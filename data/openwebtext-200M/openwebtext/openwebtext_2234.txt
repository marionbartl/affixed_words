PARIS ( AFP ) - French nuclear safety authorities said Friday that a broken pipe at a nuclear fuel plant in southeast France had caused a radioactive leak but no damage to the environment .
The latest uranium spill at the plant run by nuclear giant Areva in Romans - sur - Isere came amid much public concern over a leak at another facility last week that polluted the local water supply .
Residents in the Vaucluse region of southern France have been told not to drink water or eat fish from nearby rivers after the liquid uranium spill on July 7 at the Tricastin nuclear plant .
According to the ASN nuclear safety authority , the pipe defect at the FBFC plant at Romans - sur - Isere in the Drome region may date back several years .
" Results from initial tests show there has been no impact at all on the environment , because the quantity of uranium was very small , in the order of a few hundred grammes , " said ASN spokeswoman Evangelia Petit .
The FBFC plant produces nuclear fuel for some of France 's 58 reactors , the world 's largest network after the United States and which produces 80 percent of the nation 's electricity .
Areva late Thursday notified the nuclear authority of the leak and three inspectors were dispatched to the site in the early hours on Friday to assess the damage .
Petit said the spill did not reach the ground water and that there was no sign of contamination .
Areva president Anne Lauvergeon was later Friday due to inspect the Tricastin plant , which is run by its subsidiary Socatri .
After admitting to a safety lapse at Tricastin , Areva on Thursday replaced Socatri 's director and announced an internal audit to determine what went wrong .
French Ecology Minister Jean - Louis Borloo has announced that tests of the ground water near all nuclear reactors will be carried out to reassure residents following the Tricastin leak .
Swimming and water sports have also been forbidden as is irrigation of crops with the contaminated water .
The leak ranked as a level - one incident on the seven - point scale to rank nuclear accidents .

The tail - walking dolphins were spotted at the coast near Adelaide A wild dolphin is apparently teaching other members of her group to walk on their tails , a behaviour usually seen only after training in captivity .
The tail - walking group lives along the south Australian coast near Adelaide .
One of them spent a short time after illness in a dolphinarium 20 years ago and may have picked up the trick there .
Scientists studying the group say tail - walk tuition has not been seen before , and suggest the habit may emerge as a form of " culture " among this group .
" We can't for the life of us work out why they do it , " said Mike Bossley from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) , one of the scientists who have been monitoring the group on the Port River estuary .
" We 're doing systematic observations now to determine if there 's something that may trigger it , but so far we have n't found anything , " he told BBC News .
Rich culture
In the 1980s , Billie , one of the females in the group , spent a few weeks in a local dolphinarium recovering from malnutrition and sickness , a consequence of having been trapped in a marina lock .
It would seem that among the Port River dolphins we may have an incipient tail - walking culture
Mike Bossley
She received no training there , but may have seen others tail - walking .
Now , other females in the group have picked up the habit .
It is seen rarely in the wild , and the obvious inference is that they have learned it from Billie .
" This indicates that they do learn from each other , which is not a surprise really , but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call ' cultural ' behaviour , " said Dr Bossley .
" These are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups , such as language or dancing ; and it would seem that among the Port River dolphins we may have an incipient tail - walking culture . "
The " cultural " transmission of ideas and skills has been documented in apes , while dolphins off the coast of Western Australia are known to teach their young to use sponges as an aid when gathering food .

McCain energy speech interrupted by heckler
A heckler interrupted John McCain while he was giving a speech on energy at Missouri State University , accusing him of supporting more tax subsidies to oil companies than any other senator this year .
The heckler was heard shouting , " How can you be trusted ?
How can you stand up for the policies of the current administration ? "
The Springfield News - Leader has more details about McCain 's energy speech here .

The audit investigated the £ 100 m spent annually on staff allowances
The report mentions no names but British MEP Chris Davies , who leaked details , described it as " dynamite " .
Another UK MEP , Eluned Morgan , said the European Parliament 's Budget Control Committee had been told it did not have the authority to reveal the report .
Ms Morgan told the BBC that she was asking Parliament President Hans - Gert Poettering to publish the document .
I think this is foolhardy and stupid because all it does is fuel the fires of suspicion
Chris Davies
Liberal Democrat MEP
Moves to halt EU gravy train
She said Mr Poettering had the authority to make the report public .
Ms Morgan added that she wanted him to ensure " we can look at the conclusions , pore through it and make sure that we can put systems in place to correct the problems " .
The question of expenses was raised at a meeting between the parliament 's president and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown at Downing Street on Wednesday .
A Downing Street spokesman said Hans - Gert Poettering " agreed on the scale on the problem , and set out his proposals to tackle it .
The prime minister called for an expeditious response . "
' Embezzlement and fraud '
The EU 's anti-fraud office , Olaf , has already said it will look at the report after Mr Davies claimed that what he had seen amounted to " embezzlement and fraud on a massive scale " in the £ 100 m a year allocated to staff costs .
Mr Davies said he believed the parliamentary authorities would do everything they could to prevent the report being published .
" I think this is foolhardy and stupid because all it does is fuel the fires of suspicion .
It increases the sense amongst people across Europe that the European Parliament has something to hide , " he said .
The report selected a random 167 MEPs for checks and is said to give details of one MEP who took the full allowance but employed no - one , and another who had just one member of staff .
One Euro MP is said to have paid a member of staff a " Christmas bonus " worth 19 times the official 's monthly salary .
Mr Davies has called for the allegations to lead to the imprisonment of a number of MEPs .
Ms Morgan agreed that those people who were not complying with the rules should be prosecuted .
Syrian MP Dr. Muhammad Habash warned Israel not to attack his country in an interview with the Israeli - Arab news paper Ma'a al - Hadat published on Thursday saying Israel 's nuclear reactor might be hit in retaliation in such a situation .
Syria Against Annapolis Syria describes Annapolis as defeat for Palestinians Associated Press State - run Tishrin daily says Annapolis peace conference favored Israeli side , ended with no real promise for peace .
' Israel as Jewish State is consecration of Israeli racism , ' says lead editorial Syria describes Annapolis as defeat for Palestinians
The Syrian official said that his nation is considering its response in the case of an Israeli attack .
" The prospect that Israel might take some adventurous steps is reasonable to assume .
In the last year , the Israelis decided to carry out some risky maneuvers and they were on the losing side and even today there are those that are pushing for war — even though Israel was on the losing side , " the Syrian MP said .
" The possibility that Israel were to infringe upon Syria 's sovereignty is a possibility that exists and that we 're not ruling out , although at the same time , we are not looking to reach this stage and we do not want to escalate the situation , " he said in the interview .
Dr. Habash , one of the more prominent Syrian spokesmen in the media , was asked if Syria would be able to impede Israeli aggression .
He answered saying : " The Dimona reactor is located within range of our missiles .
Nothing will stop the fervor of the Syrian solder and the Syrian warrior in this situation . "
The Syrian MP also discussed issues related to Israeli - Syrian negotiations .
According to Dr. Habash , there are no Israeli - Syrian backchannels and Damascus only supports public negotiations in which its demands are very clear — the return of the Golan Heights as well as half a million Palestinian refugees currently residing in Syria to Israel .
" Every time the Israelis say there are secret contacts going on between Israel and Syria but it soon becomes clear that these remarks are made simply for domestic political concerns in Tel Aviv .
Syria does n't need clandestine negotiations .
We 're ready for public talks .
If this is so , why engage in clandestine negotiations ? "
" The mediation between Syria and Israel has never ended .
The Russians are aiding in the mediation as well as the Turks and UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon as well number of other countries that have mutual interests , " the Syrian MP told the interviewer .
" If half million Palestinian refugees that are currently living on Syrian land are returned to Israel or their lands in Palestine , and the Golan Heights is reinstated as Syrian , then we would be able to say thank God and enjoy the long - awaited peace , " Dr. Habash said .
In the meantime , Dr. Habash is promising that normalization with Israel will not occur as long as negotiations are not completed .
" Syria is not thinking about normalization with Israel before peace is achieved because normalization for free is assumed to be bribery . "
Wow .
It ’s out .
It ’s finally , finally out .
Sweet !
So there ’s a bug in DNS , the name - to - address mapping system at the core of most Internet services .
DNS goes bad , every website goes bad , and every email goes … somewhere .
Not where it was supposed to .
You may have heard about this — the Wall Street Journal , the BBC , and some particularly important people are reporting on what ’s been going on .
Specifically :
1 ) It ’s a bug in many platforms
2 ) It ’s the exact same bug in many platforms ( design bugs , they are a pain )
3 ) After an enormous and secret effort , we ’ve got fixes for all major platforms , all out on the same day .
4 ) This has not happened before .
Everything is genuinely under control .
I ’m pretty proud of what we accomplished here .
We got Windows .
We got Cisco IOS .
We got Nominum .
We got BIND 9 , and when we could n’t get BIND 8 , we got Yahoo , the biggest BIND 8 deployment we knew of , to publicly commit to abandoning it entirely .
It was a good day .
CERT has details up , and there ’s a full - on interview between myself and Rich Mogull up on Securosis .
For the non-geeks in the audience , you might want to tune out here , but this is my personal blog and I do have some stuff to mention to the crew .
There ’s something very important about what we accomplished here .
We .
Because there ’s absolutely no way I could have pulled this off by myself .
Paul Vixie is an institution .
Having long maintained the Internet ’s most popular DNS server , Paul simply knows everybody .
Paul was absolutely instrumental in pulling together the engineers we needed to solve this problem .
We needed Florian Weimer there , all the way from Europe .
We needed David Dagon , and Jinmei Tatuya , and Wouter Wijngaards .
We needed Microsoft , Cisco , Nominum , Neustar , and OpenDNS .
And we really needed CERT .
It was an interesting discussion , with lots of disagreement , but ever - growing consensus .
After evaluating several options , one approach was clear — and , I must admit , somewhat embarassing to Paul .
DJB was right .
All those years ago , Dan J. Bernstein was right : Source Port Randomization should be standard on every name server in production use .
There is a fantastic quote that guides a lot of the work I do : Luck is the residue of design .
Dan Bernstein is a notably lucky programmer , and that ’s no accident .
The professor lives and breathes systems engineering in a way that my hackish code aspires to one day experience .
DJB got “ lucky ” here — he ended up defending himself against an attack he almost certainly never encountered .
Such is the mark of excellent design .
Excellent design protects you against things you do n’t have any information about .
And so we are deploying this excellent design to provide no information .
To translate the fix strategy into a more familiar domain , imagine large chunks of Windows RPC went from Anonymous to Authenticated User only , or even all the way to Admin Only .
Or wait , just remember Windows XPSP2 🙂
This is a sledgehammer , by design .
It cuts off attack surface , without necessarily saying why .
Astonishingly subtle bugs can be easily hidden , or even rendered irrelevant , by a suitably blunt fix .
Of course , it remains obvious that something new is up , and that something will be found eventually .
But there ’s a lot of buggy systems out there , vulnerable not just to new bugs but bugs that have been known for years .
If all this effort ever accomplished was sweeping old and crusty BIND8 off the Internet , if we could finally fully eliminate Joe Stewart ’s ( edit : Originally Vagner Sacramento’s , thanks Joe ! )
Birthday Attacks from 2002 , if we started doing something about Amit Klein ’s Transaction ID Randomness finds ( even the deeply underrated client vulns ) from last year , and yes , if the static port assignments DJB warned us about ages ago were finally shut down — then this would still be a huge win .
There are reasons why the new issue is particularly severe , but I think reasonable people can agree that anything that could scrub even the old bugs would be a boon to the security of the Internet .
And so , I ask the open research community … assume I found nothing !
Assume this is nothing but a stunt , to finally get people to take Joe and Amit and DJB seriously , and to give network scanners a crystal clear fingerprint of what a trustable recursive server looks like .
Joe and Amit and especially DJB have done some incredible work .
I ’d look terrible at the end of it , but their bugs would finally get fixed , and stay fixed .
As for me , I dunno .
Go back to graphics 🙂 Mmmm … SIGGRAPH …
For those of you who wo n’t make that assumption , I have a request .
It is very unusual , and maybe unreasonable .
But I have to ask .
I want you to explore DNS .
I want you to try to build off the same bugs I did to figure out what could possibly go wrong .
Maybe I missed something — I want you to help me find out if I did , so we can deal with it now instead of later .
I do want all this .
But I also want my family to be able to use the Internet in peace .
I ’m not asking for forever .
I am asking about thirty days .
I ’ve done everything in my power to get the patches available , no matter the platform .
But the code does n’t ( always ) install itself .
While I ’m out there , trying to get all these bugs scrubbed — old and new — please , keep the speculation off the @public forums and IRC channels .
We ’re a curious lot , and we want to know how things break .
But the public needs at least a chance to deploy this fix , and from a blatantly selfish perspective , I ’d kind of like my thunder not to be completely stolen in Vegas 🙂
Now , if you do figure it out , and tell me privately , you ’re coming on stage with me at Defcon .
So I can at least offer that 🙂
Believe it or not , Newt Gingrich and Sean Hannity are still , even now , laughing like school children over the notion of properly - inflated tires .
A lot of Republicans have said a lot of stupid things about energy policy in recent weeks , but this may very well be the single most inane comment any of them have uttered publicly .
( Worse than a House Republican from Texas exclaiming , “ Let ’s bring up the Paris Hilton plan ” ?
Yes , even worse than that . )
Ben at TP valiantly goes to the trouble of pointing out why Gingrich ’s argument is demonstrably ridiculous — explaining why tire maintenance is a good idea , and would n’t “ enrich Big Oil ” — but I ’d just add that it ’s worth remembering just how idiotic Newt Gingrich ’s worldview can be .
About a year ago , the WaPo ’s David Broder said the former House Speaker has “ earned the label ‘ visionary . ’ ”
That ’s absurd ; Gingrich is a little more than pseudo - scholarly nut .
I ’m not just talking about his nutty behavior .
Gingrich , as Speaker , shut down the government ( twice ) and he pursued presidential impeachment over an adulterous affair ( while carrying on an affair of his own ) , which certainly sounds nutty , but I ’m talking more about his bizarre worldview .
We talked recently about some of his greatest hits , including Gingrich ’s sincere arguments such as the notion that the homeless should get laptops and that women should n’t be permitted to serve in combat roles because “ males are biologically driven to go out and hunt giraffes . ”
But poking around a bit the other day , I was also reminded of Gingrich ’s habit for blaming liberals , government , and liberal government for just about every societal ill he can identify .
* In 1994 , after Susan Smith drowned her two young sons , Newt Gingrich , just three days before the midterm elections , equated her crime with the values of the Democratic Party .
Gingrich told the AP , “ The mother killing her two children in South Carolina vividly reminds every American how sick the society is getting and how much we have to have change .
I think people want to change and the only way you get change is to vote Republican .
That ’s the message for the last three days . ”
* In 1999 , shortly after the Columbine massacre , Gingrich argued that American “ elites ” bear responsibility .
“ I want to say to the elite of this country - the elite news media , the liberal academic elite , the liberal political elite : I accuse you in Littleton …of being afraid to talk about the mess you have made , ” Gingrich said , “ and being afraid to take responsibility for things you have done , and instead foisting upon the rest of us pathetic banalities because you do n’t have the courage to look at the world you have created . ”
* Last year , after the shootings at Virginia Tech , Gingrich blamed liberals for supporting “ situation ethics , ” adding , “ Yes , I think the fact is , if you look at the amount of violence we have in games that young people play at 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 years of age , if you look at the dehumanization , if you look at the fact that we refuse to say that we are , in fact , endowed by our creator , that our rights come from God , that if you kill somebody , you ’re committing an act of evil . ”
Gingrich , explaining the VT tragedy , went on to condemn Halloween costumes and the McCain - Feingold campaign - finance law .
Broder may think this clown is a “ visionary , ” and the DC establishment may perceive him as some kind of “ big thinker , ” but I look at Gingrich and see a strange partisan hack with a PhD .
Picture exclusive :
The incredible moment a leopard attacks a crocodile
These are the incredible pictures which show the first ever leopard attack on a crocodile .
Hal Brindley snapped the amazing moment a leopard snatched a crocodile at a South African game reserve on the only occasion this behaviour has ever been documented worldwide .
Clash of the Titans :
The leopard attacks a crocodile in Kruger National Park
The American wildlife photographer was taking pictures of hippos from his car at a waterhole in Kruger National Park when a speeding shape came out of the bushes and headed for the water .
After an initial struggle , onlookers stared in disbelief as the leopard emerged dragging a thrashing crocodile up the bank .
With its ' snout pointing upwards , the crocodile snapped and attempted to fight back as the predators flipped and tumbled in a dramatic battle .
But the leopard , who had it caught by the throat , remained in control as the crocodile 's legs clawed frantically at the cat 's belly , its jaws snapping at air .

Predator vs. Predator :
The wily cat slams full force into the crocodile
Tussle :
The leopard begins dragging the crocodile away from the water
Despite being outweighed , the leopard was able to sit on top of the crocodile and suffocate it .
The big cat eventually dragged its ' prey into the grass and out of sight as park visitors are forbidden from leaving their cars .
There have been recorded cases of crocodiles killing leopards but never the other
way around as the meat a crocodile provides is not sufficient enough to justify the risk .

Defeat :
The croc hangs lifeless and limp from the leopard 's jaws
Brindley said : ' I asked many rangers in South Africa if they had ever heard of anything like this and they all said no .
' It just does n't make sense .
The meat you get out of a crocodile is just not worth the risk it takes a predator to acquire .
' The whole scene happened in the course of about 5 minutes .
Then the leopard was gone .
He added : ' I drove away , elated in disbelief .
It may have been the most amazing thing I 've ever seen . '

Victory :
The leopard gains control and gets on top of it , suffocating it
Dinner 's ready :
The big cat drags its prey off into the bush
The scene was reminiscent of the famous Battle at Kruger amateur wildlife video that depicted a confrontation between a herd of Cape Buffalo , a small pride of lions , and a pair of crocodiles .
The video was shot in September , 2004 at a watering hole in Kruger National Park , South Africa , by videographer David Budzinski and photographer Jason Schlosberg .
After being posted on YouTube in 2007 , Battle at Kruger became a viral video sensation and was widely praised for its dramatic depiction of wildlife on the African savannah .
It became one of YouTube 's most popular videos , with more than 31 million views .

With our castor Castor now out for all to enjoy , and the Twitterverse delighted with the new minimal desktop and smooth snap integration , it ’s time to turn our attention to the road ahead to 20.04 LTS , and I ’m delighted to say that we ’ll kick off that journey with the Cosmic Cuttlefish , soon to be known as Ubuntu 18.10 .
Each of us has our own ideas of how the free stack will evolve in the next two years .
And the great thing about Ubuntu is that it does n’t reflect just one set of priorities , it ’s an aggregation of all the things our community cares about .
Nevertheless I thought I ’d take the opportunity early in this LTS cycle to talk a little about the thing I ’m starting to care more about than any one feature , and that ’s security .
If I had one big thing that I could feel great about doing , systematically , for everyone who uses Ubuntu , it would be improving their confidence in the security of their systems and their data .
It ’s one of the very few truly unifying themes that crosses every use case .
It ’s extraordinary how diverse the uses are to which the world puts Ubuntu these days , from the heart of the mainframe operation in a major financial firm , to the raspberry pi duck - taped to the back of a prototype something in the middle of nowhere , from desktops to clouds to connected things , we are the platform for ambitions great and small .
We are stewards of a shared platform , and one of the ways we respond to that diversity is by opening up to let people push forward their ideas , making sure only that they are excellent to each other in the pushing .
But security is the one thing that every community wants – and it ’s something that , on reflection , we can raise the bar even higher on .
So without further ado : thank you to everyone who helped bring about Bionic , and may you all enjoy working towards your own goals both in and out of Ubuntu in the next two years .
Gilding the lily is nothing new to politics .
From the 1840s when William Henry Harrison claimed to have been born in a log cabin ( it was actually a Virginia plantation ) to Ronald Reagan 's reminiscing about flying over Germany in World War II ( he did , but only in a movie ) , politicians have taken perfectly good stories and embellished them .
This campaign is no exception .
During the primaries , Hillary Rodham Clinton had to back away from claims she " ducked sniper fire " in Bosnia in 1996 .
Mitt Romney found himself having to explain how he " saw my father march with Martin Luther King , " when it turned out his father never marched with the Rev. Mr. King .
The latest embellishments come from the McCain camp .
Cindy McCain has repeatedly referred to herself as an " only child . "
This week came news that she actually has two half sisters , although apparently she had very little contact with them .
The McCain campaign had also put out the story that Mother Teresa " convinced " Cindy to bring home two orphans from Bangladesh in 1991 .
Mrs. McCain , it turns out , never met Mother Teresa on that trip .
( Once contacted by the Monitor , the campaign revised the story on its website . )
Such exaggerations may simply be the product of a faulty memory or a desire to be " better " than one is in a political culture that requires larger - than - life idols .
But with the advent of the fact - checking obsessed blogosphere – and a media racing to keep up – such self - aggrandizement does n't last as long as it once did .
" It 's all about myth - making , " says Darrell West , the director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" Politicians love to turn their stories into great epics , and sometimes they have to embellish to smooth out the story line . "
" But now there are too many professional and amateur fact - checkers , " he says .
" And there are hundreds if not thousands of bloggers who have detailed knowledge on specialized information , so you really can't get away with stretching the truth anymore . "
The story about Mother Teresa " convincing " Mrs. McCain to bring home two children from an orphanage in Bangladesh has been retold many times .
Initially , the " About Cindy McCain " page on the McCain campaign website read : " Mother Teresa convinced Cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the United States .
One of those babies is now their adopted daughter , 16 - year - old Bridget McCain . "
The media picked up the theme .
A story earlier this year on ABC's " Good Morning America " stated , " With Mother Teresa 's encouragement she brought her fourth child , Bridget , home . "
An April 2008 Wall Street Journal profile states that Mother Teresa " implored " Cindy to bring the girls to the United States .
Other articles say Cindy did it " at the behest " of Mother Teresa .
But a source who was with McCain on that 1991 trip , and who asked that his name not be used because of prior legal dealings with the McCain family , says that Mother Teresa was not at the orphanage when Cindy decided to bring the two girls home .
A 1991 article in the Arizona Star at the time of the adoption only mentions that the children were from an orphanage that was started by Mother Teresa .
It does not mention a meeting with Mother Teresa or her asking McCain to bring the girls to the US .
According to biographies of Mother Teresa , in 1991 she was in Mexico where she developed medical problems .
From there , she went to a hospital in La Jolla , Calif .
A McCain source acknowledged that Cindy McCain did not meet Mother Teresa during the 1991 trip to Bangladesh but said McCain did meet her later on , although the source could not say when or where .
The campaign has since reworded the reference to the adoption on its website .
In another instance , McCain told the Chicago Tribune earlier this year that on one of her medical missions to Vietnam she was in " the very hospital – and in the very room – where her husband was brought after being shot down and then beaten by a mob during the war . "
A 1992 Washington Times story recounts a different version : " Mrs. McCain asked to see the operating room and her husband 's cell , but was turned down .
She took the rejection philosophically .
' It 's 27 years later .
Let 's go on , ' Mrs. McCain said . "
The McCain campaign again declined to comment on the discrepancy .
On background , a source close to Mrs. McCain confirmed that she was denied entry .
But , the source added : " At some point thereafter , she toured the hospital and did coincidentally end up in the senator 's room . "
" Everybody tells white lies , but in the political world it 's a little different because it raises the question that if people lie about little things , are they also going to lie about big stuff that really matters ? " says Mr. West .
Misremembering and stretching the truth is without doubt a bipartisan phenomenon .
Twenty years ago , Sen. Joe Biden ( D ) of Delaware 's presidential campaign faltered when it was learned that he had lifted passages from a speech by then - British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock and that he'd also said he'd done better in law school than he actually had .
Earlier this year , Barack Obama 's campaign admitted that he overstated his father 's connection to the Kennedy family .
In speeches , Obama had said the Kennedy family provided funding for the 1959 airlift that brought his father from Kenya to the United States for an education .
But according to research done by The Washington Post , the Kennedy clan did n't contribute to the airlift efforts until 1960 , a year after his father was already studying in Hawaii .
When The Washington Post brought the discrepancy to the attention of the Obama campaign it readily acknowledged there was a mistake .
" You always have to look for a pattern , " says political analyst Larry Sabato , at the University of Virginia .
" If it happens once , you can say it 's a memory problem , but if there 's a pattern there , there 's a problem . "
[ Editor 's note : the original version did not specify when Mrs. McCain had not met Mother Teresa ]

NEW YORK --
The news that the Rev. Jesse Jackson took a crude swipe at Sen.
Barack Obama this week put renewed scrutiny on the relationship between the veteran civil rights activist and Democratic presidential contender .
But Jackson ’s vulgar criticism of Obama came close to going unreported .
Jackson made the comments to a guest before an interview on Sunday ’s “ Fox & Friends , ” whispering that Obama was “ talking down to black people ” and that Jackson wanted to “ cut his nuts off . ”
The comments went unnoticed in the control room , Bill Shine , Fox News ’ senior vice president for programming , said Thursday .
The scathing remarks first came to the attention of an employee working the overnight shift Sunday , who transcribed the tape as part of training for the network ’s ongoing digital conversion .
Otherwise , “ it potentially would have not been discovered , ” Shine said .
On Tuesday , a staff member in the digital department e-mailed Jackson ’s comments to a producer for “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” who was vacationing in France .
The producer alerted the show ’s staff back in New York later that day .
News executives immediately realized the import of the footage .
“ I looked at it and thought , ‘ This is going to be news , ’ ” Shine said .
But the cable network did not put the material on the air right away .
“ We cautiously and patiently went forward with the story , ” he said , adding that producers reached out to Jackson and Obama to let them know about the material .
Shine said the civil rights leader did not ask Fox News to hold back the tape .
But before the network even aired his comments , Jackson went on CNN Wednesday afternoon to preemptively apologize .
Shortly afterward , Fox News teased the news of Jackson ’s remarks on “ Special Report With Brit Hume . ”
The network did n’t air the more vulgar part of Jackson ’s comments for two more hours , when the clip ran on the top-rated show hosted by Bill O’Reilly .
“ It was Bill ’s staff who had been working on it , and we felt it would be appropriate to put it there , ” Shine said .
O’Reilly told viewers that the network had decided to air only portions of what Jackson had said , saying there was “ more damaging ” material .
Shine declined to comment on what else Jackson said , adding that news executives were in discussions about whether to air more of the tape .

The U.S. Army is looking to go green — not khaki — environmentally green .
At Fort Carson , a new computerized system goes into operation this week to track carbon - dioxide emissions at the base south of Colorado Springs .
The gas — which can trap the sun ’s heat in the atmosphere and has been linked to global climate change — is created by burning fossil fuels .
The Internet - based system designed by Enviance Inc. will track everything on the base from boiler smokestacks to emissions from battle tanks .
“ The goal here is for the Army to become more environmentally and energy efficient , ” said Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army Tad Davis .
Where possible , the base will try to reduce emissions and cut energy consumption , Davis said .
This process is frequently referred to as reducing the “ carbon footprint , ” but in Fort Carson ’s case , Davis is calling it the “ carbon bootprint . ”
“ By tracking these emissions , we will be able to see if we can make reductions by changing policy or new technology , ” Davis said .
Could there be hybrid battle tanks in the offing ?
“ While we are always looking for fuel - efficient technologies , ” Davis said , “ I do n’t think we ’ll be seeing hybrid tanks . ”
Enviance , based in Carlsbad , Calif. , developed its Web - based system to help companies track wastes and emissions to comply with state and federal environmental rules , said Lawrence Goldenhersh , the company ’s chief executive .
Now the system is being expanded to cover greenhouse gases .
“ This is the future , ” Goldenhersh said .
“ As we face controls on greenhouse gases , the first thing we need to know is what we are emitting . ”
American Electric Power Co. , the nation ’s biggest generator of electricity from coal , is using the Enviance system to track carbon - dioxide emissions at its 42 coal - fired power plants , Goldenhersh said .
The Enviance software also is being used in Denver ’s “ Driving Change ” pilot program , which will monitor greenhouse - gas emissions from area drivers .
Davis said the Enviance system is one of several being tested at military installations , including Fort Benning in Georgia and the Anniston Army Depot in Alabama .

In February this year there appeared in Physics World an article entitled Constant Failure by Robert P Crease of Stony Brook University , in which he showed in how many formulae of physics and mathematics 2 π turns up , rather than π .
This article struck a chord with me , since even after many years I remember the feeling of " cognitive dissonance " when being taught that the formula was 2 πR rather than πD .
I felt it a bit much , though , suggesting that Archimedes might have been mistaken in choosing to calculate the ratio of circumference to diameter rather than to radius .
In those days , the fundamental dichotomy seems to have been between the geometers who thought of circumference , diameter and their ratio , and the astronomers who used the radius in their calculation of chord tables .
Hipparchus used a radius of 3438 which is the nearest integer to the number of minutes in 1 radian , but Ptolemy preferred 3600 as this is easier to calculate within the sexagesimal system .
The work of these astronomers , further developed by Hindu and Arabic mathematicians , gives us our trigonometry of today .
In particular , Aryabhata published in 499 A.D. the Aryabhatiya in which he invented the sine function ( radius ! ) as more convenient than the chord , but nevertheless computed the most accurate value of π ( diameter ! ) known in ancient times .
However al - Kashi , who was very much an astronomer and trigonometer , set a new record in precision in his Treatise on the Circumference in July 1424 , a work in which he calculated 2 π to nine sexagesimal places and translated this into sixteen decimal places .
The Greek geometers did not think of their ratio as a number .
To them , number , magnitude and ratio were three distinct concepts .
Then who first did ?
As it might say at the beginning of a tale from The Thousand and One Nights , " there were three brothers from Baghdad " , namely the Banu Musa in the 9th Century , who are first recorded as having described this ratio as a number .
The first person to use π to represent the ratio of the circumference to the diameter ( 3.14159 ... ) was the Welshman William Jones in 1706 .
But the radius fought back , with the word ' radian ' first appeared in print in 1873 , in examination questions set by James Thomson ( brother of Lord Kelvin ) at Queen 's College , Belfast .
He used the term as early as 1871 , while in 1869 Thomas Muir , then of St. Andrew 's University in Scotland , hesitated between ' rad ' , ' radial ' and ' radian ' , adopting ' radian ' after consultation with James Thomson .
( A Welshman , an Irishman , and a Scotsman – is it a Celtic conspiracy ? )
Even the difference between the two versions of Planck 's constant ℎ and ℏ ( aka the Dirac constant ) depends on whether one is thinking physically in terms of frequency ν or mathematically in terms of angular velocity ω.
Physics is not Applied Mathematics !

As part of our special issue on music , Daniel Levitin has written The Music Illusion , which looks at auditory illusions and how they can help us understand the workings of the human brain .
Here we have compiled five of the most striking auditory illusions discovered so far .
We had a big pool to choose from , from the mysterious quintina ( fifth voice ) heard in some types of throat - singing , to the saxophone break that is n’t on Lady Madonna ( it ’s actually the Beatles singing into their cupped hands – not to be confused with the actual sax solo ) and the soaring guitar sound of Pink Floyd ’s Dave Gilmour .
Listen to our top 5 below , and read our explanations of the effects involved .

1 Barber ’s shop illusion ( Listen with headphones )
This is a demonstration of the stereo effect .
Listening to it , you feel as though you are in a barber ’s chair , with the barber moving around you , clipping away at your hair .
As the barber “ moves ” to your right , the volume increases slightly in the right channel and decreases in the left .
Similarly , increases in the volume of sound from the clippers give the impression that he is bringing them closer and closer to each ear .
The illusion demonstrates our ability to locate sounds in space ; by comparing the inputs to the two ears , we can work out where a sound is coming from .
2 Phantom words ( Listen through stereo separated loudspeakers , best placed some distance apart )
This illusion was first demonstrated by Diana Deutsch at the University of California , San Diego .
Building on the stereo effect described above , the recording features overlapping sequences of repeating words or phrases , located in different regions of stereo space .
As you listen to it , you ’ll start to pick out specific phrases .
However , none of the phrases are really there .
Your brain is constructing them , in a bid to make sense of a meaningless noise .
Indeed , you may find that the phrases you hear are related to what ’s on your mind – for example , people who are dieting often hear phrases associated with food .
3 Temporal induction of speech
Much of human perception is the result of the brain filling in gaps in the data from our senses .
This means that if a part of an audio recording is missing , our brains will often work out what should have been there .
In this recording by Richard Warren from the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee , a spoken sentence is interrupted by a cough .
One of the phonemes has actually been completely removed by the cough .
But not only do most people hear the complete sentence , they generally find it very difficult to work out which phoneme has been deleted .
If the phoneme is replaced by a period of silence , rather than a cough , the deletion is very obvious .
The scale illusion is an example of our brains grouping similar notes together
4 Scale illusion ( Listen through stereo headphones , or stereo separated loudspeakers , best placed some distance apart )
Another effect first demonstrated by Diana Deutsch , this is an example of our brains “ grouping ” similar notes together .
Two major scales are played : one ascending , one descending .
However , the notes alternate from ear to ear – for instance , the right ear hears the first note of one scale , and then the second note of the other ( see diagram , top right ) .
There are several ways in which people perceive these sounds , but the most common is to group the high and low notes together .
Rather than hearing the two scales , people hear a descending and re-ascending melody in one ear , and an ascending and descending melody in the other .
In other words , the brain reassigns some of the notes to a different ear in order to make a coherent melody .
Right - handed people tend to hear the high melody in the right ear , and the low one in the left , while left - handers show a more diverse response .
5 Phantom melodies
Some pieces of music consist of high - speed arpeggios or other repeating patterns , which change only subtly .
If they ’re played fast enough , the brain picks up on the occasional notes that change , and links them together to form a melody .
The melody disappears if the piece is played slowly .
Compare these recordings of Christian Sinding ’s Frühlingsrauschen ( “ Rustle of Spring ” ) .
At the higher speed , the changing notes linger in your perception long enough to be linked into a melody , but at the lower speeds they ’re too widely separated .

Frühlingsrauschen , one - quarter speed
Tim Wu's new NYT op - ed , " OPEC 2.0 , " explores the growing carteliztion of bandwidth and its consequences for America , where we already spend nearly as much on bandwidth as we do on heating oil .
Tim 's got a newish book out about this stuff called Who Controls the Internet ?.
I 've only browsed it so far ( way behind on my reading ) , but it looks like a classic to me .
Like energy , bandwidth is an essential economic input .
You can't run an engine without gas , or a cellphone without bandwidth .
Both are also resources controlled by a tight group of producers , whether oil companies and Middle Eastern nations or communications companies like AT&T , Comcast and Vodafone .
That 's why , as with energy , we need to develop alternative sources of bandwidth .
Wired connections to the home – cable and telephone lines – are the major way that Americans move information .
In the United States and in most of the world , a monopoly or duopoly controls the pipes that supply homes with information .
These companies , primarily phone and cable companies , have a natural interest in controlling supply to maintain price levels and extract maximum profit from their investments – similar to how OPEC sets production quotas to guarantee high prices .
But just as with oil , there are alternatives .
Amsterdam and some cities in Utah have deployed their own fiber to carry bandwidth as a public utility .
A future possibility is to buy your own fiber , the way you might buy a solar panel for your home .
Honked off by Los Angeles pump prices ?
Cheer up .
You could be commuting in Oslo , where gasoline costs $ 9.85 a gallon and filling up a Mini Cooper would set you back $ 130 .
That ’s the priciest petrol on a list of world gas prices released Wednesday by Associates for International Research Inc. , a Massachusetts relocation consulting firm that tracks the cost of living in dozens of countries .
In fact , at just over four bucks a gallon on average , U.S. gas is still cheap compared with much of the world .
“ It ’s small consolation , I know , ” said Michael Shore , a senior manager at the consulting firm .
But “ the prices that [ Americans ] are paying now , Europeans have been paying for a long time . ”
And it ’s not just Europe .
People all over the developing world are shelling out more for gas than Americans -- who are considerably wealthier .
That includes drivers in the East African nation of Eritrea ( $ 9.46 a gallon ) , Kenya ( $ 5.94 ) , Chile ( $ 5.18 ) , Nicaragua ( $ 5.07 ) , India ( $ 4.94 ) and El Salvador ( $ 4.70 ) .
In a more extensive study completed by the firm in March , consumers in nearly three - quarters of about 150 nations surveyed paid more for fuel than Americans did .
There are some motorists who pay considerably less than American drivers .
The world ’s lowest - priced gasoline can be found in oil - rich Venezuela , where , at 12 cents a gallon , you can fill a Hummer for less than the price of a Big Mac .
So why the big price differences around the world ?
Experts say retail gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors , including the cost of refining , distribution and marketing .
But the biggest single variable is government policy :
Some countries tax gasoline heavily ; others subsidize it to make it cheap .
Many countries choose the former .
In the U.S. , state and local taxes account for about 19 % of the price of the average gallon of gas , according to the Energy Information Administration .
In England , where London drivers are paying nearly $ 9 a gallon , taxes account for 81.5 % of the pump price .
European countries have long relied on hefty fuel levies to fund road work and social programs and to encourage conservation .
The same is true for some Asian nations including South Korea ( $ 7.33 a gallon ) and Japan ( $ 6.30 ) -- both of which import all of their crude .
“ When you do n’t produce a drop of oil . . . the focus is on promoting efficiency , ” said Sung Won Sohn , economist at the Smith School of Business at Cal State Channel Islands .
The philosophy is different in some oil - rich countries that subsidize fuel as a way to share the wealth and keep citizens happy .
Drivers pay less than 50 cents a gallon when they fill up in Saudi Arabia and Iran .
Gas is cheaper than milk in Venezuela , which spends an estimated $ 11 billion subsidizing gasoline .
But whether it is individuals or governments picking up the tab , the fallout from exploding crude prices is being felt around the globe .
Some consumers in Europe are screaming at legislators to lower fuel taxes .
Truckers in Britain have staged three protests this year over the soaring cost of diesel , which is nearing $ 10 a gallon .
Fishermen in France , Spain , Italy , Portugal and Belgium have staged similar angry demonstrations .
Many Californians may go a few miles out of their way to find the cheapest fill - up , but Dutch trucker Patrick Leenders heads to another country .
Diesel in his hometown of Montfort is around $ 9.24 a gallon .
His route delivering industrial materials often takes him south out of the Netherlands .
So he tries to keep enough fuel in the tank to last until he reaches Luxembourg , 155 miles away , where diesel is a relative bargain at $ 7.57 a gallon .
The 39 - year - old is a salaried driver , so high fuel costs are his boss ’ headache .
But Leenders said many of the independent truckers he knows are in big trouble .
“ A lot of them tell me they ’ll be bankrupt by the end of the year , ” he said .
The pain is especially cruel in the developing world , where people like Gorette Odaga -- a Kenyan woman who has never owned a car and probably never will -- still are getting slammed by rising fuel costs .
A 32 - year - old beautician in Nairobi , Odaga has been the sole breadwinner for her three children since her husband died in 2003 .
Daily round - trip bus fare for the kids to get to school has quintupled over the last year to $ 1.54 -- an impossible increase on top of rising costs for food and cooking fuel .
For a time , Odaga woke the children before dawn to begin the 4.3 - mile walk in the dark .
But they were exhausted by the time they arrived at school -- particularly 5 - year - old Sandra .
Gangs roam the road and Odaga feared for their safety .
So she transferred the children to a school closer to home -- even though it ’s lower - performing .
“ At least they are secure , ” she said .
“ And I can save the [ bus fare ] to buy food . ”
It ’s much the same in Mogadishu , Somalia , where diesel fuel now tops $ 5 a gallon , a small fortune in that impoverished country .
Jitney drivers sometimes charge one price in the morning and a higher price in the afternoon to cover the climbing cost of their fill - ups .
Ibrahim Mohamed now walks the five - mile round trip to his tailor shop .
He said his earnings could n’t keep pace with rising fares , so “ I will use my legs . ”
Consumers have it somewhat easier in countries where fuel is heavily subsidized .
But the international price of crude has ballooned so fast that some governments are paring back this costly assistance .
China recently hiked retail gas prices by 16 % and diesel by 18 % .
Gasoline now costs $ 3.40 in Beijing , according to Associates for International Research .
That ’s a bargain by California standards .
But it ’s hurting Wen Yipeng ’s livelihood .
A salesman at a Shanghai auto dealership that sells luxury cars , he said even his rich customers are holding on to their wallets , thanks to a sliding stock market and rising fuel prices .
He said the dealership last year sold seven to nine Porsche Cayenne SUVs every month .
Since gas prices went up June 20 , he has n’t sold one .
Fuel - efficient “ Japanese cars sell much better , ” he said .
In Mexico , it ’s just the opposite .
Consumers there are snapping up used SUVs and full - size trucks from the United States .
Gas costs about $ 2.62 a gallon in most of the country , making these gas guzzlers affordable to many Mexican drivers .
But the trend is worrying the treasury .
Fuel consumption is soaring .
Mexico will spend around $ 20 billion on gasoline and diesel subsidies this year -- about six times what it spends on defense .
Some public officials have declared the subsidies unsustainable .
It ’s even worse in Trinidad and Tobago , where a gallon of gas costs about $ 1.82 .
The Caribbean country spent about $ 2 billion last year on motor fuel subsidies -- equivalent to 10 % of its gross domestic product .
Car sales have exploded .
Traffic is dismal in the capital , Port of Spain .
Local energy economist Gregory McGuire has recommended capping the subsidy , but he said the government has resisted .
“ If the government were to increase gas prices tomorrow morning , they would have a riot on their hands , ” he said .
“ Everybody wants a car . ”

Apparently while we have been slaving away etching dogs in business suits into massive granite columns , people started putting cartoons on the Internet — with the intention of making my livelihood completely obsolete .
Thanks .
However , one of the best outcomes of this Internet blitz is the hilarious Web comic Achewood , by Chris Onstad .
I suggest you start at the beginning , read all the way to the present , then read each characters ’ blog , then read the advice column , and then repeat .
I sat down with Onstad and asked him the following questions , to which he gave the following responses :
CARTOON LOUNGE : You were Time magazine ’s graphic novel of the year in 2007 .
How does it feel to be on top of the world ?
Chris Onstad :
When you are on top of the world , at first you wake up not knowing that .
Then you go to your computer , and there is an e-mail from someone with a time .com e-mail suffix , and the e-mail wants to become a phone call .
It is uncommon for an e-mail to ask to become a phone call , so you agree , and then the call happens pretty quickly after that .
It ’s a girl named Julie from Thanking & Congratulations , and she does what you might expect .
She makes you feel as though you are sitting Indian - style on top of the world , much like the Little Prince , and in my case I had the distinct feeling that I could have taken her to a trendy vodka bar in Alphabet City and talked playfully and open - endedly about bras for a while .
Maybe that ’s what they wanted me to feel .
Maybe I was played to a T .
But , are you happy ?
Onstad : No .
That is not a thing I reserve for books or communications or interior progress or myself .
Happy is , as defined by my men ’s therapist , a mountain bike ride to a place near Mount Santa Cruz , and it takes place around 4:15 in the morning , and when we get to the top he has this ultra - light tripod and he takes a picture of our group .
It ’s scheduled for next weekend .
What are some of your favorite funny things to watch or read ?
Onstad : On YouTube , there are videos of Gordon Ramsay bugging people and criticizing them and their restaurants .
I like the way he yells at people ; he seems like he’d be a lot of fun to yell at people with .
You ’d really just be a third wheel , but here and there I bet he ’d take a breather and you could kick them while they were down .
I also like those old Steamboat Willie - type animations they show at the Main Street USA cinema at Disneyland .
So , so scary .
Awful , in a way , if you can get yourself there mentally , and imagine all the tragedies that have befallen literally everyone involved in their production all those years ago .
When you are talking to strangers , do you refer to cartooning as your “ craft ” ?
Onstad :
It is a permanent problem , describing what you do when you do an obscure comic .
I tell people I ’m a cartoonist , and if they press me to say a cartoon out loud , I know I am wasting my time .
It ’s like suggesting that a young fireman dance around with his wonderful butt showing — it ’s his job to offer , not yours to ask .
There are so many great characters in “ Achewood . ”
Which is your favorite to write for ?
Which is your favorite to draw ?
Onstad : I like the main two guys , Ray and Roast Beef .
In my mind , they are shlemiel and shlemazel .
I am sorry if I spelled that wrong .
I was not brought up in the Jewish culture and I can only appreciate it from a distance , much like a flower on a rock that is far out to sea , watching a boat full of Jews sail past .
Do they wave ?
( Yes . )
Chris , I get invited to a lot of parties where I ’m not necessarily the guest of honor , but I ’m a guest that everyone feels honored to have there , and whom everyone would like to honor in some way .
Is this a shared experience ?
Onstad : I know what you mean .
A lot of times , like when I ’m just in line to pay a cashier for something , I ’ll swell out my chest , because I am more than likely the most important person in that line .
I have a good chest — although it has some fat on it , no joke — and I often wear a fairly tight t- shirt over a snug thermal long - sleeve , so I know that people notice .
I have to pay a lot of taxes living in New York City .
What about you , are you a taxes guy ?
Onstad : I pay almost all the major taxes , and I ’m also part of a local program in my town where we pay experimental taxes to see if we get mad .
There ’s a tax on those who throw away too much homemade food ( they ’re like , “ Just cook better , and then you ’ll eat more of it ” ) , and there is also a tax on guys who smoke regular tobacco from a bong in public solely to be provocative .
Comic -con .
Did you go to that ?
What ’s it like ?
I ’m thinking of doing some interviews there .
Onstad : No , and yes .
Stormtroopers ?
I think that ’s how it plays out .
You know what I ’d like to see at Comic - con ?
Howard Stern shaking hands with Peter Mayhew , who played Chewbacca .
Peter Mayhew is 7 ’ 1 ” and Howard Stern is kind of his Mini - Me , even though Stern is 6 ’ 5 ” .
Maybe up on a modest stage , for half - hour periods , with five minutes off for autographs .
Would you ever do an Achewood book on tape ?
If so , who would do the voices ?
Your answer can be a lie .
Onstad : I think the main thing is that Ray would be voiced by over 700 members of The Arcade Fire speaking in unison , and Roast Beef would be voiced by the door latch being locked for the night at a McDonald ’s restaurant .
The latch closure can be mixed together at different pitches to create a complex tonality not unlike utterances .
What is your ideal day ?
Onstad :
Wake up , hot merguez sausages on a plate , Madeleine Peyroux posters on sale , turn off the radio , it was all a dream .
Wake up .
Ideal night ?
Onstad : Chris Isaak driving a fairly heavy American car on a large beach , and carving it artfully around in large swoops .
Not trying to get anything done , just enjoying the physics of the event .
I ’m watching from a nearby home .
Chris , I am swamped .
I have nearly two posts to write a week , on top of a sandwich shop I ’m trying to start out of my apartment .
( Readers , call me if you are interested in any sandwiches . )
Can you write some more stuff for us that I would post as if I had done any work ?
Onstad :
This would be a burden , and an imposition , although I like what you are saying about sandwiches and new companies .
I often think that all it takes to start a good sandwich company is a place that is convenient to people , and not to use Scotch tape to close the paper around the sandwiches , because that seems out of place , though I have seen it done .
Wow .
thinking about good sandwiches is making me want to write posts .
What kind of posts do you need ?
How about I chronicle the growth of your apartment sandwich company ?
We could start there , but move to a Quizno ’s if a particular week was kind of uneventful .
Or , I could do a thing where I ate at Quizno ’s , three meals a day , for a day .
Kind of like a “ Super Size Me ” social commentary thing .
I could go out with friends afterwards and we could get some pitchers .
We could call it The UC Santa Barbara Project .
We ’re sort of new to the Internet around here .
What can we learn from you ?
How many pixels do you usually use ?
Onstad : I use pixels the way doctors used John Wayne ’s stomach : they cut it out because of smoking cancer and he had to drink whiskey through a tube in his head ( in other words , pretty intensely ) .
Did you know that John Wayne ’s childhood home became an out - of - business museum ?
Are you working on anything besides the “ Achewood ” comic strip , books , merchandise , and blogs ?
Onstad : I re-seeded my back lawn , and I watch it vigilantly .
Little eucalyptus seeds are falling all over it .
They ’re shaped like that space capsule Gus Grissom messed up in “ The Right Stuff . ”
The one he sank to the bottom of the ocean with his stupid tchotchkes .
Kind of conical .
Do you need any money ?
Onstad :
No , keep it where you are .
Money is like freedom in a leotard — it ’s the leotard that makes it matter , and without , it ’s anarchy .
People selling rap CDs in a doorway , next to people selling rap cassettes in a doorway .
Dogs barking at rich dogs , who try to do the right thing and look away .
You can call it a free - market economy , but I call it the shame of a nation .
Fill up a leotard with money — Moira Kelly comes to mind — and we ’re back on track , and that ’s something I ’d be interested in .
Share any thoughts you have about anything in The New Yorker .
Not necessarily cartoon - related .
Onstad : I have n’t seen much Malcolm Gladwell lately , and I wonder if that ’s because he ’s busy running more social experiments centered around his haircut .
Also , I thought it was lame that Anthony Lane acted like he did n’t care about the Rolling Stones .
That is ridiculous , not to care about that band in a really heavy way .
Is he ( originally ) from space ?
Chris , I ’m bushed .
Can you just finish this interview yourself ?
MIAMI --
The beer is cold .
The bite - size crab cakes are delicious .
Maria Sharapova -- the genuine article , not her digital doppelganger -- looks lovely in her pink - striped cardigan .
I 'm sitting in the air - conditioned ballroom of a Four Seasons hotel , being feted with drinks and hors d'oeuvres , checking out an early version of 2 K Sports ' new tennis video game , Top Spin 3 .
I 'm being paid for this .
And Sharapova just walked in , which means I 'm also being paid to smile and nod , and pretend to take notes as the leggy heir to Anna Kournikova 's tennis - hottie legacy smiles , nods and pretends to be an Xbox aficionado , even though she later shows far greater enthusiasm for my wife 's shoes .
( Remember : Sharapova gets paid to be here , too . )
All in all , not a bad workday .
Nothing to complain about .
Except for one little thing .
Serving .
Serving in the game is all wrong .
Not because it 's broken or clumsy , or consists of flaming balls that explode on impact , but rather because it 's feeble .
Underpowered .
And it 's driving me nuts .
In real - world tennis -- a sport I adore and covered for years -- being on serve is an enormous advantage .
Servers dictate points ; entire matches turn on a few breaks ; a mad bomber like Goran Ivanisevic can blast his way to a Wimbledon title .
But in Top Spin 3 ?
Aces are few and far between .
Returning is too easy .
The rest of the game is a huge step forward for the genre -- master the nuanced swing controls , and you 'll never go back to Virtual Tennis -- but virtual Roger Federer feels more like pixilated Martina Hingis .
Toss strike doink !
Of course , Federer 's flutterballs only make Top Spin 3 akin to every other tennis title ever produced .
Not to mention Pong .
Yet according to 2 K product manager Ryan Hunt , the game was programmed this way on purpose , to better make it more fun .
" We want to make the game accessible , so you can pick it up and get into some great points , " he says .
" I do n't know how many gamers want to watch aces fly past them , or need the game to be so realistic that it's as frustrating as actually facing [ Andy ] Roddick . "
Hunt smiles .
" Well , I guess that would be fun if you were playing as him . "
Like realistic - looking snow and blatant - CPU - comeback cheating , tennis serves are one of those things sports games just can't seem to get right .
The others ?

GRASS PAINS
Talk about a bad lie :
The combo of hardware limitations and the math involved give developers two choices -- grass that looks good from a distance but smeary up close ( Virtua Tennis 3 ) , or vice versa ( the old NFL 2 K series ) .
And as for blades you can actually distinguish ?
" Back on the Xbox , we tried a grass texture with big blades , so you could see them , " says one football game developer .
" As soon as the camera moved , it looked like the whole screen was vibrating . "

It 's a big texture , a whole field .
You have so many other art assets , and grass is the last thing anyone thinks about .
So when you stick it in at the end , it 's like , ' Whoops , not enough memory . ' "
Translation : Enjoy Brett Favre 's painstakingly modeled digital stubble .
That 's as close as you 'll get to a decent - looking lawn .

Short .
Green .
Composed of little blades .
Sometimes painted .
On the whole , not that complicated .
From football to baseball , soccer to tennis , virtual grass takes up most of the screen most of the time .
So why does it look like spray - painted concrete ( All - Pro Football 2K8 ) ?
A soggy watercolor canvas ( NCAA Football 08 , Wii Sports Golf ) ?
Steam - cleaned carpet ( Madden 08 ) ?
In Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 , the rough brings to mind brown straw planted in cow manure .
High - definition visuals make the pores on Woods ' nose come alive .
Should n't they make the playing field look equally believable ?
Dumb Football Lead Blockers
Dear developers , all we ask is this :
When our cement - headed fullbacks and beer - bellied pulling linemen cross the line of scrimmage , please direct them to block the oncoming linebackers directly in front of them as opposed to the defensive backs 15 yards downfield .
Merci .
Dumber Football Defensive Backs
Dear developers , all we ask is this :
When our CPU - controlled defensive backs are in position to make plays on the ball , please direct them to break up passes or immediately tackle receivers , as opposed to performing crazy , spinning , Matrix - like animations that turn 25 - yard post - corner routes into 60 - yard touchdown strikes .
Merci .
B - BALL DEFENSE : IN YOUR FACE
It 's not them .
It 's us .
" Here 's the problem , " says a basketball game developer .
" If I 'm Steve Nash and you 're KG and you post me up , in reality , when KG turns , Nash can't do anything but watch .
But in a game , if the user hits the jump button , he thinks that jump button should do something .
No matter what .
And we have to account for that . "
In other words ?
Keep stabbing that block button !
Why do basketball gamers spend 80 percent of their defensive time repeatedly jabbing the steal button ?
Because they want to get back on offense , home to all the cool stuff -- crazy crossovers , slick passes , sweet mo -capped dunks .
Meanwhile , defense is dull .
Clunky .
Has n't improved much since Lakers vs. Celtics .
Blocking and stealing are button - mashing crap shoots .
Stoppers like Bruce Bowen feel the same as matadors like Gilbert Arenas .
Zones never work properly .
( Attention , CPU teammates :
Why are you sagging off Dirk Nowitzki but shadowing Ben Wallace five feet beyond the arc ? )
All the little nuances that make real - life defense fun and involved -- such as forcing dribblers to their off hand -- are MIA .
At this point , so is our patience .
CPU Cheating
Three things you 'll never see outside of video games :
• A no -name defensive tackle chasing down Barry Sanders on a breakaway run .
• A middle linebacker leaping five feet in the air to bat down a pass he never even saw coming because his back was turned the entire time .
• Any professional basketball player not named Charles Smith missing more than two point - blank shots in a row .
Not to put too fine a point on it , but sports simulations cheat .
Straight out .
Always have .
Always will .
It 's as if Bill Belichick and Ernie Adams acquired a Rick Moranis shrink ray and decided to bunker down inside your PlayStation .
But do n't take our word for it .
Ask Matthew Kato , a writer for Game Informer magazine who has been playing and reviewing games for more than a decade .
" They all have catch - up AI , " he says .
" The computer is down , and then all of the sudden it breaks eight tackles and rips off an 80 - yard run to conveniently tie the game up .
I 've run experiments to see if you can shut the computer out if you run the difficulty at the highest level .
I know plenty of people who have tried this .
And you just can't skunk the computer .
Something always happens . "
Does it ever .
Clumsy and / or Complex Controls
In Top Spin 3 , smacking a powerful forehand down the line while approaching the net can require hitting four buttons at once .
Madden 's screen - filling pre-snap command menu should come with its own instruction manual .
Laudably attempting to add depth and nuance to player control , sports game makers sometimes go too far , forgetting that in all things electronic interface -- from iPods to the Nintendo Wii controller -- less is usually more .
2K Sports does n't need to revamp its unintuitive NBA 2K " isomotion " dribbling system for the fifth consecutive year ; it needs a subscription to Real Simple magazine .
And baseball designers take note : if your game features multiple control systems for batting and pitching , that probably means none of them is very good .
VALLEY OF THE KILLER DOLLS Welcome to the Uncanny Valley , the much - researched perceptual phenomenon in which the more human a digital figure looks , the more off - putting and revolting its nonhuman qualities become .
Sorta like scary wax figures .
For developers striving to create the feeling that gamers are playing with the pros , it 's a Catch - 22 : Give Federer a photo - real face , and the second he squints , the illusion is ruined .
" That is the worst issue , " says Francois Giuntini , Top Spin 3's creative director .
" It 's easy to make the faces better with hi-res textures .
But if the clothes are stiff , if the hair does n't move , if the smile is off , people notice right away . "
In the beginning , virtual athletes did n't even have faces ( or bodies , in the case of Pong ) .
Next came crude , blurry pixels .
( Larry Bird 's face ?
Or impressionist art ? )
NBA Jam popularized digitized , recognizable mugs , which evolved into today 's normal - mapped , specularly lit noggins , accurate down to reflective eyeballs and the last wayward strand of Anderson Varejao 's Sideshow Bob ' do .
So what 's to complain about ?
Only this :
The more real the faces appear , the more creepy and laughably Nosferatu - like they seem ( see Kaman , Chris , NBA 2K7 ) .
Oh , and do n't get us started on virtual coaches , who apparently spend their offseasons vacationing on the Island of Dr. Moreau .
Hockey Power Plays
Too easy to stop , even when facing a two - man disadvantage .
Penalty killing should make you sweat .
Make your thumbs hurt .
It should not be a minor inconvenience akin to mistakenly hitting the pause button .
Power plays are the long - lost sports gaming brother of tennis serves -- mighty in the real world , meek in the digital realm .
Pity .
THE RUNDOWN
Turns out developers can make on - screen athletes who sprint like their real - world counterparts .
We just would n't enjoy playing with them because the smoother the running animation , the less responsive the user control .
" There are athletes who are really quick and can turn on a dime , but they still have to go through the same basic body movements as everyone else , " says a football game developer .
" Lean , turn into the movement , take a first step .
Do you really want that to animate every time you press left on the stick ?
Or do you just want to go left ?
Getting players to feel responsive , but not look robotic and twitchy -- technology these days has a hard time getting that done . "
Go ahead , game makers -- put on your shoes and jog .
Do it in front of a mirror .
Watch yourself .
Watch other people .
Watch athletes .
Notice the common denominator : Everyone looksAnd totally unlike anyone in a sports video game .
( In 2 K football , players move as if they 're in the middle of a no- anesthesia colonoscopy ) .
Real people dip their shoulders , shift their weight from side to side .
They stumble and stagger , skip and stride .
They dogo from jogging to running to teeth - clenched sprinting by repeating the same animation cycle
Basketball Rebounding
When shots bounce off the virtual rim and land on the floor before players pick them up -- hello , NBA Live ! -- it 's probably time to rethink your rebounding code .
Just a thought .
Football Suction Blocking and Gang Tackling
The former -- when defenders are magnetically drawn backward and sideways to blockers , defying the laws of physics and common sense -- happens far too often .
The latter does n't occur nearly enough .
Physical contact is the essence of pigskin .
What gives ?
MISTAKES HAPPEN
With sports games typically releasing well in advance of the actual season they 're emulating -- for example , Madden drops in August -- accurate opening day rosters are basically impossible .
As for other errors ?
" Sometimes we just mess up , " says a developer who has worked on hockey and basketball titles .
" But a lot of times , a team will make a slight change to their uniforms and do n't think to tell us .
Or they do tell us , but we 've already finished the game . "
Missing benchwarmers .
Missing .
Misplaced student band sections .
Pants that should be white .
Shoes that should be black .
Uniform fonts that are totally wrong .
All little things , to be sure -- but as coaches always stress , victory starts with attention to detail .
Ca n't game makers try a little harder ?
Or at least put more effort into downloadable roster updates -- ahem , NBA 2K8 -- and uniform patches ?
Dropback Passing
Why is left tackle the second - most valuable position in the NFL ?
Because even elusive quarterbacks such as Vince Young can't dodge pass - rushers by dropping back 20 yards , rolling left and throwing 50 - yard , laser - guided bombs off their back feet .
On the digital gridiron , by contrast , Jim Sorgi can do all of the above .
For years , football games have featured nonexistent pass pockets , brain - dead pursuit and godlike quarterbacks more evasive and cannon - armed than vintage Randall Cunningham .
Something has to give -- and if you 've ever watched " Madden Nation , " that something is any semblance of realistic play .
Hockey Fighting
Has n't been fun since the glory days of NHLPA ' 93 .
And yes , we know :
The NHL licensing department wo n't be happy if game makers bring back bleeding heads .
Still , fun , smooth and responsive fighting should n't be too much to ask .
If Double Dragon and Bad Dudes could get brawling right , so can hockey games .
TIGHTENING THE BRAND Again , it 's not developers .
It 's us .
We 're dumb .
And too many of us want to succeed while guiding a virtual Rex Grossman .
" The user gums everything up , " says a football game developer , laughing .
" First , you want a consistent feel for everyone .
If you play as Peyton Manning , he should feel like Peyton Manning -- but if you play as Trent Dilfer , you still want the user to feel he 's competent .
So you can either make some players abusively good and others unplayable , or you can tighten that band to satisfy everyone . "

Says another developer : " There are little subtleties in real football that make such a difference that you 'll never see in a video game .
In blocking , hand position is so important , almost as important as quickness off the ball and basic strength .
But how do we let people control that ?
Warren Sapp was awesome because he made himself a small target to block .
If we tried to give users that element of gameplay , we 'd push out half our market -- that 's too complicated for them .
People want the real game , but they 're really not ready for the real game . "

So you 're playing against the virtual San Antonio Spurs .
Tim Duncan takes two shots , both from the outside .
Meanwhile , Bruce Bowen takes a dozen , half of them on dribble drives .
Or say you 're facing the digital San Diego Chargers .
They open the game with three straight rushes by LaDainian Tomlinson , then pass on 30 of their next 35 plays .
Talk about frustrating .
It 's nice that NBA Live 08's Steve Nash has an up - to - date haircut ; it would be nicer if the in - game Suns actually played their distinct , " Seven Seconds or Less " brand of high - octane basketball .
Also , why does every football game ultimately differentiate good players from bad simply by making the better players
Endless Games
Bad enough that NBA Finals games now take three hours to watch .
Worse still that a game of NBA 2K8 can take more than an hour to complete .
Gamers have jobs .
Gamers have lives .
To paraphrase Patrick Henry : Give us in - game saves -- right now , not on the next - next - next generation consoles -- or give us death .
Superstar Benchwarmers
Call it the Matt Bullard effect .
A former pine rider for the Houston Rockets , Bullard averaged 5.3 points per game in a nine - year career while shooting nearly 40 percent from beyond the arc -- the latter number making him a minor deity in older versions of NBA Live , where his 3 - point shot rating made him good for 30 - plus points a contest .
" You still find that in games , " admits a basketball game developer .
" Two years ago in our game , people would just abuse Jason Kapono .
He 's a great shooter , but not that great .
We had to go in and change a bunch of things .
We added fatigue factors , made it so that he had to spot up , that he could n't just dribble up and shoot .
As a designer , you have to figure out ways to model players so users can't take advantage . "
GETTING WHAT YOU ASK FOR
When it comes to errors in sports games , the customer is always right .
Even when the users ought to be wrong .
" It goes back to user frustration , " says a basketball game developer .
" If you 're sitting there and a ball goes out and you can't explain why -- if the nuance is lost in the broad strokes of a video game -- we do n't want that .
We had it in one of our games that if you pass out of a shot with a player with a low passer rating , the ball will go out of bounds sometimes .
I can tell people why this happens , and they still complain about it . "
Bad snaps .
Off - target throws .
Passes that sail out of bounds .
Slam - dunk attempts that ricochet into the third row .
In sports , stuff happens .
Yet outside of the occasional fumble , good ol ' fashioned screwups do n't occur nearly enough in sports video games .
" I had a conversation about this with a developer , " Kato says .
" I 'd like to see a random missed extra point once in a while .
But that goes contrary to wanting to control the action in video games -- if you perform the right action on the controller in the right time , you get rewarded .
That 's the input - output system that video games have put forward . "
We get that .
But we 're not Pavlov 's dogs .
If every now and then the food bell does n't mean dinner -- if Ethan Albright occasionally sends one sailing over the kicker 's head -- we 'll live .
And still buy next year 's version of the game .
Promise .
Money Plays
In Double Dribble , it was shooting from the on-court " X . "
In the old NHL games , it was the inside - outside deke move .
In NFL 2K1 , it was receiver out patterns .
In Top Spin 3 , it 's a glitched , nigh - unreturnable wide serve .
Despite programmers ' best efforts , sports games always have unfair scoring exploits -- the technical term is cheese -- that result in broken gameplay , controllers and friendships .
" One of my favorite games is Pro Evolution Soccer , " one developer says .
" Problem is , the same techniques I 've always used to score when I need to score are still there .
Change sides with the ball really fast , sprint up the sideline , get close to the baseline , wait for a teammate to streak in front of the goal .
Pass it to him and the defender will miss .
The goalie wo n't do anything .
I play with my friends , and I try to cut that pass off myself .
It does n't matter .
It always works .
Every year . "
STUPID HUMAN TRICKS
Money plays ?
We 're to blame because the human brain still beats SkyNet .
" Having to account for the person who does something off the wall hurts every sports game , " one developer says .
" You can alleviate those problems by giving users less control , but they hate that .
So what happens is that you program this great , intelligent football game , and then you put it into [ quality assurance ] testing .
The first thing they do is take their left defensive end , loop him all the way to the right side by the cornerback and then rush the quarterback .
Well , the game does n't know what to do , does n't even realize that the defensive end it still on the line .
And that 's before we release the game .
We could have a QA department of 200 people , but it does n't compare to 2 million gamers . "
Is designed to take away the deep ball .
Especially streak routes .
We swear .
That is all .
Nickel Defense
Should not be more effective at stopping the run than a 4 - 4 alignment .
We swear .
That is all .
Snow , Rain and Wind
It 's not so much that inclement weather in sports video games looks lousy -- though with the exception of snow in All - Pro Football 2K8 and the upcoming Madden 09 , it does -- it 's that it generally has negligible effects on gameplay .
If the wind is whipping through Giants Stadium , passing should be a chore ; if the snow is falling at Lambeau Field , players should be slipping and sliding ( to All - Pro Football 's credit , this actually happens ) ; if the rain is pouring Milli Vanilli - style , fumbles and drops should be more frequent .
Also , if the temperature drops below zero , virtual Tom Coughlin should turn purple .
Just because .
Artificial Non-Intelligence
Despite all of the above , sports games are better than ever .
Better looking .
Better playing .
Packed with developer love and care .
They 've come a long way since Pong .
Yet when it comes to smart AI -- or even Grady Little - level AI -- they still have a long , long way to go .
" The other day , I 'm playing [ against the Lakers ] , up one with 30 seconds to go , " says a basketball game developer .
" The CPU fouls me , sends me to the line .
Why would it do that ?
Play out the clock , get the ball , call timeout , take the last shot .
Anyway , I make the free throws .
The AI rushes the ball up the court , shoots as quickly as it can with Pau Gasol .
And it 's an 18 - footer .
I get the ball and win . "
The developer sighs .
He 's talking about his game .
And it makes him crazy .
" For the past five years , we 've set aside time to make sure the AI makes the right decisions at the end of the game .
But either our engineers are stupid or our designers are stupid or I 'm stupid , because we still have n't gotten it right . "

Report : Russia mulls sending bombers to Cuba
Russia may start regular flights by long - range bombers to Cuba in response to US plans to build missile defence sites in Eastern Europe , the newspaper Izvestia reported Monday , quoting an official .
" Such discussions exist , " the unidentified senior Russian air force official was quoted as saying , adding that the measure would be a response to the United States " deploying missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic . "
It was not clear whether he meant permanently basing the bombers in Cuba or using the island as a refuelling stop , but former top defence ministry official Leonid Ivashov told the newspaper that Cuba was best used for brief stopovers .
Cuba should be used " not as a permanent base -- this is unnecessary -- but as a stopover airfield , a refuelling stop , " Ivashov was quoted as saying .
Spokesmen for the air force and the defence ministry declined to comment about the report to AFP .
Starting long - range bomber flights to Cuba would signal a reawakening of military cooperation by former Cold War allies Moscow and Havana .
In 2002 Russia closed its last military base on the island , a radar base at Lourdes .
Plans to fly long - range bombers to Cuba " would be a good answer to attempts to place NATO bases new Russia 's borders , " former top air force commander Pyotr Deinekin told the RIA Novosti news agency in response to the Izvestia report .
In a speech last year , then president Vladimir Putin likened the US missile defence dispute to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 , though he added that relations between Moscow and Washington " have changed a lot " since then .
The discovery in 1962 that Moscow was secretly building nuclear missile launchpads in Cuba pushed the world close to nuclear war in a terrifying two - week brinkmanship between the Soviet Union and the United States .
Last week , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned Moscow would take countermeasures against US plans to build an anti-missile radar facility in the Czech Republic and site interceptor missiles in Poland .
Russia argues that the installations threaten its national security despite US assurances that they are directed against " rogue states " like Iran .
While talking about the war in Afghanistan yesterday , John McCain predictably went after Barack Obama , saying Obama “ has no strategy . ”
It was an odd attack , given the fact that McCain had just flip - flopped on his Afghanistan policy , and embraced Obama ’s strategy as his own .
Here ’s McCain yesterday , talking about his plan to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , in order to bring an Iraq - like strategy to the country .
The key quote , of course , was pretty straightforward : “ [ O ] ur commanders on the ground in Afghanistan say that they need at least three additional brigades .
Thanks to the success of the surge , these forces are becoming available , and our commanders in Afghanistan must get them . ”
What ’s important to realize , though , is that while Obama has been arguing for a year that he wants to send additional troops to Afghanistan , McCain has always held the opposite position , opposing the deployment of more U.S. troops , and arguing that any additional troops come from NATO .
Yesterday , however , McCain reversed course , change his position , and embraced Obama ’s policy as his own .
As Josh Marshall explained , “ So let ’s all say it out loud : McCain is now copying Obama ’s position on Afghanistan .
And with troops that he does n’t have since he ’s against pulling any out of Iraq . ”
But it gets worse .
McCain has actually held multiple positions on Afghanistan in the last seven days .
Last Tuesday , McCain did not want to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
By yesterday morning , McCain said he does want to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
Almost immediately after giving his speech — literally just minutes after the event — McCain said he did n’t exactly mean what he ’d said in his prepared remarks , and argued that the additional troops could come from NATO , not U.S. forces .
And then a few hours later , McCain refined his policy a little more , saying the additional troops would come from NATO and U.S. forces .
Remember , the premise of John McCain ’s presidential campaign is a ) his expertise on foreign policy and national security ; and b ) his consistency .
' Hey , you in the mask , have you got a light ? '
How divers helped a shark in need
It can't be easy trying to light up under the ocean .
But while at first glance it looks like he 's enjoying a cigar , this shark has actually come off worse in an encounter with a fisherman .
When the grey nurse shark was found by two divers in Australia , he had a 4ft gaff - a hooked pole used to haul big fish on to boats - wedged in his mouth .
One of the divers , John Natoli , said : ' Although it did not appear to be suffering in any way , it was obvious it would n't be able to hunt and eat and would die . '
Rescue :
The endangered fish probably snapped the gaff 's shaft after someone tried to illegally kill it
Injured :
The three - metre long nurse shark bit off more than it could chew when a giant fishing hook got stuck in its throat
The sharks are an endangered species and it is possible that this one became injured as a result of illegal fishing .
Whether someone had illegally tried to catch the 11ft shark , an endangered species , was n't known , but the divers were well aware that if something was n't done to help it , the creature would die .
' Although it did not appear to be suffering in a way , it was obvious it would n't be able to hunt and eat very successfully and would die , ' said diver John Natoli , one of the men who discovered the shark off the north coast of New South Wales .
After Mr Natoli drew attention to the shark 's plight , government divers went off in search of it - and despite the possibility of it having swum off to another area , found it near its original location .
With the greatest care ( as grey nurse sharks can still bite and thrash when under duress ) , the divers managed to lasso it and then herd it into a clear plastic tunnel , specially designed for catching injured sea creatures .
Caught :
The shark is put in a large tank on the boat so the divers can save it
Tricky operation : A brave marine biologist shoves his arm deep into the shark 's mouth to try to remove the hook
Then the shark was brought to the surface and its see - through ' cage ' hauled by crane on to a boat .
Injected with a drug to calm it , the shark was moved into a tank where a vet and divers were able to manoeuvre the hooked end of the gaff from its throat without causing any injury .
' It was a delicate job but a job well done , ' said Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald .
' We are n't sure how the gaff got there in the first place but the good news is that the shark ended up in the best of health . '
Before it was released back into the Pacific Ocean , the shark was fitted with an electronic tag so that its movements and recovery can be monitored by scientists .
There are believed to be about 500 grey nurse sharks in NSW waters .
Off the hook :
The shark swims off after its dramatic rescue
Dependency Walker 2.2
Dependency Walker is a free utility that scans any 32 - bit or 64 - bit Windows module ( exe , dll , ocx , sys , etc. ) and builds a hierarchical tree diagram of all dependent modules .
For each module found , it lists all the functions that are exported by that module , and which of those functions are actually being called by other modules .

Google Maps is a mapping service offering satellite images , real - time traffic info , panoramic street view and features such as reviewing places : restaurants , clubs etc .
A new option allows users to review members of the Congress .
Rate Congress members
Google Map user can now rate congressional offices .
Apart from the usual places people review such as salons , restaurants , clubs and other businesses , people can now express their opinion and give stars to Congress members .
People already started commenting and writing reviews .
Some users star rated members of the Congress , some wrote good reviews and some very bad ones .
Senators who received good reviews
So far , Senator Richard Shelby has been rated five stars by a user who said that the congress member was very receptive to health research ideas .
Sen .
Shelby ’s staff was also given a positive rating .
According to a user named Tanner Godfrey , the staff members are very professional and good at their job .
Another senator who received good reviews in New York Senator Chuck Schumer .
A user rated him five stars and wrote that whenever he reached out to Sen .
Schumer , he always received a prompt and friendly response .
Senator Roy Blunt ’s staff was also congratulated .
One user said that the staff of the Missouri senator was very professional .
Senators who received bad reviews
Not all senators were so lucky .
Some received bad star rating and negative reviews .
This is the case for Virginia Senator Tim Kaine .
One use rated him with a star out of five and commented that the senator is responsible for selling 20 % of the US uranium to Russia .
However , another user rated the same senator with five stars and commented he was a good man .
New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand does not have many fans either .
Some users rated her with one star .
The first part of his course will consist of two presentations .
In the first presentation , he will introduce fundamentals of Monte Carlo simulation for statistical inference , with emphasis on algorithms such as importance sampling , particle filtering and smoothing for dynamic models , Markov chain Monte Carlo , Gibbs and Metropolis - Hastings , blocking and mixtures of MCMC kernels , Monte Carlo EM , sequential Monte Carlo for static models , auxiliary variable methods ( Swedsen - Wang , hybrid Monte Carlo and slice sampling ) , and adaptive MCMC .
The algorithms will be illustrated with several examples : image tracking , robotics , image annotation , probabilistic graphical models , and music analysis .
The second presentation will target model selection and decision making problems .
He will describe the reversible - jump MCMC algorithm and illustrate it with application to simple mixture models and nonlinear regression with an unknown number of basis functions .
He will show how to apply this algorithm to general Markov decision processes ( MDPs ) .
The course will also cover other Monte Carlo simulation methods for partially observed Markov decision processes ( POMDPs ) using policy gradients , common random number generation , and active exploration with Gaussian processes .
An outline to some applications of these methods to robotics and the design of computer game architectures will be given .
The presentation will end with the problem of Monte Carlo simulation for Bayesian nonlinear experimental design , with application to financial modeling , robot exploration , drug treatments , dynamic sensor networks , optimal measurement and active vision .
In Binary Search Trees I , and II , we considered methods for efficient searching of an ordered collection by using key comparisons .
While these methods were indeed very fast , they were limited to O ( log N ) performance due to the comparison tree inherent in the data structure .
Binary search trees are also somewhat complicated , especially when the chance of encountering a degenerate tree is minimized , or removed entirely .
An alternative method for searching uses they key itself an an address into the data structure , thus breaking the O ( log N ) barrier and allowing searches to be performed with an expected time complexity of O ( 1 ) , which is as good as it gets when it comes to searching , and algorithms in general .
Unfortunately , not all keys are easily used as a table address .
Strings , for example , are not suitable , because array subscripting requires an integer .
Even when using integers , if the value is outside of the range of the array , using it as an index will cause an out of bounds access .
Hashing is the solution to this problem .
The simplest case when it comes to converting a key into a table address is when you have an integer key .
In that case it is a simple matter of forcing the integer into the range of the table , most commonly with the remainder operator :
unsigned index = key % N ;
Unfortunately , this is insufficient most of the time for two reasons .
First , keys are more likely to be strings than integers .
There has to be some way to convert a string into a table address , or hashing would die a quick death .
Second , by forcing the integer into a smaller range , there is a good chance that unique keys will have the same table address after the conversion .
This is called a collision , and collisions are the bane of hash function designers .
Hashing a string into a table address is more complicated because instead of a single numeric value there are several , and a good hash function should take them all into account when constructing a table address .
Fortunately , hashing strings can be generalized into hashing a sequence of memory blocks , so it is possible to avoid having to develop a different hash function for different key types .
The rest of this tutorial will assume that this generalization has been made and we will look at several general hash functions .
Uses for hashing
By far , the most well known use for hashing is to convert a key into an array index for table lookup .
Such data structures are called hash tables , and they are incredibly useful for a wide range of fields .
For example , in a compiler , a hash table will likely be used for keyword and identifier storage because a compiler needs quick access to this information .
A compiler may ( should ! ) also use a hash table for optimizing switch statements , and a number of other purposes .
A hash table is also surprisingly well suited to the implementation of a cache , and many web browsers and operating systems will use a hash table for just that .
Probably the second most well known use for hashing is in cryptography , where algorithms that are geared more toward security are used to create digital fingerpints for authentication and data integrity .
While lookup hashes are not as complicated or as powerful as cryptographic hashes , adherence to many of the design principles for a cryptographic hash will typically result in a very good lookup hash , so even though there is a clear distinction between hashing for lookup and hashing for cryptography , one can encourage improvement in the other .
This tutorial will focus on hashing for lookup .
Pigeonhole Principle
When hashing a key so that it can be used as an array index , it should be immediately obvious that the size of the array should be at least as large as the input collection .
This observation is simple , and some might think that it goes without saying , but it is actually a specialization of the Pigeonhole Principle , where if M items are placed in N buckets , and M is greater than N , one or more buckets contain two or more items .
This is one of the two principles that pave the way toward understanding collisions .
A collision is when two keys hash to the same index .
The pigeonhole principle proves that no hashing algorithm can hash every key to a unique index if the possible keys exceeds the size of the array .
Since most uses of hashing for lookup involve trying to take keys in a broad range and force them into indices for a smaller range , it stands to reason that no hash algorithm can perfectly hash a sequence of unknown keys into unique indices .

Perfect hashing
After having told you that collisions are a necessary evil , and dashing your hopes that there could be a “ perfect ” hash function , I will now contradict myself and say that there is such a thing as perfect hashing !
However , despite the existence of perfect hash algorithms , they are dreadfully difficult to discover for all but the smallest inputs where the number of keys and the exact construction of every possible key is known .
As such , while a perfect hash algorithm exists for every input , it is unreasonable to expect that it can be found , so instead of searching for a perfect hash function , it is better to simply build a hash function that minimizes collisions instead of denying them completely .
Constructing a perfect hash
A perfect hash can be created if the number and construction of the keys are known factors .
For example , a perfect hash for a list of ten product numbers that are sure to differ in their 4th and 5th digits can be easily constructed :
unsigned hash ( unsigned pid ) { return pid / 1000 % 100 ; }
However , notice that even though there are only ten product numbers , a table of 100 buckets must be created because the resulting hash values are at least two digits .
This is a terrible waste of space , but if the range is forced into an array of 10 buckets , the right digit of the hash values may cause a collision .
In such a case , the pigeonhole principle applies , and we can no longer guarantee that this hash algorithm is perfect .
We ’re all in this together .
Just like you , we ’re closely monitoring the impact of COVID - 19 .

Minimal perfect hashing
A minimal perfect hash algorithm maps every key to every bucket , without any unused buckets .
Unlike the perfect hash function above , a minimal perfect hash function would not have any collisions when hashing the 4th and 5th digits of the product numbers and placing the result in an array of 10 buckets .
Discovering this function is considerably more difficult , and we are still only dealing with two digit numbers .
A minimal perfect hash algorithm can only be found manually with a great deal of work , or in exceptionally simple cases .
For example , hashing ten single digit integers into an array with 10 buckets is trivial , but by adding another digit to the integers , the problem becomes much harder .
In general , a minimal perfect hash function can only be found through an exhaustive search of the possibilities .
Let ’s see how James and Carys BUYING TOP RATED PRODUCTS
Algorithms have been devised that will exhaustively search for perfect and minimal perfect hash functions .
If one is needed then these tools will be a much better option than trying to discover an algorithm manually .
Many of these tools are freely available on the web .
Properties of an ideal hash
With the understanding that collisions will be inevitable in all but the most specialized of cases , a primary goal in developing a hash function for lookup is to minimize collisions .
This typically means forcing a uniform distribution of the hash value , much like a random number generator .
However , unlike a random number generator , the process must be repeatable so that the same key hashes to the same index , while different keys do not .
This goal can be broken down into two general properties of an ideal hash .
An ideal hash will permute its internal state such that every resulting hash value has exactly one input that will produce it .
Any hash function that uses every part of the key to calculate the hash value will typically meet this requirement , so general hash functions that only process a part of the key will almost always be very poor because the differing parts of the key may not be the parts involved in creating the hash value .
A good example of this is only hashing the first four or five characters of a string , and then using the algorithm to hash URLs that start with “ http : / / ” .
A hash function is said to achieve avalanche if the resulting hash value is wildly different if even a single bit is different in the key .
This effect aids distribution because similar keys will not have similar hash values .
A hash function that distributes the hash values in a uniform manner will minimize collisions and fill the array more evenly .
Avalanche is a concept derived from cryptographic hashing , and it offers a way to ensure that a hash function is good when used for table lookup .
Often you will see hash functions that claim to be “ best for strings ” or “ best for integers ” .
These functions should be avoided because if a hash function is not good for all types of data then it is probably a poor algorithm in general .
Sometimes , on the other hand , a hash function may be optimized for a single type for performance reasons .
It is good to learn to tell the difference between the two , but a safe practice is to only use general hash functions that are known to be good .
This tutorial offers several examples of good general hash functions .
We believe our role serving customers and the community during this time is an important one .

Using existing hash functions
Designing a hash function is a black art .
As such , it is always better to use a known good algorithm than to try and invent one .
Hash functions are similar to random number generators in many ways , and just as with random number generators , it is easier to design a very poor hash function than to design even a mediocre one .
This tutorial will describe several good hash functions so that you can avoid the temptation to write an ad hoc algorithm when the time comes .
We will also look at a few not so good hash functions so that you will be able to recognize them in the real world .
Additive hash
Probably the simplest algorithm for hashing a sequence of integral values ( such as a string ) , is to add all of the characters together and then force the range into something suitable for lookup with the remainder of division .
I will give an example of this algorithm only because books commonly suggest it in their rush to get past the topic of hash functions on their way to collision resolution methods .
This algorithm is very bad :
unsigned add_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h += p[i ] ; } return h ; }
Generally , any hash algorithm that relies primarily on a commutitive operation will have an exceptionally bad distribution .
This hash fails to treat permutations differently , so “ abc ” , “ cba ” , and “ cab ” will all result in the same hash value .
Despite the suckiness of this algorithm , the example is useful in that it shows how to create a general hash function .
add_hash can be used to hash strings , single integers , single floating - point values , arrays of scalar values , and just about anything else you can think of because it is always legal to pun a simple object into an array of unsigned char and work with the individual bytes of the object .
XOR hash
The XOR hash is another algorithm commonly suggested by textbooks .
Instead of adding together the bytes of an object as the additive hash does , the XOR hash repeatedly folds the bytes together to produce a seemingly random hash value :
unsigned xor_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h ^= p[i ] ; } return h ; }
Unfortunately , this algorithm is too simple to work properly on most input data .
The internal state , the variable h , is not mixed nearly enough to come close to achieving avalanche , nor is a single XOR effective at permuting the internal state , so the resulting distribution , while better than the additive and multiplicative hashes , is still not very good .
Rotating hash
unsigned rot_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h = ( h << 4 ) ^ ( h >> 28 ) ^ p[i ] ; } return h ; }
The rotating hash is identical to the XOR hash except instead of simply folding each byte of the input into the internal state , it also performs a fold of the internal state before combining it with the each byte of the input .
This extra mixing step is enough to give the rotating hash a much better distribution .
Much of the time , the rotating hash is sufficient , and can be considered the minimal acceptable algorithm .
Notice that with each improvement , the internal state is being mixed up more and more .
This is a key element in a good hash function .
Bernstein hash
Dan Bernstein created this algorithm and posted it in a newsgroup .
It is known by many as the Chris Torek hash because Chris went a long way toward popularizing it .
Since then it has been used successfully by many , but despite that the algorithm itself is not very sound when it comes to avalanche and permutation of the internal state .
It has proven very good for small character keys , where it can outperform algorithms that result in a more random distribution :
unsigned djb_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h = 33 * h + p[i ] ; } return h ; }
Bernstein ’s hash should be used with caution .
It performs very well in practice , for no apparently known reasons ( much like how the constant 33 does better than more logical constants for no apparent reason ) , but in theory it is not up to snuff .
Always test this function with sample data for every application to ensure that it does not encounter a degenerate case and cause excessive collisions .
Modified Bernstein
A minor update to Bernstein ’s hash replaces addition with XOR for the combining step .
This change does not appear to be well known or often used , the original algorithm is still recommended by nearly everyone , but the new algorithm typically results in a better distribution :
unsigned djb_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h = 33 * h ^ p[i ] ; } return h ; }
Shift - Add-XOR hash
The shift - add - XOR hash was designed as a string hashing function , but because it is so effective , it works for any data as well with similar efficiency .
The algorithm is surprisingly similar to the rotating hash except a different choice of constants for the rotation is used , and addition is a preferred operation for mixing .
All in all , this is a surprisingly powerful and flexible hash .
Like many effective hashes , it will fail tests for avalanche , but that does not seem to affect its performance in practice .
unsigned sax_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h ^= ( h << 5 ) + ( h >>
2 ) + p[i ] ; } return h ; }
FNV hash
The FNV hash , short for Fowler / Noll / Vo in honor of the creators , is a very powerful algorithm that , not surprisingly , follows the same lines as Bernstein ’s modified hash with carefully chosen constants .
This algorithm has been used in many applications with wonderful results , and for its simplicity , the FNV hash should be one of the first hashes tried in an application .
It is also recommended that the FNV website be visited for useful descriptions of how to modify the algorithm for various uses .
unsigned fnv_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 2166136261 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h = ( h * 16777619 ) ^ p[i ] ; } return h ; }
One - at - a- Time hash
Bob Jenkins is a well known authority on designing hash functions for table lookup .
In fact , one of his hashes is considered state of the art for lookup , which we will see shortly .
A considerably simpler algorithm of his design is the One - at - a- Time hash :
unsigned oat_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h += p[i ] ; h += ( h << 10 ) ; h ^= ( h >> 6 ) ; } h += ( h << 3 ) ; h ^= ( h >> 11 ) ; h += ( h << 15 ) ; return h ; }
This algorithm quickly reaches avalanche and performs very well .
This function is another that should be one of the first to be tested in any application , if not the very first .
This algorithm is my personal preference as a first test hash , and it has seen effective use in several high level scripting languages as the hash function for their associative array data type .
JSW hash
This is a hash of my own devising that combines a rotating hash with a table of randomly generated numbers .
The algorithm walks through each byte of the input , and uses it as an index into a table of random integers generated by a good random number generator .
The internal state is rotated to mix it up a bit , then XORed with the random number from the table .
The result is a uniform distribution if the random numbers are uniform .
The size of the table should match the values in a byte .
For example , if a byte is eight bits then the table would hold 256 random numbers :
unsigned jsw_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 16777551 ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h = ( h << 1 | h >> 31 ) ^ tab [ p [ i ] ] ; } return h ; }
In general , this algorithm is among the better ones that I have tested in terms of both distribution and performance .
I may be slightly biased , but I feel that this function should be on the list of the first to test in a new application using hash lookup .
ELF hash
The ELF hash function has been around for a while , and it is believed to be one of the better algorithms out there .
In my experience , this is true , though ELF hash does not perform sufficiently better than most of the other algorithms presented in this tutorial to justify its slightly more complicated implementation .
It should be on your list of first functions to test in a new lookup implementation :
unsigned elf_hash ( void * key , int len ) { unsigned char *p = key ; unsigned h = 0 , g ; int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < len ; i++ ) { h = ( h << 4 ) + p[i ] ; g = h & 0xf0000000L ; if ( g != 0 ) { h ^= g >>
24 ; } h &= ~ g ; } return h ; }
Jenkins hash
The dreaded Jenkins hash has been thoroughly tested and passes all kinds of tests for avalanche and permutations .
As such it is considered to be one of the best and most thoroughly analyzed algorithms on the market presently .
Unfortunately , it is also ridiculously complicated compared to the other hashes examined in this tutorial :
# define hashsize ( n ) ( 1U << ( n ) ) # define hashmask ( n ) ( hashsize ( n ) - 1 ) # define mix( a , b, c ) \ { \ a -= b ; a -= c ; a ^= ( c >> 13 ) ; \ b -= c ; b -= a ; b ^= ( a << 8 ) ; \ c -= a ; c -= b ; c ^= ( b >> 13 ) ; \ a -= b ; a -= c ; a ^= ( c >> 12 ) ; \ b -= c ; b -= a ; b ^= ( a << 16 ) ; \ c -= a ; c -= b ; c ^= ( b >> 5 ) ; \ a -= b ; a -= c ; a ^= ( c >> 3 ) ; \ b -= c ; b -= a ; b ^= ( a << 10 ) ; \ c -= a ; c -= b ; c ^= ( b >> 15 ) ; \ } unsigned jen_hash ( unsigned char * k , unsigned length , unsigned initval ) { unsigned a , b ; unsigned c = initval ; unsigned len = length ; a = b = 0x9e3779b9 ; while ( len >= 12 ) { a += ( k [ 0 ] + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 1 ] << 8 ) + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 2 ] << 16 ) + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 3 ] << 24 ) ) ; b += ( k [ 4 ] + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 5 ] << 8 ) + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 6 ] << 16 ) + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 7 ] << 24 ) ) ; c += ( k [ 8 ] + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 9 ] << 8 ) + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 10 ] << 16 ) + ( ( unsigned ) k [ 11 ] << 24 ) ) ; mix( a , b , c ) ; k += 12 ; len -= 12 ; } c += length ; switch ( len ) { case 11 : c += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 10 ] << 24 ) ; case 10 : c += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 9 ] << 16 ) ; case 9 : c += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 8 ]
<< 8 ) ; /*
First byte of c reserved for length */ case 8 : b += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 7 ] << 24 ) ; case 7 : b += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 6 ] << 16 ) ; case 6 : b += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 5 ] << 8 ) ; case 5 : b += k [ 4 ] ; case 4 : a += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 3 ] << 24 ) ; case 3 : a += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 2 ] << 16 ) ; case 2 : a += ( ( unsigned ) k [ 1 ] << 8 ) ; case 1 : a += k[ 0 ] ; } mix ( a , b , c ) ; return c ; }

Designing hash functions
Designing a hash function is more trial and error with a touch of theory than any well defined procedure .
For example , beyond making the connection between random numbers and the desirable random distribution of hash values , the better part of the design for my JSW hash involved playing around with constants to see what would work best .
I would also be lying if I said that the choice of operations was not almost completely random trial and error by pulling from a pool of combinations of XOR , OR , AND , addition , subtraction , and multiplication .
The biggest design element of JSW hash is using the table of random numbers keyed on each byte of the input to act as a mixing step .
Then it was simply a matter of choosing a less complicated hash algorithm to paste that addition onto , and finally the fiddling and testing to get the algorithm performing well .
I will not claim that hash function design is always like that , but the evidence certainly suggests it .
If you design hash functions in a deterministic way , I would love to hear from you .
Testing hash functions
The most important test for a hash function is distribution on a sample of the expected input .
No hash function is best for all possible inputs , which is why I introduced a large number of algorithms in this tutorial .
Sometimes one of the good hash functions will work better than the others , and that one should be used .
Other times they will all be fairly equal and you can choose at random .
The key here is that a hash function should never be used blindly without testing it , no matter how good the author says it is .
Often , hash tests are designed around a hash function , and that introduces a bias in favor of that function .
A test for distribution is a simple affair .
Just take a sample of the expected input and insert it into a chained hash table with the chosen function .
Work out the statistics of chain length , and you can determine how many collisions were detected .
Alternatively , a quick test for collisions can be performed without the use of a hash table by simply taking a sample input with no duplicates and counting collisions with an existence table :
function collisions : file , n begin table [ n ] = { 0 } while get ( file , buffer ) do table [ hash ( buffer ) % n ] +:= 1 loop for i := 0 to n do println table [ i ] loop end
Another alternative is to plug the hash function into my jsw_hlib library and run it with a few files of sample input .
This saves you the trouble of having to work out a collision test , or designing and implementing a working hash table while calculating several more useful measurements than just collisions .

2008 Copperstate FuelVenture Klaus Savier flies top scores in the Delaminator : Best MPG ( 60.3 mpg @ 164 mph ) and best overall score .
This event is similar to the CAFÉ 400 of the 80’s where fuel efficiency , speed and the ability to carry a payload is measured over a 400 mile course .
At the first annual Fuelventure , the competitors flew a 401 mile course with carefully weighed airplanes and a payload of up to 200 lbs / seat .
The aircraft were weighed again after landing to determine the total fuel used and were scored with the following formula .
mph ^1.3 x mpg x payload^ .6
This is not only a fun and very educational race , it also demonstrates the real world usefulness of airplanes and the effectiveness of modern technology .
The Delaminator uses two LSE Plasma III CDI ignitions and a proprietary , timed sequential , high pressure Fuel Injection system on a modified Continental 0-200 engine .

The Intersection of Speed and Efficiency
by Klaus Savier
As a result of the ever - increasing fuel cost , I decided to demonstrate the efficiency of the Delaminator , a highly optimized Vari EZE , a grocery getter and 25 - year - old “ Technology Demonstrator ” for Light Speed Engineering .
This airplane is well known for winning all kinds of races since 1984 .
From the CAFÉ efficiency races in the late 80’s to the AirVenture Cup race in 2007 , where it won the 400 mile race from Dayton to Oshkosh at an average speed of 254 mph .
In 1990 , two closed course world records were set in the C1 - A weight class for the 1,000 km and 2,000 km distances at over 200 mph .
They are still standing .
The Delaminator ’s configuration for this endurance flight was identical to that used in the AirVenture Cup : - Same LSE Composite 64x86 Propeller , - Dual Plasma III CDI , - Our own Timed Sequential High Pressure Electronic FI , - No extra tank - standard 29 - gal Vari Eze fuel system , - About 25 pounds of luggage : minimal tools , no spare parts .
On Monday April 7th , just prior to Sun ‘N Fun , the weather looked great for a non -stop flight across the country , coast to coast , 2000 miles .
I hopped in the Delaminator as early as I could bear and set out for Florida .
The tailwinds were good but not quite as strong as predicted so I had to slow down a little to increase my range .
It took 8 hrs and 58 min for the total distance of 1985 statute miles , SZP , CA to PFN , FL via ELP TX to avoid the restricted area .
Total fuel used was 25.8 gallons of the 29.2 carried in the standard tanks , leaving more than an hour worth of fuel remaining .
Average fuel flow for the entire flight was 2.87 gph .
Average speed was 220.6 mph .
Tailwind average was around 30 mph at 17500 ft .
The density altitude was above 19000 ft .
Of course , I was on oxygen for the entire flight .
Now for the technical run-down on engine configuration and the methods used to achieve this level of efficiency .
In the Delaminator , the maximum manifold pressure available at 17500 is almost 16 ” .
See picture 1 and note the fuel flow of 4.2 gph at peak power giving a true airspeed of 204kts , resulting in 55.9 statute mpg .
As shown in picture 2 taken during this cross-country flight , the throttle was reduced by almost 1 ” .
While our custom FI automatically adjusts the mixture for all engine conditions , it can be biased just like the Plasma CDI timing .
The automatic mixture adjustment was thus manually leaned to almost 300 degrees past peak EGT , where slight roughness occurs .
Manual increase of timing advance returns some power lost under these conditions and eliminates any lean misfiring .
As a result of these settings and lean burn , all temperatures are near the low limits , oil pump outlet temp is below 150 F and the cylinder head temperatures are all below 300 F .
See picture .
While leaning this far on the lean side of peak reduces power significantly , it is slightly more efficient to reduce power by leaning rather than by closing the throttle because the pumping losses of the engine are lower .
The best “ no wind range ” is normally achieved at best glide speed .
For the Delaminator , this is about 100 mph when fully loaded .
Most of the trip was flown at 130 mph indicated at 17500 ft .
Prior testing has shown that the airplane achieves well over 80 mpg at best glide speed .
Flying at 130 mph , the Delaminator still achieves over 60 mpg .
The tailwind brought the mpg to nearly 80 mpg .
While I could think of a faster airplane with a higher wing loading and a bigger engine , such a configuration could not come close to the efficiency demonstrated here at high altitude .
It seems that this combination of a highly optimized 0-200 engine and high aspect ratio wings offers a combination of efficiency and speed that simply cannot be beat .

Sprint Class New " Skip Plate " Direct Crank Sensor Hardware for Plasma CDI
11/3/06 Light Speed Engineering , LLC has designed and tested a new crankshaft position sensor assembly for use on all aircraft engines .
Based on the existing Hall effect sensor technology used with the Plasma CD ignition since 1998 , the new sensor board has a thicker mounting structure due to a skip plate installed on the sensor side .
The recessed sensors make the installation more robust and gap measurement much easier .
The main improvement is that the Hall effect sensors are now mounted flush or slightly below the surface and are potted in place .
This makes it impossible to damage the sensors should the gap not be adjusted correctly .
There is no change in electrical performance or in the sensors excellent reliability .
All Direct Crank Sensor boards will be shipped in this configuration .
Older systems can be upgraded in the field or by returning the sensor board with its wires and connectors attached , to Light Speed Engineering , LLC .

In all but name , it appears very similar to their older Yahoo !
Search API , as it allows you to query Yahoo's search index programatically .
Under the surface though , Yahoo has removed the 5,000 query per day limit , you 're unrestricted in how you present the data returned , you can re-order the data , and no attribution is required .
For Rubyists ready to play with BOSS , Jay Pignata has developed BOSSMan , a library for interacting with the Yahoo !
BOSS Web service .
Either get it with Git or install with RubyGems like so :
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com gem install jpignata - bossman
Once you 've got the library , make sure you 've got an application ID from Yahoo ( this is unavoidable , alas ) and then you can start to play :
require ' rubygems ' require ' bossman ' include BOSSMan BOSSMan .
application_id = " Your Application ID here " news = BOSSMan :: Search . news ( " Barack Obama " , 0 , 3 ) news .
results .
each do | result | puts " #{result.

BOSSMan supports
Web , news , and image searches out of the box .
You can dump to JSON , XML , or YAML and access all of the relevant attributes through methods .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday August 19 2008
In the column below we stated that Dr Fadhil Chalabi met with oil companies before the invasion of Iraq .
This assertion was based on exchanges during an interview given by Dr Chalabi on the US radio programme To The Point , broadcast on June 24 .
We also referred to Dr Chalabi as " one of the primary Iraqi advisers to the Bush administration in the lead up " to the Iraq war .
Dr Chalabi participated in meetings with the US state department with other Iraqi academic experts to discuss the options for the resuscitation of Iraq after the war and how Iraq 's oil could finance the reconstruction , but we wish to make it clear that he did not offer any political advice or hold or attend any meetings with oil companies .
The meeting referred to was arranged by the state department for Iraqi experts to discuss post - war reconstruction .
Once oil passed $ 140 a barrel , even the most rabidly rightwing media hosts had to prove their populist credibility by devoting a portion of every show to bashing Big Oil .
Some have gone so far as to invite me on for a friendly chat about an insidious new phenomenon : " disaster capitalism . "
It usually goes well - until it does n't .
For instance , " independent conservative " radio host Jerry Doyle and I were having a perfectly amiable conversation about sleazy insurance companies and inept politicians when this happened : " I think I have a quick way to bring the prices down , " Doyle announced .
" We 've invested $ 650 bn to liberate a nation of 25 million people , should n't we just demand that they give us oil ?
There should be tankers after tankers backed up like a traffic jam getting into the Lincoln Tunnel , the stinkin ' Lincoln , at rush - hour with thank - you notes from the Iraqi government ...
Why do n't we just take the oil ?
We 've invested it liberating a country .
I can have the problem solved of gas prices coming down in 10 days , not 10 years . "
There were a couple of problems with Doyle 's plan , of course .
The first was that he was describing the biggest stick - up in world history .
The second that he was too late .
" We " are already heisting Iraq 's oil , or at least are on the brink of doing so .
It started with no -bid service contracts announced for Exxon Mobil , Chevron , Shell , BP and Total ( they have yet to be signed but are still on course ) .
Paying multinationals for their technical expertise is not unusual in itself .
What is odd is that such contracts almost invariably go to oil service companies - not to the oil majors , whose work is exploring , producing and owning carbon wealth .
The contracts only make sense in the context of reports that the oil majors have insisted on the right of first refusal on subsequent contracts handed out to manage and produce Iraq 's oilfields .
In other words , other companies will be free to bid on those future contracts , but these companies will win .
One week after the no-bid service deals were announced , the world caught its first glimpse of the real prize .
After years of backroom arm - twisting , Iraq is officially flinging open six of its major oilfields , accounting for half of its known reserves , to foreign investors .
According to Iraq 's oil minister , the long - term contracts will be signed within a year .
While ostensibly under the control of the Iraq National Oil Company , foreign corporations will keep 75 % of the value of the contracts , leaving just 25 % for their Iraqi partners .
That kind of ratio is unheard of in oil - rich Arab and Persian states , where achieving majority national control over oil was the defining victory of anti-colonial struggles .
According to Greg Muttitt , a London - based oil expert , the assumption up until now was that foreign multinationals would be brought in to develop new fields in Iraq - not to take over those which are already in production and therefore require minimal technical support .
" The policy was always to allocate these fields to the Iraq National Oil Company , " he told me .
" This is a total reversal of that policy , giving the Iraq National Oil Company a mere 25 % instead of the planned 100 % . "
So what makes such lousy deals possible in Iraq , which has already suffered so much ?
Paradoxically , it is Iraq 's suffering - its never - ending crisis - that is the rationale for an arrangement that threatens to drain Iraq 's treasury of its main revenue source .
The logic goes like this : Iraq 's oil industry needs foreign expertise because years of punishing sanctions starved it of new technology , while the invasion and continuing violence degraded it further .
And Iraq needs to start producing more oil urgently .
Why ?
Also because of the war .
The country is shattered and the billions handed out in no -bid contracts to western firms have failed to rebuild it .
And that 's where the new contracts come in : they will raise more money , but Iraq has become such a treacherous place that the oil majors must be induced to take the risk of investing .
Thus the invasion of Iraq neatly creates the argument for its subsequent pillage .
Several of the architects of the Iraq war no longer even bother to deny that oil was a major motivator for the invasion .
On US National Public Radio's
To the Point , Fadhil Chalabi , one of the primary Iraqi advisers to the Bush administration in the lead - up to the invasion , recently described the war as " a strategic move on the part of the United States of America and the UK to have a military presence in the Gulf in order to secure [ oil ] supplies in the future " .
Chalabi , who served as Iraq 's oil undersecretary of state and met with the oil majors before the invasion , described this as " a primary objective " .
Invading countries to seize their natural resources is illegal under the Geneva conventions .
That means the huge task of rebuilding Iraq 's infrastructure - including its oil infrastructure - is the financial responsibility of Iraq 's invaders .
They should be forced to pay reparations , just as Saddam Hussein 's regime paid $ 9bn to Kuwait in reparations for its 1990 invasion .
Instead , Iraq is being forced to sell 75 % of its national patrimony to pay the bills for its own illegal invasion and occupation .

A law that would bar fast - food restaurants from opening in South Los Angeles for at least a year sailed through the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday .
The council approved the fast - food moratorium unanimously , despite complaints from representatives of McDonald ’s , Carl ’s Jr. and other companies , who said they were being unfairly targeted .
Councilwoman Jan Perry , who has pushed for a moratorium for six years , said the initiative would give the city time to craft measures to lure sit - down restaurants serving healthier food to a part of the city that desperately wants more of them .
“ I believe this is a victory for the people of South and southeast Los Angeles , for them to have greater food options , ” she said .

The ban covers a 32 - square - mile area for one year , with two possible six - month extensions .
The area contains about 500,000 residents , including those who live in West Adams , Baldwin Hills and Leimert Park .
The law defines fast - food restaurants as “ any establishment which dispenses food for consumption on or off the premises , and which has the following characteristics : a limited menu , items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly , no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers . ”
A report released last year by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health found 30 % of children in South L.A. were obese , compared with 25 % of all children in the city .

Still , several fast - food workers told the council that the panel was ignoring the good things their franchises accomplish .
The workers argued that fast - food establishments provide residents with job opportunities and , in recent years , nutritious menu options .
“ McDonald ’s believes in healthy choices , ” said Don Bailey , who has owned and operated the company ’s restaurants in South Los Angeles for 22 years .
Another foe of the measure was Madelyn Alfano , whose company , Maria ’s Italian Kitchen , has restaurants in Sherman Oaks , Brentwood and other parts of the city .
Alfano said the law would create new red tape and force restaurateurs to spend thousands more to start businesses .
“ The intent of this bill , and this proposal , is a very good one .
There is an obesity problem , ” said Alfano , whose company recently opened an express version of the restaurant in downtown Los Angeles .
But “ I do n’t think the restaurant industry is to blame . ”

Moratoriums frequently last as long as two years at City Hall , to give planning officials enough time to craft new zoning rules .
Perry said businesses can apply for a “ hardship exemption ” if they are intent on opening a fast - food restaurant .
The councilwoman also said she expected city officials to come up with financial assistance for some restaurants .
“ This will buy us time to aggressively market the district and show potential developers that we are not only open for business , but have some substantive incentives to make it worth their while to develop in South L.A. , ” she said .

Sure , the hotelier and real estate magnate Leona Helmsley left $ 12 million in her will to her dog , Trouble .
But that , it turns out , is nothing much compared with what other dogs may receive from the charitable trust of Mrs.
Helmsley , who died last August .
Her instructions , specified in a two - page “ mission statement , ” are that the entire trust , valued at $ 5 billion to $ 8 billion and amounting to virtually all her estate , be used for the care and welfare of dogs , according to two people who have seen the document and who described it on condition of anonymity .
It is by no means clear , however , that all the money will go to dogs .
Another provision of the mission statement says Mrs. Helmsley ’s trustees may use their discretion in distributing the money , and some lawyers say the statement may not mean much anyway , given that its directions were not incorporated into Mrs.
Helmsley ’s will or the trust documents .
“ The statement is an expression of her wishes that is not necessarily legally binding , ” said William Josephson , a lawyer who was the chief of the Charities Bureau in the New York State attorney general ’s office from 1999 to 2004 .
More Than 28 % of Your Income Goes to Housing
If you are worried that you 're living beyond your means , there 's a good chance you 're right .
Here are five signs that you 're headed for trouble and need to make a course correction now .
Your Credit Score is Below 600
Your credit report is a running record of your routine payment history and outstanding loan balances
The credit bureaus use this information to compile a credit score that may be accessed by anyone considering giving you new credit and , for that matter , anyone you do business with of any kind .﻿﻿
The three major credit bureaus differ a little but credit scores generally range from low of 300 to a high of 850 .
A score of around 670 or above is considered good .
A score above 800 is excellent .﻿﻿
If your score is below 600 , it 's below the average and below the level that will make it easy for you to obtain additional credit at a reasonable rate of interest .﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
Granted , it 's not in your best interest to get further into debt .
However , if your car dies tomorrow and you need it to get to work , your options will be limited .
If you do n't have a cash cushion or access to credit , any unexpected expense is a source of great stress .
If you are n't sure what your credit score is , you can get a free copy of your reports from all three credit bureaus once a year at annualcreditreport.com .﻿﻿
This is the site that is authorized by the Federal Trade Commt﻿ ﻿
Do n't get tricked into paying for your report elsewhere .
Key Takeaways Break the cycle of revolving credit .
Take a hard look at monthly expenses .
Get into the habit of saving .
You are Saving Less Than 5 %
If you are saving less than 5 % of your gross income , you 're probably in over your head .
If you 're spending more than you earn , you 're definitely in over your head .
( There 's even a term for that : dissavings . )
A lack of savings leaves you in constant danger that an emergency , a job loss , or a health problem will disrupt your life or hurt your family , or both .
You 're not alone .
The savings rates of Americans has been falling steadily since 1975 , when Americans saved as much as 17 % of their disposable income , according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis , which tracks the numbers .
The trend bottomed out in mid-2005 at a measly 2.7 % , and by late 2019 hovered around 8 % .﻿﻿
That 's not exactly Scrooge - like frugality , but it 's respectable .
If you have n't jumped on the saving bandwagon , now 's the time to do it .
* Shaded area denotes U.S. recession
In terms of targets , the rule most financial advisors suggest is at least 10 % of your gross income .﻿﻿
Beginning at age 30 , if you were to save 10 % of your $ 100,000 annual income in your 401 ( k ) , or $ 10,000 every year , and earn an annual rate of return of 5 % , that money would grow to more than $ 900,000 by age 65 .
Your Credit Card Balances are Rising
If you pay only the minimum due on your credit card balances each month or if you send in only a small contribution toward the principal balance , you are very likely in over your head .
The average annual interest rate on newly issued credit cards is now 19 % , and the average on existing balances is 15 % .﻿﻿
It 's easy to get sucked into an endless cycle of revolving debt .
Ideally , you should only charge what you can pay off at the end of each month .
If you can't pay it off in full , make at least some contribution toward the outstanding principal .
And stop using those cards until you get the balance under control .
The importance of paying down credit card balances cannot be overstated .
A person with $ 5,000 in credit card debt that makes the minimum payment of just $ 200 per month will end up spending more than $ 8,000 and take almost 13 years to pay off that debt .
More Than 28 % of Your Income Goes to Housing
Calculate what percentage of your monthly income goes toward your mortgage , property taxes , and insurance or , alternately , your rent .
If it 's more than 28 % of your gross income , then you are probably in over your head .
Why is 28 % the magic number ?
Historically , conservative lenders have used this threshold because experience has taught them that it is the amount that the average person can pay and still enjoy a reasonable standard of living .﻿﻿
( Lending standards loosened considerably for a time .
Then the 2008 subprime mortgage meltdown happened . ) ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
Certainly , some get by spending a higher percentage on their homes and cutting back elsewhere , but it 's a dangerous line to walk .
Your Bills are Spiraling Out of Control
Buying on credit and paying by installment has become a national pastime .
As of early 2020 , consumer debt in the U.S. is almost $ 14.2 trillion .﻿﻿
It 's much easier to buy a new flat - screen TV when the salesman breaks down the price in monthly installments .
What 's an extra $ 50 per month , right ?
If your monthly income is being sliced and diced to pay for dozens of unnecessary installment purchases and services , you are likely in over your head .
It 's not just credit card debt , it 's other monthly installment debts as well .
Get out all of your monthly bills and go through them one by one .
Do you really need a premium cable package , or can you make do with Netflix or Amazon Prime plus wi-fi ?
Are you running the air - conditioner when it is n't really necessary ?
Shut it off and tell yourself you 're saving the environment .
Some of the best places to find monthly savings include your phone bill , utilities , and entertainment expenses .
Do n't Despair
If you see your own situation in some of all of the above signs of financial trouble , take it as a call to action .
Measure your financial health regularly .
Reassess your day - to - day spending habits .
Concentrate on paying down your debts .
Peace of mind and greater prosperity will follow .
A new material designed for use in microwaves heats foods and beverages more quickly and saves energy , its inventors say .
A microwave oven bombards food with microwave radiation , which is absorbed by certain molecules , including water , fats and sugars .
The microwaves , powerful enough to kill viruses and bacteria , vibrate those molecules , heating the food .
" Conventional coffee cups are made from ceramic compositions which do not absorb microwaves and hence they do not heat up , " explained Sridhar Komarneni , a professor of clay mineralogy at Pennsylvania State University .
" When conventional ceramics are used for heating food , only food heats up and then the hot food heats up the ceramic . "
Komarneni and colleagues in Japan made plates from a mix of 20 percent magnetite and 80 percent of a naturally occurring petalite mineral containing lithium , aluminum and silicon oxides .
The new ceramic interacts with the microwaves and heats up , and " the microwaves heat up the container and hence the food , " Komarneni told LiveScience .
" Rice cooks in about half or less time . "
The research is detailed in the Aug. 26 issue of the American Chemical Society 's journal Chemistry of Materials .
Containers made from the material could pop popcorn more quickly , too , the researchers say .
And food stays hot longer .
" These ceramic materials not only heat up with microwaves but also retain heat for about 15 minutes and hence the food stays hot in the container , " Komarneni said .
" Ceramic plates could be used for pizza delivery as these plates are insulating materials . "
A rice cooker and plates made from the material are already being sold by ASAHI Ceramics Research Co. in Japan .
First , be there for her .
Listen closely , and validate her feelings .
This can help her feel better about the problem , because she feels understood and less alone .
Then , if you think you have advice , say " I may have some ideas on how to deal with this .
Would you like to hear them ? "
That way , if she wants advice , she can say so and listen to your thoughts .
( Sometimes people do n't want advice , so this gives her the chance to decline . )
Also , remember that this is something that any good friend would do .
Doing this wo n't make her think that you want to date her .
If you do want to date her , you need to flirt and consider asking her out , so that she knows your intentions .
DIGG THIS
One way to make someone ’s eyes glaze over is to explain the various relationships in financial matters .
Discussions of swaps , equity , options , short - selling and the like quickly become technical and esoteric , and most people instantly tune out what is being said .
Unfortunately , this situation convinces people that finance is complicated and cannot be understood — and so it must be left to the " experts " who are assumed to know better .
Thus , the average person — the taxpayer who will be left on the hook — does not really understand why entities like " Freddie Mac " and " Fannie Mae " are in trouble , and why their " bailouts " are a disaster .
They only know that the people who are supposed to be " in charge " of these things are declaring success .
First , what are " Fannie Mae " and " Freddie Mac " ?
They are entities created by the federal government to make mortgage loans and to guarantee those loans .
" Fannie Mae " is an acronym for the Federal National Mortgage Association , which was created by the Franklin Roosevelt administration in 1938 to help further home ownership .
" Freddie Mac " is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation , created by the Nixon administration in 1970 as a " competitor " for the FNMA .
Both entities ultimately were " privatized , " but nonetheless have operated with the obviously implicit guarantee from the federal government that it would protect them against losses .
In a free market , there would be nothing like these entities , or if something like them existed , there would be no guarantee that losses would be covered by taxpayers , which has created an obvious moral hazard .
They exist because the government decided to follow a policy during the Great Depression to encourage home ownership beyond free market levels , which also meant that the entities that would have to finance such endeavors would have to come from the government .
Now , there is nothing wrong with home ownership , as it is an extension of private property rights .
However , it should be emphasized that not everyone should be a candidate for home ownership , as owning a home means that the opportunity cost for moving increases greatly .
I will use my family and me as an example .
We own a home and about an acre of property in the mountains of western Maryland , and my place of employment is located about five miles away , so it is relatively convenient to where I work .
As long as I have my current employment and as long as I can continue to make the payments ( and pay the property taxes ) , we can remain in this house .
However , if an attractive employment opportunity were to come elsewhere , the opportunity cost of moving would be substantially greater than if we were renting .
First , we would have to sell the house , and in the current market , selling it at a price that would permit us even to cover what we paid a year ago might be difficult .
Second , if we were to move without the house being sold , we would have to continue making payments and pay for a new place , which almost surely would negate any gains from the new employment .
What seems like an asset to us right now would become a huge liability in such a situation , so it is clear that home ownership right now truly limits our choices .
The government ’s insistence on individual family ownership of homes has a distorting effect upon the housing market , as it invariably creates rental shortages and then perpetuates the very problem .
Let me explain .
Because the government has created a financial system that encourages ( or demands ) people buy homes instead of renting them , there is a dearth of single - family housing or other rental housing that would meet the needs of individuals and families .
That situation drives up the price of rentals to the point where buying a home , at least in the short run , seems like the better alternative , as far more homes are available for purchase than for rent .
Thus , the incentives that government policies create also continue to widen the gap between what a free market would create and what the government seeks to impose .
( One can see that situation clearly in California , as the rash of foreclosures mean that lots of families that have lost their homes now are competing in the rental markets , which drives up rents , but that at the same time , thousands of houses sit empty waiting to be sold . )
The government did not create this market at the point of a gun ; instead , it set up a series of financial rewards and punishments .
Interest paid on home mortgages is tax deductible , while rent is not , but the series of incentives goes much deeper and extends well beyond the individual homeowner .
How does the financial system work to create the huge numbers of home loans ?
Why , in a world of scarcity ( and that includes the amount of loanable funds available for capital development ) would so much of the financial system be directed toward home ownership ?
In a free market , capital is directed toward those ends that pay the highest returns , as well as toward investments that pay a good return , but also have better prospects for those loans actually being repaid .
Repayment would come because the investments to which the loans were directed are profitable , that is , they bring entrepreneurial rewards that are higher than the sum of the prices paid to the owners of the factors of production .
When done correctly , finance is a wonderful thing , for it permits large numbers of people to pool their resources in order to provide money to entrepreneurs and to firms in order to pay for new projects , purchase of new capital , and for entrepreneurial ventures .
An economy cannot grow without it .
However , with finance comes risk .
Not all ventures can be successful , and there are times when even with the best of intentions , borrowers find that they cannot repay the loans in a timely manner — or even at all .
In a free market , the projected risk would play a role in the determination of the interest rate , as risk and uncertainty are a function of time , and interest rates ultimately are determined by the time preferences of lenders and borrowers .
Free markets have mechanisms to deal with these kinds of issues , including insurance , rating systems , and the like , and the end result is that capital tends to move toward the ends that best reflect the risks and rewards .
Such a system would include provisions for people to borrow money for home ownership , but the patterns would not be as pervasive as what we see presently in the United States .
Thus , to encourage more home ownership than would exist in a free market , the government has had to resort to financial manipulation , and that is where the FNMA and the FHLMC come in .
Backed originally by government capital , these entities have gone into the secondary markets , purchased loans made by banks and savings and loan institutions at their present value , and then have taken those loans and " bundled " them into what are called mortgage securities .
Lending institutions can put loans ( debt ) on their balance sheets because those who have borrowed the money have promised to repay it with interest in the future .
In a world in which people who have taken out home mortgages have demonstrated the ability to repay those loans in a timely manner , the debt instrument created thus has a market value .
The important role that the FNMA and FHLMC have played has been the fact that they have been a ready market for these debt instruments , which has encouraged lending institutions to make more of such loans than they would otherwise .
( I will skip the discussion of the government role in propping up banks and savings and loan institutions , as that would take another series of articles .
Suffice it to say that they are not free market institutions , at least in the manner that Austrian economists view free markets . )
The effect here is twofold .
First , it encourages more home ownership than would exist in a free market , which distorts the free market in housing .
Second , it means that capital that would have gone to more highly - favored uses in a free market now is directed to less - profitable uses .
Therefore , the emphasis on home ownership would seem to have a perverse effect upon our economy by diverting scarce capital away from those projects that would bring even more economic growth .
When one combines this situation with the fact that hostile governments have been stifling economic opportunities through taxation , regulation , and property seizures , the situation becomes even more perverse , something that became apparent during the past decade .
Investment opportunities in the United States have been declining in large part because of government hostility , and that creates an inwardly destructive effect .
First , less investment means people have fewer opportunities to better their lives , so they turn to government for help .
Second , governments that are empowered in these situations tend to be extremely hostile toward private enterprise and , therefore , tend to drive even more business enterprises away .
Third , investors then look for other means to gain a return on their money , and that is where the government - backed housing securities come in .
Because such securities traditionally have been seen as relatively " safe " because of the government guarantees , they became attractive places to put money .
As this industry grew , brokerage houses on Wall Street began to use them as collateral for about everything , and these securities were used to prop up other funds or became a financial mainstay .
Combine this situation with the Bush administration ’s " ownership society " goals and the belief that home ownership is an " opportunity " that should not be denied to anyone , regardless of their ability to pay , the outcome was inevitable .
While more and more loanable funds were diverted toward mortgages , the increased demand for housing forced up home prices , and ultimately they went up to levels which average buyers could not afford with conventional mortgages .
Unfortunately , the lending industry — prodded by the Federal Reserve System and the mortgage industry — created new loan packages to entice people to borrow huge sums of money .
Things like " interest - only " mortgages , adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , and the like were hawked to would - be homebuyers , who were assured by the mortgage companies that their properties would appreciate quickly and then they could re-negotiate their loans , using their newfound equity to lower their payments .
This entire scheme was on a collision course with reality .
The proliferation of mortgage securities ultimately drove down their value , and the constant search to find potential marginal home buyers with marginal means or credit has kept this market alive , but it was a devil ’s bargain , as the newcomers into the market were the ones who were least likely to be able to make timely payments .
Austrians can recognize the pattern of malinvestment here , even if most other people cannot .
This is not a situation into which the government can ride , guarantee the securities , save homeowners from foreclosure , and generally save the day .
Instead , by propping up this sick industry , the government not only extends the malinvestments ( and , thus , retarding the recovery ) , but also does it by creating even more new money , which only encourages people to run to the last game in town : commodities futures .
Most people cannot recognize the relationship between the government ’s bailout attempts and the increases in commodity prices , including prices for oil and gasoline .
True to form , the political classes , which ultimately are responsible for this mess , blame the speculators and the oil companies , and the mainstream news media provides the amen chorus .

The sight of a cyclist led to a fit of road rage — and a call to the cops .
Maybe , as top brass promise to help make streets safer , that message can be transmitted to the department ’s dispatchers — as a first step to communicating it to drivers on the road ?
Cyclists “ are supposed to be on the road , ” Avery confirmed .
“ Bicyclists have to maintain the same rules as a car does . ”
Drivers regularly honk and yell at cyclists ( at least at this cyclist ) on city streets , stating that cyclists belong on the sidewalk .
As tension mounts between cyclists and drivers on the street — and in the discussion threads to Independent articles about drivers hitting riders — all sides appear sometimes to lack information about the law .
The response ( according to her ) : Cyclists must ride on the sidewalk , not the street , unless it ’s an “ emergency . ”
( Because the woman , uh , requested that the camera be turned off , the phone call was n’t filmed or eavesdropped on . )
To prove her point about the law , the woman pulled out a cell phone .
She called the police .
She told the dispatcher about how this cyclist had been riding on the street and then claiming it was against the law to ride on the sidewalk .
She asked what the law said .
“ You were going in the road , in the middle of the street .
That ’s how fucking accidents happen .
That ’s how people get killed . ”
The woman was unconvinced .
“ It ’s not against the law to drive on the sidewalk ! ” she said .
I told her what police have repeatedly told me , as a reporter :
That it ’s against the law to ride on the sidewalk .
The law says we have to ride in the street .
In fact , one district manager , Lt. Ray Hassett , has gone so far as to stop cyclists en route to inform them of the law .
After she pulled in , she was asked why she was yelling .
She kept up her profanity - laced tirade .
A woman was driving her car in the northbound lane and looking to pull into a street parking space .
She had to wait an extra second because a bicyclist was riding in the road .
The incident took place at 10:35 a.m. Monday on Orange Street near Wall , across from the phone company .

Nice one Paul .
Do n't you still have the right to continue filming as this happened on a public street ?
I just thank God she was not black .

This just goes to show that nearly everyone who have been issued a driver 's license by the state of CT is barely fit to drive .
Their the driving equivalent of being functionally illiterate .
As for all the bikers out there riding on the sidewalk get off the sideWALK .
And for all those motorists who reek of impatience -- chill the f@ !k out .
Paul , this is a nice little piece .
YOu should go gorilla reporting more often .

Posted by : True New Havener | July 28 , 2008 3:55 PM
I am not exactly sure that she should be allowed to drive on the street .
And she seems like she might from time to time drive on the sidewalk so I doubt that is a safe alternative for us walkers .
And as to the dispatchers , I seriously doubt that any dispatcher agreed with her other than to say something like " sure lady but I gotta go do my job " just to get off the phone with a crazed individual who did not need 911 assistance .
She then told Paul her interpretation of the reality of the call -- just like her apparent interpretation of reality generally .
The dispatchers tend to know their jobs and when you call New Haven dispatch as I recall you get someone who then distributes you to police or fire so I especially doubt that person would be likely to have any opinion on the sidewalk versus street law .
And if you call from a cell phone , I 'm never sure which 911 you even get .
Paul -- keep yourself safe .
This one looks like she 's a bit off her rocker , which by the way , she wants you to know she has every right to sit on in the middle of the street .

Tax Dollars , Personally , I think this is news .
Far too many people ( looking at you , " Alphonse Credenza " ) do n't know -- or do n't care -- that cyclists are required by law to ride in the street and explicitly prohibited on the sidewalk .
They do n't know , or do n't care , that motorists are legally obligated to share the road .
What Paul Bass has done is show the readers of the Independent exactly what cyclists encounter on a daily basis .
So , in one sense ; this is n't ' news . '
It happens everyday .
But most people do n't see it this close .

I was riding my bicycle on Orange Street with a friend where there are no bike lanes last week .
I have a speedometer on my bike .
We were going 22 MPH .
A Car pulled up on us twice and honked their horn .
I turned around and it was YPD .
He sped past us and banked a left on Humphrey .
I tried to report the incident to NHPD and they told me that even as a citizen of New Haven I could not report the illegal activities of a Yale Police Officer to them .
She also claimed that I was not supposed to be in the middle of the road going just a hair below the speed limit on a bicycle .
Operators at NHPD and officers of Yale PD need to be trained in Cycling laws as well as citizens .
Posted by : JackNH | July 28 , 2008 5:21 PM
I have n't taken the CT drivers ' test since 1968 , but are n't there any questions on it about the rights of bicyclists on the road , and the proper respect for them ?
Is it too much to hope there might be ?
I find drivers , pedestrians ( and yes , sometimes bikers , who DO ride on sidewalks ) in New Haven often clueless .
Posted by : anon | July 28 , 2008 5:53 PM
The Mayor needs to clear out his calendar , starting this week , and have a sit - down face to face talk with every city policeman , public official , cab operator , 911 technician , ambulance company , bus driver / CT Transit , Yale transit chief , Yale police , bus subcontractor , fire truck driver , LCI enforcement official and school teacher in the City of New Haven and let them know what the laws are , and that there is a new " zero tolerance " policy for violating them .
It 's unacceptable that our public servants do n't even know what the laws are .
I routinely see cabbies and bus drivers going 45 - 55 mph in 25 mph zones .
Education has to start with the people who supposedly hold positions of public responsibility .
Next time you are assaulted , Paul , you should call the police down .
As far as driver laws go , Daniel Sumrall is absolutely correct .
Drivers are not prepared to operate deadly machinery on our roads , which is one reason why we see 130 dead people on our roads every day in this country .
Other countries have much tougher licensing .
Add to that problem the fact that many motorists are talking on cell phones while operating 4,000 pound machines ( I count about 1 in 10 drivers ) , which is technically even more dangerous than drunk driving , and you have a truly deadly mix .
It 's not just a safety issue - it 's killing our communities , environment , public health and economy as well .
Who 's going to try to walk a block to school when the public officials do n't even know how to drive safely ?
Posted by : East Rock | July 28 , 2008 6:00 PM
Ben - I often honk at bicyclists , not to be rude but just to let them know I am coming around them .
Are you sure that was not his intention ?
I fear that when I am going around a bicyclist they may not notice and swerve in my path .

Thank you Paul .
This story embodies the daily struggles of all two wheeled commuters in town .
We need more attention brought to this issue as rising fuel prices are going to mean even more cyclists on the road .
Education is severely needed .
To that end , below is a passage from the CT Driver 's Manual ( Pg 29 & 30 ) which reads : " Under Connecticut law , a bicycle is considered a vehicle with the same rights and responsibilities as cars and other vehicles on the road .
Drivers should expect to see bicyclists on the road , riding with traffic .
A bicyclist may use the left lane when turning .
When a road is too narrow for cars and bikes to ride side - by - side , the bicyclist will " take the travel lane " which means riding in or
near the center of the lane .
A major problem for drivers is the ability to see bicyclists , especially at night .
Sometimes they may be in the blind spot of your vehicle .
When you approach a bicyclist , keep on the lookout and slow down .
Learn to recognize situations and obstacles which may be hazardous to cyclists , such as potholes , drain grates and narrow bridges or roadways .
Give them adequate space to maneuver . "
Please keep reporting on this issue as it affects many New Haveners , drivers and riders , alike .
It seems that accidents are on the rise , indicating the need for an educational campaign for 2 and 4 wheeled operators .
I 'm both sorry and happy to know that I 'm not the lone source of 4 - wheeled road rage in New Haven - Thanks Paul .
I 'm going to bike home now .
Posted by : DAFeder | July 28 , 2008 7:32 PM
OK , it clearly makes people INSANE to ride in the street , and it 's illegal and unsafe to ride on the sidewalk ... is there some other zone called the " _fucking_ sidewalk " where I 'm supposed to be riding ?
There 's that cool bicyclist stencil marking the bike lane ; I wonder what the " fucking sidewalk " symbol looks like .
And would we have gotten the bike - friendly city designation if we had a special " fucking crazy driver " lane on Orange St.?
Let 's be careful out there !

East Rock ,
I was riding the speed limit in the middle of the lane .
The driver did not have the right to pass .
Additionally , honking tends to make jittery cyclists nervous and possibly react dangerously i.e. fall so , in my opinion , you should probably refrain .
Thanks for looking out though .

It 's one thing to be " right " ... it 's another to get assaulted for it .
Having spent many years commuting by bicycle at one point I think I decided that there were definately some instances where I would rather come away alive then vindicated .
And this is not to deter anyone from trying to educate people about cycling awareness .
Just pick your battles ... that 's all I 'm saying .
I wish she had gotten a police response at the scene so you could have had the pleasure of hearing an officer explain the law to her .

Is it news ?
One driver honking and road - raging against a bicyclist may not seem especially newsworthy , but as an illustration of the ongoing issues involving bicycling in New Haven is certainly is newsworthy .
Ten days ago a bicyclist was hit on the corner of Church and Chapel .
Search this website and you 'll get lots of hits and talk of the " lively debate " about bicyclists in the street .
The idea that bikes belong on the sidewalk is a common misconception that news reports like this may help to correct .
And I too questioned why you stopped camera-ing , as it is of course your right to record on a public street , even if the person you are recording is using a telephone .
You would n't be eavesdropping on the unsuspecting person on the other end of the line unless the call was on speakerphone .
Nonetheless , I can understand turning the camera off in an effort to defuse a volatile , and escalating situation .
Posted by : Esteban | July 29 , 2008 9:39 AM
I 've been riding bicycles in New Haven for over twenty years .
I know very well that I am required to ride in the street .
I know I must obey the same rules of the road to which motor vehicles are subject .
Nevertheless , I often ride on the sidewalks simply to preserve life and limb ( mine ! ) .
At various times while riding in the street I have been yelled at , honked at , spat at , laughed at , gassed and assaulted both verbally and physically .
I once came to within an inch of being crushed between a Connecticut company bus and a row of parked cars .
A letter of protest to the CT Company including all relevant information of the incident was never answered .
I once got so angry at a woman who honked insistently while passing me ( only to turn into a driveway not fifty feet ahead of me ) , that I took off my frame pump and threatened to whack her with it .
I took down her plate number and did an FOI check to discover she was the wife of a prominent New Haven physician !
And so , I often find myself riding on the sidewalk as do some of the policemen I see on bicycles in my Dwight neighborhood .
Evidently they understand the danger of the streets .
Posted by : Brian | July 29 , 2008 10:12 AM
I only want to point out that riding a bicycle on the sidewalk is only against state law in some towns .
The statute provides that riding on the sidewalk is illegal only when the local Traffic Authority makes it illegal .
New Haven has an ordinance that provides that riding on the sidewalk is prohibited .
Of course if people like Paul 's motorist could ever get organized they could maybe convince their Aldermen to repeal this .
In other towns in Connecticut it is legal to ride on the sidewalk .
Under state law , however , New Haven does not possess the local authority to prohibit bicycles from riding on the roads .
Daniel Sumrall has it right .
There are places in this world where half a brain is legally required to get behind the wheel of a car ( strict testing hurdles ) .
I have a man who works for me who rides a bicycle everywhere .
He failed the Connecticut drivers test twice .
What a feat !
Posted by : Cheri | July 29 , 2008 10:16 AM
Esteban : I 'm with you on this .
I am guilty of occasionally biking on sidewalks , especially in areas like Whalley Ave , where the sidewalks are very wide , and where I 'm unlikely to put a pedestrian in any danger .
I , too , see cops on bikes riding on sidewalks , and have considered taking out my own cell phone to get a picture so that Lt. Hassert can see why it 's a bit confusing to be ticketed ( for biking on sidewalks ) when cops are biking on sidewalks on a regular basis .
I actually do n't think biking on the sidewalk should be illegal , but the cyclist MUST ALWAYS defer to pedestrians , and they must bike slowely and carefully .
However , the street is usually the safest place , unless , of course , you end up dealing with the crazy woman who is the subject of this report .... I think she was looking for a fight , and I 'm glad it was with Paul , who dealt with the situation so calmly ...
Posted by : Win | July 29 , 2008 10:50 AM
Just a note on honking at cyclists , it expressly states in the CT Driver 's Manual that drivers should not honk at cyclists because it could startle them and cause an accident .
I would encourage everyone here to look at the New Haven Safe Streets petition and think about signing it to promote safer streets in our city .

See this is the problem obviously this lady is insane but all of you bikers want it both ways .
You ride on the street and the sidewalk .
You Cross streets at red light in the cross walk when you want .
You ride on the sidewalk when you want .
You ride the wrong way down a street when you want .
But then you want drivers to consider you to be equals when it comes to sharing the road .
I have no problem with bikes in the road or changing the law to let them on the sidewalk but the problems arisen because bikers like to be a motor vehicle in the street and when its more convenient they like to think of themselves as pedestrians .
I 'd like to see Paul get some video of himself confronting bikers in the wrong .
Posted by : Cheri | July 29 , 2008 11:20 AM
JP : I think bikers have to have it both ways .
We have to bike in traffic with cars , but we cannot move as fast , and we are usually very limited to where we can be on the road .
So , although it seems to you that we want these contradictions , we do n't .
The honest truth is that when possible , most of us try to follow the rules of the road , but sometimes we are simply not able to compete with cars , trucks , buses , etc. , who are not paying us any respect ( or downright pissed at us for even being there ) , and who really do n't care if we get side - swiped , cut off , beeped at , screamed at , etc .

JP , if a bicyclist is stopping at the light , taking a look around , then putting his / her foot down and pushing off across a crosswalk at a walking pace , how is he / she not considered a pedestrian ?
Posted by : KenCT | July 29 , 2008 11:37 AM
Yes , JP , there 's plenty of blame to go around .
I 've been walking , biking , and driving in New Haven for over 30 years .
What gets me particularly crazy are the bikers who barrel down the sidewalks in downtown New Haven expecting pedestrians to scatter like so many pigeons .
Less confrontation , more civility .

And then there are those who honk and curse at pedestrians for forcing them to slow down by crossing the street at a crosswalk in front of them .
Try using the crosswalk at the middle of the Green sometime .
This in turn encourages jaywalking .
If you are going to be cursed out for crossing at a crosswalk , why bother finding one ?
Posted by : William Kurtz | July 29 , 2008 12:55 PM

You 're right ; the many people who bike unsafely , irresponsibly and rudely do present a problem to motorists and other cyclists .
But check this link out :
http://washcycle.typepad.com/home/2008/07/the-myth-of-the.html
The writer does a good job of exploding the myth of the scofflaw cyclist and explaining why people on bikes often disregard ( perhaps " customize " is a better word ) certain traffic laws .
Posted by : JP | July 29 , 2008 1:34 PM
Anon , that 's exactly what I 'm talking about your either the same as a car or your not .
You do n't get to go from being a car when the light is green to being a pedestrian when the light is red .
You 're a motor vehicle whether you put your foot down or not .
Now I guess if you dismounted the bike and walked it across and got back on that might be another story .
Another one of my favorites is when a light turns red and a biker goes between the cars to the front of the line forcing all the cars to pass them again .
Guess what also not legal .
You 're a motor vehicle hold your place in line .
If bikers all followed the law drivers would understand what the laws are and except them but because its so confused and because none of the bikers follow the law no one has any idea what a biker should or is going to do .
Its really the biking communities fault that drivers do n't get it .

" None of the bikers follow the law " ?
" It 's really the biking communities [ sic ] fault that drivers do n't get it " ?
I have to disagree there , and I think even cursory observation will bear me out .
First off , to say that " none " of the cyclists follow the law is an indefensible absolute .
Lots of us do .
Many do not .
Others operate in the same sort of gray area that most motorists do -- rolling stops at stop signs , passing through lights that are only -- ahem ! --" pink " , cheerfully exceeding the posted speed limit , and honking at people on bicycles who are at or near those limits .
Posted by : JP | July 29 , 2008 4:05 PM
William ,
1 ) I 'm gona stick with none just like no drivers always follow the law .
Your really going to tell me you never run a red light on your bike .
You signal every time you turn , you never ride between cars at a red light , you never go down a 1 way street the wrong way or set a tire on the sidewalk .
I just do n't believe it .
2 ) There is no gray area in the law this type of thinking is why you get hit or beeped at .
The big difference is its the social norm for drivers to break certain laws .
When bikers break laws no one knows what 's going to happen .
For example when the light turns yellow i know drivers are going to speed up and run the light .
However when a bike rides down the sidewalk the opposite direction of traffic I have no idea if he is going to ride into the street if people are in front of him .
Speeding , Rolling stops , running pink lights its all the normal flow of traffic with you bikers there is no norm its whatever you feel like doing .
You can even go back and read on the NHI how at critical mass rides they hold up traffic at greens and run the red lights and these are organized pro bike events .
Posted by : Bill Saunders | July 29 , 2008 4:20 PM
Cheri , I may be wrong , but I seem to recall reading a statute somewhere that does allow police to ride their bikes on the sidewalk .
Now if we can get the police to enforce the helmet law for cyclists riding in the street who are under sixteen , we might make a dent in this bike gang thing .
Posted by : Bruce | July 29 , 2008 5:07 PM
JP , Let 's get things into perspective .
Drivers ( like myself sometimes ) actually " break " the laws so often that we do n't even realize that we do it .
Before you turn me in to the police , let me list some of the ways that drivers break the law every day .
1 ) Crossing white line while at a light or stop sign
2 ) Rolling stops at stop sign
3 ) Crossing double yellow to pass standing vehicle
4 ) Turning or changing lanes without signaling
5 ) Driving even 1 mph over the speed limit ( 25 max on Whitney , folks )
There are actually good reasons to " break " many of these laws ( for example , you may need to see around a bush on the corner ) , but technically by the letter of the law you are breaking the rules .
Some flexibility in the laws is necessary no matter what vehicle you are in .
Even pedestrians are rarely without sin .
Have you ever stepped outside the white lines in a crosswalk ?
People really need to weigh the consequences of their actions and balance safety with convenience and sensibility .
No one is going to wait 2 hours behind a moving truck just to avoid crossing a double - yellow line on Orange Street .
Posted by : JP | July 29 , 2008 5:40 PM
Bruce ,
Listen i break the laws all the time .
I speed , i never use turn signals run a pink here and there .
Im not at all agents bikers some of my best friends ride everyday to work .
Im just saying bikers ride on the sidewalk so often people think that thats where they are supposed to be .
They are on the sidewalk more often then they are on the street .
If they were never on the sidewalk drivers wouldent think that where they belong .
Posted by : juli | July 29 , 2008 6:12 PM jp... to respond to your earlier comment : when some cyclists pass vehicles to get to the front of a line of stopped traffic , it is not motivated by lack of patience .
it is often the safest way to get through an intersection , by making yourself visible to traffic in all directions , and stating your intentions by signaling where you are going .
many cities are installing " bike boxes " in the front of intersections for cyclists to wait until a light changes .
this prevents collisions when a cyclist is travelling straight through and the driver is turning right .
Posted by : David Streever | July 29 , 2008 7:29 PM
JP : Cyclists do ride through red lights during crit mass : at this time , it 's because the police are blocking oncoming traffic .
This " pro-bike " event started as a protest .
Now , our city has embraced it , and the type of riding happening is not illegal , because the police are blocking traffic , just as happens in a parade .

Posted by : Patrick | July 29 , 2008 9:12 PM
JP , You 're right about the sidewalk issue : cyclists need to get off the damn sidewalk .
It 's just as , if not more , frustrating for me as a cyclist to see another cyclist on the sidewalk as it is for you .
Some other traffic laws are different though .
There 's a growing movement to make red lights like stop signs for bikes and stop signs like yield signs .
Iowa has already passes a law to that effect , California is considering it , Toronto has " bicycles excepted " under most of their traffic signage ... why is this ?
Well , most stop signs ( especially four way stops ) and many lights are traffic calming devices , not traffic safety devices .
Bikes do not need to be calmed as much as motorists .
Posted by : cedarhillresident | July 29 , 2008 9:29 PM ok jumping in on the conversation .
As a new and trying to get in shape cyclist , so I can park the car more ... It is freaking scary on the road .
And yes I may pop up in the less walked areas .
So my guess is many of the people on bike on sidewalks are new to it .
I hope I will get a thicker skin to not do it but I panic .
Not giving up , I am hoping the streets do get safer so even I can park the car .
As a motorist I let the bikes have the right of way they have no metal around them !
Besides most more experienced bikers go faster than my car does in city traffic ... if your doing the speed limit

Traffic needs to be slowed to 15 - 20 mph , otherwise the majority of people ( e.g. the 95 % of people who are " inexperienced " or " never " cyclists ) will feel comfortable riding on the road .
Otherwise , count on a lot of people riding on the sidewalk .
The experienced cyclists may not , but newsflash -- only about 10 % of Americans rode a bike once in the past month .
If we are serious about reducing our dependency on foreign oil and putting money back in the pocketbooks of city residents -- who are currently being strained trying to pay for transit -- we need to make streets more walkable and bikeable .
The first priority should be a very basic network of bike routes , like Orange Street , with 15 - 20 mph traffic speeds and traffic calming , that enable residents to feel comfortable getting from one side of the city to the other on foot or by bike .
Four or five streets would suffice for this .

I forgot my camera but i did count the bikes on my way to work today .
Out of 5 bikes 4 were on the sidewalk and 1 was going the wrong way down the street .
None were rideing legally .
David Streever , Cops only taged along on the latest crit mass ride before that bikers held up greens all on there own .
Anyway my point of all this is just to say that yes cars should always yeild to bikes no matter what but the reason drivers get mad at bikes ia because there really is not law and order to the sport .
As you can see above just about everyone admits to doing as they please when it suits them .

Oh man ...
I just saw Paul riding to work this morning and I swear it took every ounce of self control I had not to pull up next to him and shout " GET ON THE F@#KING SIDEWALK !!!" ... in jest of course .
I 'm pretty sure he would have understood the humor but I did n't wan't to startle him or I would have done it for sure .

JP , Thanks for your thoughtful comments .
I appreciate what you 've contributed to this discussion .
Regarding the ' gray area ' and the law - bending , I do some of those things you mentioned , just like I sometimes break the law when I 'm driving .
For example , when approaching a line of cars at a red light , I typically ( if there 's room to do so ) move to the front of the line and proceed through the light when it turns green .
I am also willing to go through when the ' walk ' signal is on , and sometimes when the opposing light turns red and there 's no cross traffic in sight .
I do this , rather than waiting my turn at the back of the line , because in most instances it 's both safer and more efficient for all to do so .
Going through the light ahead of the first car allows me to get up to speed and move to the right side or shoulder and allow the faster traffic to pass .
In my view , it 's an attempt to be courteous , and not unpredictable .
I 'm in whole - hearted agreement about the danger and inconvenience posed by people on bicycles who behave unpredictably .
I see a lot of that , both as a driver and as a cyclist .
I have almost been pushed off the side of the road and into car traffic many times by people riding on the left side of the road and almost struck many times by people coming off sidewalks at intersections without looking .
I guess my point is that people pick and choose what they can safely get away with .
As a cyclist , I rarely exceed the posted speed limit .
But as a motorist , I never treat a red light as a stop sign which I sometimes do when riding .

I must say , this morning on my way up George Street I encountered a very rude cyclist .
At 7:45 am , he blew the red lights at George / College , George / Temple and the worst one , George / Church .
He did slow down but , as soon as he saw the intersection was clear , continued through .
I pulled up next to him and told him that he was obligated to follow the same laws the motor vehicles do .
He did n't really seem to care but did stop at George / State .

What was your tone when you approached him ?
What was his reaction like ?
I 'm just curious .

Paul good job by standing your ground and explaining the law to this hormonal mess .
NHPD please expain this law to your non bicycle riding dispatchers .

Perhaps the cyclist was just trying to save his own life by reducing interactions with motor vehicles .

From the State of CT General Statutes ( C.G.S. 14-286a ) :
" Every person operating a bicycle solely by hand or foot power upon and along any sidewalk or across any roadway upon and along any crosswalk shall be granted all of the rights and shall be subject to all of the duties applicable to pedestrians walking in such areas as provided by the general statutes , except as provided otherwise by any ordinance of any city , town or borough or any regulation of the State Traffic Commission issued or adopted pursuant to the provisions of section 14 -289 . "
From the latest ( June , 2008 ) CT Drivers Manual :
" Bicycles
Under Connecticut law , a bicycle is considered a vehicle with the same rights and responsibilities as cars and other vehicles on the road .
Drivers should expect to see bicyclists on the road , riding with traffic .
A bicyclist may use the left lane when turning .
When a road is too narrow for cars and bikes to ride side - by - side , the bicyclist will " take the travel lane " which means riding in or near the center of the lane .
A major problem for drivers is the ability to see bicyclists , especially at night .
Sometimes they may be in the blind spot of your vehicle .
When you approach a bicyclist , keep on the lookout and slow down .
Learn to recognize situations and obstacles which may be hazardous to cyclists , such as potholes , drain grates and narrow bridges or roadways .
Give them adequate space to maneuver .
To avoid conflict , drivers of motor vehicles need to know the rules : •
Do not drive or park in a bicycle lane .
You may cross a bicycle lane , such as when turning or when entering or leaving an alley , private road , or driveway .
• Fines are doubled for failure to yield right - of - way to a bicyclist .
• You must yield to bicyclists in a bicycle lane or on a sidewalk , before you turn across the lane or sidewalk .
• Do not crowd bicyclists .
Wait for a clear stretch of road before passing a bicyclist who is moving slower than your motor vehicle in a lane too narrow to share .
Remember , the bicycle is a slow - moving vehicle and this may require you to slow down .
The greater the speed difference between you and a bicyclist , the more room you should allow when passing .
• Do not honk at a bicyclist , unless you have good cause to warn the rider .
The loud noise could startle the rider .
There may be a good reason for the bicyclist to be riding in the travel lane , such as roadway hazards not visible to motorists .
• When turning left at an intersection , yield to oncoming bicyclists just as you would yield to oncoming motorists .
• Do not pass bicycles if you will be making a right turn .
Always assume bicyclists are traveling through unless they signal otherwise .
• Children on bicycles are often unpredictable - they cannot see things out of the corner of their eyes as well as adults , so they may not see you even when they glance back before pulling out in front of you .
They also have trouble judging the speed and distance of oncoming vehicles .
They believe adults will look out for them , and lack a sense of danger . "
From the Chaper 29 , Article 1 , Sec. 29 - 10 , Code of Ordinances , City of New Haven , CT :
" Sec. 29 - 10 .
Vehicles on sidewalks .
No person shall drive , wheel or draw any coach , cart , handcart , wheelbarrow , bicycle , or other vehicle of burden or pleasure , whether of the same description or not , except children 's hand carriages drawn by hand , or permit any horse under his care to go or stand upon any sidewalk or footpath in the streets or public squares of said city , except going in or out of driveways .
( Code 1928 , § 751 ; Traffic Reg. of 7-7- 52 , § 10 ) " That should settle this once and for all

Posted by : JP | July 31 , 2008 6:00 PM 2Unique4U ,
not sure thats really helpful as everyone knows what they should be doing .
Its just that its not really practical to follow the law .
Posted by : Meg | July 31 , 2008 10:04 PM
Steve ,
I told him that if he ran another red light , the cops would be notified .
I ride too , do not run red lights and obey the laws .
I understand starting off as the opposite light is turning green but to proceed through a two or three lane intersection as he did is ignorant ( none of the opposing lights were about to turn green ) .
He agreed with me and finally did stop and wait at the intersection of State St .
He did stay in the right turn lane at Union and West Water , which is a little crazy .
I would 've stayed to the right of the lane going straight as I have seen many close calls with cyclists in that turn lane .
The cars that are turning expect the cyclists to do so too .
I totally agree that many drivers are ignorant of the law ... heck , I was beeped at , yelled at by kids in the back seats of cars ( one pretended to be shooting ) and nearly struck ( on the shoulder ) on my 30 mile ride just the other night .
I think that cyclists who get comfortable with bad habits are a disaster waiting to happen .
And anon , the laws are black and white .
Are you telling me it 's okay to pull up to a red light ( in a car ) , look both ways , and proceed if there is n't any traffic ( after all , that WOULD be reducing interactions with other motor vehicles , right ? ) .

As much as I hate to do it , this is why I usually ride on the sidewalk in this town .
Do people not need traffic safety classes in order to get a license ?
Why are there so many idiot drivers ?
Who taught them ?
[ deep breath . . .]
Posted by : Steve Ross | August 1 , 2008 12:51 PM
JP , I respectfully disagree .
It 's plainly apparent to me that drivers do n't know what " they should be doing . "
Now , whether the types of motorists we 're talking about would care to consider any of those bulleted points is another question !
Meg ,
Thanks for the further info .
It appears that , all things considered , you educated the guy , and it might improve his chances protecting himself on the road .
I 'm glad that he was n't rude to you .
While I consider my a competent cyclist , I 've been guilty of running many a light ( though with discretion and a total familiarity of the area ; I certainly would n't " blow through " any light without a cautionary look ) , but lately I 've found myself footdropping for the entire duration of the light , even if there is n't any opposing traffic .
I wonder if that has anything to do with these boards ?

Confiscate the bikes of those who disobey the law , Throw in Sessa the Segwaying law - breaking banker Treat these lawbreakers as you do those on birt - bikes , Safety will improve .
Posted by : William Kurtz | August 2 , 2008 5:11 PM
Walt , Great suggestion ; I can definitely get behind that as long as the same rules ( confiscation for disobedience of the law ) apply to motorists as well .
Let 's take the cars of people who exceed posted speed limits , violate noise ordinances with their stereos and horns , run red lights , and so on .
Posted by : latichever | August 3 , 2008 2:22 PM
I am very respectful of bicyclists .
I also know how dangerous it is to ride in the street .
I doubt that any prohibition against sidewalk riding applies to young children , such as mine .
I would hate to see them ride in the street , and I can sympathize with any bicyclist who chooses to do so .
And there was a comment here about bicyclists respecting the rules of the road .
As if !
When was the last time you saw a bicyclist stop at a red light or a stop sign ?
They regularly ride against the traffic , wear no helmets , etc .
Being two - wheeled should not be a license to break the law .
Posted by : nhgreen | August 4 , 2008 10:28 AM >>

>>
Latichever , that is a gross generalization , and is factually incorrect .
Statistical research has shown that sidewalk cycling has an accident rate 25 TIMES that of major roads ( William Morris , 1998 ) .
Inform yourself , before you continue to argue a point :
http://www.johnforester.com/Articles/Facilities/TransQuart01.htm
Please , teach your children safe , effective cycling ; this means gradually teaching them to ride in the STREET , following vehicular rules .
Posted by : Steve Ross | August 4 , 2008 11:58 AM
Latichever , I often wonder about children on bikes as well ; often enough I 'll see parents riding tandem with their children , though I recently saw a woman riding in the street as her child / grandchild kept pace with her on the adjacent sidewalk , which seemed like a pretty intelligent way to do it .
Still , it 's an unsettling conundrum .
I 'd like to address something , though .
I see many more cyclists obeying the law of late than I had previously , and for those who do n't , they often fall into model that Bill Kurtz brought to everyone 's attention in the previous post ( his posts have been wildly great ) .
I stopped at every light this morning ... but I then ran each one as the cross - street signal turned yellow , as is reasonable .
And lastly , and a minor point solely for your edification , there are n't helmet laws for adults on bicycles .
Posted by : Fer | August 4 , 2008 1:14 PM
As far as I can tell almost all car drivers exceed the speed limit regularly .
This is extremely dangerous and puts us all at risk .
Why is there not outrage about speeding ?
People who speed in cars , are threatening us all and our children .
Officer , please enforce the speed limit .
Posted by : jo | August 4 , 2008 1:49 PM my perspective on the orange street incident : tho the pregnant woman lost control , my guess is she was impatient to park , the street is narrow , the sidewalk in front of FBI building probably ( usually ) clear .
maybe while driving she was afraid she might hit or hurt the cyclist .
she was angry & became unnerved by the questions & camera .
now she is humiliated because of her vituperative display of anger & outrage .
this is a truly a shame .
but it has certainly fueled the debate in our share - the - roads dilemma ..
clearly we need signs and markings on the roads to indicate that bicycles are expected to ride in the street .
markings will signify that this is the law and that we all must cooperate and share the road .

Most of the anger toward cyclists is caused by a driver 's misunderstanding of what the law says
Until we have a real driver 's education in place , there will be more incidents such as this .

The Supreme Court recently ruled that manufacturers of medical devices cannot be sued for injuries or deaths they cause if the Food and Drug Administration has approved them .
A 2001 ruling bars suits even when a company has defrauded the F.D.A .
Now , the Court is poised to rule on whether Americans can sue drug companies when their products have maimed or killed people .
For the general public 's right to ' standing ' , the future looks very bleak .
The Government claims the F.D.A. is competent enough to oversee the drug and device markets , and courts should not be " second - guessing " the agency .
A majority of Justices seems to agree .
Both the Government and the Court are dangerously mistaken .
The Government Accountability Office and the F.D.A.'s own science board have released reports saying the agency is " incapable " of protecting America from unsafe medical devices , drugs , and even food .
To deny standing to those hurt by medical products just because there happens to be an agency that oversees the industry would be the same as denying standing to residents of communities poisoned by toxic waste released into their water supply because the company responsible for the pollution is overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency .
It 's the same as denying standing to people killed by defective electrical systems in vehicles because the industry is overseen by the Department of Transportation , or those killed in plane crashes because we have an F.A.A .
Should parents be prevented from suing a daycare center for child abuse because it passed inspection by the Department of Human Services ?
Are injured patients to be barred from filing malpractice suits merely because their doctor was considered competent enough to obtain a medical license ?
If hundreds of people are injured by a specific make of firearm because of a structural flaw , should their cases be summarilly dismissed because the overall design was approved by the Federal Firearms Administration ?
Many products and services of every kind have been approved by one regulatory agency or another , only to be found defective or unsafe long after they were deemed harmless .
The F.D.A. at one time appoved silicon breast implants , DDT , and cigarettes .
Just in the past ten tears , at least 12 drugs initially approved by the F.D.A. have been pulled off the market after being found unsafe - and only after scores of people were harmed by them .
Other products such as lead paint , asbestos , and mercury have been initially labeled as " safe " by our omnipotent bureacracies , and many men , women , and children have paid for that kind of " oversight " with their lives and health .
Congress should undo these ridiculous Supreme Court rulings with legislation that returns to the public the standing it has always had to seek justice in the courts against careless or unprincipled manufacturers of products that harm them .
But if the Government wants to say that regulatory agencies are so competent that they , alone , can decide what is or is n't dangerous , then the agencies themselves should be ready and willing to accept full responsibility for the decisions they make .
All lawsuits for every product or service they approve should be brought directly against the approving agency , and standing should be granted to anyone who has suffered from their dangerous arrogance .
Somehow , I do n't think that 's what the nine folks sitting on the High Court have in mind .

Christopher Cox Reuters file Christopher Cox on Tuesday said he has asked for an investigation into how Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme went undetected despite repeated " credible and specific allegations " made to SEC staff since at least 1999 .
The nation 's largest credit - rating agencies failed to protect investors during the real estate boom because of sloppy business practices and inadequate staffing , federal regulators said in a report issued Tuesday .
An investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission , launched 10 months ago because of the subprime mortgage meltdown , says the big three ratings firms — Moody's , Standard & Poor 's and Fitch — struggled to keep up with the workload of rating an ever - increasing number of mortgage - backed securities from 2002 to 2007 .
As a result , all three lowered their standards in rating complex investments known as residential mortgage - backed securities ( RMBS ) and collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
Because many institutional investors can put money into only investment - grade bonds ( i.e. , bonds with a rating of " AAA " ) , investment banks scrambled to win the highest ratings for the mortgage - backed securities they developed during the real estate bubble .
When the subprime mortgage crisis erupted last year , bondholders demanded to know why so many of these securities , constructed with toxic subprime mortgages , had been awarded " AAA " ratings .
The SEC said that happened because : • Starting in 2002 , as the real estate boom accelerated , the ratings agencies did n't hire enough staff to keep up with an ever - increasing workload .
• The firms did not keep clear records for why they deviated from established ratings methods in slapping " AAA " designations on questionable securities .
• Once they rated an investment product , the firms did not track the performance of those securities closely , so that when foreclosures skyrocketed last year , many RMBS and CDOs still had investment - grade ratings .
• The ratings agencies did not do a good job managing conflicts of interest .
Instead , the analysts charged with rating the bonds were often aware that slapping a ranking of " AAA " onto a product would improve the financial success of their firms .
The SEC report backed up some of its assertions with copies of e-mails , though it would not identify the senders .
In one , an unnamed analyst complained that her agency 's methodology did n't capture " half " of the risk of a particular security , adding , " It could be structured by cows , and we would rate it . "
A manager at the same firm wrote that his agency was " creating an even bigger monster , the CDO market .
Let 's hope we are all retired and wealthy before this house of cards falters . "
SEC Chairman Christopher Cox announced the findings Tuesday in Washington , D.C.
On a positive note , he said the ratings agencies ' " problems are being fixed in real time . "
But one longtime critic of the ratings agencies did n't agree .
" There was an utter failure and breakdown of control in these companies , and the SEC failed to catch any of it , " said Joshua Rosner , managing director of Graham Fisher .
" I 'm certain there 's a hell of a lot more incriminating e-mails , " he said .
" The SEC is glossing it over . "
As for the ratings agencies that the SEC examined , Moody 's and S&P each issued statements Tuesday pledging support for industry reforms and declaring their commitments to transparency in the marketplace .
Fitch also praised the commission 's reform efforts , adding , " The SEC has not informed Fitch of any finding that Fitch acted in a manner inconsistent with Fitch 's code of conduct . "

FRESNO , California ( CNN ) --
Plans to deport an Armenian high school valedictorian in Fresno , California , were put on hold Tuesday after Sen.
Dianne Feinstein took steps to make him and his family legal U.S. residents .
Valedictorian Arthur Mkoyan , 17 , may be deported to Armenia with his family if a Senate bill is n't passed .
While 17 - year - old Arthur Mkoyan celebrated at his Bullard High School graduation ceremony , the Democratic senator introduced a bill on his behalf in the Senate .
" I 'm just excited , " Mkoyan said .
He hopes to study medicine at a state university in the fall .
" It 's really amazing they 're going to do this , because it 's going to stop everything . "
The family arrived in the United States in 1995 on six - month tourist visas , said Virginia Kice , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Settling in Fresno , Arthur 's father , Ruben Mkoian ( he and his son spell their last names slightly differently ) , worked as a truck driver .
The teen 's mother worked in a jewelry store , and the family set about living their lives , which soon included a younger brother for Arthur .
Mkoian believes that if they were to return to Armenia , his family would be subject to reprisals because of his attempts to expose corruption at the government agency where he worked .
After the family 's visas expired , they applied for U.S. residency .
That application was denied , Kice said .
Immigration wheels turns extremely slowly .
An immigration judge finally ruled in 2002 that the family had no legal right to remain in America .
Do n't Miss Academic plans threatened by deportation
The family tried again by applying to the Board of Immigration Appeals ; that was rejected , also .
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year denied their petition for a hearing .
" I would remind people that this family had ample access to due process , " Kice said .
" The case has been in litigation for more than 10 years .
Immigration experts on every level determined that they had no legal basis to be in the United States . "
Mkoyan does n't know much about Armenia .
He feels like an American teenager .
" I have n't been in Armenia since I was 2 , so I do n't really know anything about the place , " Mkoyan said .
" All I 've seen is just videos my mom has watched on the Internet . "
Watch the teen talk about how much he wants to stay in the U.S. »
Mkoyan and his mother , Asmik Karapetian , learned that Feinstein was fighting for them when they returned home from graduation .
The senator 's office left a message on the family 's answering machine .
" It gives you a little hope that maybe it will pass and maybe we can stay , " the teen 's mother said .
Both houses of Congress would have to pass the bill -- and President Bush would have to sign it -- for it to take effect .
However , the bill 's introduction is enough to halt deportation , which was scheduled for June 20 .
" As a matter of policy , we wo n't proceed with a deportation as long as a private bill is pending , " Kice said .
But the odds remain long against the family staying in the United States .
There is " almost no chance " that the family 's quest for a private bill will succeed , said Daniel Kowalski , editor in chief of Bender 's Immigration Bulletin .
" Very few are being passed , " he said .
Of the 21 private immigration bills introduced last year , none was enacted .
None of the 117 introduced was enacted in 2006 .
The year prior , 98 were introduced , and four were enacted .

There ’s been something of a Vim renaissance among the Reevoo developers of late .
It was driven initially by necessity : a couple of developers live far away and spend a couple of days a week working from home , but wanted to be able to continue doing pair programming despite the physical distance .
Latency means that GUI solutions like VNC suck , so we ’ve ended up using a combination of GNU Screen and Vim .
Vim ’s ideal for low - bandwidth and high - latency connections , and Screen lets two people use the same terminal .
By comparison , all the developer machines in the office are Macs , and most of us use TextMate as an editor .
It ’s a good product : it ’s easy to get started with ( unlike Vim ! ) , but it ’s also highly customisable — and it comes supplied with a number of language support bundles , doing everything from lining up equals signs to asking Subversion who ’s responsible for writing a particular line of code .
The most - used combinations from the Ruby bundle are probably Command - R ( run the current file ) and Command - Shift - R ( run the test under the cursor ) , because they really speed up the test - driven development cycle .
I ’ve been a Vim user for a long time , but using TextMate at work has made me realise just how much I was missing !
Fortunately , Vim is just as customisable as TextMate .
It just does n’t do as much out of the box .
My colleague James wrote about his Vim learnings yesterday , and commented :
Ideally I ’d like to be able to do the equivalent of “ run focussed test ” in TextMate , which should be quite straightforward , but that ’ll have to wait for another day .
Here ’s my effort at solving that .
In my .vimrc , I ’ve added a couple of key mappings that only work in command mode in ruby test files :
" Run Ruby unit tests with gT ( for all ) or gt ( only test under " cursor ) in command mode augroup RubyTests au !
autocmd BufRead , BufNewFile * _test.rb,test_*.rb \ :nmap gt V:<C -U>!$HOME/.vim/bin/ruby-run-focused-unit-test \ % < C - R>=line ( " ' <" ) < CR >p < CR > | \ :nmap gT :<C-U>!ruby %< CR > augroup END
gT should be fairly obvious , but gt relies on a small Ruby script I ’ve written and stored in my ~/.vim / bin/ directory .
Incidentally , I keep my configuration files in Subversion , so have a browse if you ’re interested , or even check the whole lot out :

Japan 's predominant mobile phone operator , NTT DoCoMo , is currently developing a number of technologies to create " wearable " gadgets .
The most impressive technologies that are being tested include : rolling your eyes to increase the volume on a portable music player and tapping fingers in order to switch on a DVD player .
According to Masaaki Fukumoto , executive research engineer at NTT DoCoMo , the technology linked with rolling eyeballs features sensors and chips within headphones that perceive the electrical current which is generated by the movements of the user 's eyeballs .
" We are working on a cell phone of the future , " outlined Mr. Fukumoto at a suburban Tokyo research center .
The company hopes that the wearable control technology is going to be applied in mobile gadgets that download music , play video games and allow users to do shopping on - line and be aware of the received letters from their e-mail .
Last month the company demonstrated the abilities of one of its gadgets .
Hiroyuki Manabe , a researcher , working for NTT DoCoMo , wore a huge headset which was covered with wires to illustrate the way computer - generated lines within a monitor , connected to the headset , darted whenever he made a movement with his eyeballs .
He was able to increase the volume on a digital music player by simply rolling his eyes .
In addition , whenever he wanted to apply fast - forward function he just tweaked his eyes twice to the right .
According to the researchers , the new technology will make it possible for the mobile phone cameras to read bar codes for receiving data and download music when a person just looks at the codes .
Mr. Fukumoto presented a wearable cell phone that has the shape of a ring and the size of a ball for ping - pong .
Whenever a user sticks fingers in his years , the sound waves start traveling like vibrations through his bones and into his ears , where user hears it as sound again .
The company also presented a wristwatch able to identify the tapping of a user 's thumb and forefinger in order to turn on such devices as a DVD player .
" Japanese do n't like to stand out , " said Mr. Fukumoto , adding that it is still uncertain whether such technology is going to be transformed into real products .

With falling investment values and struggling private - sector retirement programs , most people understand that they will have to work later into their lives to afford a few comfortable years in a condo near some golf course .
Yet there is a group of Americans that is immune from these concerns .
I ’m not referring to the relatively small number of successful corporate CEOs , but to the large number of government employees who receive pension benefits far in excess of those earned by private employees .
Recent pension increases have come largely under the radar .
The results are dramatic as cities and counties struggle with pension - related debt .
One Bay Area city , Vallejo , is facing bankruptcy thanks to a quarter of a billion dollars in pension and health care debts for its retirees .
Many Californians have been taken aback by the Vallejo situation , yet the dynamic there is n’t much different than the one at play throughout the United States .
For perspective , think about your retirement plan , and now take a look at how the elite caste of government workers lives in the county where I work , Orange County , California .
For instance , police , firefighters , and other “ public safety ” workers receive what is called a “ 3 percent at 50 ” retirement plan .
They can retire at age 50 after 30 years of work with 90 percent of their final year ’s pay , guaranteed forever courtesy of the taxpayers .
Taxpayers , in fact , make all the contributions for these workers over the course of their careers .
( There is a variety of ways to spike those pensions in the last year of work , one of the most frequent being the discovery of a “ disability ” approximately a year from the employee ’s retirement date , which shields 50 percent of retirement pay from taxes . )
It used to be that government workers received lower pay during their working years , in exchange for higher retirement benefits and more job security .
But these days they get it all : higher pay , benefits that are an order of magnitude higher , immunity from firing except under the most egregious circumstances .
Consider that deputies in the scandal - plagued Orange County Sheriff ’s Department — where a grand jury recently detailed deputies who watch TV , sleep on the job , and abuse prisoners , and where the ex-sheriff is preparing for a trial on seven federal corruption charges — often earn more than $ 150,000 a year , according to a recent Orange County Register report .
Deputies abuse the overtime system to enhance their pay .
In 2000 , the sheriff granted the deputies ’ union what it had long wanted : a 3/12 workweek .
They work six 12 - hour shifts and one eight - hour shift every two weeks .
That workweek was sold as a means to enhance public safety by reducing the fatigue of long hours on the job .
But because deputies have so much time off they work additional hours , which are all overtime .
Almost all OC deputies now earn over $ 100,000 a year in pay and more than 100 of them earn more than $ 150,000 a year .
OC firefighters have an even better deal .
Their average pay and benefits package is approximately $ 175,000 a year and their workload is less than punishing .
( The local fire union rep asked for a correction after I reported that firefighters are paid for sleeping .
They are paid while sleeping , he explained . )
In 2001 , the entirely Republican Board of Supervisors voted to retroactively increase pensions for deputies .
In fact , the five board members practically tripped over themselves to offer the resolution to do so .
They argued that the spike was necessary for recruitment reasons , but then why grant a gift of public funds to those who are about to retire soon by granting the retroactive portion of the benefits ?
In reality , police and fire unions have exploited the 9/11 tragedy to portray themselves as de facto heroes who always deserve more taxpayer loot .
And few politicians can say no out of fear of the political repercussions come election time .
But it ’s not just public safety employees who score what amount to multi-million - dollar benefits .
Once public safety gets higher pensions , everyone else wants them also .
In 2004 , the Orange County Board of Supervisors retroactively increased pensions for the remaining categories of government workers , elevating them to a 2.7 at 55 system ( 2.7 times the number of years worked , available at age 55 ) .
The run -of - the - mill OC bureaucrat can now retire with 81 percent of his final year ’s pay .
These pension spikes — even when they are based on false promises — are binding contracts that cannot be changed short of bankruptcy .
In Orange County — where the 1994 bankruptcy still looms as a significant discussion point during any fiscal debate — the unfunded pension liabilities went up $ 400 million thanks to the latest pension vote .
Last month the board voted to put any pension increases to a county - wide vote .
It ’s a good idea , but as one supervisor who opposed the last pension spike pointed out , it ’s a few years too late .
His point : there ’s no more room to increase pensions now that the liabilities are so high and public awareness is growing .
Just recently , however , I learned that the city of Fullerton is looking at increasing its government workers ’ pensions by 25 percent .
It ’s the same story everywhere .
Government workers live in a different world , oblivious to the difficult economic times all around them .
When asked what it is he ultimately wants in negotiations , a union leader famously quipped : “ More . ” Unfortunately , there are always plenty of politicians to give it to them .

I can honestly say that my attitude to my body became markedly better when I accepted that I was fat .
The moment I could say this , without blushing and being disingenuous - the moment I stopped hoping that someone would step in and say , " Oh God , no , you 're actually really thin ! " - my life became much more straightforward .
For a sense of how verboten the word is , you only have to recall last week 's opening of Neil LaBute 's play Fat Pig .
I 've heard a lot of people say how nasty they find the title ; one newspaper described it as " luridly offensive " .
And while of course it is offensive to call someone a pig , and that 's the point , it 's also clear that no one would have found that bestial term anything like so offensive if it had n't been twinned with the word " fat " .
Why is it so offensive to be called fat ?
Because of all the related synonyms .
Ugly , stupid , feckless , lazy , sweaty .
I could go on , but I 'm not going to give all those ridiculous , boring , thoughtless , stupid , dumbass fattists the ammunition .
The opinions of those people is what makes it frightening to claim the word , and so instead a host of other euphemistic , and in my view , often more offensive terms are used .
Full - figured , big - boned , voluptuous , curvaceous , and my least favourite : " real woman " .
I cannot stand this phrase .
It is extremely patronising to fat women : there is clearly nothing more " real " about being fat than thin , so it is an entirely lame attempt to make fat women feel better about ourselves .
It is also tacitly insulting to thin women , who are apparently " not - real " : cyphers , fakes and liars the lot of them .
It therefore pits women against women , and , in my experience , makes precisely no one feel any better .
If you need to use a specific term , to me , " overweight " would seem to suffice .
It 's direct .
It 's literal .
Fair enough .
I spent years denying I was fat , and I can now appreciate the irony .
If there 's one characteristic you can't hide , it 's this one .
Embrace it .
What does it mean ?
Does it mean you 're ugly , stupid , or feckless ?
Of course not .
It means you 're overweight .
Be ashamed of being rude , nasty , mean with your money , or malevolent .
But having eaten more calories than you 've burned off ?
God , if that 's the worst you 've ever done , then pat yourself on the back and pour yourself a drink .
If I 'm so unashamed , why am I trying to lose weight ?
Well , as I 've said before , though being fat is a comfortable , happy situation for many people - fantastic , all power to them - it 's made me less physically active , and less physically comfortable in general , so it makes sense to do something about it .
What I 've found is that it 's been much easier to eat healthily since I 've squared myself with being fat .
That may seem counter - intuitive , but the fact is that the bubble of self - hatred that you inhabit as an inhibited , ashamed fat person makes it very difficult to do anything positive at all .
You start a week raring to go , ready to suck down a few salads , and by Wednesday , some arsehole has called you " fat bitch " in the street , and you find yourself tucking into french bread and brie .
Zut alors !
Once you can shout back : " Yes , I am fat , and you , my friend , are a wanker , " this cycle ceases to exist .
Of course , that last example underlines an eternal truth .
Just because someone talks freely about their size does n't mean that it is acceptable to direct the word " fat " at them : it can still be very nasty coming from somebody else 's mouth .
I was reminded of this when newsreader Katie Derham called the Lucian Freud model , Sue Tilley , " Fat Sue " on air , and was firmly put right by Tilley herself .
I was also reminded of it when a radio researcher called me to take part in a discussion about fat people .
I was busy , so gave the name of some other journalists who had written about their weight .
" Yes , but are they really fat , like you ? " she replied , a phrase she certainly had not used when she was trying to entice me on to the show .
" Well , " I replied , " that 's for them to say , is n't it ? "
The next president may have his hands tied by the size of the deficit
The next US president is expected to face a record federal budget deficit of almost half a trillion dollars .
The White House has lifted its deficit forecast for 2009 to $ 482bn ( £ 242bn ) up from $ 407bn .
The budget deficit measures how much more the government is spending than it is raising through taxes .
The slowing economy is reducing the tax take and the government has launched a stimulus plan by making payments to 130 million households to boost spending .
The forecast figure excludes about $ 80 bn of war costs .
The budget deficit is measured from the beginning of October to the end of September .
It is possible that the deficit for 2008 will also break the record of $ 413bn , which was set in 2004 .
A $ 482bn deficit would represent about 3 % of the total output of the US economy , which is well below some of the deficits seen in the 1980s and 1990s in percentage terms .
Nonetheless , whoever turns out to be the next US president may be reluctant to enact any further tax cuts or increases in spending that would raise the deficit .
The deficit figure also is flattered by including the surpluses that are currently being accumulated by the social security trust fund , but that will soon turn into deficits in the next decade .
And it takes no account of the potential costs of a full - scale Federal bail - out of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , who have been given a Federal guarantee in the housing bill that has just passed Congress .

What are these ?
I have decidedly mixed feelings about the book Beautiful Code , but one of the better chapters is Tim Bray 's " Finding Things " .
In it , he outlines the creation of a small Ruby program :
counts = {} counts .
default = 0 ARGF .each_line do |line| if line =~ %r{GET / ongoing / When / dddx/( dddd/dd/dd /[ ^ . ]+ ) } counts [ $ 1 ] += 1 end end keys_by_count = counts.keys.sort { |a , b| counts [ b ] < => counts [ a ] } keys_by_count [ 0 .. 9 ] .each do |key| puts " #{counts [ key ]} : # {key} " end
Tim calls Ruby " the most readable of languages " ; I think that 's a bit of a stretch , but I 'm probably the wrong person to ask , because I 've learned to distrust beauty :
It seems that infatuation with a design inevitably leads to heartbreak , as overlooked ugly realities intrude .
Love is blind , but computers are n't .
A long term relationship -- maintaining a system for years -- teaches one to appreciate more domestic virtues , such as straightforwardness and conventionality .
Beauty is an idealistic fantasy : what really matters is the quality of the never ending conversation between programmer and code , as each learns from and adapts to the other .
Beauty is not a sufficient basis for a happy marriage .
But I digress .
Even if you have no idea what Ruby is , this simple little program is n't too difficult to decipher .
It helps if you know that Tim Bray 's blog URLs look like this :
http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/
200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder
This is a program to count the most common HTTP GET URL entries in a webserver log file .
We loop through the entire log file , building up a key - value pair of these URLs , where the key is the unique part of the URL , and the value is the number of times that URL was retrieved .
Maybe it 's just the Windows developer in me , but one might wonder why you 'd bother writing this code at all in the face of umpteen zillion free and commerical web logfile statistics software packages .
After all , the best code is no code at all .
Well , perhaps there is a reason for this code to exist after all .
Tim eventually turned this snippet of code into a benchmarking exercise -- The Wide Finder Project .
It 's a classic example of the culture , born in Awk , perfected in Perl , of getting useful work done by combining regular expressions and hash tables .
I want to figure out how to write an equivalent program that runs fast on modern CPUs with low clock rates but many cores ; this is the Wide Finder project .
A noble experiment , indeed .
The benchmarks were performed on the following hardware :
Sun T5120
8 UltraSPARC T2 CPU cores @ 1.4 GHz
64 GB RAM
The input data is as follows :
The complete set of Tim's web logfiles from March 2007
926 MB
4,625,236 lines
The results are sort of .. well , all over the map .
I 'll summarize with the worst and best scores for each language :
Slowest Fastest Perl 44.29 1.51 Erlang 37.58 3.54 Python 41.04 4.38 OCaml 49.69 14.64 Ruby 1:43.71 50.16
I 'm simplifying quite a bit here , and omitting languages with only one submission , so do head over to the actual results page for more detail .
While you 're there , I also suggest reading Tim 's analysis of the results , wherein he argues that some of the code optimizations that " won " the benchmarks should be automatic and nearly transparent to the programmer .
He proposes that , in a perfect world , a one - character change to the original Ruby program would be all it takes to enable all the necessary multicore optimizations :
ARGF .each_line * do |line|
I heartily agree .
Personally , I think that 's the most important result from the Wide Finder Experiment .
When it comes to multicore performance , choice of language is no silver bullet .
How else can we explain the massive disparity between the fastest and slowest versions of the code in each language ?
As experiments go , Wide Finder was a reasonably successful one , if somewhat incomplete and perhaps too small .
Tim has addressed both of those criticisms and rebooted with The Wide Finder 2 Project .
It 's bigger , badder , and brawnier , but the goal remains the same :
The problem is that lots of simple basic data - processing operations , in my case a simple Ruby script , run like crap on modern many - core processors .
Since the whole world is heading in the slower / many - core direction , this is an unsatisfactory situation .
If you look at the results from last time , it 's obvious that there are solutions , but the ones we 've seen so far impose an awful complexity cost on the programmer .
The holy grail would be something that maximizes ratio of performance increase per core over programmer effort .
My view :
Anything that requires more than twice as much source code to take advantage of many - core is highly suspect .
Check the Wide Finder 2 Project Wiki for all the key details .
The naive Ruby implementation currently takes 25 hours -- yes , hours -- to complete .
Some clever programmers have already beaten this result by almost two orders of magnitude , per the results wiki page .
Wide Finder is n't a perfect experiment , but it is a relatively simple , easily understandable summary of the problems facing all of tomorrow 's software developers in the coming massively multicore world .
Can you do better on the time without exploding either the code size , the code complexity , or the average programmer 's head ?
Numbers show girls as good at math as boys
Researchers say the long - running debate is settled : Girls are just as good as boys at math .
After checking the test scores of 7 million students in 10 states , university researchers found no difference between the sexes in performance on math tests given in grades 2 through 11 .
The study seems to settle old theories about the existence of a math gene that gives boys an edge over girls in advanced coursework and ultimately in the workforce .
" Today , we do know that women can do math , " said Marcia Linn , UC Berkeley education professor and co-author of the report , published in today 's issue of the journal Science .
Decades ago , girls took fewer advanced math and science courses , and those who did posted lower scores .
The old line of thinking seemed to say : Girls , who do n't like math and are n't good at it , should shy away from those brainy courses .
That perspective was embraced by the popular doll Teen Talk Barbie , who briefly proclaimed in 1992 : " Math class is tough . "
Concerted efforts over the last 20 years to encourage girls to pursue math seem to have paid off , the researchers found .
By 2000 , high school girls were taking calculus at the same rate as their male peers , a trend that could be interpreted as showing they no longer felt shut out of the most demanding math courses .
" Equalization of math enrollment has led to equalization of performance , " Linn said .
Previous studies have shown that girls are just as capable at math as boys , but the new research was the first to look at such a massive sample of students across the country , taking advantage of the standardized test scores now required by the federal No Child Left Behind Act .
The study 's five researchers , from UC Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison , compared the average performance of all students on the tests , the scores of the most gifted children and the ability of students to solve complex math problems .
" In all cases , girls measured up to boys , " the authors said .
The National Science Foundation funded the research , which sought to dispel the stereotype that girls lack mathematical ability and to offer insight into the underrepresentation of women in the highest levels of math , science and engineering .
High school sophomore Frances Fu of Oakland said she can't imagine a world where girls could n't or would n't measure up in math - her favorite subject .
" Girls in my class participate more , and with the boys it's the opposite , " she said .
" Definitely , it 's OK to be smart in math . "
She earned at A + in geometry last year as a freshman at Skyline High School .
Fu participates in a Girls Incorporated of Alameda County program called Eureka , in which mentors support and encourage girls to take math and science courses .
It is one of many programs in the state and the nation trying to get more girls into male - dominated fields .
While the social stigma still exists - that it's not feminine to like math or science - girls are becoming more confident about their abilities and skills , said James McErlain , a science , math and technology specialist with Girls Incorporated .
" You can be whoever you want to be as a girl and still enjoy math and sciences and be OK with that , " he said .
Despite the similar test scores in math , the gender gap continues to persist when it comes to the workplace , the researchers noted in the Science article .
Perhaps many girls are still influenced by the stigmas and math phobias that persist among previous generations .
" Parents and teachers really need to rethink how they are presenting math to their children and their students , " Linn said .
" It is equal .
But the perceptions may still impede career decisions . "
Craft is a demo running on its own minimalistic demo platform .
The demo platform is based on an ATmega88 microcontroller .
Having successfully built a soundchip out of a microcontroller together with my friends in kryo , I wanted to tackle the greater challenge of generating a realtime video signal along with the sound .
This is the result :
Craft won the Console / Real Wild compo at Breakpoint 2008 .
I will never forget the overwhelming reaction from the audience !
Here 's the Pouët page for Craft .
Just like your average 80's home computer , the entire design is centered around the timing of the video signal .
A typical VGA - based , low - resolution CRT monitor will redraw the screen 60 times per second using an electron beam , which is sweeping across the screen one line at a time .
TFT monitors work differently , but the VGA signal is still based on the idea of an electron beam .
Timing is crucial :
One display line takes 24 μs , and is followed by a 7.75 μs break called the horizontal blanking period .
After 480 such lines , there 's a longer break ( 1428.75 μs , equal to 45 full display lines ) before it all starts over .
Two digital signals are used to synchronize the sender ( graphics card , custom demo hardware etc. ) and the receiver ( monitor ) .
They are called the horizontal sync and the vertical sync signals .
It 's OK to deviate a bit from the standard timing values as long as you keep the sync signals steady .
The microcontroller is clocked at 20 MHz .
If we convert the figures above into clock cycles , we get 480 cycles of visible pixels , 155 cycles of horizontal blanking and 45 full display lines worth of vertical blanking — but during those lines you need to keep generating the horizontal sync pulses .
Due to rouding errors , we get a frame rate of 59.99
Hz , but that is well within the tolerance range of a computer monitor .
Sound is generated during the horizontal blanking periods .
That gives a sample rate of 31.496 kHz .
Of course , only the really timing critical part ( waveform generation ) is performed during the horizontal blanking .
Melody , rhythm , amplitude envelopes , arpeggios etc. are handled by a playroutine which gets called once for every video frame , during vertical blanking .
There are four sound channels in total , each with its own fixed waveform .
The waveforms are 4 - bit triangle , 50 % pulse , 75 % pulse and white noise .
The noise is generated by means of a 15 - bit shift register .
The volume of each channel can be individually controlled , except for the triangle channel , which is always playing at full volume .
This minimalistic softsynth was of course inspired by the NES sound chip .
Apart from the sync signals mentioned above , a VGA signal contains three analog voltage lines — red , green and blue — that vary between ground and 0.7 V during the visible parts of the video frame .
As you can see in the schematic below , I perform a two - bit digital - to - analog conversion for each of these signals , using R - 2R resistor ladders .
That way , the software can change the current colour in a single clock cycle using the out PORTC , register instruction .
In addition to this , I 've hooked up a couple of diodes and a PNP transistor in such a way , that when the MOSI pin is low while the OC2B pin is high , the three color signals will be pulled to a high voltage , corresponding to white .
This is used to generate high resolution scroll text :
The MOSI pin is connected to a shift register internally in the AVR ( it is typically used for serial data transmission ) , and this shift register can be programmed to emit a sequence of 8 bits with a single instruction , thus offloading the CPU .
Smooth scrolling is then implemented by inserting variable delays before and after each display line , but that alone is not enough , because characters would appear and disappear suddenly at the edges of the screen .
So additionally , the output comparator connected to timer 2 in the chip is set up to create a visibility window using the OC2B pin .
This is how it all fits together , hardware - wise .
If you are interested in the physical layout used on the breadboard , you can find it along with firmware and source code near the top of the page .
The variable 1 K resistor can be used to adjust the brightness of the scroll texts .
If you want to learn more , I suggest you dive into the source code , starting with boot .
S , mainloop .
S and asm .S .
The most interesting part is probably the cycle - accurate code in asm.S .

Wow that is amazing .
Would using 2 or 3 chips like this produce even more impressive results ?
I notice there is some horizontal jitter in the lava field section , between 1:42 and 2:02 .
I guess you are running short on the time needed to do the calculations accurately .

Wed 23 - Apr-2008 10:46 Really impressive .
I 'll be showing this to friends at KTH ( kth.se ) , and probably build one or two .
On my main lab board I have an AT90USB chip , which has to run at 16MHz to support USB , so I 'd guess that means lower horizontal resolution .
I think an Xmega could be really impressive , using its DMA engine to output high resolution colour signals .

Yeah , I 've already got it bookmarked . =)
Some day I 'll probably attempt something similar .
The tradeoff between VGA and composite is of course that the VGA signal has a higher pixel clock , but in the composite signal you 've got to modulate the colour signals .
But when one tries to build something generic , such as your console , one needs external ram , and then it's not such a big deal to add further external components .

The tradeoff between VGA and composite is of course that the VGA signal has a higher pixel clock , but in the composite signal you 've got to modulate the colour signals .
But when one tries to build something generic , such as your console , one needs external ram , and then it's not such a big deal to add further external components .

It will still have a few external 8 pin chips ( i use a Tiny13 as my keyboard controller - heh ! compare THAT to the standard 40 - pin controller you find in XT's and AT's ) , and 1 external EEPROM for storing the BASIC program .
The prototype PCB has already been desinged and should be 45x45 mm only , but it requires SMD .

Once i have a nice working version of my Console32 , i will revert back to my Mega88 and create the same Console project ( with limited graphics , since the Mega88 has only 2 k RAM to work with ) .

I was doing something similar , but I 've only generated VGA signal and no sound ... and my scheme involves two memory chips ( page switching ) , a CPLD to control sync pulses and memory , and a PIC to write data into the memory .
Anyway , props to you for doing this all in software on one chip !

Have you been at all tempted by the AT94K05AL ?
It 's a bit more towards the pricey end but soo many possibilities .
I guess the best cheap boost would be a low end xmega .
I have this half baked idea of having a challenge where you take a standard pc keyboard and video connector and add $ 20 worth of parts to make the best computer you can .
( you can use volume pricing for your price calculations though because the idea is to imagine if you made thousands of them )

would it be possible to have several of these chips work together , and specialize one chip for one kind of work , thus getting a better result ?

couple that with a homemade input device ( or something like an old NES controller ) , and you could make your own game console .

Hi lft !
I 'm very much impressed by your work !
I would like to ask a question :
Since you obviously have the knowhow to produce graphics and the VGA signals at the same time , would it be possible to create some kind of simple vga -driver for the MEGA88 in a way that you can set some graphic elements on the screen using a I ²C or RS232 interface ?
What I would like to see is a lib for the MEGA8 .
We just flash it and can do the following for example :
- setPixel( x , y , color )
- setCircle( x , y , radius , color , bfill )
- setText ( x , y , cString , color , ... )
- other handy stuff
I know that communication between µC use a lot of time , but there is no need to have an ultra steady vga signal using a TFT ?
So we could transfer some instructions and the MEGA8 would display the data on the VGA - Panel .
A couple of FPS per second would be enough .
Would that be possible ?

Hi !
The main problem with this approach is that the chip would have to keep track of a frame buffer .
1 kB of RAM is not a lot .
Even if we opt for a simple black and white bitmap , there would only be room for 128 x 64 pixels .
One alternative would be to use a tiled display , but without external RAM it would still be very limited .
Once we start using external RAM , we can do lots of things , and that area has been explored by others in several projects .

If the problem with the above is just the 1K RAM , would a larger chip with , say 4 K RAM , be enough to do some basic text and graphics ?

I posted the above question and just realized that 4 K would only allow 512 x 256 pixels , so how about some of the 8 K RAM processors ?
Would that allow some basic text and graphics capabilities using serial port for video data input ?
Thanks again !

My initial idea about the setPixel and stuff was to keep track about how things are created .
Not storing the actual image .
If you want to set a pixel you check if the pixel should be painted by searching some kind of ObjectPaintInstruction - stack or something .
I have to add that this approach would loose speed the more objects are to be displayed .... hmmm... maybe a dedicated VGA driver chip would be the easier choice ;)

I 've played about with generating video directly from an AVR myself , did most of a space invaders game as a demo , and I 've actually used similar techniques on commercial designs to drive graphic LCD displays directly from an AVR ( the timing is rather less critical with LCD's ) ...
That included driving a windowed display using a Mega128 with next to no external hardware , so from the perspective of someone who knows exactly what 's involved let me say that you 've done a beautiful job there ...

It 's for adjusting the intensity of the white high - res overlay used for text , so the text wo n't bleed ( too high ) or turn grey ( too low ) .
Different transistors have different hFE factors , which also vary with temperature , so it 's convenient to be able to fine tune the system after it has been assembled .

I 'm pretty bad at analogue electronics but you write in the description that the red , green and blue lines vary between ground and 0.7V .
But when i look at the ladder in your ascii schematics for for example red ( PC4 , PC5 ) i would have thought that when both is set to 1 ( 5V ) you get 3.75 V ?
Am i missing something ?

Yeah , actually I think there 's something strange going on , because I realize I have n't connected the AVcc pin , which powers port C according to the datasheet .
So presumably port C is severely current limited .
When you calculate signal levels , you have to take into account the input impedance of the VGA monitor ( 75 Ohm ) , but that still gives you a signal range from ground to 1.27 V , which is clearly out of spec .
The proper theoretical value for R would be 460 Ohm .
Anyway , I learned the hard way in another project : Always connect AVcc !

I have an atmega168 lying around , which almost is identical to atmega88 , but with more flash .
My board is ready and built according to your ASCII description , but I can't make it work for some reason .
Im quite new to microcontrollers and im not familiar enough with assembler to understand most of your code ( I have tried for hours , really ) .

The hex - file is uploaded and the fuses are set as you described .
But as mentioned , it does not work .. there is no signal on any pin .
I think this is because the source is unchanged , and written for atmega88 , so there are most likely some things that need to be changed in order to run it on atmega168 , but i dont even know where to start .
Usually i use eclipse with the avr plugin , so i dont really know how most things actually work .

My guess is the registries for the timer interrupts are different on the 88 then the 168 .
You should see some signals on the pins tough .
Read the atmeag168 manual and the atmega88 manual
Look at the registries on the chips
Compare them , to what he is setting in code , make changes ...

Mon 4 - May - 2009 02:31 Hi
I have some questions .
This is really one of the most amazing things i have seen , and since you have uploaded the source and schematics i wanted to build my own copy of your demo board to see if it actually works .
( I REALLY want to see it with my own eyes and show it to my friends )
So ,
I have an atmega168 lying around , which almost is identical to atmega88 , but with more flash .
My board is ready and built according to your ASCII description , but I can't make it work for some reason .
Im quite new to microcontrollers and im not familiar enough with assembler to understand most of your code ( I have tried for hours , really ) .
Linux is my main OS and i have avr - gcc , avrdude , the build - essential metapackage and so on installed , so compiling your sources went without problems .
The hex - file is uploaded and the fuses are set as you described .
But as mentioned , it does not work .. there is no signal on any pin .
I think this is because the source is unchanged , and written for atmega88 , so there are most likely some things that need to be changed in order to run it on atmega168 , but i dont even know where to start .
Usually i use eclipse with the avr plugin , so i dont really know how most things actually work .
Here is a comparision between atmega48 , 88 and 168 : http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2554.pdf
Would you pleeease help me getting started , i really want to make this work .
I will upload my eagle schematics and board layout once im sure it works , together with the atmega168 hex file in case someone is interested .
My guess is the registries for the timer interrupts are different on the 88 then the 168 .
You should see some signals on the pins tough .
Read the atmeag168 manual and the atmega88 manual
Look at the registries on the chips
Compare them , to what he is setting in code , make changes ...

Thanks for the reply !
I tried compiling it for the atmega 168 and it did not work .
The problem seems to be related to many relative branch instructions .
They did not work with 16 kb memory in some places for some reason .
I tried simply replacing them with jmp instructions , but that seems to consume too many clock cycles , so the timing was way off after that .
The registers used by this project however seemed to be the same on both mcus .
Well , i have replaced the atmega168 with an atmega88 , and now it works perfectly !
Another thing i was thinking about is the way the sound is generated .
As one 8 - bit timer is free it should be possible to generate sound by running the timer in fast pwm with no prescale and simply adjusting the duty cycle by writing to OCRXX for the timer .
Then the output from the OCXX pin for the timer could be used to simulate the analog sound value with a 78 kHz frequency with variable duty cycle .
Doing this would be easier in software and much easier in hardware as one of the DA - converters is not needed any more , and i think it would give almost the same sound .

Mon 8 - Jun-2009 22:53 Hello ,
first , I must say that I 'm really in awe , and that reading the craft source code was possibly the most educational AVR experience I 've ever had .
However , I 've got a problem with getting my own copy to work - basically , the video is there , perfectly stable and all correct , but there 's no sound .
I 've already octuple - checked ( is that even a word ? ) all the connections , resistor values , polarity of the capacitor and so on , and still I 've got no clue as to why would n't it work .
There 's a silent " knock " in the speakers when the microcontroller kicks in after reset , some interference from the video signal can be heard ( the sound fluctuates with the " waves " in the opening screen and changes completely witch each screen ) , but absolutely no signs of music - and , most importantly , the " analyzer " screen ( the one with a 3D cube and Manderbolt ) indeed shows the vertical stripes completely motionless ( save for the moment when they slide off to make more space for the cube ) .
I 'm using a new ATmega88 , with the fuses programmed correctly ( well , the video would n't be there otherwise ) , and the circuit was built on a breadboard .
Any hints ?

Hi
I have also rebuilt craft , and it works perfectly for me .
I think you forgot to program the eeprom from eeprom.raw .
I tried uploading flash . hex only , and i got the same behaviour you described .
Try downloading both flash .hex and eeprom.raw to the avr , and it should work .
I 'm using AVRDude from the command line , and i noticed i have to upload both files at the same time .
If you are using AVRISP mkii with avrdude , try something like
< code >
avrdude -c avrispmkII - P usb - p m88 -e - U flash:w:test.hex - U eeprom:w:eeprom.raw
</code >
I 'm not sure the command above is 100 % correct , but i think it works .
Good luck !

Fri 2 - Oct-2009 01:59 Hi
I have rebuilt craft for the second time this evening , and i wanted to contribute with something as this project is amazing and i really appreciate the effort of making it open source .
I have made a PCB using the open source software KiCad under Linux .
Here is a link to the files needed to recreate it ( most components are smd , but making this by hand should be easy as the resistors and capacitors are 0805 and the pcb is single - sided ) :
http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1026013/Projects/Craft_PCB.zip
Included are the KiCad project files and some other files :
* 3d rendering of the top and bottom of the PCB as jpg .
* The schematic as ps and pdf .
* The copper layer as ps and pdf .
* The copper silkscreen as ps and pdf .
* The component silkscreen as ps and pdf .
The board is 48 mm x 55 mm .
Hope this helps someone , feel free to use it however you like .
I could make the pcb smaller , but i did not have much time as i made everything this afternoon / evening .
Linus , feel free to add these files to the download section and to use the included schematic in the description if you like , as it is a bit easier to read than the ascii one .

After circuit analysis I 've found out that the 0V peak at the VGA - Sync Signals is acually at circa 1.7V .
Are there any Port registers wrong and Pins not defined as output ?

There is a known error , namely that AVcc has been left floating in my design .
Since AVcc powers port C , this will cause current limiting on the RGB outputs .
However , I have n't had any trouble with the sync levels .
Have you verified that there are no cuts or shorts ?

One question : I also tried using the MOSI pin to generate a video signal , but after the 8th bit is shifted out , the MOSI line stays high for a short time , before the next byte gets shifted out .
How did you solve this ?

I decided to live with it .
The MOSI trick is used when displaying text , either statically or in the sine scroller .
In the font , every character is eight pixels wide , and the extra delay after the eighth bit forms the space between characters .
The pin is connected to the video signal in such a way as to make it white when low and transparent when high .

Did you connect AVcc ?
In the original design , AVcc was left floating ( by mistake ) , and this probably affects the amount of current that can be sourced from PORTC .
Otherwise I really do n't know .

At first I also connected the AVcc Pin , but then I disconnected it again since I found out that there 's something wrong with the colours and I thought it could have something to do with AVcc but disconnecting it did n't change anything .
Anyway I also do n't know what 's the Problem here but I let you know what 's wrong when I get it solved .

For all you guys interested in prototyping your circuits on this kind of PCBs ( often called " perfboards " ) , a quick google search gave me this two links :
DIY Layout Creator ( written in Java -> Free )
http://www.synthdiy.com/show/?id=2489
Lochmaster
http://www.abacom-online.de/html/lochmaster.html
I 'm currently testing Lochmaster , and I must say that it 's way better than nothing .
It is certainly limited but one should n't wish a full - featured suite for simple circuit prototyping .
These two taken from this site :

I 'll be showing this to friends at KTH ( kth.se ) , and probably build one or two .
On my main lab board I have an AT90USB chip , which has to run at 16MHz to support USB , so I 'd guess that means lower horizontal resolution .
I think an Xmega could be really impressive , using its DMA engine to output high resolution colour signals .

Hi !
The main problem with this approach is that the chip would have to keep track of a frame buffer .
1 kB of RAM is not a lot .
Even if we opt for a simple black and white bitmap , there would only be room for 128 x 64 pixels .
One alternative would be to use a tiled display , but without external RAM it would still be very limited .
Once we start using external RAM , we can do lots of things , and that area has been explored by others in several projects .

There is absolutely no C - code in Craft .
It 's pure assembly language .
Try having a look at mainloop .
S , there 's a label called " mainloop " , which is the central loop .
Now , to understand the code , you need to know a few things ...
Registers :
r0 , r1,r2,r3 ....r30,r31 are all registers .
A register on the AVR contains a value between 0 and 255 .
x , y , z :
x register is two registers , r26:r27 combined
y register is two registers , r28:r29 combined
z register is two registers , r30:r31 combined , and is the only register that can be used with LPM
Instructions :
lpm , lds , ldi : these are LoaD instructions .
LPM =Load from Program Memory , LDS=LoaD from SRAM , LDI=LoaD Immediate value
ST=STore
STS=STore in SRAM
CP, CPC=ComPare , ComPare with Carry
BRxx=BRanch if condition xx . xx could be for instance CS ( Carry Set ) , NE ( Not Equal ) , EQ ( EQual ) , CC ( Carry Clear ) and a few more .
RCALL=call some subroutine
RET=RETurn ( from a subroutine )
JMP=JuMP to address
RJMP=Relative JuMP
IJMP=Indirect JuMP ( jumps to the value of the Z- register , which is two registers , r30:r31 combined )
LSL=Logically Shift Left
LSR=Logically Shift Right
CBI =Clear Bit
SBI=Set Bit
AND=logical AND
OR=logical OR
EOR=logical Exclusive OR
ADD=ADD two registers
ADDI=ADD Immediate value to register
ADC=ADd with Carry
SUB=SUBtract two registers
SBC=SuBtract with Carry
SUBI=SUBtract Immediate value from register
OUT =change the value of a port
IN=read the value of a port
Only one instruction is allowed per line , execution is top -> down .
Here 's your job now :
Go and figure out what 's going on in the program . :)
If there are instructions , that I did not mention , you can search the Web .
You may find help in the full datasheet for the ATmega8 , the datasheet can be downloaded from Atmel.com ( remember :
There are two versions , a short and a full , download the full version )
There is absolutely no C - code in Craft .
It 's pure assembly language .
Try having a look at mainloop .
S , there 's a label called " mainloop " , which is the central loop .
Now , to understand the code , you need to know a few things ...
Registers : r0 , r1,r2,r3 ....r30,r31 are all registers .
A register on the AVR contains a value between 0 and 255.x , y , z:x register is two registers , r26:r27 combinedy register is two registers , r28:r29 combinedz register is two registers , r30:r31 combined , and is the only register that can be used with LPMInstructions : lpm , lds , ldi : these are LoaD instructions .
LPM =Load from Program Memory , LDS=LoaD from SRAM , LDI=LoaD Immediate valueST=SToreSTS=STore in SRAMCP , CPC=ComPare , ComPare with CarryBRxx=BRanch if condition xx . xx could be for instance CS ( Carry Set ) , NE ( Not Equal ) , EQ ( EQual ) , CC ( Carry Clear ) and a few more .
RCALL=call some subroutineRET=RETurn ( from a subroutine ) JMP=JuMP to addressRJMP=Relative JuMPIJMP=Indirect JuMP ( jumps to the value of the Z- register , which is two registers , r30:r31 combined ) LSL=Logically Shift LeftLSR=Logically Shift RightCBI=Clear BitSBI=Set BitAND=logical ANDOR=logical OREOR=logical Exclusive ORADD=ADD two registersADDI=ADD
Immediate value to registerADC=ADd with CarrySUB=SUBtract two registersSBC=SuBtract with CarrySUBI=SUBtract Immediate value from registerOUT =change the value of a portIN=read the value of a portOnly one instruction is allowed per line , execution is top -> down .
Here 's your job now :
Go and figure out what 's going on in the program . :)
If there are instructions , that I did not mention , you can search the Web .
You may find help in the full datasheet for the ATmega8 , the datasheet can be downloaded from Atmel.com ( remember :

Yes .
Look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder
Keep in mind that DAC 's output impedance should be low enough to drive 75 ohm load , that is the monitor input impedance .
But not too low because microcontroller leg can't give much current .
I think it should be possible to modify firmware hex file and make it use microcontroller 's watchdog after the main program end .
The watchdog will restart the whole microcontroller .
Or use more stupid way : pull reset low with an external hardware thing .

Big thank you this , I 'm now taking faltering steps playing with microcontrollers and digital electronics because of the great write up you posted here :D
I have a question , not sure if you read this and answer them but :
What are you using timer B for ?
In boot .s
It - looks - like it would act like a reset and looks like if enabled it'll trigger every 72 * 8 cycles ( just over a lines worth ) .
I 'm new to this so could n't figure our exactly what you 're doing :D
Were you using it as a watchdog during dev ?
Ones again many thanks for making a project so inspirational to me :D

" One display line takes 24 μs , and is followed by a 7.75 μs break called the horizontal blanking period "
I am confused here - every place i read about 640x480@60 hz VGA timings , the display line takes 25.17 us , the front porch 0.94us - the actual sync itself ( pin down ) is 3.77us and the remaining back porch , 1,89 us .
Im pressuming you are aiming at the standard 25.175 mhz ?
Also , in your code you are correcting for some jitter or missing timing - precision - is this because you use prescaling ?

Yeah , the standard allows for some deviation , so I picked some values that worked .
Summing the values above , you get 31.77 μs for a standards - compliant scanline , but 31.75 μs in my implementation .
At 20 MHz , each clock cycle is 0.05 μs , so it would not be possible to achieve 31.77 μs .
Also , in your code you are correcting for some jitter or missing timing - precision - is this because you use prescaling ?
The jitter correction is necessary because even though the interrupts fire at just the right moment , the CPU will complete the currently executing instruction before jumping to the interrupt handler .
AVR instructions are 1 , 2 or 3 cycles ( and reading from EEPROM will hold off interrupts for 4 cycles ) .

You are right ; I have forgotten to include the decoupling capacitor to the schematic .
It 's a 10 uF electrolytic that connects to Vcc on the plus side , and Gnd on the minus side .
Its purpose is to stabilise the power supply against transients in the demand .

some colours does n't seem to be the correct ones , cyan is missing in the plasma ( showing another shade of blue instead ) or the first tunnel is n't coloured red and white ( it 's purple and violet ) for an example .
any idea ?
i checked the hardware a few times and it looks ok .
Did you connect AVcc ?
In the original design , AVcc was left floating ( by mistake ) , and this probably affects the amount of current that can be sourced from PORTC .
Otherwise I really do n't know .

Is AVcc mandatory while you are using PORTC for digital IO , not the ADC functionality ?
I guess AVcc is needed for A/D conversion and you do n't need them while using PORTC as digital IO ( which is the case with your impressive demo ) .
I 'm trying to implement your demo on ATtiny13 as an even cheaper version , but with less color depth and no music : )
Great work dude

Outline of Heart Simulator 1/6 | NEXT =>
The heart simulator under development is a multi-scale and multi-physics simulator that has never been achieved before .
We start with physiological models describing the dynamics of various ion currents and sarcomeric proteins , leading to the active deformation of virtual myocytes with microscopic intra-cellular structures , and tissue - level contraction and relaxation .
This in turn leads to beating of the heart and ejection of blood , which produces the blood pressure and electrocardiogram .

As an aspiring racing official , Mauricia Grant had grown used to working in a man 's world .
When she finally made it into NASCAR , Grant was appalled at the way she was treated beginning from her first day on the job until her firing last October .
Now she 's suing NASCAR for $ 225 million , alleging racial and sexual discrimination , sexual harassment and wrongful termination .
" I loved it .
It was a great , exciting , adrenaline - filled job where I worked with fast cars and the best drivers in the world , " Grant told The Associated Press .
" But there was an ongoing daily pattern [ of harassment ] .
It was the nature of the people I worked with , the people who ran it , it trickled down from the top .
" It 's just the way things are in the garage , " she said .
The 32 - year - old Grant , who is black , worked as a technical inspector responsible for certifying cars in NASCAR 's second - tier Nationwide Series from January 2005 until her termination .
In the lawsuit , she alleged she was referred to as " Nappy Headed Mo " and " Queen Sheba " by co-workers , was often told she worked on " colored people time " and was frightened by one official who routinely made references to the Ku Klux Klan .
In addition , Grant said she was subjected to sexual advances from male co-workers , two of whom allegedly exposed themselves to her , and graphic and lewd jokes .
The lawsuit , filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , lists 23 specific incidents of alleged sexual harassment and 34 specific incidents of alleged racial and gender discrimination beginning when she was hired in January 2005 through her October 2007 firing .
NASCAR spokesman Ramsey Poston said the organization had not yet reviewed the suit .
" As an equal opportunity employer , NASCAR is fully committed to the spirit and letter of affirmative action law , " Poston said , adding NASCAR has a zero tolerance policy for harassment .
In the lawsuit , Grant said she complained numerous times to her supervisors about how she was treated , to no avail .
On one occasion , Grant said Nationwide Series director Joe Balash , her immediate supervisor , was dismissive of her complaints , explaining her co-workers were " former military guys " with a rough sense of humor .
" You just have to deal with it , " she says Balash told her .
On another occasion , she alleged Balash participated in the harassment .
" Does your workout include an urban obstacle course with a flat - screen TV on your back ? " she claimed Balash asked her during the week of July 28 , 2007 , while working in Indianapolis .
Grant told the AP her two younger sisters witnessed racial discrimination against the official while visiting her at Daytona International Speedway in 2006 and encouraged her to document every incident going forward .
The lawsuit details a series of those alleged incidents :
• Grant was forced to work outside more often than the white male officials because her supervisors believed she could n't sunburn because she was black .
• While riding in the backseat of her car pool at Talladega Superspeedway , co-workers told her to duck as they passed race fans .
" I do n't want to start a riot when these fans see a black woman in my car , " she claims one official said .
• When packing up a dark garage at Texas Motor Speedway an official told Grant : " Keep smiling and pop your eyes out ' cause we can't see you . "
• When she ignored advances from co-workers , Grant was accused of being gay .
She also claimed co-workers questioned the sexual orientation of two other female officials .
After her termination , Grant said she went over her notes and recognized " a pattern of retaliation and discrimination . "
" It did n't diminish my love for the sport of auto racing , but the job was n't always the easiest thing to go to every day , " she said .
Grant 's attorney , Benedict P. Morelli of Morelli Ratner PC , compared her fight to that of former New York Knicks executive Anucha Browne Sanders , who got $ 11.5 million in a sexual harassment case against Madison Square Garden and former Knicks coach Isiah Thomas .
" When you try and combat a force that huge , that wealthy and that powerful -- it takes a lot of courage to take that on , " Morelli said of Grant .
" It only takes one woman to stand up and expose what is really happening behind the scenes . "
Grant said she routinely complained to her supervisors .
Two weeks after her final complaint , Grant said she was warned during the week of Aug. 18 , 2007 , at Michigan International Speedway that she had engaged in " conduct unbecoming of a NASCAR representative " and would be fired unless she changed her behavior .
She said the warning stemmed from a confrontation with a track official who stopped her as she passed through a gate to use the restroom .
Roughly two months later , Grant was fired , and NASCAR cited a poor work performance in ending her employment .
The lawsuit claims other than a previous warning for using " street " language , Grant had never been disciplined for job performance and routinely received positive reviews .
In addition , the suit claims official Heather Gambino was fired in 2006 for complaining about a sexually hostile work environment .
The suit also claims former official Dean Duckett , who is black , was reprimanded and ultimately fired last November for using " aggressive language toward a white co-worker . "
Among those identified in Grant 's suit are Balash , assistant series director Mike Dolan , supervisors Alan Shephard and Dennis Dillon , NASCAR 's senior manager for business relations , the human resources director and 17 of Grant 's fellow officials .
All of the defendants are white .
Grant says she continues to suffer from severe emotional distress , including depression , anxiety , nightmares , sleep disturbance , crying jags , headaches and gastrointestinal distress since her firing .
She 's been unemployed since .
" My supervisors all praised me .
I was hanging in there with the guys , " she said .
" I am an athletic person .
I went over the wall and faced malicious crews and competitive crew chiefs , and I was right there and held it down and was never lazy about it .
" And I knew that once I was terminated , there was n't going to be an opportunity for me to find another industry like NASCAR to practice my craft , " she said .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Financial trading and interbank lending almost ground to a halt on Monday as banks grew fearful of dealing with each other following Friday ’s near collapse of U.S. investment firm Bear Stearns , prompting talk of another round of coordinated central bank aid .
As banking stock prices and the U.S. dollar plummeted , banks ’ access to unsecured borrowing from other banks fell to a relative trickle and dealers said the over - the - counter market had become highly discriminatory , depending on the bank name .
The seizure in money markets was reflected in a dramatic 80 basis point surge in overnight dollar London interbank offered rates , the biggest daily increase since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
“ Banks and institutions are just scrambling for cash , any cash they can get their hands on , ” said a money market trader at a European bank .
“ And it ’s seen as a U.S. market problem for the moment , or a dollar problem anyway , ” he said , noting the relatively modest increase in overnight euro and sterling Libor .
Published dealing rates were unreliable and analysts said any bank that had not already secured funding further than a week or so would struggle to raise cash at all .
“ Bear ’s near - collapse and takeover accelerates the liquidity crunch and the money market crisis , ” Dresdner Kleinwort analyst Willem Sels told clients in a note .
“ Banks ’ risk aversion and sensitivity to counterparty risk should rise even further , leading to more pressure on hedge funds .
Money markets are having a brutal wake - up call . ”
As various pockets of the global short - term credit market froze , investors flocked into Treasury bills and cash - like investment to shelter their money from the credit turmoil .
For example , the three - month T - bill yield , seen as a “ risk - free ” return on U.S. assets , briefly fell below 1 percent to its lowest level in about five decades .
COMING TO TERMS
Bankers said they were struggling to assess developments since the New York Federal Reserve said on Friday it was propping up the stricken firm via Wall St bank JP Morgan , and intense concerns about the stability and solvency of financial counterparties caused dealing volumes in lending markets to seize up .
In an effort to minimize the fallout and in conjunction with the fire sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan , the Fed on Sunday cut its discount lending rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent and announced another series of liquidity measures .
But with concerns about whether other firms may meet a similar fate to Bear Stearns , nerves on every trade were jangled .
“ It ’s quite illiquid this morning .
If you want unsecured cash you ’re really going to have to pay up for it .
It ’s really quite an intense situation , ” said Calyon analyst David Keeble .
Banks led the losers as stock markets lost more than 3 percent .
Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays fell more than 8 percent .
HBOS slid more than 11 percent and Alliance & Leicester shed more than 7 percent .
Shares in Lehman Brothers dropped as much as 46 percent before ending the day down 19 percent in U.S. trading .
“ There ’s turmoil in all markets after Bear Stearns , ” said BNP Paribas strategist Edmund Shing .
“ Everyone ’s asking : Who ’s next ?
Is there a Bear Stearns in Europe ?
Could investment banks start to fail ? ”
The problem was said to be particularly acute in sterling markets , with the gap between indicative three - month interbank borrowing rates and the Bank of England loans more than 70 basis points -- the highest for the year .
Some analysts said major players on the interbank market had been doing as little as 700 million pounds a day of business over the past week , a fraction of the several billions that would have been executed a year ago , and far less on Monday .
“ Counterparty risk is back in play , every trade is being scrutinized ahead of time , ” one interest rate trader said . “
The stress in the market forced the UK central bank to make an emergency offer of five billion pounds of three - day funds .
“ This action is being taken in response to conditions in the short - term money markets this morning , ” the bank said in a statement .
“ Along with other central banks , the Bank of England is closely monitoring market conditions . ”
For policy - makers and traders looking for encouraging signs in the credit market , at least in the United States , the yield spread on two - year interest rate swaps over Treasuries , a gauge of risk aversion , shrank to its tightest since mid-February .
U.S. federal funds , or overnight loans on surplus bank reserves , fell to 2.00 percent in late trading , more than a full percentage point below their session high of 3.5 percent .
PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE
Three - month euro interbank rates were also some 65 basis points above ECB rates , compared with around 40 basis points at the start of the month .
The spread reached a peak of around 90 at the end of last year .
Dollar spreads were also wider than on Friday but heavy discounting of further Fed rate cuts have meant the spread has actually narrowed this month to around 65 versus 80 basis points at the start of March .
The European Central Bank declined to comment , even though speculation of coordinated central bank statements , liquidity injections and even synchronized rate cuts circulated around markets .
A German Finance Ministry spokesman said no extraordinary meetings of the Group of Seven economic powers was planned .
“ We ’re watching developments very closely in the United States . ”
But International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn said the global financial markets crisis was worsening and risk of contagion was increasing .
With the dollar sliding to record lows , traders said currency options markets were seizing up too , another reflection of the state of panic and fear that appears to be dominating all financial markets .
Implied volatilities on FX options , a measure of expected volatility in the underlying asset price and investors ’ demand to protect themselves against these moves , soared on Monday .
As the dollar sank to 13 - year lows against the yen further below 100 yen , one - week dollar / yen implied “ vols ” jumped to 25 percent , a level not seen since 1999 .
“ This is a market where you should be on your guard .
Shorting options is quite a difficult position to manage , ” said the senior FX trader in Tokyo .
This past weekend my niece and I were discussing our personal self improvement goals , and reasonable expectations for the foreseeable future .
One of my goals for the next couple of weeks is to lose five pounds .
I told her , to her dismay , that , at best , I would expect to have about ten good years left in me .
I was a heavy smoker and drinker ( alcoholic ) from the age of sixteen to forty .
My foreseeable future is defined by my past .
Which brings us to the subject matter of my new blog .
I have always had a Peter Pan complex ; I honestly believe that I am still " growing up " .
However , all too often reality rears its ugly head .
The other day I was able to ride my bicycle thirty miles in the New Hampshire hills .
Fifty miles may have been possible , one hundred , a " century " , is only a fantasy .
I love to eat , but I know I need to lose weight .
I no longer drink alcohol , but I am addicted to coffee and only recently have begun to " kick " soda .
My iced tea is herbal , but I have n't thrown out the black teas .
Green vegetables are often an afterthought on the dinner menu and plate , but I am growing a garden this year .
My lettuce crop was a success .
I have used up all the old bottles of salad dressing and am now on extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar .
So , as I was outlining the general theme for my blog , I searched for a mentor , a philosophical foundation to guide me through my golden years , and this blog .
I found one !
Epicurus ( Greek Έπίκουρο ς) ( 341 BCE , Samos – 270 BCE , Athens ) was an ancient Greek philosopher and the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism .
For Epicurus , the purpose of philosophy was to attain a happy , tranquil state of existence .
This could be achieved by living a self - sufficient life surrounded by friends .
Epicurus once observed , " The art of living well and the art of dying well are one . "
In modern popular usage , an epicure is a connoisseur of the arts of life and the refinements of sensual pleasures ; epicureanism implies a love or knowledgeable enjoyment especially of good food and drink .
This is not the case in Epicureanism .
Epicurus regarded ataraxia ( tranquility , freedom from fear ) and aponia ( absence of pain ) as the height of happiness .
He also considered prudence an important virtue and perceived excess and overindulgence to be contrary to the attainment of ataraxia and aponia .
He argued that when eating , one should not eat too richly , for it could lead to dissatisfaction later , such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future .
The beauty of choosing Epicurus as my guide is that very little of his original writings remain .
I can pretty much cherry pick what I want and not worry that someone will quote an obscure passage from long lost book 88 , chapter 312 and blow me away .
He comes highly recommended :
His emphasis on minimizing harm and maximizing happiness in his formulation of the Ethic of Reciprocity was later picked up by the democratic thinkers of the French Revolution .
Others , like John Locke , wrote that people had a right to " life , liberty , and property . "
This triad , as well as the egalitarianism of Epicurus , was carried forward into the American freedom movement and Declaration of Independence , by the American founding father , Thomas Jefferson , as " all men are created equal " and endowed with certain " inalienable rights such as life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . "
I am particularly attracted by his notion of living a self - sufficient life surrounded by friends .
We are in for some tough times .
I am not a pessimist , but rising fuel and food prices in combination with plummeting property values will shrink the middle class .
Welcome to the world of my childhood .
When the doorbell rang it was often Sears , Roebuck looking to repossess our purchases .
My Mom always had a bag of rags ready to hand them .
She would say : " Oh , you must be looking for the dungarees " , toss them the bag and close the door .
The earliest known precursor to jeans is the Indian export of a thick cotton cloth , in the 16th century , known as dungaree .
Dyed in indigo , it was sold near the Dongarii Fort near Bombay .
Sailors cut it to suit them ; but that 's a story for another day .
I know that the masses are hoping that the changing of the guard through the upcoming US presidential elections will right the ship of state .
Young evangelicals are singing the praises of Barack Obama as if he is the second coming of John the Baptist .
I will never bet all my chips on God , or politicians .
The opinion of the crowd is , Epicurus claims , that the gods " send great evils to the wicked and great blessings to the righteous who model themselves after the gods , " when in reality the gods do not concern themselves at all with human beings .
Difficult economic times ahead .
Hunker down .
But live well .
Welcome to Epicurean Health .
We will discuss issues that can help us become more self reliant .
And happy !
I have started slow , so jump on board to either catch up quickly or help me out !
I have my garden .
I am drying my basil , but there must be a better way than hanging it on chopsticks held down by spice jars .
What does it mean when some leaves turn dark while others remain green ?
I just bought a large pot for canning , but I am looking for the new Ball Guide to canning .
Do I really need the new one or can I buy the ten year old copy from the thrift shop ?
I 'll be on the path to lose weight , but I have no intentions of dieting .
I 'll learn to eat healthy and exercise more .
I want to develop alternative sources of income .
Our ultimate goal will be to attain a happy , tranquil state of existence .
" The art of living well and the art of dying well are one . "

Whether they are made of pork , as is most often the case , or of beef , veal , buck , goat , chamois , venison , sheep , wild boar , or horse , cured meats ( salumi in Italian ) were born of a need to conserve meat for months after the slaughter of the animal .
Salting , smoking , and air - drying are the three processes by which fresh meat is transformed into a long - keeping staple .
While all meats are salted , some are smoked , and others are simply air - dried .
Italians have been making an amazing array of cured meats for thousands of years using both noble and humble parts of the animals they raise .
The ancient Romans prized the spicy pork sausages crafted in the southern region of Basilicata ( called Lucania then , and giving rise to sausages named Lucaniche still eaten today ) .
And , fond of intensely tasty foods , they smoked or salted whole pig thighs , yielding savory Prosciutti not unlike those still made in mountain villages across Italy .
Two thousand years later , pork remains Italy 's favorite meat for curing .
Pigs are especially prevalent in areas where there is a notable cheesemaking tradition : after all , wherever there is cheese , there is excess whey , which , combined with bran and corn , becomes perfect feed for pigs .
Come back often to see what these piglets are discussing .
Pork may be on the menu .
Menu changes frequently .

Global Research
July 30 , 2008
Operating with little ethical oversight , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has been tapping cutting - edge advances in neuroscience , computers and robotics in a quest to build the " perfect warfighter . "
DARPA , the Pentagon agency that brought us the internet , are now searching for the means to militarize the human mind itself , viewed as the ultimate platform for imperialist domination and social control .
Dovetailing precisely with other projects to " dominate " the urban " battlespace " of global south and " homeland " cities , DARPA researchers are stretching moral boundaries where clear distinctions between " human " and " machine " are being consciously blurred .
( see " Simulating Urban Warfare " and " America ’s Cyborg Warriors " )
As the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics warns ,
The right of a person to liberty , autonomy , and privacy over his or her own intellect is situated at the core of what it means to be a free person .
This principle is what gives life to some of our most well - established and cherished rights .
Today , as new drugs and other technologies are being developed for augmenting , monitoring , and manipulating mental processes , it is more important than ever to ensure that our legal system recognizes and protects cognitive liberty as a fundamental right .
( CCLE , " Frequently Asked Questions , " September 15 , 2003 )
Not only is the right to " liberty , autonomy , and privacy " being undermined by militarizing the life sciences , but the legal system itself is ill - equipped to deal with advances–and emerging threats –to " cognitive liberty " as America ’s corporatist surveillance state seek new means to elicit compliance and control over individuals as biological science is securitized under the rubric of " national security . "
In Mind Wars : Brain Research and National Defense ( Dana Press , 2006 ) , bioethicist Jonathan Moreno lays out a frightening scenario where various Pentagon agencies with DARPA leading the charge , have been funding neuroscientific and biological research in the following areas :
Mind - machine interfaces , also called " neural prosthetics . "
Living robots " whose movements can be controlled via brain implants .
Research has successfully been carried out on " roborats " and " robodogs " for mine clearing and other dubious purposes .
" Cognitive feedback helmets " that provide commanders or their medical surrogates the ability to remotely view an individual soldiers ’ mental state .
MRI and fMRI technologies for what has been called " brain fingerprinting " as an interrogation tool or airport screening for " terrorists . "
So - called " non-lethal " pulse weapons and other neurodisruptors for deployment in global south or " homeland " cities as " riot control " tools .
" Neuroweapons " that use biological agents to stimulate the release of neurotoxins .
Research into concocting new pharmaceuticals that inhibit the urge to eat , sleep , suppress fear , or repress psychological inhibitions against killing .
With a multibillion dollar budget and dozens of projects in the pipeline , DARPA ’s Defense Sciences Office ( DSO ) are looking for newer and ever - more insidious means " to harness biology " for military applications .
A short list of DSO projects include the following :
* Biological Sensory Structure Emulation ( BioSenSE ) , a program " designed around the concept of understanding biological sensory structures through advanced characterization and emulating , or transferring , this knowledge to the creation of superior synthetic sensors . "
The majority of biological stimuli are deemed of " great military relevance " by Darpacrats .
* Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System ( CTTWS ) , the intent of which is to integrate " advances in technology and biology " for a " soldier - portable " visual threat detection device that will utilized " cognitive visual processing algorithms " and " operator neural signature detection . "
* Fundamental Laws of Biology ( FLB ) , is described as a mathematical modeling program that " will impact DoD and national security by developing a rational and predictive basis for doing biological research to combat bioterrorism , maintain healthy personnel , and discover new vaccines and medicines " –or to facilitate the design of new biological weapons .
* Nano Air Vehicle ( NAV ) , described by program managers as as a project that " will develop and demonstrate an extremely small ( less than 7.5 cm ) , ultra - lightweight ( less than 10 grams ) air vehicle system with the potential to perform indoor and outdoor military missions .
The program will explore novel , bio-inspired , conventional and unconventional configurations to provide the warfighter with unprecedented capability for urban mission operations . "
Paging John Anderton , white courtesy telephone !
* Neovision " will pursue an integrated approach to the object recognition pathway in the brain .
This fundamental biological research will be accomplished using methods intentionally geared toward computational and modeling approaches that are amenable to hardware - and software - based implementations . "
* Peak Soldier Performance ( PSP ) is designed to " create technologies that allow the warfighter to maintain peak physical and cognitive performance despite the harsh battlefield environment . "
In other words , develop drugs and nutrients for a " more efficient " soldier .
* Preventing Sleep Deprivation ( PSD ) is described as seeking to " enhance operational performance , " under harsh conditions .
Current approaches " under investigation " include " novel pharmaceuticals that enhance neural transmission , nutraceuticals that promote neurogenesis , cognitive training , and devices such as transcranial magnetic stimulation . "
* Training Superiority ( DARWARS ) , a suite of programs directly tying the military - industrial and entertainment complexes together into a seamless web .
DARWARS seeks to provide " continuously available , on - demand , mission - level training for all forces at all echelons .
Specifically , the program is developing , in areas of high military importance , new kinds of cognitive training systems that include elements of human - tutor interactions and the emotional involvement of computer games coupled with the feedback of Combat Training Center learning . "
Continuous " on - demand training anywhere , anytime , for everyone . "
As with all dual - use research conducted by the agency , military relevance trump all other considerations .
One need only examine the use of psychological research in the " war on terror " for some very troubling analogies .
AugCog
If behavioral psychology was handmaid to the horrors perpetrated at Guantánamo Bay , Abu Ghraib and CIA transnational " black sites , " what new nightmares are in store for humanity when advances in neuroscience , complex computer algorithms and a secretive national security state enter stage ( far ) right ?
Let ’s take a look .
Amy Kruse , Ph.D. , is described on DARPA ’s website as the creator of the concept of " operational neuroscience , " designing programs that " are helping transform neuroscience from a laboratory discipline to one that is doing advanced research to deliver revolutionary capabilities important to our warfighters . "
DSO ’s " Training and Human Effectiveness " brief claims this suite of programs is " revolutionizing training … for everyone , anywhere , and at any time . "
Kruse ’s area of expertise is " AugCog " or augmented cognition , a subset of neuroscientific research seeking models for a " brain - machine interface . "
Described by the Augmented Cognition International Society ( ACI ) as
an emerging field of science that seeks to extend a user ’s abilities via computational technologies , which are explicitly designed to address bottlenecks , limitations , and biases in cognition and to improve decision making capabilities .
The goal of AugCog science and technology is to develop computational methods and neurotech tools that can account for and accommodate information processing bottlenecks inherent in human - system interaction ( e.g. , limitations in attention , memory , learning , comprehension , visualization abilities , and decision making ) .
( " What is Augmented Cognition ? " ACI , no date ) [ emphasis added ]
According to DARPA ’s description of the program , Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress ( AugCog ) :
Military operators must frequently perform cognitively demanding tasks in stressful environments .
The AugCog Program has developed technologies to mitigate sensory or cognitive overload and restore operational effectiveness by extending the information management capacity of the warfighter .
This is accomplished through closed - loop computational systems that adapt to the state of the warfighter and thereby significantly improve performance .
The exploitation of human and other biological systems by DARPA raise profoundly troubling questions of how these security - related applications will be used by the United States to achieve global dominance at any and all cost .
A recent article in Military Geospatial Technology reveal the technophilic preoccupations that obsess securocrats .
Imagine a computer that can read human brain waves to assess the lay of the land .
It might seem futuristic , but that ’s what the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) and the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency [ NGA ] had partially in mind when they awarded contracts under DARPA ’s Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology ( URGENT ) program .
( Cheryl Gerber , " Seeing with Your Brain , " Military Geospatial Technology , Vol. 6 , Issue 3 , June 5 , 2008 )
One of URGENT ’s " prime contractors , major defense grifter Lockheed Martin , call their " approach to the program Object Recognition via Brain - inspired Technology , " ( ORBIT ) .
In conjunction with DARPA ’s URGENT program , the AugCog project is based on brain - inspired software that seeks to merge neuroscience with computers to create a technology that promises to deliver " situational awareness " to the " warfighter . "
But building complex 3 - D mapping systems is merely the initial jump - off point for what may come once " brain - inspired " algorithms are " perfected . "
One " product " that currently aids the " warfighter " and " counterterrorist " officials is called Signature Analyst , designed by corporate grifter SPADAC , a McClean , Virginia defense contractor with close ties to the Department of Homeland Security and the the NGA .
According to SPADAC ’s website , Signature Analyst
delivers enhanced objectivity by discerning subtle yet powerful and actionable insights , maximizing likelihood of success .
Combining predictive analytics with spatial information as well as human terrain and social networking elements , the solution delivers effective consequence modeling and improved confidence in decisions for a range of global operational and business challenges .
The program claims it provides " situational awareness " by " finding commonalities " and " relationships " in distinct , seemingly disparate data sources , including past events , as well as " human terrain " and " social networking " information .
As we have described previously , Scaleable Social Network Analysis was a data - mining tool designed by DARPA ’s Total Information Awareness office that worked in tandem with the National Security Agency ’s illegal spying programs .
One shudders to imagine what " consequences " DARPA and their corporate " partners " are " modeling . "
A commercial version of the " product " is in the works .
One " benefit " of the Signature Analyst software trumpeted by SPADAC is that will " allow fewer analysts to evaluate more data in less time . "
Why its the perfect " predictive " tool for the current capitalist downturn !
Carrying the mechanistic human / machine model a step further , Lockheed Martin and their " partner " Numenta , a California - based software company , are working on applications for the Defense Department .
According to Numenta ’s website , company founder Jeff Hawkins , author of the 2004 book On Intelligence , has " a deep interest in neuroscience and theories of the neocortex . "
We bet he does !
Indeed , Hawkins ’ team has designed a suite of software applications , the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing ( NuPIC ) , based on what it calls " hierarchical temporal memory ( HTM ) , " a " computing paradigm " that mimics the structure and function of the human neocortex , the area of the brain that handles high - level thought .
John Darvill ORBIT ’s chief investigator described Lockheed ’s relationship with Numenta to Military Geospatial Technology thusly : " Lockheed has been involved with Numenta technology for two years and is a member of the Numenta Partner Program for technical interchange .
We have a collaborative technical relationship with Numenta .
We use their technology , modify it and apply it . "
How ?
According to Numenta CEO Donna Dubinsky , HTM is designed to " be good at what the human brain can do–inference and pattern recognition even in the presence of noise . "
In a similar fashion , HTM " learns a model of the world " Dubinsky elaborated , " by exposure through its senses .
In the same way , our software is self - learning and has to be exposed to the material that it has to learn .
So we train the software .
For example , we expose it to a lot of tanks so it learns tank - ness . "
And if the software could be applied to an interrogation archetype , will it then " self - learn " how to " model " a sensory deprivation or psychological torture regimen , individually tailored to an " illegal enemy combatant " after it has been " exposed to the material " ?
Will the software in other words , be exposed " to a lot of torture so it learns torture - ness " ?
Technological dual - use is a slippery slope towards atrocity and unimaginable horror , especially if left in the hands of American militarists .
Back to the Future
Here precisely , lies the crux of the problem of exploiting neuroscience and robotics in a quest for newer and ever more insidious military applications .
The potential of neurologically interactive technologies to " enhance " human capabilities , indeed to invade the privacy of human thought , and infringe on the independence of our minds for " reasons of state , " transform biological / medical research into a subset of weapons development .
To be sure , science , and in particular the cognitive sciences , have been seduced by the Pentagon and the CIA in the past .
The literature on unethical CIA and Army research into quixotic quests for " mind control " over " enemy " agents and " target " populations –MKULTRA and their perverse offspring–are replete with the horror stories of their abused victims .
Indeed , MKULTRA became the ideologically - charged basis for current interrogation and torture practices by the CIA , the military and their " outsourced " partners .
A perusal of the Company ’s seminal interrogation manuals , KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation and the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983 drew liberally from the most up - to - date cognitive research of its time .
Indeed , many of the sources cited in KUBARK and HRE were leading behavioral psychologists and psychiatrists " under contract " to the CIA , as documented by historians and researchers John Marks ( The Search for the Manchurian Candidate ) , Alfred W. McCoy ( A Question of Torture ) and Christopher Simpson ( Science of Coercion ) .
Indeed , as Simpson avers in Science of Coercion , the Human Ecology Fund , a CIA cut - out funneling money to prestigious academics such as Albert Biderman , underwrote research on " captivity behavior " and the efficacy " of drugs , electroshock , violence , and other coercive techniques during interrogation of prisoners . "
Fast forward to the present .
As anthropologist Hugh Gusterson writes regarding current Pentagon interest in neuroscientific research today ,
individual scientists will tell themselves that , if they do n’t do the research , someone else will .
Research funding will be sufficiently dominated by military grant makers that it will cause some scientists to choose between accepting military funding or giving up their chosen field of research .
And the very real dual - use potential of these new technologies ( the same brain implant can create a robosoldier or rehabilitate a Parkinson ’s disease sufferer ) will allow scientists to tell themselves that they are " really " working on health technologies to improve the human lot , and the funding just happens to come from the Pentagon .
( " The Militarization of Neuroscience , " Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , 9 April 2007 )
In the final analysis , DARPA , the Pentagon agency that brought us the internet , are now searching for the means to militarize the human mind itself , viewed as the ultimate platform for imperialist domination and social control .

Two years after it was bulldozed , the 14 - acre Los Angeles community garden known as the South Central Farm is being developed for a clothing chain with strong ties to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
Forever 21 , one of the city ’s fastest - growing women ’s apparel businesses , wants to operate a warehouse and distribution center on the site owned by real estate developer Ralph Horowitz .
Supporters of the garden -- still angry that Horowitz tore it up despite support from such Hollywood luminaries as Daryl Hannah and Danny Glover -- have been trying for weeks to kill the proposed project by demanding more rigorous environmental review .
Villaraigosa , who championed the farm ’s preservation two years ago , is staying out of the latest fight .
Advertisement
He has received nearly $ 1.3 million in contributions and commitments from Forever 21 and its executives over the past two years for initiatives ranging from tree plantings to his own reelection campaign .
That relationship troubles the activist known as Tezozomoc , who has used noisy protests and persistent lobbying to try to protect the land from development .
Tezozomoc called Villaraigosa ’s relationship with Forever 21 “ distressing for the community ” and voiced doubts about the sincerity of the mayor ’s effort to save the farm two years ago .
Villaraigosa spokesman Matt Szabo said that the mayor did “ absolutely everything he could ” to save the farm in 2006 , but that Horowitz was unwilling to make a deal .
Szabo said the mayor has no opinion on the level of environmental review needed for the proposed Forever 21 project .
“ It ’s being treated like every other proposed project in the city , ” he said .
Advertisement
The proposal for Forever 21 is the latest event in a 22 - year political saga over a site once filled with cactus , fruit trees and vegetable gardens .
The effort to preserve it drew worldwide attention two years ago , attracting celebrities such as folk singer Joan Baez and serving as the subject of a documentary film .
The development proposal for the farm site could force Villaraigosa to choose between environmental activists willing to stage protests outside his home and office , and a business that has a huge effect on the region ’s economy .
Forever 21 Senior Vice President Christopher Lee has said the site at 41st and Alameda streets is critical to the expansion of his business , which has been doubling each year .
If Forever 21 does n’t find a large expanse of land soon , it could leave Los Angeles -- taking important manufacturing jobs with it .
Advertisement
“ That ’s going to be really detrimental to Los Angeles because we pump in hundreds of millions of dollars here , ” said Lee , who was recently appointed by the mayor to the city ’s Industrial Development Authority .
Lee and Forever 21 founder Don Chang were two of several business leaders who accompanied Villaraigosa on his trade mission to Asia in 2006 .
Six months later , Forever 21 gave $ 100,000 to Villaraigosa ’s successful campaign to elect three new school board members .
In recent months , the company agreed to give $ 1 million to Villaraigosa ’s Million Trees L.A. initiative , which encourages residents to plant more trees .
The company also gave $ 150,000 to Villaraigosa ’s staging of the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Century City last year , a donation so significant that Lee was given a speaking role at the event ’s closing reception at the Griffith Park Observatory .
Tezozomoc said that such contributions make it difficult for Villaraigosa to deal fairly with the former farm site .
Advertisement
Szabo , on the other hand , said the mayor has “ an absolute obligation ” to ask businesses such as Forever 21 to contribute to such causes as a recent community cleanup on the Westside .
“ I mean , we ’re talking about planting trees and donating T - shirts for kids , ” Szabo said .
Supporters of the proposed development say a distribution center would create much - needed jobs in South Los Angeles .
Foes say the neighborhood , which sits near the freight route known as the Alameda Corridor , does not need more warehouses .
A city zoning officer is expected to decide this month whether to require an environmental impact report on the proposed distribution center , which probably would add a year to the approval process .
Advertisement
Opponents have forwarded hundreds of e-mails to the city ’s planning department , saying the 2,400 daily truck trips expected to be generated by the project merit a lengthier review .
“ At this point , there is no way any diesel - truck , industrial warehouse is going to do any good in that community , ” said Leslie Radford , spokeswoman for the South Central Farm support committee .
Radford contends the project would add to the neighborhood ’s air pollution and create “ dead - end jobs . ”
But Faye Washington , executive director of the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles , said she was impressed with the wages the company would pay .
Her YWCA ’s Job Corps program is negotiating with Forever 21 to try to make sure it would hire local residents .
Advertisement
And City Councilwoman Jan Perry , a longtime supporter of Horowitz ’s project , argued that Villaraigosa ’s clean truck program would significantly limit the emissions created by the distribution center , making it less harmful to air quality than it would have been earlier .
Perry said most of the trucks driving to the Forever 21 facility would come from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach , where trucks will be required to have cleaner - burning engines -- the kind built in 2007 or later -- over the next 3 1/2 years .
The fight over the 14 - acre site dates back to 1986 , when city officials used the power of eminent domain to force Horowitz to sell his land so a city incinerator could be built there .
That plan was abandoned amid community protests , and in the wake of the 1992 riots , the land was converted into a community garden overseen by the Los Angeles Food Bank across the street .
Nearby low - income residents , many of them Spanish - speaking immigrants from Mexico and Central America , carved the site into tiny plots filled with vegetables , herbs and flowers .
But with the incinerator plan scrapped , Horowitz sued the city , buying back the land in a settlement .
Advertisement
By then , the farm had become one of the largest community gardens in the region -- and a symbol of the city ’s need for more urban farming , said Occidental College professor Robert Gottlieb , who heads the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute , a research and advocacy group dealing with food and social justice .
“ What made [ the farm ] so interesting was it was becoming a community space , ” he added .
“ It was n’t just a series of plots of individual gardeners .
It hosted events ; it had festivals .
It was a place where families came . ”
Despite last - minute efforts by Villaraigosa to have a nonprofit group acquire the land , Horowitz had the garden demolished and its gardeners removed in 2006 .
It was a media spectacle : Protesters and police squared off as helicopters hovered overhead .
After two years of relative calm , Horowitz and the farmers are battling again .
Horowitz took his development plan for the site to a public hearing last month .
Activists , some carrying baskets filled with fresh fruit , testified against it .

Oakland pot candy maker pleads guilty OAKLAND
The owner of an Oakland factory that produced marijuana candy with names like Buddafinga and Mr. Greenbud has pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana .
Michael Martin , 33 , of El Sobrante entered a guilty plea at a hearing Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Oakland .
He is scheduled to be sentenced July 2 by Judge Claudia Wilken .
Martin is the owner of Tainted Inc. , which started as a boutique business that made chocolate truffles and grew into a large marijuana - candy maker that bought chocolate by the ton , authorities said .
Tainted Inc. employee Jessica Sanders has been charged with illegally using a phone to distribute marijuana , a felony , while employees Michael Anderson and Diallo McLinn - the son of longtime Berkeley activist Osha Neumann - were each charged with a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession .
Authorities said Tainted made candies with names that played off popular legal treats : Budda - finga , Mr. Greenbud , Stoners .
The business also made pot-laced items such as cookies , ice cream , peanut butter , granola bars and barbecue sauce , according to the Drug Enforcement Administration .
When the federal government charged Tainted Inc.'s owner and employees in September , authorities said the company supplied the marijuana - laced candies to cannabis clubs in the Bay Area , Los Angeles , Seattle , Vancouver , British Columbia and Amsterdam .
Before surrendering to face the charges in October , Martin blasted the U.S. government for what he called an unfair attack by federal bullies on ailing patients who rely on medical marijuana .
Martin said he joined the medical - marijuana movement after seeing his father die painfully of prostate cancer in 2002 after a 10 - year battle .
His father refused to use marijuana because of a federal ban on all types of the drug .
Martin said he uses medical marijuana to ease pain after a fall left him with seven screws and a steel plate in his left heel .
He said he also has degenerative cartilage in his right knee .
In September , federal agents raided his factory on the 900 block of 61st Street in North Oakland and a building on the 300 block of 40th Street where marijuana was grown .
The investigation bears similarities to DEA raids in Oakland in 2006 in which five people connected with a company called Beyond Bomb were convicted of making marijuana - laced treats with names like Munchy Way , Rasta Reece 's and Puff - a - Mint Pattie .
In federal marijuana cases , defense attorneys are barred from telling jurors that companies supply medical cannabis products through licensed dispensaries to qualified patients .
Proposition 215 , the initiative approved in 1996 by state voters , legalized growing and using marijuana for medical purposes with a doctor 's recommendation .
Under federal law , marijuana used for any purpose is illegal .

I will indeed never forget Feinstein's and Schumer 's roles in placing Mukasey in his position .
Schumer 's current indignation seems nothing more than ex post facto CYA , and there is dead silence on Feinstein 's part .
I hope when Senator Leahy retires , neither will be in a position to assume his mantle automatically .

You 'd think the Dems would learn .
They trust these snakes when they are up for nomination , then are surprised when they turn out to be --- snakes !
Time we turned these people out of office and put some real reps in office .
Or we can be really paranoid and suggest the trend signals that the dems are in on the deal and have been all along .
Their pitiful performances during hearings and votes is just cover for their duplicity .

" Across the United States , FBI agents have been hamstrung by the Justice and Homeland Security Departments , led by two individuals , Michael Mukasey and Michael Chertoff , whose close links to the Russian - Israeli Mafia in New York and New Jersey have seen case after case involving Russian - Israeli mobsters going un-investigated and virtually ignored . "
This bit from Wayne Madsen Reports sums up Mukasey .
My question is how involved are Schumer or Pelosi ?

So Senator Leahy ... your saying that only 6 - 7 others voted for IMPEACHMENT and so ... we 'll never know who and what they have compromised ... which explains these FISA votes .
Sir ?
I will counsil my child to fight for the THIRD party , and quit believing in this illusion of DEMOCRACY !
My last post , I was thinking nader ( but ya know .. .
He was funded early on by rockefeller .
I did n't , until I read it in Daniel Estulin 's book about the bilderbergs , cfr and trilaterals . )
So really , I do believe in refinement ... and I 'd like to make that Cynthia McKinny , thank you very much !

After the last FISA thing I 'm convinced the party leadership are Aliens in cahoots with the Republican Alien leadership .
I can't think of any other rational reason why they would push that legislation or guys like Mukasey for AG .
Did they think it would boost their approval rating like a minimum wage or children 's healthcare bill would ?
I can't come up with any other reason why Bush would be able to accomplish so much of he wanted with a Democractic controlled congress .
Pelosi -Alien , Feinstein - definitely Alien , Reid - Alien , Hoyer - Alien , Schumer - I just think Schumer 's dumb .

Thanks for the levity Bamboo Harvester !
But , I 'm really starting to think this is the perfect moment for the Green Party to be the alternative to the kings , queens , and jujubes .
With the truth staring us in the face people should quit voting fear with the lesser - of - two - evil - votes or the blind - faith - to - party - vote and make a move back towards real democracy .
Here 's a clue for the obamatrons ( the whole interview is dead on , but please listen to what she says about obama and think about what blind support gets us . ) :

The pleasure is mine !
I do n't see it as the lesser of 2 evils it 's a matter of survival ...
To win a national election requires the tacking of a seasoned yachtsman and a disciplined captain calling the shots .
I believe Obama is even aware of many of the election fraud tactics .
" Winning " means getting something ( perhaps much ) " losing " get you ABSOLUTELY NOTHING but more Fascism .
But , I will admit to voting for Ross Perot and do n't regret it .

As to the other subject again , they 'd only get my vote back if they 'd stand up in favor of a new 911 investigation ...
Oh Yeah , that lil nugget we 've so conviently forgotten .

I just do n't buy , trust the democraps and all will be better , like a bag of chips !!
I 'm fearlessly going GREEN and I 'd like other people to consider it too ! .
I mean really , in this self allowed / made crisis / panick mode we seem to find ourselves in that they have created for us !!!!!!!!!!,
It 's an action I can actually take for a peaceful energy solution .
Furthermore , I think Kucinich would be the perfect pick for the ticket , speaking of dreaming .
If Greens want poeple to truely consider them , open up the VP process to the people considering them .
But really , my big question of the day is ... do you think this would have made phil gramm the once democrapic - congressman - turned republicon - senator - ubs creep - mcsame - advisor money ?

Many of us at Mozilla and within the Mozilla community were excited when Stephen Colbert gave Firefox 3 his “ Colbert Bump ” on the day of Firefox 3 ’s launch ( a big thanks to Jonathan Zittrain ) .
You can watch the video here .
Download Day was a wild success , and we were happy to share some thanks and credit with Stephen .
However , a few questions naturally arose , e.g. , what was the direct impact of the Colbert Bump ?
and could the effect be precisely measured ?
Here ’s what we did : we looked at downloads of Firefox 3 by users within the U.S. – and then we drilled down to a minute - by - minute view to see what , if anything , could be detected .
At minute 23 of the broadcast , Colbert said , “ Firefox 3 just got the Colbert Bump . ”
What happened next ?
We saw a big spike in downloads exactly one and two minutes later :
Apparently we ’re not the first to find scientific evidence proving the Bump ’s effect .
If you ’re interested in that previous study by James Fowler of the University of California at San Diego , you can read the complete version here .
Fans eager to watch the first installment of Joss Whedon 's direct - to - web musical Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog flooded the site Tuesday , causing it to crash .
The first installment , which was scheduled to go live Tuesday , has been down since early morning .
" Traffic is through the roof ....
We were hit beyond the servers ' capabilities , " said * Dr. Horrible * co- creator and writer Maurissa Tancharoen , who estimated that the site clocked 200,000 hits per hour .
Web meltdown notwithstanding , the first act of * Dr. Horrible * can be downloaded at the iTunes Store for $ 2 .
The second and third portions will be available Thursday and Saturday , respectively , with each episode of the miniseries available for download through July 29 .
A " season pass " for all three episodes costs $ 4 .
After the download period , the series will be released as a DVD with plenty of extras .
Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog is the latest project from geek scribe Joss Whedon .
It tells the story of a wannabe villain battling his archnemesis , Captain Hammer , and struggling to woo his neighbor , Penny .
Joss Whedon , creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Firefly and Dollhouse , came up with the idea for the internet musical during the Hollywood writers ' strike earlier this year .
So far , the first installment , or act , has been wildly popular , outpacing shows like Lost , The Wire and The Daily Show to rank No. 1 on the iTunes list of most popular television series .
The creative team behind the miniseries , which includes Tancharoen , Whedon and his two brothers , Jed and Zack Whedon , released a statement Tuesday about the barrage of visitors : " We love you for crashing the site , we really do .
In the meantime , those of you who have iTunes capabilities can go there and get your fix .
Our site should be up and running again in a few hours .
Your support is warming our hearts and kicking our asses .
So thank you thank you . "

So this morning , I ask Democratic Congressional leaders to move forward with four steps to expand American oil and gasoline production .
First , we should expand American oil production by increasing access to the Outer Continental Shelf , or OCS .
Experts believe that the OCS could produce about 18 billion barrels of oil .
That would be enough to match America ’s current oil production for almost ten years .
The problem is that Congress has restricted access to key parts of the OCS since the early 1980s .
Since then , advances in technology have made it possible to conduct oil exploration in the OCS that is out of sight , protects coral reefs and habitats , and protects against oil spills .
With these advances â€ ” and a dramatic increase in oil prices â€ ” congressional restrictions on OCS exploration have become outdated and counterproductive .

That 30 percent of the country is nonwhite ?
That black women spend $ 20 billion a year on clothes ?
That an African - American is the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party ?

June 10 , 2008 --
The " miracle " window washer who survived a 47 - story fall from a New York City skyscraper said today in an exclusive interview on " Good Morning America " that he 's grateful to be alive and that the Big Apple is his home .
" This is home forever ' Alcides " Miguel " Moreno , an Ecuadorean immigrant , told Diane Sawyer .
It was a moving coda to an extraordinary story of survival , one that continues as the unimaginably lucky Moreno grows stronger each day .
Moreno and his brother plummeted from the city skyline in December after their scaffolding snapped .
His brother died .
Through tears -- and a little laughter -- Moreno talked about how good it was to be alive , lovingly referring to his devoted wife and family .
" I 'm thinking , talking about my life , " he said , " I have children . "
The hospital originally described Moreno 's condition as a " complete disaster , " that included several broken limbs and severe internal injuries .
Doctors were unsure if Moreno would ever walk again , and when he could return home .
But Moreno , 37 , continues to surprise doctors , performing a miraculous recovery , returning home and even walking again .
' The Legend of the Fall '
On a cold morning , Moreno and his younger brother , Edgar , woke up at 4 a .m. to go to work together , washing windows as they had done for the previous 12 years .
But on that Dec. 7 , 2007 , the cables holding their scaffolding snapped and dropped the brothers , at up to 125 mph , to the city 's concrete more than 550 feet below .
Edgar , 30 , died instantly .
Moreno managed to hold on , riding the scaffolding like a surfboard to the ground .
Astonished rescue workers found Moreno alive .
He was even sitting up , holding his hands to his chest .
" No one actually believed he 's alive , falling from this height , " paramedic Michael Kremenizer said .
Doctors called it a miracle .
" I do n't know what adjective you 'd care to use , unprecedented , extraordinary , " said Philip Barrie , a doctor at New York Presbyterian Hospital .
" If you are a believer in miracles , this would be one . "
Moreno suffered a broken arm , two broken legs and severe injuries to his chest , abdomen and spine .
A small army of doctors drilled a hole in his brain to reduce swelling , pumping 24 units of blood into his battered body before eventually inducing him into a coma .
It came to be known by the local media as " the legend of the fall . "
Not only did Moreno survive , but he eventually woke up .
On Christmas Day , Moreno emerged from the coma , reaching for his wife .
At a news conference , his stunned wife , Rosario " Rosie " Moreno , did not know what to say .
" I do n't know what to tell you .
I 'm still at awe , " she said last year .
" I 'm still in shock . "
Only four months after the accident , Moreno checked out of Kessler Rehab Center in New Jersey .
And , miraculously , he left walking on his own two feet .
Gesturing to the right side of his body , Moreno said , " I land[ed ] on this part , you know , all this part . "
And even though he still has pain , he says it is " much better . "
As his body heals , Moreno has continued to regain more of his memory .
" That means a lot to me , when I start to remember my neighbors .
Once I remember my house and the city where I live , " Moreno said .
While Moreno has fond memories of his younger brother , he also now has memories of his brother falling .
" Yesterday , I remembered my brother and I was crying a little bit , " he said .
" That was the only thing since this happened that I remember . "
Although Moreno was a U.S. citizen before the accident , his brother , Edgar , was not .
The paperwork arrived after his death .
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited the companies that employed the window washers and installed the scaffolding , fining them a total of $ 40,000 .
' This is Home Forever '
Continuing to defy conventional wisdom , Moreno is making significant progress .
Now , only six months after that terrifying morning , he is walking completely on his own .
His recovery is one that he says he could not have done without wife Rosie , who kept constant vigil on a tiny couch next to his hospital bed .
" This is home forever , " Moreno said .
" I mean , look , I have me a Puerto Rican girl . "
She may be Puerto Rican to his Ecuadorian , but Moreno declared proudly that their home is the life they have built together , with their three children : Michael , 14 ; Mariah , 8 ; and Andrew , 6 .
Now , he cheers at Mariah 's soccer games , enjoys family barbecues as the summer melts away and spends Sunday mornings at church , where friends welcomed him back from a miracle that no one could have imagined .
The panel ordered that Mr. Nacchio receive a new trial in front of a different judge .
“ The reality is that for years , not just in Colorado but in many states , citizen taxpayers have paid the price for C.E.O. ’s and companies who break the rules in order to get ahead , ” Mr. Knox said .
Ultimately , the proposal would extend criminal and civil liability to executives who knew about corporate fraud and did nothing to stop it , but who were not necessarily involved in it , said Mark Grueskin , a lawyer for Protect Colorado ’s Future .
Not surprisingly , the proposal , and subsequent versions with alternative language that have been suggested by Protect Colorado ’s Future , has generated sharp opposition from Colorado ’s business community .
If the measure is approved , some fear that the courts will become overwhelmed with frivolous lawsuits .
Those lawsuits , in turn , could bankrupt small and midsize companies and make it more difficult for legitimate lawsuits to succeed , said Joe Blake , president and chief executive of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce .
“ We ’re very concerned that any number of people could crowd the docket and frustrate the court system with suits that are perhaps well - intentioned but highly frivolous , ” he said .
“ We ’re going to have chaos out here . ”
Mr. Grueskin countered that the measure would parallel current state law and require plaintiffs to pay for their lawsuits if a court ruled that they were frivolous .
“ There is an inherent disincentive to use this as a means for a gadfly to act as a corporate obstructionist , ” he said .
“ I would be surprised if there would be many responsible companies that would have a problems with this . ”
i Phone 2.1 firmware specs ?
Apple may already be laying the groundwork for several important updates in the next major iteration of iPhone firmware , according to multiple sources .
One notes that in exploring the Localizable .
strings entry under English.lproj in the current iPhone WebKit framework , there are entries for several commands the firmware does not currently support , including cutting , copying and pasting .
Apple has expressed interest in adding the feature , but has not set a timeframe .
The firmware also contains a reference to a " mobile radio " function , which could indicate that Apple hopes to support native Internet radio , instead of through third - party apps .
Another source claims to have obtained a beta of v2.1 firmware , said to be in distribution for developers only .
Among the features in this are alleged to be expanded Core Location items , including means for gauging the direction a person is headed , and their velocity .
In theory , this could allow turn - by - turn GPS navigation .
The update also appears to have an early implementation of Apple 's background push notification , a means of imitating background processes without the corresponding battery drain or decline in CPU performance .
Apple has said that full support for push notification will only arrive in September however , which could suggest when v2.1 will be delivered via iTunes .
In the meantime Apple is believed to be preparing a v2.0.1 update , addressing bugs only .

In the final days of 2006 , former Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein was hanged for the 1982 murders of 148 people in Dujail , Iraq .
While capital punishment is still on the books in many countries around the world , death by hanging has in many cases been replaced by more sterile killing methods like lethal injection , which some believe to be a more humane form of execution .
Many people might be surprised to learn that hanging , when carried out with modern techniques , can be one of the quickest and most painless ways to be executed .
The modern method of judicial hanging is called the long drop .
This is the method that Iraqi officials used to execute Saddam Hussein .
In the long drop , those planning the execution calculate the drop distance required to break the subject 's neck based on his or her weight , height and build .
They typically aim to get the body moving quickly enough after the trap door opens to produce between 1,000 and 1,250 foot - pounds of torque on the neck when the noose jerks tight .
This distance can be anywhere from 5 to 9 feet ( 1.5 to 2.7 meters ) .
With the knot of the noose placed at the left side of the subject 's neck , under the jaw , the jolt to the neck at the end of the drop is enough to break or dislocate a neck bone called the axis , which in turn should sever the spinal cord .
In some cases , the hangman jerks up on the rope at the precise moment when the drop is ending in order to facilitate the breakage .

­ This is the ideal situation in a long drop .
When the neck breaks and severs the spine , blood pressure drops down to nothing in about a second , and the subject loses consciousness .
Brain death then takes several minutes to occur , and complete death can take more than 15 or 20 minutes , but the person at the end of the rope most likely can't feel or experience any of it .
On the next page , we 'll learn about other kinds of hangings and how they cause death .
Corp. U.S. Mythology
This is a WARNING !
Regardless of how much you have read , studied or “ learned ” , and regardless of how good it sounded or how real it seemed at the time , it is possible that , regardless of the source , what you thought was true might simply be a myth .
This becomes a particularly difficult situation when the source of the information upon which such beliefs are formed came from authoritative sources like : parents , teachers , schools , governmental officials , official media sources , etc .
Because so much of the information found on the internet ( and in other media sources ) was generated by third party sources that have little or no substantive or authoritative base , such sources are not reliable .
Nonetheless , when people read or study from such sources they begin to develop opinions they convince themselves they learned the truth from a reliable source .
However , taking actions based upon such unreliable sources can have quite devastating effects !
This is particularly bothersome when the information provided by such sources becomes the substance of mythology ; and , those myths grow to become part of the traditional thinking — knowledge base — of the people .
Nonetheless , such myths remain myths ; no matter how many people believe in them .
Therefore , wise people never believe anyone or any source , just because the information received sounds good ; instead , they first learn how to learn the truth , the law and history by following the Standard for Review and so proving the facts that confirm the truth with actual evidence .
Respectively , we admonish our readers not to believe us , or anyone else , just because you see or hear something that sounds good .
You need evidence ; the quality of which is at least good enough to support the facts if they were presented as evidence in court .
To reveal most mythology we simply follow the admonition from Foundational Law ( the Bible ) , “ In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . ”
KJV Bible , 2 Corinthians 13:1
With that admonition it seems wise to do your own research , not trusting hearsay from any source .
Let the two or three witnesses be factual records of law and history each of which are verifiable by a variety of actual substantial sources ; like : the law itself and actual verifiable historical records supporting the same .
This is one of the reasons we always say : “ Do n’t believe us or anyone else on such matters .
Do your own research and prove the truth for your self . ”
We always feel such research is best done with the assistance of prayer made with a sincere heart and real intent ; asking our Father in Heaven for guidance to know the truth .
Thus , to discern the truth we : First , pray for guidance ; Second , following the Standard for Review , study — and discover the truth from you own firsthand research ; repeat research done by other sources ; get several actual source records of Law and History that confirm the accuracy of what you learn ;
Third , pray again asking if what you have discovered is not true .
Only when you have so discovered and understand the truth for yourself by your own firsthand experience is it reasonable to take action .
Now on to revealing some the Mythology spread about and or by what appears to be government :
The chart topping Corp U.S. Myths are :
Our purpose in presenting these Corp. U.S. myths is to inspire you to actually start learning the law firsthand from its source .
Corp. U.S’.
Myth 1 :
The District of Columbia Act of 1871 incorporated the municipal government of the District of Columbia into a municipal corporation .
From time to time people ask us questions similar to the following :
 An initial review of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 seems like it only incorporates a local government ( like Chicago or Seattle ) ; how do you get that they formed a private corporation ?
If you take the Act out of its historical context and , from the present , look to the Act , in the past , not knowing its history , then merely imagine who are the parties involved , you might agree with the presupposition that the Act merely incorporated a municipality .
However , such a review will not help you understand the meaning of any actual Act ; thus , to best understand what actually happened we follow our “ Standard for Review ” to first discover the history behind the relationship ; and , second , we look to the terms and conditions of the Act , by reviewing the Act itself , to see how it fits in accord with law and our history .
Standard for Review
Rule 1 : To understand any relationship you must : Always know yourself first ( start at Genesis 1:2629 ) ; Discover the true nature of all other parties second ;
First understand who the parties are ( from their origin ) ;
Then you must understand the historical and environmental nature of the relationship ; and , Only then can you understand how applicable laws may effect the relationship ; thus , it s time to study such laws .
Rule 2 : Review the details of the relationship in question only after you have completed the review required by Rule 1 , then review the actual terms of the relationship and the details in question in accord with what you learned from applying Rule 1 .
Thus , to understand the parties involved in the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 ( hereinafter , “ DCOA ” ) , we must first understand who are the parties involved in the relationship as described by the Act .
We are not going to delve into the Act here , in its entirety ; suffice it to say , looking over the situation , we find the Act is one made by the original jurisdiction government ’s Congress , as set by the Constitution for the United States of America .
The DCOA describes its venue as : “ all that part of the territory of the United States included within the limits of the District of Columbia ” .
The District of Columbia was originally provided for in the Constitution for the United States of America ( Sept. 17 , 1787 ) at Article 1 Section 8 , specifically in the last two clauses .
Then , on July 16 , 1790 , in accord with the provisions of those clauses , the Territory was formed in the District of Columbia Act , wherein the “ ten mile square ” territory was permanently created and made the permanent location of the country ’s government ; that is to say , the “ territory ” so provided for included both the land and its actual government .
Under that Act , Congress also made the President the civic leader of the local government in all matters in said Territory .
Then , on February 27 , 1801 , under the second District of Columbia Act , two counties were formed and their respective officers and district judges were appointed .
Further , the established town governments of Alexandria , Georgetown and Washington were recognized as constituted and placed under the laws of the District , its judges , etc .
The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly called this Act ( of , February 27 , 1801 ) the “ District of Columbia Organization Act ” or the “ Charter Act of the District of Columbia ” and recognized it as the incorporation of the “ municipality ” known as the “ District of Columbia ” .
Then , on March 3 , 1801 , a Supplementary
Act to that last Act , noted here , added the authority that the Marshals appointed by the respective District Court Judges collectively form a County Commission with the authority to appoint all officers as may be needed in similarity to the respective State officials in the states whence the counties Washington and Alexandria came , those being : Maryland and Virginia , respectively .
According to the United States Supreme Court those charter acts ( first acts ) were the official incorporation of the formal government ( with its municipalities ) of the District of Columbia as chartered by Congress in accord with the Constitution ’s provision .
Again , the Supreme Court called that body of government “ a corporation ” , with the right to sue and be sued .
Respectively , since 1801 , the District of Columbia has been consistently recognized as a “ municipal corporation ” with its own government .
That sets the basics for the first rule of our Standard for Review , ‘ know the parties ’ .
What we have presented is sufficient to show the basics of who the parties are as they related to resolving the answer to the question above .
We admonish everyone to prove the facts for themselves by their own research .
The second rule from our Standard for Review is : “ Then you must understand the environmental nature of the relationship . ”
With that in mind let ’s consider the events of the time : the Civil War had recently ended and the country was still under Lincoln ’s Conscription Act ( Martial Law ) .
Congress had at least three problems they could see no way to directly cure by following the laws of the land ( as constituted ) : they were out of funds , they had promised 40 acres of land to each slave that left the South to fight for the North and they had to reintegrate the south into the Union ; which they could not do without controlling the appointment of the Southern States Congressional members .
There were other problems ; but , these three stand out from the rest .
That is enough about the environment for the purposes of this review ; however , the more you study the historical events of this time , the more obvious the relationships will become and the more proof you will amass to prove the facts of what actually happened .
In the interest of time , space and the topic of this response , we will move on .
The last step of the Standard for Review ’s discovery process requires a review of the actual terms of the relationship .
Thus , we review the first paragraph of the DCOA ; where :
Congress wrote :
That all that part of the territory of the United States included within the limits of the District of Columbia be , and the same is hereby , created into a government by the name of the District of Columbia , by which name it is hereby constituted a body corporate for municipal purposes … and exercise all other powers of a municipal corporation .
Given that even the Supreme Court confirms that the government of the District of Columbia was already “ created into a government ” , so formed into a municipal incorporation in 1801 under the District of Columbia Acts , we wonder , even with Congress ’ constitutional authority to pass any law within the ten mile square of the District , how do you create , or incorporate , for the first time , a municipal government that has already been in existence as a municipal corporation for over 70 years ?
The obvious answer is , “ It ’s impossible ! ”
There is no way to pass an “ Organic Act ” when the “ Charter Act ” is already in place , because the two words ( organic and charter ) have the same meaning —
The First Act .
Though historians can make history appear to change by rewriting it for those unwilling to study the past from the actual records of the past .
Even Congress cannot change the actual history .
However , the records speak for themselves only if , and when , we study them .
When you consider the historical facts , the only meaning left for the terms given in the opening paragraph of the DCOA ( and that which follows ) is , the municipal corporation that was created is a private corporation owned by the actual government .
Further , the only government created in that Act was the same form of private government any private corporation has within the operation of its own corporate construct .
Thus , we coined the term , “ Corp. U.S. ” ; to distinguish that corporation from the actual “ original jurisdiction ” government ; as it was formed in accord with the Constitution for the United States of America .
We also note Congress reserved the right , granted them in said Constitution , to pass and enforce virtually any law within the District of Columbia ; which is almost complete dictatorial authority over their Corp.
U.S. construct , without regard for its internal operations or officers .
Thus , Congress can lawfully use Corp. U.S. as they see fit , within that portion of the ten mile square defined as the District of Columbia .
Respectively ( through that authority ) ; the members of Congress now wore two hats ; one hat for their original jurisdiction government official seat and a second more effective hat as as a corporate board member titled with the same names : “ Congressman ” ; “ Representative ” or “ Senator ” ; the President also effectively wore two similar hats .
Thus , our historical records and laws clearly show that Corp.
U.S. is not merely an incorporated municipality ; rather , it is a private Corporation that was lawfully created by our original jurisdiction government
Myth resolved .
We find no legal or lawful problem with the formation of Corp. U.S. ; as shown above , the Constitution provided Congress with the authority to pass any law within the ten mile square of the District of Columbia ; however , with the creation of such a thing ; the people would have to remain more vigilant to make sure that such a corporation was not used to extend authoritarian power beyond bounds of said District to usurp authoritarian styled power over the people of the nation by force .
Of course , because the people failed to exercise such vigilance , that is exactly what is happening today .
Respectively , the only way to peacefully remedy this situation is the people must learn the law and apply it to restore our original jurisdiction government ( see : Governor ’s Corner ) .
Such a remedy is exactly why Team Law is here to help you learn how to learn the Law ; so , you can apply it to preserve our peace , your freedom and our nation .
Of course , so long as people continue to focus their minds on imagining doom and gloom because of what they think other people are , or are not , willing to do , they limit themselves from the only thing that keeps them from becoming part of the solution instead of part of the problem .
In that regard , most people seem to sit in a ‘ catch - 22 ’ ; because they have already imagined the world is getting worse and they are not willing to believe that they can do anything to change that , they limit themselves from doing anything to change that vision .
Thus , that limit keeps them from being successful .
The solution is simple , because it starts with each one of us and there is no time like the present to start making a difference .
We have repeatedly proven that learning and applying the law works .
And , History proves that , even at the worst of times , the best opportunities of our lives can only happen if we take the first step .
Therefore , as you start to move in the right direction to create a powerful positive future for yourself — the world starts to change — you make it a better place .
The first step is to imagine that powerful positive future .
You can start by answering this question :
“ If you could make one righteous wish that would change any aspect of your life for the better — What would that wish be ? ”
Now , Notice what your life would be like if you already had that change now !

Corp. U.S’.
Myth 2 :
The United States Government is sovereign .
On the outset of this review we acknowledge that because “ The United States of America ” is a nation of sovereign people , it is a sovereign nation .
Though that fact alone should make it clear that the government is , and must remain , the servant of the people not their sovereign , Corp .
U.S. promotes the ideology that it cannot be sued because it alleges that it is “ Sovereign ” .
That myth is easily resolved by reviewing the 1871 DCOA , under which , Corp. U.S. was created .
It clearly states that Corp. U.S. can be sued .
Respectively , the myth is resolved because sovereign cannot be sued within its own realm without its permission .
Nonetheless , we are not willing to rely on that alone to resolve the myth .
Instead , let ’s review the three elements that define sovereignty in comparison to the government , Corp. U.S. and the people .
Sovereignty is a political power that is defined by : dominion , agency and possession : “ Dominion ” is synonymous with “ Land ” , which is defined as : “ ( A ) n area of three dimensional space , its position being defined by natural or imaginary points located by reference to the earth ’s surface .
‘ Land ’ is not the fixed contents of that space , although … the owner of that space may well own those fixed contents .
Land is immoveable , as distinct from chattels , which are moveable ; it is also , in its legal significance , indestructible .
The contents of the space may be physically severed , destroyed or consumed , but the space itself , and so the ‘ land ’ , remains immutable . ”
Peter Butt , Land Law 9 ( 2nd ed. 1988 ) Reprinted in Black ’s Law Dictionary , Seventh Edition ;
The government of The United States of America was : formed by the Constitution for the United States of America ; and is limited in its authority by said Constitution ; which forbids the government from owning land with the exception of that which is necessary to accomplish the following : “ To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) as may , by Cession of particular States , and the Acceptance of Congress , become the Seat of the Government of the United States , and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be , for the Erection of Forts , Magazines , Arsenals , dock - Yards , and other needful Buildings ” .
Said Constitution , Article .
1 . §. 8 . Clause 17 . ; Accordingly , when a territory ( land ) is acquired by The United States of America that land is held for dispossession to the people ; who , under a proper claim are granted private Title ( land patent ) to the land ; wherein , most of those patents ( outside of the original 13 States & Texas ; which came from foreign kings ) were granted by the United States of America , under the hand and seal of the President of The United States of America ; Respectively , the land mass of The United States of America is secured by land patents ( Titles ) that grant the land to private individuals ( and to their heirs and assigns ) ; “ Agency ” is the right , or authority , to act , influence , exert power over and / or control a specific domain .
The purpose the people gave for forming their Constitutional Republic form of government was , and remains : “ to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity ” , said Constitution ’s Preamble ; respectively , a review of said Constitution shows that : not only did the people never grant said government authority over the people or over their rights to Life , Liberty or Property , they reserved that all such rights , etc. remain with the people ( see : amendments 9 . and 10 . ) ;
The agency so granted to the government of The United States of America is limited to the specific authority the people collectively granted the government to act , for the people , through said Constitution ; which only allows government the limited authority to administrate that small portion of the peoples ’ collective sovereign authority necessary to accomplish the provisions of said Constitution ;
Said governmental agency does not include agency over the private land owned and occupied by said people ; and , The people retain their private agency over the land they own .
“ Possession ” is the actual control or physical occupancy of a specific domain and the property appurtenant to the same .
The government of The United States of America does not possess the private land owned and occupied by said people ; and , The people possess the private land owned and occupied by them .
By definition , the government is not sovereign ; and , By definition , the people that : own , retain the agency over and possess the land ( dominion ) are sovereign .
Therefore , because even the original jurisdiction government of The United States of America does not possess any of the three factors , all of which are , necessary to Sovereignty ( dominion , agency & possession ) , it cannot possibly either be sovereign or respectively , rule over the people ( as a sovereign could do ) .
Nevertheless , even though said government is not sovereign , that does not limit the nation from being sovereign ; because said people are sovereign and together those people form a “ Nation of Sovereigns ” ; which “ Nation of Sovereigns ” used said Constitution to create a government ( “ of the people , by the people and for the people ” ) and to grant said government the collective administrative authority necessary for our government to stand in the world of nations representing the sovereign people of The United States of America ; and to , in accord with said Constitution only , control the several States of the Union .
Therefore , government of “ The United States of America ” is not itself sovereign ; rather , its officers are merely granted the authority to collectively administrate a small portion of the peoples ’ sovereignty .
Respectively , when the original jurisdiction government created Corp. U.S. ( in accord with the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 ) , it did not possess authority to grant Corp. U.S. sovereign authority ( see : Osborne vs Bank US , 22 US 738 ) , it could n’t possibly have granted Corp. U.S. sovereign authority .
However , as a private corporation , Corp. U.S. was granted the authority to sue and / or be sued .
We expect the reason Corp. U.S. consistently claims to be a sovereign is to imply the Sovereign ’s advantage of not being able to be sued in their own domain .
Myth resolved .
Because Corp. U.S. is often referred to as just : “ United States ” ; and , because court cases exist that recognize the “ United States ” as sovereign , it is at times important to review such cases for two things :
Does the nature of the case imply that it was ruled with regard to Corp.
U.S. ; or , was it ruled with regard to the nation itself ?
Did the parties in the case that were attempting to sue the “ United States ” raise a reasonable argument to show the elements shared above that would limit such a ruling from being made to look as it it were made in favor of Corp.
U.S. itself instead of the actual Nation of Sovereign People ; which cannot be collectively sued .
The reason people raise such cases and then fail to present a proper argument that keeps the court from ruling on matters that do not apply to the case is that they do not know the law well enough to avoid such errors .
Please remember , Team Law is here to help you learn how to learn the Law ; so , you can properly apply it to preserve your freedom and our nation .
The first step to preserving that freedom is believing that it is possible — believing in such a future comes from first imagining having that freedom as you see yourself creating a powerful positive future ; and noticing how that feels .

What would that change be ? ”

Myth 3 :
Before 1913 the Constitution of the United States of America had only 15 Articles of Amendment .
This Myth is perhaps more commonly know by Corp. U.S’. allegation that :
“ The original 13 th amendment was never ratified ” .
Given the following three facts :
Corp. U.S. was incorporated under the District of Columbia Act of 1871 ( hereinafter , “ DCOA ” ) ; Within the DCOA Corp. U.S. adopted its own constitution ; which Corp. U.S. deemed the : “ United States Constitution ” ; and , Corp. U.S. ’ new “ United States Constitution ” is missing the Nation ’s 13 th Article of amendment .
Respectively , with two principle exceptions , Corp. U.S. ’ new constitution was identical in every way to the “ Constitution of the United States of America ” ; those two exceptions were :
As noted above , the Constitution of the United States of America ’s 13 th Article of amendment is not included in Corp. U.S. ’ new constitution ; and , Respectively , the Constitution of the United States of America ’s 14 th , 15 th and 16 th articles of amendment : are respectfully numbered : 13 th , 14 th and 15 th in Corp. U.S. ’ new constitution .

Myth 4 :
The 16th Amendment gave the government the right to tax without apportionment .
This myth was promoted by Corp. U.S. after its adopted its constitution ’s 16th Article of amendment .
However , a review of the Supreme Court case rulings both before and after that amendment clearly show that no such authority was granted .
Instead the amendment merely acknowledged that Corp. U.S. already possessed the right to so tax their agents and other parties with whom they had private contracts that authorized the same .

Corp. U.S’.
Myth 5 :
The United States Senators that have served since 1913 are Senators of the government that was formed by the Constitution for the United States of America .
To understand this myth , first , notice where Senators come from .
Like other Corp. U.S. elected officials , U.S. Senators are elected from a popular vote ; which means that their only real experiential qualification is they must : “ Win the election . ”
Of course , that means knowing the Constitution and / or having experience with the law - making process is not a qualification necessary for obtaining the office .
Respectively , given that most people so elected as U.S. Senators have little or no experience that would make them aware of the fact that Corp.
U.S. is a corporation that was created under the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 , instead they believe in Corp.
U.S. Myth 1 ; respectively , the fact that , Corp. U.S. is not the government that was created by the Constitution for the United States of America completely escapes them .
Thus , when new Corp. U.S. officials take office ( overwhelmed with work that needs to be done to face problems inherent to the office ) , their preconceptions ( related to Corp. U.S. Myth 1 ) on arrival , make them woefully equipped for the tasks at hand .
Thus , they are indoctrinated with the assumed belief that whatever is already in place is not only lawful and proper but the natural order of things in our government .
Thus , as time passes the newbie imagines things are being done correctly ; which is often not the case .
Accordingly , over time , if the people are not vigilante in their responsibility of limiting such offices to the authority lawful provided , the officers will begin to exercise authoritarian powers much as those that may have preceded them in that office .
In such cases , problems are compounded by the people failing to notice that Corp. U.S. is not our actual government ; but , is merely the corporation the original jurisdiction government put in place ( in 1871 ) to take care of the government ’s business needs and aid them in the process of assimilating the South back into the country .
Of course , given that most of the functions of Congress are business needs , by 1913 , virtually all of the functions of government were performed for the government by Corp U.S. ( wherein the members of Congress and the President used only their corporate capacity ) .
Respectfully , in 1913 , Corp. U.S. passed and ratified its own 16th and 17th amendments to its constitution .
That 17th amendment changed how Corp.U.S.
Senators acquire office ; and , from that time , Corp. U.S. Senators were elected by popular vote .
However , because the nation ’s Constitution forbids Congress from any authority to change where Senators are elected , Corp. U.S’.
17th amendment cannot have been an amendment that could be posed , passed or lawfully ratified by an original jurisdiction Congress ; respectfully , that amendment can only function as a Corp. U.S. amendment .
A physical verification of the record also shows that at the time of the alleged ratification , Corp. U.S. followed the same method of “ ratification ” that it did for the 16th amendment ( i.e. : it was adopted by the members of Congress instead of ratified by ⅔ of the States ) .
Respectfully , from that day forth , Corp. U.S. Senators were elected by popular vote ; while , the original jurisdiction Congress ’ Senators for each State continue to be appointed by the respective State ’s Senate or by the Governor of each State ; as per , the Constitution for the United States of America ( if in fact they are seated at all — in most cases , the seats remain vacant ) .
Accordingly , since the Corp. U.S. adoption of its 17th amendment , in 1913 , and the States stopped sending original jurisdiction Senators to the nation ’s Senate .
Instead , every six years , at election time , each Corp .
State holds a popular election for their respective Corp.
U.S. Senator and those are the only kind of Senators each State has been sending to Washington , D.C. for quite some time .
Therefore , those Corp. U.S. Senators no longer possess the capacity to sit in the original jurisdiction Senate .
( To remedy this problem , we have been helping the people reseat their original jurisdiction government through our Reseat America page . )
Though the preceding information effectively provides sufficient information to help any interested party research the evidences to show these facts are correct , we may add more to this article to further debunk this myth .
Meanwhile , please remember , Team Law is here to help you learn how to learn the Law ; so , you can learn to apply it to preserve your freedom and our nation .
The first step is accomplish this starts with each of us , individually .
We have to first believe it can be done .
We have found that such belief come best to those that act upon their responsibility to learn the law .
Once that happens , people begin to learn how easy and risk free the process is .
The law is actually quite simple ; anyone can learn it .
Once you discover that , you can easily imagine what would happen if each of us just starts to apply the law — the outcome of that is an incredible vision of a powerful positive future .
You can start creating that vision today by answering this question :

Myth 6 :
President Woodrow Wilson served as President of the United States of America in its original jurisdiction Constitutional Republic form of government for two full terms of office .
Though this topic is under construction , we will introduce this myth now my simply noting that President Wilson did so serve for one term .
However , after he was elected , by the Electoral College , for his second term , his election was confirmed by a Corp. U.S. only Congress ; but , such a Corp. U.S. confirmation could not possibly lawfully qualify as confirmation into the original jurisdiction government ’s presidential office for his second term ; because that confirming body of congressmen included Senators that had no original jurisdiction capacity .
Soon , we will flesh out this article with the elements that prove the facts of this myth .

Myth 7 :
Federal Reserve Notes are money .
Though this myth is easily understood , debunked and resolved by simply understanding the facts of what money is and what Federal Reserve Notes ( hereinafter : “ FRNs ” ) are not , this myth is one of the most difficult myths to eliminate for three powerful reasons :
Acceptance ; virtually everyone accepts and uses FRNs as the currency base for virtually all of their buy , sell and / or exchange transactions ; just as if FRNs were actually money ; Ignorance ; so many of the people believe the myth that they simply ignore the facts — not wanting to know the truth : and , Apathy ; that is to say : those that are caught up in the effects of this myth believe that even though it may be true that this is a myth — it works — so , they rhetorically ask : “ What ’s the big deal ? ” “ What difference does it make ? ” Respectfully the concluding ( even before they ask ) : “ There is nothing we can do about it . ”
And , there they remain , unmovable and unwilling to learn — because they are afraid of change !
Because this myth stands at the basis of virtually every financial transaction and is such a basic element of every day life , we tend to overlook the pernicious effect of the myth ; as if it were a necessity of modern life .
However , this myth stands at the basis of the most incredible hoax ever foisted upon an unsuspecting people ; wherefore , this myth must be uncovered and resolved before our nation is lost under the burden of this myth ’s effect .
Of course , one must also understand this myth to either live free or in honor of the First Command man received from God .
To debunk this myth you must understand three things :
You must know the meaning of the word “ money ” ; and understand its usage both in the Constitution ( as the founding fathers intended it ) and the effect the subsequent laws , etc. as they adjusted that meaning over time ;
You must know what FRNs are , how they came into existence and how they are and have been legally and lawfully used over time ; and , You must know the effect the use of FRNs ( instead of money ) has had on our nation ; which has been far greater than the mere introduction of economic fluctuations ( inflation , recession , market crashes , etc. ) ; their use has been the basis for a complete shift in the political structure of our nation from a Constitutional Republic to a Communistic Oligarchy .
We know that the third element of that list seems almost impossible to most people ; but , the facts and history are unmistakable .
So , being forewarned , please know that learning the truth will not only open the possibilities of resolving this myth , but , it will make it possible to learn how to use the system ( even as it is currently managed ) to help restore our original jurisdiction government to its Constitutional Republic form while maintaining peace , prosperity and functionality in both our nation and in our homes .
So , let ’s get on with the debunking of this myth by reviewing its basic elements .
Though the word ‘ money ” is used in the Constitution 6 times , it is not therein defined ; thus , to understand what the founding fathers intended when they so used that word , we must turn to sources like , The Law of Nations and dictionaries of the time period to discover the common usage of the word .
The established dictionary most used then was : Noah Webster 's 1828 Dictionary .
However , FRNs did not exist at that time ; so , though that definition of money might be construed to include such things as what later became known as FRNs ; by 1913 , when the first FRNs were made , Congress had been implementing the authority so granted to the government , in accord with the Constitution for well over 100 years and the meaning of money ( as used in the Constitution had been significantly refined .
Still , as time passed the applicability of the term , as used in the Constitution , became more refined ( by respective laws , statutes , regulations , etc. ) until its usual use was accurately published in BLACK ’S LAW DICTIONARY , 4th Edition , p. 1157 , as :
“ MONEY .
In usual and ordinary acceptation it means gold , silver , or paper money used as circulating medium of exchange , And does not embrace notes , bonds , evidences of debt , or other personal or real estate .
Lane v. Railey , 280 Ky. 319 , 133 S.W.2d 74 , 79 , 81 . ”
Still , to understand what FRNs are , it is best to go back to their creation and learn from that source what their history tells us ; and , to understand that history you have to first understand that Corp.
U.S. was created in 1871 ( see Corp U.S. Myth 1 ) .
Then , in 1909 , the parties that had bought up most of the Corp. U.S. bonds ( which came due in 1912 ) began the formation of the Federal Reserve Bank ( hereinafter “ FRB ” ) .
When those bonds came due in 1912 , Corp. U.S’ .
Congress believed the FRB founders had created the FRB for the purpose of establishing a reserve for supporting future loans for Corp.
U.S. However , though the FRB of 1913 had plenty of money ( gold and Silver coin minted by the United States of America Mint ) , the FRB made it quite clear that the FRB was not willing to loan any money to Corp.
U.S. Instead they offered that if Corp. U.S. wanted to learn about how the FRB operated , they would have to come down to the FRB headquarters on Jekyll Island , off the cost of Georgia , to find out about it .
The Jekyll Island offer went like this : the FRB would not loan money to Corp. U.S. However , if Corp. U.S. could get the American people to use the FRB ’s FRNs as if they were money , then the FRB would provide Corp.
U.S. the use of such FRNs at an annual usage rate ( rent ) .
In other words , Corp. U.S. could use ( rent ) the FRNs at a specific rate related to the arbitrary value printed on the face of the so called notes .
The deal included that the use rate ( rental ) would only accrue so long as the note was in circulation and it would then be due and payable .
The FRB also offered the following incentive : they guaranteed that if Corp.
U.S. could get the people to accept these notes in circulation as if they were money , the FRB would guarantee their exchange by redeeming the notes from the people at their face value in United States of America gold or silver coin money .
Thus , so long as the notes remained in circulation , the rent accrued ; and , until the rent was paid it compounded with interest at the same rate as the rent accrued .
Corp. U.S. accepted the offer .
To understand the deal let ’s take a closer look : it works a lot like a car loan ( rental ) where the car is borrowed at the specific rate agreed upon .
You pay the rate of the rental agreement and you get to keep the car for the term of the agreement .
In the case of the FRB ’s rental of their FRNs , Corp. U.S. could borrow ( rent ) the notes , which had a specific face value printed on them , and the rental rate was set respective of that value at the time of the agreement .
Let ’s say the rental rate was set at 3 % .
That means that as long as Corp. U.S. keeps those specific FRNs , they have to pay 3 % of the notes ’ face value per year .
Thus , if they were to borrow $ 100,000.00 total face value in FRNs for a day , they would have to pay $ 8.22 cents in rental costs for the use of those FRNs for that day .
If they were to hold such notes for a year , they would have to pay , $ 3,000.00 in rental costs for the use of the notes .
Anyone could return the FRNs to the FRB at any time and Corp. U.S. would only have to pay the agreed upon rental fee ( plus any accrued interest ) for the time the notes were held or were in circulation .
The deal also included the provision that if the people ( anyone other than Corp. U.S. ) were to turn the notes in to the FRB , the FRB would redeem the notes for their face value in real money ( U.S. minted gold or silver coins ) paid to the people that returned the FRNs .
In 1913 , that was all there was to it .
The notes were rented and put into circulation much like a car is rented .
As you can see this appears to be a very good deal for Corp.
U.S. if the people , in mass , omit the process of exchanging the FRNs for gold and silver coins — which they did .
And , for the next 20 years , Corp. U.S. continued to rent FRNs from the FRB ; however , they never paid any of the rent due ; so , over time , the interest on the unpaid debt continued to rise and compound .
In 1933 , because Corp. U.S. continually failed to pay any of their obligations made in accord with their agreements with the FRB ; accordingly when the FRB called the debt , Corp. U.S. went bankrupt to the FRB .
Corp. U.S. had amassed so much debt in unpaid rent and interest on said rent that it could not possibly pay its debt .
However , Corp. U.S. needed to continue to function !
Therefore , they went to the FRB to negotiate terms for getting a new set of notes into circulation .
Though the settlement offer arrived at was temporary , it allowed for a new set of FRNs to be printed and exchanged with the old notes that remained in circulation ; and , Corp.
U.S. had to agree to start at least paying some of the interest on the outstanding debt that forced them into bankruptcy .
Respectively , Congress announced an emergency “ banking holiday ” where the local banks throughout the country were closed and all of the FRNs were removed from the local banks and returned to the FRB ; thus , beginning the end of the old style FRNs ( redemption guaranteed in gold or silver coin ) .
During the “ holiday ” the banks were also restocked with new notes from the FRB .
The new FRB deal included new rented transaction instruments : also called , “ Federal Reserve Notes ” ; but , where the FRNs the people were familiar with stated words to the effect of , “ redeemable at any Federal Reserve Bank ” , the new notes stated , “ this note is legal tender for all debts public and private ” .
The new FRNs were acquired by Corp. U.S. and circulated in virtually the same manner as the old FRNs ; nonetheless , they were not redeemable ; except in “ like kind ” .
Therefore , if the people were to take the new FRNs to the FRB they would receive a “ like kind ” exchange of notes , new for old .
Though the original FRB deal was better for the people , the new deal fit with the law of notes which only requires a like kind exchange .
To the people , because they knew they could always exchange the old FRNs for actual gold or silver coin money at the FRB , they became accustomed to the ease of exchange of the notes in commerce ( using them like actual money used in monetary exchanges ) , they originally treated the FRNs just like money ; again , because it was directly exchangeable for money .
However , though the new notes were perceived as being far less valuable and prone to inflation , they still functioned just like the old FRNs in commerce .
In reality , it is easy to understand why ; both the new and the old FRNs were acquired in the same fashion , they were arbitrarily printed on paper and rented into circulation , much like cars are rented in car rental agreements .
The FRB simply no longer backs the FRNs with gold and silver coin money , due to Corp. U.S. ’ bankrupt status ; as a bankrupted entity Corp. U.S. can no longer compel performance on its debts .
To accomplish the FRB ’s requirement that Corp. U.S. start paying at least the interest on their outstanding debt , Corp. U.S. needed a new source for funding ; respectively , Corp. U.S. passed and enacted the Social Security Act of 1935 ; under which Act Corp. U.S. created new agency called the Social Security Administration ( hereinafter “ SSA ” ) and started marketing a program the President called : “ The New Deal ” .
In reality , said SSA Act of 1935 was simply the means for generating the excess capital Corp. U.S. needed to start paying said outstanding interest .
Now , given the facts of the SSA cardholder relationship ( see : Corp. U.S. Myth 9 ) , let ’s look at how SSC cardholders interface with FRNs and or Money ; and , at this point take notice of the fact that FRNs are not now and never have been “ money ” ; rather , from the actual records of our history we learned they are merely transaction instruments that were rented by Corp. U.S. ( in their bankruptcy ) and marketed into circulation .
On their face , they simply appear to be notes ( likely made in compliance with the law of notes ) ; respectively , their appearance leaves one with the belief that they may be bearer notes with no facially published due date ; which would imply that they are due and payable on demand .
And , whereas their specific conditions of existence are not otherwise described on the note , they can only compel redemption in like kind .
That is to say , if you present them to their maker you can only count on getting back more notes of the same nature .
Whereas the note was generated for Corp. U.S. , who remains under the control of its 1933 bankruptcy , the note cannot be an instrument of substance ; rather , it remains a rented transaction instrument signifying said bankruptcy debt .
In other words , the FRB arbitrarily creates FRNs ( out of thin air ) so it can rent them to Corp. U.S. ’ to use as instruments of exchange to manage their bankruptcy .
Though the FRN may appear to be a debt instrument , in reality it is simply an official transaction instrument used to formally exchange debits and credits between Corp. U.S. agencies ( see : Patriot Myth 22 ) .
It therefore requires no backing and can be generated in accord with the needs for its flow in circulation .
The bottom line : FRNs are not money ; rather , they are merely rented transaction instruments used by Corp.
U.S. to account for and track their agencies as they build up assets ; however , that subject is elemental to the following : “ Corp. U.S. Myth 9 . ”

Myth 8 :
The Government of the United States of America went bankrupt in 1933 .
Though this topic is under construction , we will introduce the facts now my simply noting that : by 1920 all of the officers serving in the Executive , Legislative and Judicial branches of the original jurisdiction government had been replaced with Corp.
U.S. only officers and , respectively , Corp. U.S. abandoned the constitutionally set Treasury of the United States of America .
Thus , all of the original jurisdiction government seats were vacated .
Further , the debt in question in the bankruptcy was privately agreed to between Corp. U.S. and the private Federal Reserve Bank ; and , it was Corp. U.S. that failed to pay any of the rent and / or interest on that rent , so agreed upon , that was the cause of the bankruptcy .
Accordingly , the original jurisdiction government never had any involvement with either that agreed upon debt or with the following bankruptcy that was caused by Corp. U.S’. failure to pay their obligation to that debt .
Respectfully , today , not only does the original jurisdiction government have nothing to do with that debt ( and its related bankruptcy ) , Corp. U.S. owes the original jurisdiction government ( and respectively the people ) more money than there is on the face of the planet .
Soon , we will flesh out this article with the elements that prove the facts of this myth .

Myth 9 :
Social Security participation is mandatory .
This is myth has been regularly promoted by Corp.
U.S. for many years ; however , no law supports this myth .
From its inception the Social Security system has been maintained as a voluntary participation system .
In fact , because of the following elemental facts , neither the original jurisdiction government nor Corp.
U.S. could possibly lawfully make such a program mandatory .
All authority in government comes from the people .
The Constitution forbids government from taking life , liberty or property without due process of law .
The Constitution forbids government from interfering with the obligations of contracts .
None of the people , either individually or collectively , possess the authority to mandate that any other man , woman or child must hold a government created name , number or card in order to live , own property or privately transact any form of relationship with any other party .
If the people do not possess a particular authority , they cannot possibly grant that which they do not possess to the government .
Therefore , because neither you nor I , nor any other party possesses the lawful authority to mandate such an obligation upon any other man , woman or child , the people cannot collectively possess such an authority ; accordingly , though neither the original jurisdiction government nor Corp.
U.S. can possibly mandate the Social Security system upon the people , no law limits Corp. U.S. from offering such a Social Security card ( hereinafter “ SSC ” ) holding opportunity from the people ; should the people individually voluntarily accept such a relationship when offered .
In fact , though participation in the system can only be required if you want to claim a benefit that is only provided within the system , recent events almost make this myth a reality .
The recent events we are referring to are those authoritarian acts related to Homeland Security and Øbama Care .
Soon , we will flesh out this article with the elements that prove the facts of this myth .

Myth 10 :
The Social Security card is : “ your Social Security card ; ” and / or , the Social Security Number is : “ your Social Security Number . ”
On the onset of creating a cardholder relationship , the Social Security Administration ( hereinafter : “ SSA ” ) delivers documents to potential cardholders that include the Social Security card ( hereinafter “ SSC ” ) .
Those documents make it quite clear that the “ Social Security card belongs to the United States government ” and not to you ( the man , woman or child to whom the envelope containing the SSC is delivered ) .
Further , virtually every SSC that has ever been issued clearly states , right on the card , words to the effect of :
“ This card belongs to the United States government and you must return it if we ask for it . ”
A close review of the law proves out this exact same point ; both the SSC and the Social Security Number ( hereinafter “ SSN ” ) are the property of the Corp.
U.S. , through its agent , the Social Security Administration ( hereinafter “ SSA ” ) .
Regardless of what you and or our society have come accustomed to calling it — there are no exceptions !
But , that is not the worst thing about this myth .
The worst thing is that by getting you to think of the SSC as “ your card ” , and / or of the SSN as “ your number ” , they get you to ignore the actual facts and nature of the relationship .
So , let ’s go back and review that relationship from its historical beginning ; which we referred to at the end of our presentation of Corp.
U.S. Myth 6 , above .
Therein we noted that when Corp. U.S. went bankrupt to the Federal Reserve Bank ( hereinafter : “ FRB ” ) the FRB required that Corp. U.S. start paying at least the interest on their outstanding debt .
To do so , Corp. U.S. needed a new source for funding ; respectively , Corp. U.S. passed and enacted the Social Security Act of 1935 ; under which Act Corp. U.S. created new agency called the SSA and started marketing a program the Corp. U.S. President called : “ The New Deal ” .
In reality , it was simply the means for generating the excess capital Corp. U.S. needed to start paying said outstanding debt ’s interest .
However , the program had far further reaching effects for the people of the United States of America and the world .
Prior to Corp. U.S. ’ implementation of said Act , neither the government nor Corp. U.S. had the power or authority to control the people ; and , Corp. U.S. continued to manage the affairs of government in the frame of the Constitutional Republic .
However , notice what happened as they implemented the Social Security program .
Using a SSA supplied SS - 5 application form , anyone can apply for a cardholder relationship for either themselves or for any other qualifying party .
The Social Security Administration uses the information they take off of such SS5 forms to “ create a name and number ” , which the SSA registers , in a database of cardholders , along with relevant information regarding the respective application .
The SSA then prints said name and number on a pre-printed Social Security card ( hereinafter “ SSC ” ) and sends a package including the SSC to its recipient cardholder .
The recipient receives the package .
The contents of the package ( including the SSC itself ) plainly reserves that the SSC does not belong to the recipient ; rather , the SSC remains the property of Corp.
U.S. The package also plainly instructs the recipient to verify their acceptance of the relationship by activating the SSC with a signature act ; if the recipient is willing to accept the responsibilities that go along with the SSC ; which include : the SSC is to be held in a safe place until such time as its actual owner wants it back .
The SSC is not transferable and the SSC cannot be used in any unlawful way .
Corp. U.S. also reserves the right to request the return of the SSC at any time — and that is all .
Looking over this relationship , one will discover all of the elements of a Revocable Trust ( see : Contracts , Trusts and the Corporation Sole ) are clearly part of this relationship .
Therefore , the SSA created relationship inherent to the SSC cardholder relationship is that of a Trust , which trust remains an agency of Corp. U.S. under Corp. U.S’. direct control ; through congressional acts .
Corp. U.S. publications regarding the relationship also make it quite clear that : ‘ the name and number on the card uniquely distinguish the cardholder ( the trust ) , and its account , from any people with the same or with a similar name . ’
Now , given the facts of the SSA cardholder relationship , let ’s look at how SSC cardholders interface with FRNs and or Money ; and , at this point take notice of the fact that FRNs are not now and never have been “ money ” ; rather , from the actual records of our history we learned they are merely transaction instruments that were rented by Corp. U.S. ( in their bankruptcy ) and marketed into circulation .
On their face , they simply appear to be notes ( likely made in compliance with the law of notes ) ; respectively , their appearance leaves one with the belief that they may be bearer notes with no facially published due date ; which , by law , indicates that they are due and payable on demand .
And , whereas their specific conditions of existence are not otherwise described on the note , they can only compel redemption in like kind .
That is to say , if you present them to their maker you can only count on getting back more notes of the same nature .
Whereas , the note was generated for Corp. U.S. , who remains under the control of its 1933 bankruptcy , the note cannot be an instrument of substance ; rather , it remains a rented transaction instrument signifying said bankruptcy debt .
In other words , the FRB arbitrarily creates FRNs ( at will , without actual monetary value or substance ) so it can rent them to Corp. U.S. ’ to use as instruments of exchange to manage their bankruptcy .
So , let ’s take a look at the actual relationships wherein FRNs are used ; starting with the employer employee relationship ; because , that is the source where most people come into contact with the FRNs ; or , with some instrument representing the same :
Following the “ Standard for Review ” let ’s review the parties :
The employee is a person identified by its name and SSN , therefore it is simply an agency trust of Corp.
U.S. The employer is ultimately just another agency for Corp. U.S.
To show this we remind you the employer is a person ( company , corporation , individual ) that has an Employer Identification Number ( hereinafter “ EIN ” ) .
Originally the EIN was issued by the Social Security Administration in accord with the Social Security Act of 1935 , today they are issued on application by IRS ; all such numbers are ultimately related to , and operated under an SSN or another EIN ; thus , all such parties with such numbers ( Taxpayer Identification Numbers ( hereinafter “ TIN ” ) ) are merely agencies of Corp.
U.S .
In accord with the terms of the employment agreement between such employers and their employees , the employee provides the contracted goods and or services and the employer remunerates the funds required by the agreement .
Now considering that the relationship is in reality made between two separate agencies of the same organization ( Corp. U.S. ) , is there any need for money in such a transaction ?
The answer is : “ No . ” The transaction could easily be ( and often is , through related banking transactions ) completed by a debit entry from the one agency ( employer ) , which is balanced out by a credit to the other agency ( employee ) .
No money is needed .
However , where there are hundreds of millions of such agencies , tracking them in 1935 would have been impossible without some device that could be totally controlled by the specific agencies involved in the transactions themselves .
Enter the FRN .
Though it appears to be a debt instrument , in reality it is simply an official transaction instrument used to formally exchange debits and credits between Corp. U.S. agencies .
It therefore requires no backing and can be generated in accord with the needs for its flow in circulation .
The final step : once the employee has been remunerated with such “ funds ” they can go to a merchant and exchange the funds for hard assets , like : food , shelter , clothing and transportation .
In virtually every case today , such exchanges are made with other Corp. U.S. agencies ; which agencies are exemplified by their own respective TINs .
Thus , again , no money is needed and the FRN or any other instrument or respective accounting representing the same will suffice .
Now , at this point , it is extremely important to notice that though each such so created trust started out merely holding the SSC the SSA initially provided , as a matter of law , all of the property ever subsequently acquired through the use of such a cardholder ’s name and / or SSN also becomes the property of such cardholder ; just like the SSC ; and , so , all such property remains the property of the agency trust ’s beneficiary .
In other words as a matter of law :
Corp .
U.S. is the lawful owner of all property acquired through the use of a SSN .
Respectively , given the fact that virtually all transactions made in the United States today are made by someone using a SSN ; and , that situation is compounded by the fact that they also make those transactions either using FRNs or using instruments derived from the use of such FRNs .
Wherefore , ask yourself : “ What do you call a form of government wherein the government or its agencies own virtually all of the personal property held within the regime ? ”
The answer is : “ Communism . ”
Therefore , as noted above , the worst thing about this myth is when you think of the SSC as “ your card ” and / or of the SSN as “ your number ” you ignore the facts and nature of the actual relationship ; that is :
As a matter of law , the SSC is now and will always only be the property of Corp. U.S. The Social Security cardholder was created by Corp. U.S. to : hold Corp. U.S’.
SSC in trust ; generate excess capital ( see : paragraph 1. of the Social Security Act of 1935 ) ; and , create an agency relationship between the cardholder and Corp. U.S. ;
the controlling elements of which agency relationship are : Corp. U.S retains ability to control the trust by terminating it at any time ; and , Corp. U.S. retains the ability to control distributions from the trust to its beneficiary by , at any time : adjusting F.I.C.A. ; and / or , by adding other statutory controls ( as taxes , etc. ) that will compel distributions from the trust to its beneficiary ( Corp. U.S. ) .
As the Beneficiary of all such agency trusts , Corp. U.S. retains actual ownership of all property that is ever acquired through the use of the SSC and / or the SSN .
Again , the worst thing about this myth is when you think of the SSC as “ your card ” and / or of the SSN as “ your number ” you ignore the fact that , as a matter of law :
Everything you thought you owned actually belongs to Corp. U.S. !!!
And , though you can live in a Constitutional Republic you have voluntarily chosen to
live under the communistic control of Corp. U.S. !!!

Myth 11 :
“ Your Social Security ” is “ Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance . ”
The Supreme Court has already well ruled on this topic acknowledging that there is no Social Security : insurance ; retirement or any other kind of contractual entitlement program related to Social Security Benefits .
In fact , they showed that there is no Social Security fund into which funds are taken from paychecks ; rather , the F.I.C.A. funds ( deducted from taxpayer ’s paychecks ) go directly into the general funds of the Corp. U.S. Treasury .
Respectively , all funds taken in accord with the Social Security Act of 1935 , et seq . are directly placed into said Treasury ; where Congress is free to use them for any lawful purpose they desire ; just as they would with any other funds held therein .

Myth 12 :
“ The courts have recognized that Barrack Øbama is a “ natural born Citizen ” of the United States . ”
In spite of the obvious facts regarding the meaning of the constitutional phrase : “ natural born Citizen ” ( see : Corp. U.S. Myth 13 ) , some ignorant people still promote the myth that alleges that Barrack Øbama is a “ natural Born Citizen ” as is required by the Constitution .
One website that supports that myth is : “ Øbama Conspiracy Theories ” ( hereinafter : “ ØCT ” ) ; respectively , that site has a page titled : “ Recent court rulings on presidential eligibility ” , that is supposed to show the validity of that myth .
Wherefore , it seems like the best way to debunk that myth might be to simply review that page by simply showing the facts behind those cases and expose the specious logic and spurious rhetoric used to create the bogus opinions loaded within those moot cases .
The “ Øbama as President ” supporters contest that because of opinions published in cases ( such as those shown below ) there is no cause for taking the necessary legal actions ( as exemplified in the Call to Action ) that would lawfully compel the Senate to remove Barrack Øbama from office .
We disagree !
With only one exception , every such case from said “ Recent court rulings on presidential eligibility ” was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted or lack of standing to sue — in fact , each of the respective courts lacked jurisdiction to hear the cases the respective plaintiffs filed .
Accordingly , none of those courts possessed the jurisdiction necessary to hear any of those cases that were brought before them ; thus , their opinions regarding the subject matter in question was moot and had no bearing on the matter at all .
To demonstrate that fact , we will review each of those cases in the following outline .
Please notice that throughout the review the initial numbered paragraph of each section begins with a court case name and ( for educational purposes ) contains the mythological opinion expressed ( or quoted ) by the authors of the “ ØCT ” website ; wherefore , that paragraph presents the bogus allegations / conclusions from that site ; respectively , in the lines that follow each section ’s opening paragraph , we will debunk those bogus allegations / conclusions .
The next section begins with the next ordinally numbered paragraph followed by a quote from the ØCT page beginning with a court case name .
We hope you find the following both educational and supportive :
Øbama Cases Review of court rulings on presidential eligibility " Hollander v. McCain ( New Hampshire 2008 ) ruling : “ Those born “ in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , ” U.S. Const. , amend .
XIV , have been considered American citizens under American law in effect since the time of the founding , United States v. Wong Kim Ark , 169 U.S. 649 , 674-75 ( 1898 ) , and thus eligible for the presidency ” "
The first of three primary flaws with this case having any relevance on the matter of Øbama ’s candidacy is that this case first ruled that the Plaintiff had no standing to bring the case at all ; thus , this case , as a matter of law , cannot set any precedent for the matter of candidacy because the case never acquired standing for an argument .
Therefore , regardless of any pleadings filed in the case , and regardless of the Court ’s reviewing those pleadings , the case was never argued and cannot be used to imply any viable ruling beyond the fact that the case had no standing to be heard .
The second primary flaw with this case having any relevance on the matter of Øbama ’s candidacy is the Court ’s Order partially quoted above ( Hollander v. McCain , at pg. 5 ) and repeated here with the full relevant part states : “ Those born “ in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , ” U.S. Const. , amend .
XIV , have been considered American citizens under American law in effect since the time of the founding , United States v. Wong Kim Ark , 169 U.S. 649 , 674-75 ( 1898 ) , and thus eligible for the presidency , ” However : Though the Court cited : United States v. Wong Kim Ark , 169 U.S. 649 ; that case has absolutely nothing to do with , and makes no reference to either ‘ Presidential candidacy ’ or the “ natural born citizen ” requirement for Presidential candidacy ; wherefore , it is misquoted , off - point and has no meritorious application to this subject matter .
The New Hampshire Court already recognized in its ruling that it does not have standing to rule on the ‘ Presidential candidacy ’ ; so , when , after citing US v. Wong Kim Ark , it voiced its conclusion in error : “ and thus eligible for the presidency , see , e.g. , Schneider v. Rusk , 377 U.S. 163 , 165 ( 1964 ) ( dicta ) ” it had no standing to make that errant conclusion ;
Further , after voicing that errant conclusion the court cited : “ Schneider v. Rusk , 377 U.S. 163 , 165 ( 1964 ) ( dicta ) ” as if it was supportive of that errant conclusion .
However , Schneider v. Rusk does not support that errant opinion ; in fact , in Schneider v. Rusk , the Supreme Court clearly rules exactly the opposite of the New Hampshire court ’s errant conclusion regarding the 14th Amendment ; check it out : “ Congress has the right to legislate with respect to the general class … Congress here … was aiming only to regulate and …what Congress did had been deemed appropriate not only by this country but by many others and is in keeping with traditional American concepts of citizenship .
We start from the premise that the rights of citizenship of the native born and of the naturalized person are of the same dignity and are coextensive .
The only difference drawn by the Constitution is that only the " natural born " citizen is eligible to be President .
Art. II , § 1 .
While the rights of citizenship of the native born derive from § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights of the naturalized citizen derive from satisfying , free of fraud , the requirements set by Congress , the latter , apart from the exception noted , " becomes a member of the society , possessing all the rights of a native citizen , and standing , in the view of the constitution , on the footing of a native .
The constitution does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge those rights .
The simple power of the national Legislature , is to prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization , and the exercise of this power exhausts it , so far as respects the individual . "
Osborn v. Bank of United States , 9 Wheat .
738 , 827 .
And see Luria v. United States , 231 U.S. 9 , 22 ; United States v. MacIntosh , 283 U.S. 605 , 624 ; Knauer v. United States , 328 U.S. 654 , 658 . ” ( red text emphasis added )
Please read the red text portion of that quote again and notice that , as a matter of fact , native born citizens have existed long before the Constitution was penned ; thus , it should be quite obvious that they do not derive any of their rights from the 14th Amendment .
Respectively , that is an obvious error in the Supreme Court ’s ruling — because native born citizens existed prior to the 14th Amendment it is obvious that their rights were never derived from § 1 of the 14th Amendment .
Respectively , even though such errors can exist in court rulings , those errors remain errors and cannot reasonably be used as precedent setting elements for any case that may follow them and the slightest challenge will automatically set grounds for an appellate overthrow of such following ruling .
Wherefore , given that every one of those cases cited within that last quote confirms both that Congress does not have the power to limit or grant rights that are naturally inherent to people and that , respectively , the naturalized citizen cannot be made eligible to be President by an act of Congress ; therefore , it should be quite clear that the United States Supreme Court has clearly distinguished that the only type of citizen that can qualify for the office of President of the United States of America is a : “ natural born Citizen ” ; not a : “ naturalized citizen ” and not merely a : “ native born ” citizen ; only a : “ natural born Citizen ” can qualify for that office .
Respectively , the Court made its third primary flaw when it misapplied the US v. Wong Kim Ark and the Schneider v. Rusk cases in contradiction to the United States Supreme Court ’s rulings regarding the same .
Respectively , this case sets no precedent , has no merit related to the subject manner and should never be followed .
" Ankeny v. Governor of Indiana ( Indiana 2008 – Appellate Court ) ruling : “ Based upon the language of Article II , Section 1 , Clause 4 and the guidance provided by Wong Kim Ark , we conclude that persons born within the borders of the United States are “ natural born Citizens ” for Article II , Section 1 purposes , regardless of the citizenship of their parents . ” "
The first of at least four primary flaws with this case having any relevance on the matter of either Øbama ’s candidacy or the definition of the Constitution ’s phrase : “ natural born Citizen ” is the Appellate Court first ruled regarding the lower court ’s Order dismissing the case for the cause that “ the Plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted ” ; thus , this case , as a matter of law , cannot set any precedent for the matter of candidacy because the case never acquired standing for an argument .
Therefore , as a matter of law , regardless of any pleadings filed in the case , and regardless of the Court ’s review of such pleadings , the case cannot be used to imply any viable ruling beyond the fact that : “ the Plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . ”
The second primary flaw : using cases that were misapplied to the argument , as shown above , does not render a cause for making a conclusion based upon the misapplied argument .
As shown above , the Wong Kim Ark case provided no relevant “ guidance ” regarding either ( a ) the matter of the meaning of the phrase “ natural born Citizen ” as it was used in the Constitution or ( b ) the matter qualifications for serving in the Presidency ; wherefore , the court erred by making that statement .
The third primary flaw : the Court erred when it ruled : “ Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution governs who is a citizen of the United States ” ; that amendment does not designate “ who is a citizen ” ; rather , it merely designates that regardless of whether a citizen is born or naturalized both those born and those naturalized are citizens both of the nation and of the nation ’s respective states .
Respectively , it is a well known fact that the people [ with their natural god given inherent rights ] existed long before the government ; and under their ( the peoples ’ )
God given inherent authority they formed the government ; with its Congress ; wherefore , though the people maintain the authority to create or change Congress , Congress has neither the capacity to change the people nor to modify the rights of the people ( Constitution 9th and 10th articles of Amendment ) ; respectively , Congress does not possess the authority to “ govern ” “ who is ” , or who is not , either a “ native citizen ” or a “ natural born Citizen . ”
The United States Supreme Court ’s put it this way in Osborn v. Bank of United States : “ … the party may originate under a law … and … Congress may …give a naturalized citizen , who is the mere creature of a law , a right to sue in the Courts of the United States … .
“ … the act of Congress … proceeds to bestow upon the being it has made , all the faculties and capacities which that being possesses .
Every act … grows out of this law , and is tested by it .
“ A naturalized citizen is indeed made a citizen under an act of Congress … .
He becomes a member of the society , possessing all the rights of a native citizen , and standing , in the view of the constitution , on the footing of a native .
The constitution does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge those rights .
The simple power of the national Legislature , is to prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization , and the exercise of this power exhausts it , so far as respects the individual .
The constitution then takes him up , and , among other rights , extends to him the capacity of suing in the Courts of the United States , precisely under the same circumstances under which a native might sue .
He is distinguishable in nothing from a native citizen , except so far as the constitution makes the distinction . ”
Then years later the Court again confirmed that distinction as follows : “ Citizenship obtained through naturalization is not a second - class citizenship .
It has been said that citizenship carries with it all of the rights and prerogatives of citizenship obtained by birth in this country " save that of eligibility to the Presidency . "
Luria v. United States , 231 U.S. 9 , 22 . ” And , Luria v. United States ibid. referring back to Osborn ibid.
states : “ Under our Constitution , a naturalized citizen stands on an equal footing with the native citizen in all respects , save that of eligibility to the Presidency .
Minor v. Happersett , 21 Wall .
162 , 165 ; Elk v. Wilkins , 112 U.S. 94 , 101 ; Osborn v. Bank , 9 Wheat .
738 , 827 . ” Luria v. United States ibid .
Respectively , it is clear that neither Congress nor the 14th Article of amendment can govern the existence or nature of a “ natural born Citizen ” ; respectively , neither Congress nor said 14th Article can govern or redefine the nature or meaning of the term “ natural born Citizen ” as it was used in the Constitution to control access to the Presidency .
The fourth primary flaw : the court provided no evidence , at all , of any relevant argument , or supportive case law , that would give cause for their opined conclusion that both a “ native born citizen ” and a “ natural born Citizen ” are the same thing .
All of the cases they referred to that dealt with citizenship either addressed the nature of a naturalized citizen or the nature of a native citizen ; none of them addressed the nature of a “ natural born Citizen ” ; which term is not otherwise defined in the Constitution ; wherefore , the meaning of the term must be taken in context of its usage by the framers of the Constitution in the time of their using that phrase .
Respectively , the rules of the English language alone designate that “ natural born ” is an adjective phrase modifying the proper noun “ Citizen ” .
Thus , the phrase must refer to that nature of citizenship that is defined by natural birth .
And , the only condition of natural birth that defines citizenship , regardless of any other consideration , is that condition where both the mother and the father of the child are citizens of the same country .
If either parent of the child is a citizen of a different country then the citizenship of the child is a matter of law , not nature .
Only in the condition of both parents being citizens of the same country is the citizenship of the child a function of the natural birth of the child .
Respectively , where the phrase “ native born ” defines the condition of where ( on the soil of what nation ) a child is born , the phrase “ natural born Citizen ” clearly defines the condition that both parents are citizens of the same country — regardless of where the child was born .
Respectively , given that those two distinctively different phrases have distinctively different meanings the court ’s exchanging the two as if they were interchangeable in also an obvious and critical error no one had opportunity to contest .
Though we have this listed as the fifth primary flaw , this flaw is the reason other courts errantly cite this case ; and , as such , it most damning of the flaws of this Indiana case : in this flaw , the court accurately proposed that to understand the constitutionally undefined term “ natural born Citizen ” we must go back to the time , and context , when the framers of the Constitution used that phrase ; however , rather than staying on - point with the issue of a “ natural born Citizen ” in the United States of America , they instead take an off - point tangent with a cursory review the English law ( of that time ) regarding subjugation to the King of England .
Of course , at that time , the only people in the U.S.A. that were subjects of any other person were slaves — and as a matter of law , slaves were property not citizens .
Respectively , subjugation and citizenship are two entirely different matters ; and , subjugation has no relationship to the constitutional phrase “ natural born Citizen ” .
Respectively , though English law both then and now recognizes that natural born citizenship is defined by the common citizenship of both parents , subjugation is defined by presence within the realm of the King — that is , if you are present ( within the realm of the King ) and do not have diplomatic immunity , you are subject to the King ; regardless of your citizenship .
Thus , when the Indiana court takes off on the unrelated tangent if subjugation , they made a critical error that rendered anything else they had to say on the matter irrelevant .
Nonetheless , because that court ( even though it has no jurisdiction over the matter ) took that tangent and so many others cited that case ( as if it had merit on the matter ) we will further address the distinction in law between subjects in Great Britain ’s feudal system and citizens in the U.S.A .
Great Britain ’s feudal system is a class system that recognizes everyone in Great Britain ( other than those protected by diplomatic immunity ) is subject to the King .
In fact , in Great Britain , the master group of “ people ” is divided into the following classes of people : ( 1 ) the Sovereign ( that is the King and or Queen ) ; ( 2 ) subjects ; and , ( 3 ) aliens .
The class of subjects is further divided into either “ free ” or “ unfree ” people and in countries within the realm ( Domain controlled by the King ) where slaves are permitted there may also be slaves ( which are not considered as people ; rather , slaves are property ) .
Thus , slaves do not fit within the classes of “ people ” unless they become “ free ” by some action of law .
Respectively , the unfree people include the subclasses of : serfs , bondmen / bondwomen / indentured and “ villeins ” .
Villeins includes but is not limited to people that were born of parents that are not both citizens of Great Britain ; regardless of where the child is born .
Illegitimate children ( unless they are the progeny of a slave ) are considered “ free ” because they are not related to any lawful right to inherit anything from anyone .
Only “ free ” people can have or attain the class status of “ citizen ” ; and , only citizens ( or those of a higher class ) can have either the right of suffrage ( the right to vote ) or the right to hold office .
The principle of “ Citizenship ” in Great Britain is , to this day , derived from Ancient Roman Law ; as quoted here from the Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica : “ ‘ Civitas ’ , plural Civitates , citizenship in ancient Rome .
Roman citizenship was acquired by birth if both parents were Roman citizens ( cives ) ” .
Though , it is not necessary for us to , here , present a legal brief or treatise on this matter ( showing the distinction between each of these classes in the feudal system of Great Britain ( there are many classes between the throne of the King and the lowliest unfree peasant ) , we will here address only these final points : in Great Britain , as in Rome , there was a significant difference between citizens and all others — citizenship was not only a matter of parentage wherein children naturally born ( not adopted ) , it was a matter directly tied to the property owned by those parents , their right to vote and hold office in that venue .
Thus , whenever a citizen was introduced to another person their standing as citizen was announce like this : “ I am pleased to introduce ‘ John of Nottingham ’ . ”
Notice the name of the city or parcel of land from which their inheritance came was announced to the person ’s name ; if the person being announced was of the peerage ( noble birth ) then their title comes before the name and the family name follows .
Respectively , in Great Britain ( a feudal monarchy ) , the only party that owns land in the entire monarchy is the King and / or Queen .
Thus , the final point of distinction between citizens in the U.S.A. and subjects in Great Britain is : in Great Britain only the King and / or Queen are Sovereign and can own Land ; yet , in the U.S.A none of the people are subjects and all of the people have the sovereign right to own land .
Thus , the Constitutional phrase : “ natural born Citizen ” has no relation the issue of subjugation in Great Britain ; and , to this day that phrase has the same meaning it did at the time when the framers of our Constitution penned those words , as it is and was in Great Britain and as it was , even back to the time of ancient Roman Law ; and that meaning is paraphrased here as follows : “ natural born Citizenship in the U.S.A. is acquired only when both parents of the child are citizens of the U.S.A. at the time of the birth of the child . ”
Again , back to the first of the five listed primary flaws : the reason no one had opportunity to contest this obviously erroneous ruling is because the only cause for appeal that could possibly be raised before this court was the one cause created by the court ’s ruling — “ the case failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted ” .
To that cause that court ruled : “ ( W ) e note that the Plaintiffs do not cite to any authority recognizing that the Governor has a duty to determine the eligibility of a party 's nominee for the presidency .
The Plaintiffs do not cite to authority , nor do they develop a cogent legal argument stating that a certificate of ascertainment has any relation to the eligibility of the candidates . ”
Respectively , the court affirmed the lower court ’s order to dismiss .
Then , though the issues of the case were moot , the court entertained the moot , de novo , review as noted above .
However , we must remember that the court has already acknowledged that it does not have jurisdiction over that subject matter ; respectively , it is not appealable .
In other words , the moot review is irrelevant to the ruling .
The bottom line : because no limitation in law limits someone that does not qualify for the office from running for the office of President ; thus , the relief requested could not be granted by the Indiana Court system ; and , accordingly , the meaning of the constitutional phrase : “ natural born Citizen ” is beyond the scope of the Indiana court ’s jurisdiction ; and cannot stand as precedent setting in any jurisdiction .
Respectively , this case sets no precedent , has no merit related to the subject manner and should never be followed .
" Tisdale v. Øbama ( Virginia federal court 2012 ) ruling : “ It is well settled that those born in the United States are considered natural born citizens . ” "
Though the quote listed above appears to be a quote from this court it is actually the same misquoted reference we responded to in our response to Hollander at paragraph 1 above ; respectively , there is no point in repeating that response here .
Again though this case was dismissed because it had no standing in the Federal court , Tisdale appealed the case at Tisdale v. Øbama , Court of Appeals , 4th Circuit , No. 12-1124 ( 2012 ) ; where we learn that the nature of the underlying case was a USC Title 42 § 1983 complaint ; however , Title 42 § 1983 is a civil rights statute that relates only to parties that violate someone ’s civil rights “ under the color of State law ” .
Accordingly , the case described nothing that could be possibly be construed as such a “ color of State Law ” violation .
Thus , the court ruled the case had no standing .
Though the Trial Court ’s Order did not go into that matter ( we only learned that the case was a Title 42 issue from the subsequent Appeal ) , regardless of any other issue , the court was right in ruling that the case had no standing because it presented no standing for a Title 42 § 1983 cause of action .
Respectively , given that the case had no standing the only issue anyone could possibly appeal would be the court ’s actual ruling that the case had no standing ; respectively any opinions voiced by the court outside of that issue alone would have no basis for appeal ; so , as a matter of law , such opinions expressed by a court can never set a precedent because they were never made in a way where any party had a chance to contest the same .
Thus , they merely stand as the opinion of the man that expressed the opinion and have no real weight in law at all .
Respectively , this case sets no precedent , has no merit related to the subject manner and should never be followed .
" Purpura v. Øbama ( New Jersey 2012 ) ruling : “ No court , federal , state or administrative , has accepted the challengers ’ position that Mr. Øbama is not a “ natural born Citizen ” due to the acknowledged fact that his father was born in Kenya and was a British citizen by virtue of the then applicable British Nationality Act .
Nor has the fact that Øbama had , or may have had , dual citizenship at the time of his birth and thereafter been held to deny him the status of natural born .
It is unnecessary to reinvent the wheel here .
…
The petitioners ’ legal position on this issue , however well intentioned , has no merit in law .
Thus , accepting for the point of this issue that Mr. Øbama was born in Hawaii , he is a ‘ natural born Citizen ’ regardless of the status of his father . ” "
This case was brought as an administrative action before the New Jersey Secretary of State ; respectively , it was heard before an administrative law judge ( hereinafter “ ALJ ” ) who made a determination that was provided as an advisement to the Secretary of State ; who then ruled on the matter following that advisement .
The case was later appealed to the New Jersey Court of Appeals ( see : Purpura v. Øbama ) ; where the appellate court affirmed the Secretary of State ’s opinion .
However , the advisement from the ALJ followed the Ankeny v. Governor of Indiana ruling as if it had merit and as with that case went off - point on the issue of subjugation to a king instead of natural born citizenship and ignored the fact that even English law both then and now recognizes the distinction between native born and natural born .
However , the courts correctly ruled that the issue of the presidential candidate capacity to serve in the office has nothing to do with their ability to be nominated to run for office — wherefore again , the case was dismissed because it raised no meritorious cause of action .
Where New Jersey again , followed the same errors and cited the above errant arguments that were proposed , without option for appeal or opposing argument , those opinions remain as non precedent setting opinions all of which , as a matter of law , remain in error — however , because the plaintiffs failed to proceed forward contesting the court ’s following those errant arguments the arguments that could have been raised were never raised and the issue was dropped by the Plaintiff / Appellants ’ failure to prosecute .
Respectively , this case sets no precedent , has no merit related to the subject manner and should never be followed .
" Voeltz v. Øbama ( Florida 2012 ) ruling : “ However , the United States Supreme Court has concluded that ‘ [ e ] very person born in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , becomes at once a citizen of the United States .
‘ Other courts that have considered the issue in the context of challenges to the qualifications of candidates for the office of President of the United States have come to the same conclusion .
[ The judge cites Hollander and Ankeny ] " Again , the Plaintiff ’s “ failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted ” and that removed any issue beyond that cause from any elemental cause of appeal .
In this case , at the time when the case was brought , Øbama was not even a candidate for the election in that State !
Wherefore , the case was totally frivolous .
It was amazing that the court even allowed it to have a review .
In the Court ’s Order the judge did venture into the off - point subject matter and followed the same misquoted references from Hollander and Ankney ; to which we responded paragraphs 1 and 2 above ; respectively , there is no point in repeating those responses again here .
Respectively , this case sets no precedent , has no merit related to the subject manner and should never be followed .
" Voeltz v. Øbama ( 2nd suit Florida 2012 ) ruling : “ In addition , to the extent that the complaint alleges that President Øbama is not a “ natural born citizen ” even though born in the United States , the Court is in agreement with other courts that have considered this issue , namely , that persons born within the borders of the United States are “ natural born citizens ” for Article II , Section 1 purpose , regardless of the citizenship of their parents .
[ Citations to Wong , Hollander , Ankeny ] . "
In this case , the Florida 2nd Judicial Circuit Court correctly ruled that the Plaintiff filed a complaint for relief under Florida Statutes § 102.168 but failed to “ and can not state a cause of action for the relief requested ” because that statute “ is not applicable to the nomination of a candidate for the Office of President of the United States . ”
Nonetheless , the court took the time to respond further to the case and in its
Order dismissing the case the court correctly ruled : “ this Court lacks the jurisdiction to consider ” the matter .
The Plaintiff ’s attorney offered to amend the complaint ; but , the Court correctly ruled that ‘ nothing could be done to amend the complaint to correct its defects ’ .
At that point , the Court reviewed the same cases referenced above and followed the same pattern of misquoting and misapplying those cases as if any of those rulings were either meritorious or applicable .
Of course , that is the danger of such courts voicing opinions beyond the scope of that which can be argued either in those courts or on appeal .
The fact that such Orders are published even though they have no merit and fail under the test of actual historical facts and law , they appear even though as a matter of law they cannot possibly set any precedent or be considered as a valid opinion of any court .
Even though the underlying case had no merit , in 2013 the Plaintiff ’s frivolously appealed the case to the Florida 1st District Court of Appeals [ recorded at : 134 So.3d 1049 ( 2013 ) ] ; where the appeal correctly was : “ DISMISSED as moot . ” : the Appellant then petitioned that court for a rehearing ; which was also : “ DISMISSED as moot . ”
The Appellant then appealed the case to the Florida Supreme Court with a motion for a Writ of Mandamus [ recorded at : 126 So.3d 1059 ( 2013 ) ] ; which appeal , with its motions , was also denied and that decision was not published — again , the underlying case was moot ; wherefore , the appeals were frivolous .
Again , each of those appellate courts were correct in their ruling of the case as “ moot ” — it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and thus had no standing — period .
The same remains the affect of the extraneous opinions of each of these courts that express opinions on what they think would have happened if such a case would have been properly brought in a proper venue under a proper cause of action — such opinions can set no precedent and have no standing in law .
Of course , when court after court cites back to such errant opinions as if they had merit and were precedent setting it creates the appearance to others ignorant of how the law actually works making it appear as if the issues therein related may have merit ; and , that is exactly why the people must learn the truth and learn to use the law to properly raise this issue in a proper venue where the matter can be resolved in accord with the law .
Respectively , in such cases , if the opposition raises such frivolous arguments then the actual facts , law and history can easily be shown to defeat such frivolous arguments — only then will the truth prevail .
Respectively , this case sets no precedent , has no merit related to the subject manner and should never be followed .
" Allen v. Øbama ( Arizona 2012 ) ruling : “ Most importantly , Arizona courts are bound by United States Supreme Court precedent in construing the United States Constitution , Arizona v. Jay J. Garfield Bldg. Co. , 39 Ariz. 45 , 54 , 3 P.2d 983 , 986( 1931 ) , and this precedent fully supports that President Øbama is a natural born citizen under the Constitution and thus qualified to hold the office of President .
… Contrary to Plaintiff ’s assertion , Minor v. Happersett , 88 U.S. 162 ( 1874 ) , does not hold otherwise ” "
The heading of the internet based article this entire review was made against is : “ Øbama Conspiracy Theories : Fishin g for gold coins in a bucket of mud since 2008 ” ; and quote here , in their 7th paragraph , ( quoted above ) presented out of context , as if it were argument , is the one that demonstrates the age old adage of the “ pot calling the kettle black ” ; for , therein they allege that the Arizona v. Jay J. Garfield Bldg.
Co. case sets a “ precedent fully support ( ing the allegation ) that President Øbama is a natural born citizen under the Constitution most obvious ” ( parenthetical content added for clarity replacing an “ s ” ) .
That case has nothing whatsoever to do with any issue related to citizenship , presidential qualifications or any issue related to the same ; respectively , it has been cited by the Arizona courts many times to designate the fact that Arizona courts are required to follow precedents set by the United States Supreme Court ; however , in this case , the United States Supreme Court has set no precedent defining the constitutional term “ natural born Citizen ” ; which , is the very reason for so many varying opinions regarding that issue .
Respectively , as is properly noted in the Indiana ’s Ankeny v. Governor ruling , because the term is not defined in the Constitution , as a matter of law it falls to the meaning of the term as it was used by the framers of the Constitution at the time when the Constitution was formed .
Wherefore , as referenced above , the definition of that phrase both at that time and now is : “ ( T ) he only condition of natural birth that defines citizenship , regardless of any other consideration , is that condition where both the mother and the father of the child are citizens of the same country . ”
Placing that quote back in context of the Arizona court ’s ruling we find that the only case the court cited that could possibly be alleged as one related in any way to citizenship is US v Wong , ibid . ; and , as noted above that case has nothing whatsoever to do with either the constitutional t
Henry Ford 's first Model - T was built to run on hemp gasoline and the CAR ITSELF WAS CONSTRUCTED FROM HEMP !
On his large estate , Ford was photographed among his hemp fields .
The car , ' grown from the soil , ' had hemp plastic panels whose impact strength was 10 times stronger than steel ; Popular Mechanics , 1941 .
http://www.illuminati-news.com/marijuana-conspiracy.htm
Rudolf Diesel , the inventor of the diesel engine , designed it to run on vegetable and seed oils like hemp ; he actually ran the thing on peanut oil for the 1900 World 's Fair .
Henry Ford used hemp to not only construct cars but also fuel them .
As an alternative to methanol , hemp has at least one glowing report : the plant produces up to four times more cellulose per acre than trees .
And a hemp crop grows a little quicker than a forest .
As for an alternative to petroleum ...
Hemp grows like mad from border to border in America ; so shortages are unlikely .
And , unlike petrol , unless we run out of soil , hemp is renewable .
Growing and harvesting the stuff has much less environmental impact than procuring oil .
Hemp fuel is biodegradable ; so oil spills become fertilizer not eco-catastrophes .
Hemp fuel does not contribute to sulfur dioxide air poisoning .
Other noxious emissions like carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are radically slashed by using " biodiesel .
Hemp fuel is nontoxic and only a mild skin irritant ; anybody who , s ever cleaned out an old carburetor with gasoline can confirm the same is not true for petrol .
Growing hemp for fuel would be a tremendous boon for American farmers and the agricultural industry , as opposed to people like , say , the Bush family .
And that , s why hemp might not go anywhere as a fuel alternative .
Oil interests are big and donate likewise to politicians , and selling a man on an idea that will cost him more than he , ll benefit requires an amazingly skilled orator -- or a gun .
Unfortunately , unless you , re the federal government , gunpoint conversions are usually illegal .
Ergo , PR is about the best bet right now .
There are many people working hard on this front , including the Hemp Car and its intrepid crew .
Currently ginning up for a trans - America evangelism tour , the Hemp Car plans to spread the good word of hemp - fuel viability at stops in both the U.S. and Canada .
For whatever good it will do , they should make sure to stop by Washington , D.C. , and have a word with President George W. Bush .
The current oil crisis and our nation , s dependency on sometimes - persnickety foreign sources might find the new chief executive with an open mind to fuel sources other than Texas tea -- regardless of his oily bank accounts .
And , while salvaging his dad 's legacy is not Goal 1 for Dubya , it might also help him look more forward thinking in terms of energy policy and the environment .
Of course , hemp fuel may never take off .
It might dry up like all those hemp crops left unattended after the feds banned their cultivation in the 1930s .
One way or the other , Bush should consider freeing up the market to innovate with alternative fuels like hemp oil -- it couldn , t hurt , and it stands the chance to help .
In so doing , he , ll end his term with a far better moniker than the " environmental president . "
For , if other policy decisions he makes go in a similar direction , we can perhaps call him the " free - market president . "

Fuel of the Future When Henry Ford told a New York Times reporter that ethyl alcohol was " the fuel of the future " in 1925 , he was expressing an opinion that was widely shared in the automotive industry .
" The fuel of the future is going to come from fruit like that sumach out by the road , or from apples , weeds , sawdust -- almost anything , " he said .
" There is fuel in every bit of vegetable matter that can be fermented .
There 's enough alcohol in one year 's yield of an acre of potatoes to drive the machinery necessary to cultivate the fields for a hundred years . "
Ford recognized the utility of the hemp plant .
He constructed a car of resin stiffened hemp fiber , and even ran the car on ethanol made from hemp .
Ford knew that hemp could produce vast economic resources if widely cultivated .
Ford 's optimistic appraisal of cellulose and crop based ethyl alcohol fuel can be read in several ways .
First , it can be seen as an oblique jab at a competitor .
General Motors had come to considerable grief that summer of 1925 over another octane boosting fuel called tetra - ethyl lead , and government officials had been quietly in touch with Ford engineers about alternatives to leaded gasoline additives .
Secondly , by 1925 the American farms that Ford loved were facing an economic crisis that would later intensify with the depression .
Although the causes of the crisis were complex , one possible solution was seen in creating new markets for farm products .
With Ford 's financial and political backing , the idea of opening up industrial markets for farmers would be translated into a broad movement for scientific research in agriculture that would be labelled " Farm Chemurgy . "

Why Henry 's plans were delayed for more than a half century : Ethanol has been known as a fuel for many decades .
Indeed , when Henry Ford designed the Model T , it was his expectation that ethanol , made from renewable biological materials , would be a major automobile fuel .
However , gasoline emerged as the dominant transportation fuel in the early twentieth century because of the ease of operation of gasoline engines with the materials then available for engine construction , a growing supply of cheaper petroleum from oil field discoveries , and intense lobbying by petroleum companies for the federal government to maintain steep alcohol taxes .
Many bills proposing a National energy program that made use of Americas vast agricultural resources ( for fuel production ) were killed by smear campaigns launched by vested petroleum interests .
One noteworthy claim put forth by petrol companies was that the U.S. government 's plans " robbed taxpayers to make farmers rich " .

" Certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of CCTV in schools , and strict safeguards for its use .
Although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes , such as discouraging vandalism and violence , we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled . "
66 - year - old minister claims hospital guards tased him over joke

A reverend claims security guards dragged him out of a Toledo , Ohio hospital and tasered and beat him because he told a joke , CBS reported Friday .
Rev. Al Poisson said he was visiting the hospital to see a man who had been injured while Poisson was shopping with his 6 - year - old grandson .
According to the reverend , an innocent joke about the lack of a smile on a guard 's face led to a beating .
Security cameras caught the incident on camera and show at least five officers surrounding a man laying on the floor and beating him .
" It wound up being an atrocious , unbelievable situation , to say the least , " the 66 - year - old minister said .
" They 've cut about five minutes of this video out , " Poisson said , describing the length of time he was kicked on the ground by one of the younger guards .
St. Vincent Mercy Medical Center issued a statement defending the guards ' actions which said " the response to the aggression was appropriate . "
The hospital pressed charges against Poisson for assault that were eventually thrown out of court , Poisson said .
Poisson is filing a lawsuit with his lawyer Stevin Groth .
" We 're going to use the American justice system , put this in front of a jury and let them decide what 's appropriate , " Groth said .

Mr Bush also faced criticism at the summit after Silvio Berlusconi , the Italian Prime Minister , was described in the White House press pack given to journalists as one of the " most controversial leaders in the history of a country known for government corruption and vice " .
Sixty countries backed by the World Bank and most UN bodies yesterday called for radical changes in world farming to avert increasing regional food shortages , escalating prices and growing environmental problems .
But in a move that has led to the US , UK , Australia and Canada not yet endorsing the report , the authors said GM technology was not a quick fix to feed the world 's poor and argued that growing biofuel crops for automobiles threatened to increase worldwide malnutrition .
The report was issued as the UN's World Food Programme called for rich countries to contribute $ 500 m ( £ 255 m ) to immediately address a growing global food crisis which has seen staple food price rises of up to 80 % in some countries , and food riots in many cities .
According to the World Bank , 33 countries are now in danger of political destabilisation and internal conflict following food price inflation .
The authors of the 2,500 - page International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development [ IAASTD ] say the world produces enough food for everyone , yet more than 800 million people go hungry .
" Food is cheaper and diets are better than 40 years ago , but malnutrition and food insecurity threaten millions , " they write .
" Rising populations and incomes will intensify food demand , especially for meat and milk which will compete for land with crops , as will biofuels .
The unequal distribution of food and conflict over control of the world 's dwindling natural resources presents a major political and social challenge to governments , likely to reach crisis status as climate change advances and world population expands from 6.7 billion to 9.2 billion by 2050 . "
Robert Watson , director of IAASTD and chief scientist at the UK Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , said : " Business as usual will hurt the poor .
It will not work .
We have to applaud global increases in food production but not everyone has benefited .
We have not succeeded globally .
In some parts of India 50 % of children are still malnourished .
That is not success . "
Watson said governments and industry focused too narrowly on increasing food production , with little regard for natural resources or food security .
" Continuing with current trends would mean the earth 's haves and have - nots splitting further apart , " he said .
"
It would leave us facing a world nobody would want to inhabit .
We have to make food more affordable and nutritious without degrading the land . "
The report - the first significant attempt to involve governments , NGOs and industries from rich and poor countries - took 400 scientists four years to complete .
The present system of food production and the way food is traded around the world , the authors concluded , has led to a highly unequal distribution of benefits and serious adverse ecological effects and was now contributing to climate change .
The authors say science and technology should be targeted towards raising yields but also protecting soils , water and forests .
" Investment in agricultural science has decreased yet we urgently need sustainable ways to produce food .
Incentives for science to address the issues that matter to the poor are weak , " said Watson .
The GM industry , which helped fund the report , together with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation , the World Health Organisation and the British and US governments , abandoned talks last year after heated debate .
The scientists said they saw little role for GM , as it is currently practised , in feeding the poor on a large scale .
" Assessment of the technology lags behind its development , information is anecdotal and contradictory , and uncertainty about possible benefits and damage is unavoidable , " said the report .
" The short answer to whether transgenic crops can feed the world is ' no ' .
But they could contribute .
We must understand their costs and benefits , " said Watson yesterday .
The authors also warned that the global rush to biofuels was not sustainable .
" The diversion of crops to fuel can raise food prices and reduce our ability to alleviate hunger .
The negative social effects risk being exacerbated in cases where small - scale farmers are marginalised or displaced form their land , " they said .
Responding to the report , a group of eight international environment and consumer groups , including Third World Network , Practical Action , Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth , said in a statement : " This is a sobering account of the failure of industrial farming .
Small - scale farmers and ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the current food crisis and meet the needs of communities . "
Lim Li Chung , of Third World Network in Malaysia , said : " It clearly shows that small - scale farmers and the environment lose under trade liberalisation .
Developing countries must exercise their right to stop the flood of cheap subsidised products from the north . "
Guilhem Calvo , an adviser with the ecological and earth sciences division of Unesco , one of the report 's sponsors , said at a news conference in Paris : " We must develop agriculture that is less dependent on fossil fuels , favours the use of locally available resources and explores the use of natural processes such as crop rotation and use of organic fertilisers . "
At a glance
Bio-energy
The report says biofuels compete for land and water with food crops and are inefficient .
They can cause deforestation and damage soils and water .
Biotechnology
The use of GM crops , where the technology is not contained , is contentious , the UN says .
Data on some crops indicate highly variable yield gains in some places and declines in others .
Climate change
While modest temperature rises may increase food yields in some areas , a general warming risks damaging all regions of the globe .
There will be serious potential for conflict over habitable land .
Trade and markets
Subsidies distort the use of resources and benefit industrialised nations at the expense of developing countries .
Owners of the ultimate geek car , the DeLorean , are no strangers to modifying their McFly rides , including hovercraft and electric conversions of the iconic silver - skinned sports car .
Now , thanks to the new DeLorean Motor Company , buyers of new DeLoreans and owners of the classic ones can outfit them with everything but a Mr. Fusion .
We stopped by the new DMC 's headquarters in Houston , where we got the scoop on the new DeLorean and more importantly , what you can now do with the old one .

Check out our drive of the DeLorean DMC - 12
We reported last year DeLorean Motor Company plans to make a series of " new build " modernized DeLoreans with all the amenities you 'd expect in today 's luxury cars .
What we did n't know until our tour this past week , was all of the accessories for the new DeLorean ( really , the " new build " DeLoreans will use 80 % originally manufactured parts and 20 % upgraded parts ) are already available to current owners of the classic DeLorean DMC - 12 .
What else would you expect from the ultimate " Geek " car ?

At least that 's how Stephen Wynne , sitting atop a mountain of parts large enough to rebuild hundreds of the steel - bodied , gullwinged Delorean DMC - 12 sports cars , describes those who own and continually modernize the unique automobiles .
But he means " geeks " in a good way .
His company exists thanks primarily to the abundance of originally manufactured parts left after production stopped in late 1982 .
These parts are still being purchased today by owners of the approximately 6,000 to 7,000 cars still estimated to be driving around .
Though most collectors of classics pride themselves on their ability to recreate their cars as originally and authentically as possible , the relative ease of doing so with a DeLorean has meant owners are creating modern cars within the old stainless steel shells .
Sure , you can point to the extreme end of the customization scale — cars like the Electric DeLorean , which is more than just a golf - cart motor and a few batteries .
This is a fully - functioning electric car with a range of around 30 to 35 miles that 's actually faster in the quarter mile than the stock , V6 - powered DMC - 12 .
Another extreme example is the DeLorean Hovercraft attempted by the crew at Monster Garage .

But it's at the mundane end where the real story is taking place .
The stock original DeLorean came with an AM / FM radio and tapedeck , but DeLorean now offers an Alpine IVA system with a 7 " display , Eclipse speakers , JL Audio subwoofer and Genesis P - 5 Amplifier .
Assuming you do n't go back too far in the future ( to before the advent of satellites ) , a navigation system with live traffic and satellite radio is available .
Ca n't see past the flux capacitor ?
Try adding the backup camera .
Gotta call back to Doc Brown 's lab ?
The Bluetooth cellular interface is probably a smart option .
The iPod interface is also a good choice no matter what audio / video system you add ; that way you can listen to Stainless Style , the concept album about the life of John DeLorean that 's also a lot of fun to listen to .

To help push all of that new technology , DMC is also offering an upgrade to the engine that includes new stainless steel headers , muffler and tips , ignition system upgrades , a K&N filter , a cold air intake and other parts .
The combination results in nearly 200 HP , making it perform at a level that 'll allow daily drivers to survive on the highway .
A refined sports suspension , featuring new shocks and springs , also helps keep the cars comfortable and sporty .
And if you 're a super DeLorean geek , the headquarters outside of Houston , Texas is a must - see .
In addition to the large collection of cars ( it 's strange seeing that many of them in one place ) and nearly 1,000 of the gullwing doors , there 's an original Back To The Future pinball machine in the lobby .
Pet shop clerks throughout Tijuana acknowledge that foreigners regularly inquire about the drug .
“ We ’ve probably had 100 people come in asking for the drug in the last couple years , ” said Pepe Velazquez , a veterinarian and owner of El Toro pharmacy .
Until El Norte , a regional newspaper , published an article recently that detailed how easy it was to buy pentobarbital  and how foreigners intended to use it  many store owners and clerks said they assumed the customers were using the drug to end the lives of their animals .
“ We did n’t have any idea what they were doing , ” said a sales clerk at a pet shop called California .
“ It ’s for animals .
Everything here is for animals .
We thought they were giving it to their animals . ”
It turns out that they were buying it for human consumption .
Mr. Nitschke estimates that 300 members of his group , most of them from Australia but some from the United States and Europe , have bought the drug in Mexico in recent years .
Some save it for when their health fails to the point that they no longer wish to live .
In a few instances , buyers took the drug while in Mexico .
“ To witness it , it looks as peaceful as can be , ” Mr. Nitschke said of death by pentobarbital .
“ I usually recommend that they take it with their favorite drink since it has a bitter taste .
I ’ve never seen anyone finish their whiskey or Champagne .
There is n’t enough time to give a speech .
You go to sleep and then you die . ”
But now that word is out that the drug is being used for human consumption , local authorities are seeking to clamp down on unauthorized purchases .
Shops are now supposed to sell the drug only to licensed veterinarians who present a prescription .
Millions of pounds of lead used in hunting , fishing and shooting sports wind up in the environment each year and can threaten or kill wildlife , according to a new report from the U.S. Geological Survey .
Lead has long been known to be damaging to biology .
It 's previous use in gasoline , paint , pesticides , and solder in food cans has nearly been eliminated .
Lead shot was banned for waterfowl hunting in 1991 , but its use in ammunition for upland hunting , shooting sports , and in fishing tackle remains common .
Numerous previous studies have documented adverse effects to wildlife , especially waterbirds and scavenging species , like hawks and eagles , the researchers say .
Lead exposure from ingested lead shot , bullets , and fishing sinkers also has been reported in reptiles , and studies near shooting ranges have shown evidence of lead poisoning in small mammals .
The USGS released images of a young eagle with lead shot inside it and the stomach of a pelican loaded with fishing gear .
Outdoor shooting ranges overall are thought to use more than 80,000 tons of lead shot and bullets each year , according to the report .
Precise estimates are not available for lead fishing tackle in the environment , but about 4,382 tons of lead fishing sinkers are sold each year in the United States .
Frequently used upland hunting fields were found to have as much as 400,000 shot per acre .
The most significant hazard to wildlife is through direct ingestion of spent lead shot and bullets , lost fishing sinkers and tackle , and related fragments , or through consumption of wounded or dead prey containing lead shot , bullets or fragments , said U.S. Geological Survey contaminants experts Barnett Rattner and Chris Franson .
The two scientists are lead authors of a new Wildlife Society technical report and co-authors with five other experts of a recent Fisheries department article on the same subject .
" Science is replete with evidence that ingestion of spent ammunition and fishing tackle can kill birds , " Rattner said .
" The magnitude of poisoning in some species such as waterfowl , eagles , California condors , swans and loons , is daunting .
For this reason , on July 1 , 2008 , the state of California put restrictions on the use of lead ammunition in parts of the range of the endangered California condor because the element poses such a threat to this endangered species . "
Lead poisoning causes behavioral , physiological , and biochemical effects , and often death .
The rate of mortality is high enough to affect the populations of some wildlife species , the scientists conclude .
Although fish ingest sinkers , jigs , and hooks , mortality in fish seems to be related to injury , blood loss , exposure to air and exhaustion rather than the lead toxicity that affects warm - blooded species .
Lead can also slowly dissolve and enter groundwater , making it potentially hazardous for plants , animals , and perhaps even people if it enters water bodies or is taken up in plant roots , the study points out .
For example , said Rattner , dissolved lead can result in lead contamination in groundwater near some shooting ranges and at heavily hunted sites , particularly those hunted year after year .
Some states have limited the use of lead shot in upland areas to minimize such effects , and others are considering such restrictions , according to a USGS statement .
Environmentally safe alternatives to lead shot and sinkers exist and are available in North America and elsewhere , but use of these alternatives is not widespread , according to the report .
1 Block Off the Grid Rolling Out California 's Largest Community Solar Initiative
August 19th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
San Francisco - based 1 Block Off the Grid ( 1BOG ) announced today that it is teaming up with Real Goods Solar for a 100 - home solar campaign in the city .
1 Block Off the Grid is an initiative that promotes residential renewable energy systems through education , private finance , and community purchase programs .
Essentially , the organization uses the power of community as a bargaining chip to make solar more accessible to homeowners .
With this initial solar campaign , 1BOG was able to negotiate up to 48 % off 2 kW solar systems from the market price for its participants .
According to 1BOG Founder and Managing Partner Sylvia Ventura , 2 kW is the average size of a home - based solar system in San Francisco .
Now that 1BOG has partnered with Real Goods Solar for solar panel installations , members can begin to reap the benefits of community - based solar .
“ There ’s a much shorter payback period with the 1BOG rebate , ” said Ventura .
And 1BOG is n’t stopping with San Francisco .
The company already has 40 people signed up in Washington , DC , 15 people signed up in Las Vegas , and a number of people signed up in Portland , Oregon .
Ultimately 1BOG hopes to expand into 12 cities .
“ We definitely have a lot of work ahead of us , ” said Ventura .
“ But right now our priority is to complete the San Francisco campaign — to have a proof of concept . ”
If the first campaign works out , sign me up for the second .

Talks on a new world trade pact broke down without agreement here Tuesday , delegates said , after more than a week of bitter wrangling .
“ The package that we were able to negotiate and agree on Friday night is not going to carry the day , ” US Trade Representative Susan Schwab told reporters as she left a meeting of key trading powers , referring to an earlier breakthrough on a deal proposed by WTO chief Pascal Lamy .
New Zealand Trade Minister Phil Goff confirmed that talks had collapsed .
“ We wo n’t see a conclusion to the round this year , ” he told reporters as he left the meeting .
Ministers had struggled for more than a week to close differences on subsidies and import tariffs to forge a new deal under the World Trade Organization ’s Doha Round , launched seven years ago .
Delegates said negotiations stumbled over proposals for import tariff measures to protect poor farmers that would impose a special tariff on certain agricultural goods in the event of an import surge or price fall .
India and the United States were sharply divided over the so - called special safeguard mechanism ( SSM ) .
“ The United States and India did not accept the compromise proposals , and arrived at an impasse , ” a source close to the talks told AFP , adding that the negotiations had broken down .
Some developing countries such as India wanted that mechanism to kick in at a lower import surge level than has been proposed in order to protect their millions of poor farmers from starvation .
Others wanted it to take effect at a higher rate .
India ’s Commerce Minister Kamal Nath had dug in his heels over the proposed tariff thresholds , claiming the backing of around 100 developing nations .
With both sides refusing to give way , acrimony had grown on Monday with the United States publicly accusing India and China of holding up progress .
Schwab described the final meeting as “ very disappointing . ”
“ Throughout the last 10 days , and in the months and years prior to this , the United States have shown leadership in trying to get this done .
We remain committed to the Doha round , ” she said .
“ It is critical that we move forward . ”
“ The gulf between the major parties on the SSM was too wide to bridge , ” Goff said .
“ That was the issue that has prevented these talks moving forward to conclusion . ”

Queen 's stockbroker raided by police and city watchdogs in biggest ever crackdown on insider trading
The Queen 's stockbroker Cazenove has been caught up in Britain 's biggest ever crackdown on insider trading .
Eight people were arrested in dawn raids yesterday by the City watchdog the Financial Services Authority .
Cazenove admitted that one of the arrested worked at its London offices as a sub-contractor .
A 40 - strong team from the FSA swooped on addresses in London and the South East with back - up from City of London police .
Cazenove , the Queen 's stockbroker , has been at the centre of police raids into insider trading
They are believed to have seized computers and paperwork .
The FSA says insider dealing - in which privileged information is used to make profits from share prices - is rife among financial institutions .
Yesterday 's swoop is the fourth this year , and the watchdog warns that more are to come as part of a ' major ongoing investigation ' .
The news is further embarrassment for Cazenove , which only last week had its reputation sullied over insider dealing allegations .
Malcolm Calvert , 64 , a former trader and partner of Cazenove , was charged with 12 counts of insider dealing involving £ 1 million worth of shares .
He denies the charges .
A spokesman for Cazenove said last night : ' We can confirm that a sub - contractor in a support function for Cazenove was one of the eight people arrested by the FSA . '
The prestigious bank can trace its history back to the 17th century .
Staffed by public schoolboys and with an impressive list of clients , it played an important part in the round of privatisations in the 1980s .
In 2004 it joined forces with U.S. giant JP Morgan to create one of Britain 's leading investment banks .
Another of the arrested is from Swiss bank UBS .
The bank said the person involved was a junior member of staff , who had now been suspended .
The FSA believes that as many as a quarter of all mergers and takeovers of companies in the UK involve insider trading .
Financial crime makes millions of pounds for those involved at the expense of honest investors who buy shares in companies in good faith .
But the U.S. has a much better record for bringing people to justice for insider trading than the UK .
One tool it uses to huge success is the power to grant immunity , which is very useful in breaking up insider dealing rings .
The FSA has no such powers and many cases collapse because of lack of evidence .
It is now lobbying the Government to increase its powers .
A salesman at an electronics shop in Islamabad , Pakistan 's capital , watches President Pervez Musharraf announce his resignation in a televised address to the nation .
(( Anjum Naveed / Associated Press ) ) Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf resigned from office Monday before his political opponents could begin impeachment proceedings against him , saying he had " worked for the country in good faith . "
Musharraf made the announcement in a nationally televised address a day after a committee of Pakistan 's ruling coalition finalized a list of impeachment charges against the former army chief .
The charges included violating the constitution and misconduct .
During his lengthy address , Musharraf dismissed the charges against him , calling them " baseless " and " a fraud against the nation . "
He said he was stepping down because he did not want Pakistan 's " dignity to suffer . "
" After consulting my legal advisers and nearest political supporters … in the interest of the nation , I resign from my post today , " he said .
" I hand over my future to the people 's hands , and let them do justice . "
Musharraf used his speech to defend his political and military record , citing his handling of Pakistan 's economy , as well as education and infrastructure programs he instituted during his nine - year reign as president .
" For 44 years , I have protected this nation without thinking of my life , " he said .
" I hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes . "
Choice for successor uncertain
Musharraf , a former general , had been facing intense pressure to quit from political opponents who defeated his allies in February 's parliamentary elections .
Musharraf said he would submit his resignation to the speaker of the National Assembly later Monday but it was not immediately clear whether it would become effective the same day .
The chairman of Pakistan 's Senate , Mohammedmian Soomro , will take over as acting president when Musharraf steps down , Law Minister Farooq Naek said .
But it remains an open question whom parliament will elect to succeed Musharraf , partly because the ruling coalition has vowed to strip the presidency of much of its power .
There is speculation that the leaders of the two main ruling coalition parties — Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif — are interested in the role , although neither has openly acknowledged as much .
After Musharraf made his announcement , television footage showed groups of people celebrating in the streets in towns across Pakistan .
" It is very pleasing to know that Musharraf is no more , " said Mohammed Saeed , a shopkeeper among a crowd of people dancing to drum beats and hugging each other at an intersection in the northwestern city of Peshawar .
Pakistan 's stock market and currency both rose strongly on hopes that the country was bound for political stability .
Came to power in 1999 coup
Musharraf , a key U.S. ally in the war against the Taliban and al - Qaeda , came to power in a 1999 bloodless coup .
He stepped down as army chief last year to run for a third term in office but still maintains close ties to the military .
His reputation suffered last year when he ousted dozens of judges and imposed emergency rule .
He said at the time the measures were necessary to protect Pakistan from extremism and political instability .
Upon news of Musharraf 's resignation , lawyers began pressuring the ruling parties to restore the ousted judges .
Following Musharraf 's address , Information Minister Sherry Rehman called the president 's departure " a victory for democratic forces . "
" Today , the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country , that chapter has been closed , " Rehman said .
Musharraf could still be charged
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said leaders of the ruling coalition would discuss later Monday whether to prosecute Musharraf in court on charges that were being planned for the impeachment process .

'A step in the right direction .
Pakistan 's return to parliamentary democracy , an independent judiciary , and a system based on the rule of law is welcome . '
— Bill 77 < a href=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/08/18/bibles-china.html#socialcomments>Add your comment</a>[/ CUSTOM ]
Sharif 's party insists he should be tried for treason , which carries a maximum punishment of death .
" The crimes of Musharraf against the nation , against the judiciary , against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual , " party spokesman Ahsan Iqbal said Monday .
But several Pakistani media agencies reported Musharraf and the coalition were discussing an agreement that would enable him to avoid facing charges by stepping down .
If a deal is made , it is unclear whether Musharraf would stay in Pakistan and live at his farm in the outskirts of Islamabad , or go into exile in a country like Saudi Arabia or Turkey .
Earlier this month , coalition party leader Zardari , the widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto who now heads the Pakistan Peoples Party , announced he and his partner Sharif , the former prime minister , had agreed to seek the impeachment proceedings in parliament .
Musharraf accused the coalition of creating an " atmosphere of confrontation and vendetta " against him .
" Unfortunately , all my appeals for reconciliation … all my efforts failed in this direction , " he said Monday .
The ruling coalition , which holds a majority in Pakistan 's parliament since its victory in February 's elections , had expressed confidence in recent days it would be able to get two - thirds of the vote in both houses and have Musharraf removed .
Weekend Energy Listening : Wind Power with Paul Gipe Posted by benk on June 8 , 2008 - 11:00 am in The Oil Drum : Canada The World Wind Energy Conference is just around the corner and happens to be in my home town .
I was flipping through the conference program and noticed a familiar name pop up quite a lot : Paul Gipe .
He 's written a number of books on wind power and most recently has become involved in feed - in tariffs for wind power in North America .
I spoke to him a while ago about how the industry has developed .

Disclaimer :
This transcript was provided by a 3rd party and may not be 100 % accurate .
Please refer to the audio as well .
Ben :
I have spoken a lot on the show about wind power and how it is growing by leaps and bounds .
Records for wind power installations are breaking every year now , so worldwide the wind power sector grew by 43 % last year .
US growth was a little under , Canada ’s growth was a little over .
Interestingly , India is coming on strong now .
They just overtook Denmark for fourth spot in terms of total installed capacity , but nobody can really match Denmark in terms of wind power per capita .
Joining me to talk about wind power from California is Paul Gipe .
So , thank you so much for coming on the show , Paul .
Paul Gipe : Yeah , thank you Ben .
Ben :
Just as a quick biography , Paul has been around the wind power industry since the 1970s and he has written a number of books and articles , which everybody can find on his website wind works.org .
He was named Person of the Year in 1988 by the American Wind Energy Association .
He was given pioneer status by the World Renewable Energy Congress .
Paul , actually you were first described to me as the guy that David Suzuki goes to for wind power answers , so I just have this vision of David Suzuki having you on speed dial , calling you up in the middle of the night to talk about things like capacity factors .
Does that ever happen ?
Paul Gipe : I wish that was true , but no .
David and I do talk and we do discuss this issue , but there are lots of wind power experts in the world and I have my own take on how renewable energy is being developed or should be developed .
Ben :
For today , I am especially interested in , since you have all this experience , I am especially interested in getting some type of historical background of how wind power has been developed since the 1970s up until now .
I know that Denmark back then had the state - of - the - art technology and the industry is going through record high oil prices all the way through record low oil prices and now we are again approaching record high oil prices .
So , could you walk us through the developments of the wind power sector ?
Paul Gipe :
Well , the development of wind energy has often been connected to the availability , not just the price of oil and when oil has become abundant and very low cost it has set back wind power development a number of times .
Wind generation of electricity really began in Denmark around the turn of the century where wind turbines were being developed to produce the direct current for charging batteries at the villages that had not received central station electricity in Denmark and during the war years , the First World War when oil supplies were cut off by the British blockade of Jutland , the Danes again turned to wind power and also as they are entering World War II when the German war machine needed oil , it was consuming all the oil available in the continent .
The Danes again turned to wind power for generation of electricity in the villages of the Jutland Peninsula and then in the 1950s and 1960s , we saw a real bloom in the development of wind technology in Germany , in England , and in Denmark and with the abundant supply coming from the big giant , super giant , fields of Saudi Arabia that the bloom was taken off the flowering of wind energy at that period and that technology then lapsed for a number of years , but what was key was during the 1950s , for a decade , for 10 years there was a wind turbine operating commercially , but it is successfully producing electricity for over 10 years using a technology that today we would think is very crude , but contains the fundamental elements of what we call the Danish Wind Turbine Design and it is those fundamental elements that have brought us to the state of where wind energy is today and why it has become so successful .
So , following the 1950s , the next great boom in wind energy development took place in early 1980s in California , from 1981 through 1985 , before this next great collapse in the price of oil and the rise of Thatcherism and Reaganism killed renewable energy industry in the Anglophone world .
Key happened .
At that time , of course , California was the world center of renewable energy development , not just wind , but primarily wind , and that was …
Ben :
That was in the 1980s ?
The early 1980s when California …
Paul Gipe : Yeah , early 1980s , yes .
That is why I am in California ; it is because I followed the wind to California and work in Tehachapi , which is still to this day one of the largest concentrations of wind turbines in the world .
Tehachapi produces almost 2 terawatt hours a year or two billion terawatt hours a year , electricity from about 3500 wind turbines , so it is still a center of wind energy development to this day .
Ben :
So , that was around the US oil crisis , the early 1980s ?
Paul Gipe :
That is correct , right , following the Iranian revolution in 1979 when there were gas lines and so on .
It was really in response to a law that was passed in 1978 here in United States called the National Energy Act , which had a number of very important provisions .
Key one was that you were allowed to build an alternative source of energy and sell that electricity to the grid , to the network .
Now , in a typical American fashion , we made a major mistake in the law and we did not define the price that you would be paid .
We only defined the mechanism to determine the price and of course we as Americans have a real affinity for attorneys and it has basically been in the hands of attorneys for over 20 years , but at the time we were able to succeed in getting a price , standard offer contract in California that enabled the boom of wind energy in California in the early 1980s and that is why the Danes became so successful , it is in part because they sold thousands of wind turbines to California .
Ben :
So , that guaranteed price that was in terms of dollars per kilowatt or cents for kilowatt hour type of thing ?
Paul Gipe : Correct .
It was a fixed price for a number of years and then after those number of years , you still had a contract to sell your electricity , but the price fell to whatever was considered as the prevailing rate , but it guaranteed a fixed price for the first 10 years , which is necessary to pay for the capital cost of installing renewable energy .
Solar and wind are very capital intensive technology .
You got to pay for all the machinery .
Ben :
Of course , since then the price of wind has fallen dramatically , of wind power .
Paul Gipe :
The technology has advanced .
It has made great strides , but these have been incremental improvement .
There is no radical change of wind energy .
It is still basically the same kind of windmill that we had in early 1980s .
It looked pretty much the same .
They typically had three blades that spin around a horizontal axis and are upwind to the tower .
This is much , much bigger .
We have gained economy as a scale and as a result of that the cost of energy that is produced by the wind turbines has fallen dramatically .
Ben :
It must have been a pretty exciting time way back in the early 1980s when California was buying all of these wind turbines from Denmark .
What about later on when the price of oil hit all time lows ?
How did the industry survive through that ?
Paul Gipe :
Well , first of all , I mean it was absolutely a terrific time to be in renewable energy .
The old timers who are still around remember that period particularly with wind energy here in California .
It was the Wild West .
A number of books written about the period that talked about this are the Gold Rush , the Wind Rush at California .
It was an amazing time and of course it did collapse .
I am not sure that we could say that we did survive that period .
We did survive .
There are a number of us who still work in the field whether it is solar energy or biomass or in my case wind energy and we have continued to do that , but the renewable energy industry was set back , well it has set back to a decade .
It was set back 20 years .
It did take 20 years to recover that momentum that we had in early 1980s , but in the meantime the technology has greatly improved .
We have developed the technology and we can attribute today the success of where we are is because unlike here in North America , the Europeans did not abandon the desire for renewable energy .
They took a different approach and said we are going to need this technology , we are going to need renewable energy and they maintained a program for the development of renewable energy over these intervening two decades .
Even though the price of oil collapsed , they maintained a program .
They may not have been as dramatic as what we had in California , but they were as important , if not now looking back on it more important , because they built a different kind of industry and that different kind of industry gives us more possibilities , more ways to use renewable energy than the very nearly focused form that was developed in California and that gives me hope .
Ben :
So , they basically built an industry that was not based on the price of oil .
Paul Gipe : Exactly .
They built an industry that was based on the desire , a political desire , a sociable desire , to have renewable energy that was independent of the volatility in the price of fossil fuels , specifically oil .
Denmark , for example , weaned itself off of oil .
They began using more , say , Polish coal and also natural gas from its fields in the North Sea , but at the same time it made a national commitment to develop renewable energy for the direct benefit of its people , for the direct use by its people .
They created the program at the request of farmers , renewable energy advocates , and community groups that they wanted to use renewable energy .
They wanted to participate .
They wanted to be a part of what we now called the Renewable Energy Revolution and that is different in what was done in California .
It gives us a different model for how to develop renewable energy .
It gives us another choice for ways in which we can develop renewable energy .
We are hoping that this model will develop in Canada , in Ontario , for example , with what the government calls Standard Offer Contracts or what I call renewable energy tariffs .
Ben : Okay .
Something that really surprised me when I read it on your website is that almost 5 % of Denmark ’s population owns a piece of a wind farm .
That is amazing to me .
Why is that ?
Paul Gipe :
Well , there are a number of reasons and actually books have been written about this , about the sociological phenomena that Danes are very community oriented .
They are very cooperatively oriented .
A lot of their big national businesses are cooperative , milk , dairy , cookies , pork , I mean pigs , and they are a powerful force in the cooperative movement in the world and this is in part a result of a philosophical movement , a religious movement , in the mid-19th century .
Denmark did not have a violent revolution like we had in United States from Britain or the French Revolution .
The Danes went through an agrarian reform that was based on enlightenment of its people , education and training of its people , to bring them up out of the mud , raise them up out of all the mud , through education , self - education , in small groups and this eventually led to the cooperative movement in Denmark .
So , when the people there began looking at wind energy , even though their electric utilities are cooperative in a legal sense , the people said we do not want these guys doing developing wind energy because basically they have not done anything , we have asked them for years , but what do they do ?
They want to go build a nuclear power plant .
We do not want a nuclear power plant .
We want wind energy .
So , we want to do this and the government in Denmark is responsive to that and said okay , we will provide a mechanism that will allow groups of people together or farmers to set up wind turbines and make money doing it , sell the electricity into the grid , and so wind power exist today in the world because of farmers and community groups in Denmark .
Ben :
There is obviously a link between owning lands and putting up a wind farm , but North America has a ton of land and not that many wind farms .
Paul Gipe :
Well , let me just say that they can be done in North America , this form of development that we saw in Denmark and we see now in Germany for the last 15 years , the same form of development in Germany .
In North America , we will have both forms .
We will have the traditional electric utility whether it is electricity to front or either of the back or OPG or Scottish power building wind farms , large central station power plants or private wind power companies like Vision Quest out of Alberta .
They will be building wind farms .
We have that kind of development in North America because we are blessed with so much land area , but we do have similar settlement patterns in Southern Ontario , like in Ontario , and in places in the Midwest United States where there are lots of farmers , lots of individual land holdings where the Danish model or the German model can be applied and I think that we are just at the beginning of a movement for this kind of development .
There is a great interest among farmers and rural land owners in Quebec now and in Manitoba to do the same thing that Ontario is on the verge of doing .
Ben :
The Department of Energy just published their 2006 Energy Outlook and they think that their best bet is that wind will only contribute 1 % of the US ’s primary energy needs by 2030 .
I mean that is nothing .
Paul Gipe :
Are you talking about the US Department of Energy ?
Ben :
Yeah , yeah .
Sorry , the US Department of Energy .
Paul Gipe : Oh , we still have a US Department of Energy ?
Oh , I have not taken anything from the US Department of Energy seriously since Ronald Reagan , I am sorry .
They are still there , are they ?
Ben :
Yeah , they also said 88 % of the increase will come from coal power .
Paul Gipe :
Well , all I have to remind your Canadian listeners is who is the president of the United States and who runs our administrative structure in the United States does not tolerate any descent or any opposing points of view and once you understand that , you will dismiss any statement from the US Department of Energy as simply self - serving .
Ben : Okay .
So , will the wind power growth continue to be at around 40 % per year do you think ?
Paul Gipe : Worldwide .
Ben : Worldwide .
Paul Gipe : Absolutely , yeah .
All the signs are pointing to not just rapid growth of wind energy , but rapid growth of all forms of renewable energy .
If you look at solar photovoltaic , solar cells for the generation of electricity , the growth is dramatic , if not more dramatic , than wind energy .
If you look at what has happened in Germany …
Let us take Canada , for example , let us say Canada has about 600 to 700 megawatts of wind power and wind power is much more cost effective than solar photovoltaic because of the nature of the technology .
Germany has twice the amount of solar cells installed on people ’s roofs , that is , homeowners , farmers , and businesses in Germany as all of the wind turbines in all of Canada .
That are just solar cells and this has all just happened in the last three or four years , so the growth in solar photovoltaic is very dramatic and if we can get the prices right in Canada , we will see growth of solar cells , too .
I mean the Premier of Ontario , Dalton McGuinty , would like to see solar panels on people ’s homes in Ontario .
He said that to David Suzuki and myself and we are going to take him at his word and try and make sure that happens .
Ben :
What are your thoughts for things like offshore wind farms in North America ?
I mean the Cape Wind Project is having a lot of problems lately .
Well , they have had a lot of problems since they have started , since they have proposed the Cape Wind Project .
Do you think offshore will be a big player ?
Paul Gipe : No , we do not need offshore in North America .
Sure , we should not exclude offshore where offshore makes sense , we should not exclude it .
Offshore Toronto , for example , certainly should not exclude it .
Offshore Rochester , New York , offshore Detroit should not exclude , offshore Kingston should not exclude that , offshore of Queens University certainly should not exclude that , but we are land rich in North America and it is simply a lot easier to put the wind turbines on land and offshore .
I have argued for many years , they are on record in my books and in my articles that offshore is not a panacea for what ails wind energy .
The big issue with wind energy is will the people accept it ?
Will the public accept it ?
Some will , some will not , of course , unlike nuclear power , which can be shoved down people ’s throat by some central decision making by some government whether it is in Toronto or Washington , DC .
Wind energy has to be accepted by the people who live nearby and if it is not we will not do it and the early push for going offshore was the belief that going offshore was a panacea .
They are out at sea , they cannot see them , nobody is going to care .
Of course , that was bogus at the very beginning and you see in the Cape Wind case of course it is bogus because you do not want Canadiens and the mansions there they do not want to look at windmills .
Even if they cannot see them , they know they are out there and well I mean would you want to go to [ 20:45 unintelligible ] if you think there is a windmill offshore .
Of course , you would , but maybe the Canadiens do not want to live with it .
Those kinds of people have a lot of political influence .
Ben :
Is that the biggest threat right now , NIMBism or not in my backyard - ism ?
Paul Gipe :
For wind energy , absolutely , absolutely .
As I say , wind energy has to be acceptable to the people .
It has to be done in an environmentally acceptable manner ; otherwise , we should not do it .
I mean that is the reason that I am an advocate of renewable energy , of wind energy in particular , is that it is preferable to other forms of energy development such as nuclear power or burning coal and it is only acceptable if wind energy is in fact environmentally superior , so you got to do a good job .
Ben :
What about the intermittency of wind power ?
Is that not a big problem ?
Paul Gipe :
No , it is not a serious issue .
It is often raised .
Intuitively , we know that the wind does not blow all the time and when you look out at the wind turbines whether it is that one single turbine at the Pickering plant , did you ever notice how in Ontario you always have a token turbine by your nuclear plant ?
Some days it does not turn and some days it might turn kind of lazily while producing a lot of electricity , but when you have thousands of wind turbines scattered over a country the size of Canada or a province the size of Ontario , those wind turbines begin to balance out each other and study after study for the last 30 years , say , yes this is a technical issue and yes it has technical solutions and we just had another study , a study on a study , a study that in the Anglophone world evaluated 200 previous studies on intermittency of renewable not just wind but wind and solar and so on and I am sure they only looked that the English language studies , have not looked at the Germans or the French studies , and they said , yeah okay it is a technical problem , but everywhere it has been done , people just get on with the job and so as I say on my website and in one of my books , this has been beaten to death .
I thought we put this question to bed 20 years ago .
It is basically a red herring .
It is a technical issue where people , for example , at Queens University engineers , that is why we train engineers to deal with these kinds of questions and it can be dealt with .
Ben :
Actually , my next question is , are we going to start seeing any neat ways of storing wind energy ?
Paul Gipe :
Well , first of all , we do not need to store wind energy .
One of message is you do not need storage because you already have storage in any large integrated electric utility system whether it is in Ontario or New York State or Denmark or Germany , you already have a lot of storage .
Now , in the case of Ontario , you do not have a lot of hydro storage , you have a little bit , you do not have a lot because you are mostly run -off - the - river plants , they are not large reservoirs like you have in Quebec , but also you have fossil fuels and if you are offloading a generation of electricity , offloading fossil fuel generation , gas or coal , basically you are still storing that energy in the form of the fossil fuel that was not consumed and if , for example , if you have a hot water heater in your house and that hot water heater is still electric and you turn that electric heater on at night when the wind turbines are all generating electricity , you store new electricity in the form of heat and hot water , you can do the same thing at home .
So , first of all , you do not need storage .
Secondly , we did do a lot of storage already , it does exist .
Third , okay , there are some technical things that might be of interest or looking like it could be of interest , compressed air storage .
Ben : Yeah .
Paul Gipe : Big project proposed for Iowa , which use several hundred megawatts of wind turbines on the order of all the wind turbines you have in Canada now , in Iowa , in connection with a pumped air storage project .
Another interesting technical development , interesting to engineers , is new battery technologies .
These are chemical batteries , not lead acid , but other process .
In the long term , of course , electrolysis of water into hydrogen , very energy intensive , but in the long term that is a possibility of being able to store surplus wind energy in hydrogen and in the short term , plug in hybrids .
Electric vehicles like the Prius , that is a hybrid gasoline - electric with additional battery packs , are being installed in a conversion company here in California .
You plug your car in and you drive it at home , plug it in , the next day you go out , you have stored electricity in the batteries of the car , then you get over 100 miles of a gallon because you are not burning the gasoline and that electricity should come from …
You are never going to have electric vehicles .
That electricity has got to come from renewable .
Ben : Yeah .
Yes .
Paul Gipe :
It can not come from coal .
Ben : Yeah .
I just wanted to ask you quickly .
This was a question that somebody else wanted me to ask you .
Is there going to be any improvement on the technology ?
I know you said that the basic wind turbine design from the Danes does not really require that much improvement , but is anything on the horizon ?
Paul Gipe :
The technology , all renewable technologies , demands improvement .
In fact , all human endeavors demand continual improvement .
In the case of wind energy , we will continue to see and we will demand , it will be necessary to have continued incremental improvements in the technology , radical change in the way a wind turbine looks .
No , I am an outspoken critic of ill fated , ill - conceived crackpot wind turbine inventions …
Ben :
There has been a lot of talk about vertical axis wind turbines .
Paul Gipe :
Well , particularly among Canadiens , this is very interesting in my lectures in Canada and I do not do this here south of the border , but north of the border I always put in my presentations one slide that shows vertical axis wind turbines , particularly the turbine at Cap - Chat in the Gaspé , which some Canadians are quite proud of as an example of Canadian engineering .
Of course , it has not worked for almost a decade .
I would consider that an embarrassment myself and I put a big X through this wind turbine and I said , “ This is not a wind turbine . ”
It is a static sculpture .
It is perfectly acceptable as a static sculpture if Canadians want to have this on their landscape .
For me as an advocate of wind energy , my position is if the windmill does not work , get rid of it .
Make most in beer cans out of …
Okay , now having said that , Canadians have had an affinity for vertical axis wind turbines .
Nothing wrong with that concept , the technology of vertical axis wind turbines can be made to work fairly efficiently in terms of the engineering term efficiently , but that technology has never been developed .
It is the same level of technological development and economic development that we have of the conventional wind turbine looks like an airplane propeller and as a consequence I am an advocate of generating electricity with wind turbines .
I am not just an advocate of building windmills .
If we could have the electricity without the windmill that is the best world we could have .
The state that we have today is if you want electricity from wind turbines , you are going to use conventional wind turbines that look like an airplane propeller .
If engineers at Queens University or University of Toronto or at University of Windsor want to continue research in vertical axis wind turbines , that is fine , that is great , just do not spend much money on it because we need to spend the money on building the technology that produces electricity because Canada needs clean electricity .
You do not get that from an R&D program .
You only get that from installing real products that work .
Ben :
All right .
Well , thank you so much for coming on the show .
Just before we end though , I just want to point out your latest book , Wind Power : Renewable Energy for Home , Farm and Business , and I have read through some of the reviews and it is the book to have on wind power .
Paul Gipe :
Well , let me just mention , too , Ben , that the French language version , the Francophone version of the book will be available in June for any Francophone listeners , any listeners from Manitoba or Quebec , there will be a French language version of that book available in June .
Ben : Excellent .
You can buy it on amazon.com , on that website .
Paul Gipe :
Yes and I of course recommend that everybody buy it by the crate .
Ben :
Okay , well thanks so much for coming on the show , Paul .
Paul Gipe :
Thank you very much , Ben , and good luck with your podcast .
Ben :
Thank you .

* This is actually a lie -- there 's a more complicated set of classes .
But it gets the gist right , anyway .
One of Haskell 's distinguishing ( and perhaps unique ) language features is called " type classes " , which can be especially confusing because the word " class " has a strong meaning to most of us already .
So here 's a description of what they are , and why I think they 're interesting .
( This post also borrows heavily from the paper Software Extension and Integration with Type Classes , so as usual you can read that for more detail and better presentation .
But I also add some of my own thoughts , so this not completely a subset . )
One simple ( perhaps overly simplistic ) way to think about type classes is as a different name for an interface ( in the OO sense ) .
Imagine a functionthat takes a list of things to sum as its argument .
We 'd like for it to work for lists of integers as well as lists of floats .
But we do have a restriction : the list items need to be able to add ; it does n't make sense to pass a list of hash tables .
The solution is to define a type class as a collection of types that provide an interface .
( This is the confusing part , because these terms resemble OO terms but they 're used in a slightly different way . )
Haskell has a standard type class called ( short for numeric ) that declares operations like + , and then declares a bunch of types ( * ) as instances of the type class .
To demonstrate these terms again : " , a type , is an instance of , a type class . "
And then ourfunction declares that it works over any list of typeas long asis an instance of The stuff to the left of the double arrow declares the restrictions : " must be an instance of " .
The stuff on the right is the type : " takes a list ofs , gives back a single " .
Up to this point this is more or less standard OO fare with some ideas renamed .
But note that a type class is not a type : we did n't declareas taking a list ofs , but rather that it takes a list ofs that are instances of thetype class .
Also note that these are simpler than true OO inheritance : types can be instances of type classes , but there 's no deeper hierarchy tree ; there 's just one level .
One of the key differences from OO inheritance is that a type class and instances can be declared entirely separately from the declaration of the original type .
This allows types to be used in unanticipated ways .
Shoving all possible operations into an OO class makes the class inflate : in Python , showsAnd if you decide you need a new interface , you 're stuck unless you want to modify the class .
This is solved in Ruby by their " open classes " , which let you add methods to a class whenever you like , but even Rubyists try to limit their use of that : if library A decides that Strings need amethod , and library B needs a different one , you 're screwed -- adding methods to a globally shared class is exactly counter to the goal of separate and independent software components .
With a type class , two libraries can each create their own differentclasses and implement them for different subsets of types in different ways .
This is another way to think about a type class : it provides a view on to a collection of data types .
For example , ( section 2.2 of the paper ) the OO " adaptor " problem can be neatly solved with a type class , and does n't require creating an intermediary object .
As a more concrete example , Haskell has a range operator for constructing lists : is the list of numbers from 1 to 10 .
This is syntactic sugar for a call to the ( erable ) class , which means that I can add e.g. my owntype toand suddenly code likewill work .
Another example is how QuickCheck ( I described it here ) needs to be able to generate random inputs to test a function , so it has a random - integer generator , and a random - list generator , etc .
But what if it tests a function that works with colors ?
I can makean instance of their generator type class , and everything just works .
Because the class is separate from its types , functions in type classes can cut across many different class hierarchies .
For example , thetype class contains all types that can be " mapped " over : I can square each element in a list and get a new list , and I can similarly square each element in a tree and get a new tree .
So we can make both lists and trees instances of theclass and name the operation , and the operation of squaring each element held by any mappable type can be written .
( For which , again , the squaring works for all numeric types . )
Another good example is thatis a type class , covering types that obey the monad laws .
This allows the existing library of functions that work with monads to work across many different behaviors
So whenever a library has a new way of looking at a collection of types , picking up some common thread between them -- then that can be captured in a type class .
Perhaps a library can work with any queuing data structure that allows retrieving the " next " element : then it can declare aclass ( which currently does n't exist in Haskell ) , add lists and heaps to it , and still allow users to provide their own .
One way to think about this that is actually surprisingly applicable is the current " web 2.0 " fashion of tags versus hierarchies .
In section 2.3 of the paper they discuss what they call " the tyranny of the dominant decomposition " , which is that sometimes there is n't just one apparent class hierarchy , and describe how different sets of type classes allow different views on the same types .
Yet you can still create a hierarchy of type classes , much in the way you can create hierarchies with tags .
One of the simplest type classes ( and historically the original motivation for type classes ) is , supporting equality .
Then theclass ( supporting orderings ) can use , requiring its types to support both equality and a less - than operator .
One of the primary reasons Haskell / ML can make static typing pleasant is that type classes are inferred .
If I declare my sum function : Haskell can recognize ( because I used " + " ) thatcan only accept addable things : .
In fact , type inference is designed such that the most general type is always inferred , which means that even if I was n't thinking about complex numbers when I defined add , it still works for complex numbers while still verifying at compile time that I can't pass in two file handles .
Because of this inference , there is actually a complicated set of number - related type classes in Haskell that I 'm not even aware of .
For example , non-integer division only works fors , which includes boths ( represented as numerator / denominator ) as well ass , while a separateclass allows a modulus operation .
I did n't know most of that before now , when I just looked it up -- from the programmer 's perspective , I just get notified at compile - time if I 'm mixing up floating - point division with integer modulus , or if I try to use a file as a key in a hash table .
Part of the key to all of this ( and why my previous post was warm - up ) is invertingintto , because in the former case the set of functions is constrained by the object while in the latter case you can add functions willy - nilly .
( And you can have different sets of functions available through different imports , like my serialize example . )
That aside , many of these features I described are implementable with dynamic languages , so what 's interesting here ( I think ) is that Haskell has made these sorts of design patterns statically verifiable while still providing power beyond what we 're used to .
On the other side , this sort of functionality is also provided to some extent in C++ via templates and static overloading but C++ templates have all sorts of strange limitations because they implement a lot of this through ( effectively ) textual substitution .
It 's not all golden , of course -- I still have n't described a way to match dynamic dispatch -- and the paper outlines different limitations in a number of ways .
But it turns out that type classes do cover a variety of use cases in an interesting way that is distinct from the common OO patterns .
It turns out that type classes , again like C++ templates , are one of those basic - enough ideas with enough power that they can be used in all sorts of crazy ways , so consider this post as only scratching the surface .
For example , see this hack where he manages to use type classes to symbolically differentiate numerical code .
Since you can also return through a type class , functions can vary their behavior depending on their return type , which produces all sorts of weird behaviors .
See for example the end of this post where the behavior of some code can seemingly vary depending on how the values are used .
Some future reading : my previous post on my type classes for HDBus , and especially the paper I 've kept mentioning , which starts from the basics and gives a lot more examples .
Additionally there 's UnderestimatedTypeClasses on the Haskell wiki , which in part claims : " There are many misconceptions of the expressiveness of type classes , usually doing them a disservice , and there are many analogies which , at best , only cover a facet of them and at worst are outright misleading .
For example , type classes are not analogous to : OO classes , Java interfaces , or CommonLisp generic functions .

Stilettos For Babies ... Wh .. What ?
( Photos )
The latest fashion trend being marketed to the parents of babies is stiletto heels .... gasp !
This over - the - top accessory item for babies is the brain child ofand .
One of the women was taking her baby to a birthday party and envisioned how funny it would have been if her babe in arms had turned up at the infant soirée in spike heels .
Ha ha ha ?
Their company , Heelarious .. her first high heels features soft crib shoes with satin heels and satin lining .
They come cleverly packaged in a see through plastic purse with decorative rhinestone closure - perfect for gift giving according to their website .
A flurry of controversy and negative feedback has been forthcoming from child protection agencies , including the British NSPCC .
Christopher Cloke , head of child protection awareness was quoted as saying :
This is part of a worrying trend of inappropriate clothing being marketed at young children . "
The six styles of custom shoes are available in sizes 0 to 6 month in fashionable shades including hot pink , black and leopard print .
The shoes are reportedly not intended to hold up a child .
In fact , if a child stands in the shoes the heels will collapse .
Would that be classified as a safety feature or a potential hazard ?
We 've previously done stories on the provocative marketing of edgy fashions for children .
The ad campaigns have been called over - the - top by detractors .
Beyonce Knowles and her sister Solonge Knowles own one such company , House of Dereon .

Two drivers stopped at a red light one night in April 2007 .
One driver was drunk — and not just a little drunk .
Jonathan Hernandez was a convicted felon on probation , with enough alcohol in his blood to qualify for an extreme DUI .
The other driver , 19 - year - old Jacob Ritter - Clark , had never gotten so much as a speeding ticket .
He was sober .
Info Maricopa County Public Defender 's Office Read the rest of the " Drive At Your Own Risk " series here .
I know you think you know where this is going .
Two drivers collided , and their lives will never been the same .
Blah blah blah .
But the two drivers did n't collide .
Both cars took off at the light , but Hernandez took off much faster .
He gunned his Saturn and cut in front of Ritter - Clark — then lost control , flipping his car and pinning his passenger between the open sunroof and the bloody pavement .
Tests would later show Hernandez had been going at least 88 miles per hour .
But though Ritter - Clark 's car never even touched the speeding drunk 's , the cliché is still right on one level :
In the wake of the accident , both drivers ' lives have been irrevocably altered .
Jonathan Hernandez is in prison .
No surprise there .
But here is the unexpected part : Jacob Ritter - Clark might end up with an even longer sentence .
Ritter - Clark , the sober driver who managed to avoid crashing into the out - of - control drunk felon , pulled over immediately to call 911 .
Thanks to that act of kindness , he 's now facing two felony counts — and a presumptive sentence of 7 ½ years in prison .
If you 've learned about the courts by watching Law & Order , you might imagine that the wheels of justice move quickly .
But this is true only in one sense .
The initial review of a collision , or a simple assault , is often speedy as hell .
Arrests are made .
Charges are filed .
After that , the wheels can grind interminably .
You wo n't plead guilty to a lesser charge ?
Prepare to attend pre-trial hearing after pre-trial hearing .
Prepare for trial dates that come and go , with no trial in sight .
That 's because , typically , no one wants a trial .
Trials are expensive — and bring no guarantee of justice .
If you 're guilty of anything , you 're much better off cutting a deal , getting some charges thrown out , and throwing yourself on the judge 's mercy .
Judges know that , prosecutors know that , defense lawyers know that .
Jonathan Hernandez , the kid who caused the accident by driving drunk and speeding , surely knows that , too .
Hernandez , as they say , was " known " to the system — just 23 , he 'd already racked up five domestic violence convictions , one of them a felony that he was still on probation for .
( Two years before the crash , records show that he hid in the bushes , ambushed an ex-girlfriend , and choked her in front of their 2 - year - old son . )
On probation , he 'd managed to total a car by wrapping it around an electric pole , tested positive for cocaine use , and failed to show up for further testing — all without being sent to prison .
Like any good repeat offender , Hernandez knows the game .
He took the deal on the table : five years in prison , plus three years probation .
It 's Jacob Ritter - Clark who 's holding things up .
He keeps protesting that he 's innocent .
The Mesa police decided that Jacob Ritter - Clark and Jonathan Hernandez were drag racing .
That 's illegal .
Following Mesa PD 's recommendation , the Maricopa County Attorney charged both with aggravated assault and endangerment .
Hernandez was guilty , clearly .
But it 's only after I read the police report that I realized how thin the evidence is against Ritter - Clark .
In fact , if Ritter - Clark had n't thought of himself as an innocent bystander and immediately returned to the upside - down Saturn to call 911 , I can't imagine he'd be facing charges today .
That night , Ritter - Clark and his passenger each told police the exact same story : Hernandez and his buddy pulled up next to them at the stoplight at Greenfield and Main and asked them to drag race .
They refused , and the next thing they knew , the light turned green and Hernandez 's Saturn cut in front of them — then skidded into the curb , flipped , and thudded to a halt only because it smashed into a Mexican restaurant .
Because Ritter - Clark 's car never hit anything , because there were no skid marks or physical evidence left by his vehicle , there is no way that anyone can know how fast he was going that night .
But two witnesses told police that Ritter - Clark was driving way over the speed limit — and the cops , after all , had heard from Ritter - Clark himself that he'd been challenged to a drag race .
So , when they saw that he'd bought fancy black rims for his Toyota Corolla , that he had put a Toyota sticker on its hood , and was tricking out the exhaust system , the cops must have thought they had a speed freak .
" The officer was talking about how he likes going fast on his ' crotch rocket , ' " Ritter - Clark recalls .
He says he asked whether Ritter - Clark had ever been to the raceway .
No , Ritter - Clark answered , truthfully .
But he had friends who went and , someday , he'd like to go , he told the cop .
It was only months later , when Ritter - Clark got a summons in the mail , that he realized he was in any trouble .
He was so confused that he actually went down to the Mesa Police Department and looked at a copy of the police report .
It was then that he realized he'd become a criminal defendant in the very case in which he had turned around to call 911 .
And never mind what you heard in school about " innocent until proven guilty . "
From that point , it was up to Jacob Ritter - Clark to prove himself innocent .
Now , that would n't normally be so difficult .
To show that Ritter - Clark is guilty of aggravated assault , prosecutors do n't have to show only that he was speeding , or even drag racing .
They'd have to show that he recklessly caused the accident — or used his vehicle as a " dangerous instrument . "
Both seem pretty ludicrous in light of the fact that he never touched the other car and that the other driver was drunk and ripping through traffic at nearly 90 miles per hour .
Unfortunately , the person who ought to be able to help Ritter - Clark fight the charges , and take the case to trial , has been kicked off the case .
Marie Clark , Jacob 's mother , tells me that her family refinanced their house in order to hire Chuck Franklin , a Scottsdale attorney .
Franklin is a smart , experienced lawyer — although he 's arguably best known for the giant RV that tools around the Valley advertising his services .
Franklin , clearly , thought Ritter - Clark 's protestations of innocence had some merit .
He asked for a " complex case " designation , estimating that his firm would hire as many as five experts and do 20 witness interviews .
Then came the complication .
Franklin 's small firm had just hired a young lawyer from the County Attorney 's Office .
And , though no one realized it at first , as a prosecutor , that lawyer had visited the crash scene and had been in a meeting where the Ritter - Clark case was discussed .
Because of that , the County Attorney 's Office asked the judge to disqualify Franklin 's entire firm .
The judge agreed .
And though Franklin fought the ruling , appealing all the way to the Arizona Supreme Court , the judge 's decision stood .
By that point , Ritter - Clark 's family was low on money .
They 'd paid Franklin $ 11,000 , and even though he 's refunded more than half of it , the lawyers they consulted were not willing to take the case to trial for less than $ 12,500 .
Jacob Ritter - Clark was working as a contract employee at TRW , but his contract was n't renewed .
His car has been repossessed — and he still owes $ 12,500 on his car loan .
He was assigned a public defender .
The family liked Franklin .
They trusted him .
They do not feel the same way about Matthew Smiley .
An attorney contracted with the Office of Public Defense Services , Smiley has officially been part of the case since October but did n't even get a copy of the police report until last week .
He 's never so much as called his client .
Until I gave it to them , Ritter - Clark 's family did n't even have Smiley 's phone number .
( Smiley declined comment , saying he needs to sit down with his client before he can say anything about the case . )
If Jacob Ritter - Clark wants to make a deal , he 'll have to plead guilty to a felony .
If he refuses , and he 's found guilty of aggravated assault at a trial , the minimum sentence he could receive is five years of hard time .
Marie Clark is so worried that she starts tearing up just talking about her son .
She 's had to go on anti-anxiety medication for the first time in her life , she confides .
" We can't have our lawyer , " Clark says .
" So now what do we do ?
And if my son goes to prison for something he did n't do , what am I supposed to do ? "
On June 26 , Jacob Ritter - Clark is at yet another court hearing .
He 's dressed carefully , in a black button - up shirt .
His mom is there , and his dad , and his fiancée , Kadi Horvath , who is four months pregnant .
He wants to make a good impression .
He hopes someone will notice a man who is loved .
Someone expecting his first child .
Someone whose mother is worried sick .
But no one notices .
The judge is scheduling other cases .
The prosecutors have a ton of work and need to keep things moving .
And Jacob Clark - Ritter 's lawyer is nowhere to be seen .
" He called me for the first time this morning , " says Marie Clark .
Her eyes are anxious .
" He asked if he was still representing us . "
Superior Court Judge David Udall calls the court to order at 9 a.m. , and most of the other lawyers are ready to go .
Trial dates are scheduled .
Guilty pleas are made .
Everything is moving along nicely , except Matthew Smiley is still missing .
The prosecutor is not happy about it .
" Have you seen Smiley this morning ? " he quizzes one of the public defenders at , oh , roughly 9:45 a.m .
" Smiley ? " asks the public defender .
" He 's in your office , " the prosecutor says , impatiently .
The public defender turns to one of his colleagues .
" Who 's Smiley ? " he asks .
The other one shrugs : " I have no idea . "
By the time Smiley finally shows up , more than an hour late , all other scheduling is long done .
Judge Udall has retreated to his chambers , and the prosecutors are steaming .
So Smiley does n't have time to so much as say " hi " to his client before Judge Udall reappears , eager to finish scheduling matters .
Because Smiley has never really talked to his client , he schedules the next hearing smack in the middle of Ritter - Clark 's honeymoon .
This is what passes for justice in Maricopa County .
It 's hard to sit here , and watch the process grind on , and not want to stand up and shout that something has to give .
Marie Clark says her son came to her with tears in his eyes .
He is , after all , about to get married , with a baby on the way .
" Mom , if I end up in jail , will you take care of my family ? "
Jacob asked .
What can she say ?
What can anyone say ?
And here 's the craziest part .
The " victim , " the guy Jacob Ritter - Clark supposedly assaulted , is himself a convicted felon .
Jonathan Belarde had been found guilty of theft and aggravated assault — and was released from prison just one month before he climbed into Jonathan Hernandez 's car on that fateful night .
Police records show that he , like his driver , had been drinking .
His injuries were not life - threatening , but they were pretty serious .
After the accident , Belarde violated parole and ended up in prison again .
He died there in September 2007 , according to state records .
( Prison records say he died of natural causes ; corrections officials provided no further information . )
This is the " victim " whom prosecutors are supposedly protecting by prosecuting Jacob Ritter - Clark .
A dead thug .
What a county .
Evening , June 3rd , in a muggy , dragonfly - beswarmed place called the Pontchartrain Center , just outside New Orleans .
Half a continent away , amid yet another legacy - smashing fusillade of unsolicited invective from Bill Clinton , the excruciating Obama - Hillary mess is finally wrapping up , in a pair of anticlimactic primaries somewhere over the darkened plains of Montana and South Dakota .
But here in the Big Easy , John McCain has chosen this moment to mount his first general - election attack against the Great Satanic Liberal Enemy — who , as luck would have it , turns out to be a Negro intellectual from Harvard who 's never served in the military .
And this is supposed to be a bad year for Republicans ?
You 'd never know it from listening to McCain , whose kickoff speech is the same election - year diatribe that Republicans have been giving for decades , one long broadside against those goddamned overgrown Sixties weenie liberals who hate the flag , love the bomb - tossing enemies of America and are bent on the twin goals of ending the system of free enterprise and placing every aspect of our lives under government control .
McCain pegs Obama as a man who wants to take America " backward , " to the failed ideas of the Sixties .
" I 'm surprised that a young man has bought into so many failed ideas ! " he says , to furious applause .
Then , spitting out a forced , ugly laugh that he must have practiced many ( but not enough ) times in the bathroom mirror of the Straight Talk Express , he adds , " That 's not change we can believe in ! "
The choice of New Orleans as a launching pad for McCain 's national campaign is the kind of leadenly obvious move that people who do politics for a living are pleased to call " sound strategy " :
For a candidate supposedly desperate to avoid carrying the Bush label into November , this disaster - stricken city is about the only place in the country that offers a striking visual image of a Bush policy that McCain has actually criticized .
So the candidate dragged himself onstage here , ostensibly to perform the dreary business of " distancing himself " from Bush by once again criticizing the president 's response to Katrina .
The Bush - bashing money quote — " Americans have a right to expect basic competence from their government ! " — was featured prominently in media accounts .
But the idea that John McCain is kicking off his trek to the White House by fleeing at top - end speed from the faltering Republican brand is the kind of absurdly facile misperception that only the American campaign press could swallow whole .
The reality is that the once independent - thinking McCain has by now completely remade himself into a prototypical , dumbed - down Republican Party stooge — one who plans to rely on the same GOP strategy that has been winning elections ever since Pat Buchanan and Dick Nixon cooked up a plan for cleaving the South back in 1968 .
Rather than serving up the " straight talk " he promises , McCain is enthusiastically jumping aboard with every low - rent , fearmongering , cock - sucking presidential aspirant who 's ever traveled the Lee Atwater / William Safire highway .
Even the briefest of surveys of the supporters gracing McCain 's events underscores the kind of red - meat appeal he 's making .
Immediately after his speech in New Orleans , a pair of sweet - looking old ladies put down their McCain signs long enough to fill me in on why they 're here .
" I tell you , " says one , " if Michelle Obama really does n't like it here in America , I 'd be very pleased to raise the money to send her back to Africa . "
The diminutive and smiling old lady 's friend leans over .
" That 's going a little too far , dear . "
" Too far ? " says the first .
" Farrakhan is saying they were brought here against their will , and their bodies are still feeding the sharks at the bottom of the sea !
I mean , really ! "
" OK , sharks still eating bodies , " I say , writing it all down .
" Could I have your name , ma'am ? "
" Janice Berg , " says the first old lady .
" And lest you think I'm Jewish , the name comes from Norway .
Berg is ' mountain ' in Norwegian .
I 'm part German , part French myself . "
A few paces away , I catch up with a man named Ron Saucier and a woman who would only identify herself as Mary .
Ron says his problem with Obama is the integrity thing .
" He exaggerates too much , " Ron says .
" He 's not honest . "
" OK , " I say .
" What does he exaggerate about ? "
" Well , like that time he was saying he had a white mother and a white grandmother , " he says .
I ask him how this is an exaggeration .
" Well , he was saying . . . " he begins .
" As if that qualifies him to . . . "
Despite my repeated prodding , Ron seems unable or unwilling to say aloud exactly what he means .
Finally , his friend Mary , a grave - looking blonde with fierce anger lines around her eyes , jumps in , points a finger and blurts out one of the all - time man - on - the - street quotes .
" Look , you either are or you are n't , " she says .
" And he are n't , " Ron says , nodding with relief .
Some of us who have been mesmerized by the Obama - Clinton cage match during the past six months may have developed certain delusions about the state of American politics , in two areas in particular .
One is the idea , much pushed by wishful - thinking media commentators like myself , that the abject failure and unpopularity of the Bush administration somehow means the Republican revolution is over , and the mean - ass hate - radio conservatism of Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh is finally dead .
The other is the even more quaint notion that the historic , groundbreakingly successful candidacies of a black man and a woman have ushered in a futuristic era of political tolerance and open - mindedness .
It 's bunk , all of it , and nobody understands this better than John McCain .
With his chameleonlike , whatever - gets - you - through - the - night ideology , McCain intends to use the same below - the - belt , commie - baiting , watermelon - waving smear tactics that Clinton used against Obama in the Democratic primaries , except at tenfold intensity .
Once the victim of a classic racist smear job in backwoods South Carolina ( where he was whipped in the 2000 primary after a Karl Rove whispering campaign suggested he had an illegitimate black daughter ) , McCain has now positioned himself on the business end of that same deal .
Like Hillary Clinton , an erstwhile vilified liberal who remade herself as a flag - waving , Sixties - bashing champion of " hardworking Americans , white Americans " once the remarkable candidacy of Barack Obama forced her off her old turf , the one - time " insurgent " McCain has finally decided to sail with the wind at his back by going dumb and courting the same talk - radio demographic that used to despise him .
What enables him to do so is a key insight : that while George W. Bush may be unpopular as an individual , fear and hatred in this country have never gone out of style .
The remarkable metamorphoses this year of both Hillary Clinton and John McCain would be puzzling and inexplicable were it not for a basic truism of the political - hate game .
The reasons McCain and Clinton were villains of the Rush Limbaugh / Sean Hannity crowd in the first place had nothing to do with their policy positions or votes in the Senate or anything like that .
Their real crimes were their arrogant insistence on exercising their intellectual independence , as well as their stubborn refusal to indulge in drooling - caveman demagoguery .
The instant both of them crossed into the hater column and began feverishly jacking off the toothless racists of the Deep South with broadsides against the America - hating socialist menace Obama , all was instantly forgiven .
Only a few months ago , I was constantly running into Republicans at McCain events who had profound concerns about the Arizona senator 's " liberal " record .
But these days I 'm hard - pressed to find anyone on the trail who even remembers that McCain once supported Roe v. Wade , and opposed the Bush tax cuts , and compared the tortures at Abu Ghraib and Gitmo to the techniques of the Spanish Inquisition , and even heretically claimed that Mexican immigrants were " God 's children too . "
When I ask Mary Morvant , a pro-life Christian , why she 's supporting McCain given his record on abortion , she gives a typical answer : " I 'm much more concerned about Obama . "
McCain enters the general election in the form of a man who has jettisoned the last traces of his dangerous unorthodoxy just in time to be plausible in the role of the torchbearing leader of the anti-Obama mob , waving the flag and chanting , " One of us !
One of us ! " all the way through to November .
He now favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent , he 's unblinkingly pro-life every time he remembers to mention abortion , and he 's given up bitching about torture .
With his newfound opposition to his own attempts to reform immigration policy and campaign finance , McCain is perhaps the first candidate in history to stump against two bills bearing his own name .
McCain 's transformation is so complete that at a recent town - hall meeting in Nashville , when asked to name an author who inspired him , the candidate — who once described televangelists of the Jerry Falwell genus as " agents of intolerance " — put none other than Joel Osteen at the top of his list .
" He 's inspirational , " McCain said .
Standing at the meeting , I did n't write Osteen 's name down in my notebook — apparently because my brain refused on some level to accept that McCain had actually said it .
Of all the vile , fake , lying - ass , money - grubbing shyster scumbags on the face of this planet , there is perhaps none more loathsome than Osteen , a human haircut with plastic baseball - size teeth who has made a fortune selling the appalling only - in - America idea that terrestrial greed is actually a form of Christian devotion .
" God wants us to prosper financially , to have plenty of money , to fulfill the destiny
He has laid out for us , " Osteen once wrote .
This is the revolting , snake - oil - selling dickhead that John McCain actually chose to pimp as number one on his list of inspirational authors .
So much for " go , sell everything you have and give to the poor , " and all that other hippie crap from the New Testament .
This dumbed - down , hypersimplified incarnation of McCain offers the vehicle for his new platform , which is just the same old ring - around - the - collar fear - mongering horseshit used by a generation of conservatives , warmed over to fit 2008 .
In fact , in his stump speeches these days , McCain never veers off a strikingly Bushian binary version of reality , in which the world is divided into clear - cut camps of God-fearing American good and un-Christian , bomb - tossing foreign ( and foreign - enabling ) evil .
McCain talks about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his evil plans for world domination , Hamas and its rockets that rained on poor Israeli children in their Purim ( he pronounces it pyoor - eem ) costumes .
Also in the " bad " column are Hezbollah , Al Qaeda , the " far - left radical outfit " MoveOn.org , the wealthy liberals in Georgetown who opposed the gas - tax holiday for ordinary , decent folk because " they can probably walk to work , " and the Democrats eager to impose socialism because " they have little faith in the wisdom , decency and common sense of free people . "
Break it down and this is basically the same old label game , with McCain trying to rally his crowds against all the major isms : terrorism , socialism , elitism , anti-Americanism .
His crude attempts to paint Obama with these brushes are more or less the whole of his argument for the presidency .
Obama is terrorist - coddler because he is " ready to talk in person with tyrants " like Ahmadinejad , he hates soldiers because he refused to condemn MoveOn 's " General Betray Us " ad , and he 's a socialist because he favors health - care reform — despite the fact that the Obama plan is n't " socialized " medicine any more than the universal requirement to buy private auto insurance is socialism .
And when it comes to Obama 's and his wife 's America - hating , well . . .
McCain really does n't need to say anything about that .
All he needs to do to remind audiences of Reverend Wright and Michelle " I'm proud of America for the first time " Obama is to offer a few bons mots in the opposite direction .
" I seek the office with the humility of a man who cannot forget that my country saved me , " McCain likes to say .
And while he does n't believe he was anointed by God to lead the great nation of America , he insists , " I am her servant , first , last and always . "
That 's it — that 's the entire argument .
McCain is a canny enough old goat to know that the public 's insatiable appetite for traitorous enemies will do the rest .
He 'll wave as many flags and stand in front of as many fucking fighter jets as you like , while the other guy lectures us about why he does n't always need to wear a flag pin in his lapel and calls a bomb - throwing Sixties terrorist " a guy who lives in my neighborhood " instead of calling for his immediate beheading .
Cindy Oestriecher , a McCain supporter who turned out for his speech in New Orleans , is stumped when I ask her for an example of Obama 's lack of patriotism .
" What was that thing about anti-American ? " she asks a friend .
" What were they referring to ? "
" What thing ? " asks the friend .
" People were talking about that thing , that anti-American thing , " Cindy says , frowning .
" You mean about the flag , the thing on the Internet ? " the friend replies .
" Yeah , I guess , " says Cindy .
" The anti-American thing . "
" That bothers you ? " I ask .
" Of course it does ! "
" But you do n't even know what it is , " I say .
" You just know that someone else said he was anti-American .
You do n't even know who it was that said it ! "
She shrugs .
What 's my point ?
We all know what the deal is .
When it comes to presidential politics , you either are or you are n't .
And Barack Obama are n't .
If you can't grasp the simple math of that statement , you do n't know much about elections in this country .
It 's not about the war , or the economy , or the faltering Republican brand , or any of that :
This is about hate and fear , and a dark instinct in our blood going all the way back to Salem , and whether or not a desperately ambitious ex-heretic named John McCain can whip up a big enough mob in time to drown the latest witch .
Which means that despite all the talk about " change , " we 're once again stuck in the same dumb flashback that has been prodigiously wasting our time for the last four or five decades — the seemingly endless quest to crush the mythical leftist revolution , which for some reason has spent most of the last half - century cleverly disguised as a bunch of ineffectual bourgeois New Yorkers sitting around watching Stanley Kubrick movies and eating whole foods while conservatives took over the world .
What 's especially creepy about this flashback this time around is that it seems to mirror the tragic loop in McCain 's own psyche .
For all his frantic recanting of the many embarrassingly bipartisan episodes from his Senate past , McCain has never betrayed even a nanosecond 's worth of memories from the central catastrophe of his life : his capture and torture in a Vietnamese prison .
But now that he is finally pitted , in the great battle of his life , against a smooth - talking peacenik nearly half his age who wants American troops to withdraw instead of pressing on for " victory " in an unpopular war , McCain can keep reliving all those old hurts and all those old battles over and over again , in front of sympathetic crowd after sympathetic crowd .
Never mind that Iraq is n't exactly Vietnam , or that Barack Obama is n't Jane Fonda — what matters is that the Republicans nominated a wounded old soldier who now gets to spend the next five months trying to exorcise his personal demons , and this serendipitous circumstance fits nicely with the party 's national strategy , despite the fact that pinning these old hurts on the likes of Obama makes no sense at all .
Still , it 's not hard to hear , in McCain 's quasi - coherent rants , his bitterness at being abandoned to years of savage tortures while millions of little Hillarys and Bills and Obamas - in - training were getting high and balling each other during the Country Joe and the Fish set at Woodstock , instead of standing up and saluting the " winnable " war effort that got McCain sent to Vietnam in the first place .
Then as now , the crime of the Obama class in the eyes of a wronged veteran like McCain was n't that they caused these wartime sufferings ; it was that they did n't cheer them as righteous and necessary , and unhesitatingly support the sending of more soldiers to the same fate .
In the present day , it is George Bush who got us into this new Vietnam - like mess and revived the specter of tortured prisoners , but McCain 's anger is n't focused in that direction .
He 's not mad that it 's happening again , not looking to blame the people who actually started the fire .
Instead he seems re-energized by the fact that we are all back in that same hell , back to living the PTSD - inducing nightmare that McCain himself never got to leave — and if it takes dumbing down his act and playing to the Rush and Hannity crowd to give his story a happy ending this time around , he wo n't hesitate .
So if you thought Hillary was bad , buckle your seat belts :
The really dumb stuff is just beginning .

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
DADA v. MUKASEY , ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
Petitioner , a native and citizen of Nigeria , alleges that he married an American citizen in 1999 .
His wife filed an I –130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf that was denied in 2003 .
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) charged Dada with being removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act for overstaying his temporary nonimmigrant visa .
The Immigration Judge ( IJ ) denied the request for a continuance pending adjudication of a second I –130 petition , found Dada eligible for removal , and granted his request for voluntary departure under 8 U. S. C. § 1229 c ( b ) .
The Board of Immigration Appeals ( BIA ) affirmed and ordered Dada to depart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties .
Two days before the end of the 30 - day period , Dada sought to withdraw his voluntary departure request and filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U. S. C. § 1229 a( c ) ( 7 ) , contending that new and material evidence demonstrated a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued until resolution of the second I –130 petition .
After the voluntary departure period had expired , the BIA denied the request , reasoning that an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but does not depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from receiving adjustment of status .
It did not consider Dada ’s request to withdraw his voluntary departure request .
The Fifth Circuit affirmed .
Held :
An alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw a motion for voluntary departure , provided the request is made before expiration of the departure period .
Pp. 5 –20 .
( a) Resolution of this case turns on the interaction of two aspects of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 — the alien ’s right to file a motion to reopen in removal proceedings and the rules governing voluntary departure .
Pp. 5 –12 .
(1) Voluntary departure is discretionary relief that allows certain favored aliens to leave the country willingly .
It benefits the Government by , e.g. , expediting the departure process and avoiding deportation expenses , and benefits the alien by , e.g. , facilitating readmission .
To receive these benefits , the alien must depart timely .
As relevant here , when voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings , the departure period may not exceed 60 days .
8 U. S. C. § 1229 c( b ) ( 2 ) .
Pp. 5 –9 .
(2) An alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen , § 1229 a ( c ) ( 7 ) ( A ) , asking the BIA to change its decision because of newly discovered evidence or changed circumstances .
The motion generally must be filed within 90 days of a final administrative removal order , § 1229 a ( c ) ( 7 ) ( C ) ( 1 ) .
Although neither the text of § 1229c or § 1229 a( c ) ( 7 ) nor the applicable legislative history indicates whether Congress intended for an alien granted voluntary departure to be permitted to pursue a motion to reopen , the statutory text plainly guarantees to each alien the right to file “ one motion to reopen proceedings under this section , ” § 1229 a ( c ) ( 7 ) ( A ) .
Pp. 9 –12 .
( b) Section 1229 c ( b ) ( 2 ) unambiguously states that the voluntary departure period “ shall not be valid ” for more than “ 60 days , ” but says nothing about the motion to reopen ; and nothing in the statutes or past usage indicates that voluntary departure or motions to reopen cannot coexist .
In reading a statute , the Court must not “ look merely to a particular clause , ” but consider “ in connection with it the whole statute . ”
Kokoszka v. Belford , 417 U. S. 642 .
Reading the Act as a whole , and considering the statutory scheme governing voluntary departure alongside § 1229 a ( c ) ( 7 ) ( A ) ’s right to pursue “ one motion to reopen , ” the Government ’s position that an alien who has agreed to voluntarily depart is not entitled to pursue a motion to reopen is unsustainable .
It would render the statutory reopening right a nullity in most voluntary departure cases since it is foreseeable , and quite likely , that the voluntary departure time will expire long before the BIA decides a timely - filed motion to reopen .
Absent tolling or some other remedial action by this Court , then , the alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis :
The alien either may leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order , with the effect that the motion to reopen is deemed withdrawn , or may stay in the United States to pursue the case ’s reopening , risking expiration of the departure period and ineligibility for adjustment of status , the underlying relief sought .
Because a motion to reopen is meant to ensure a proper and lawful disposition , this Court is reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute is designed to make reopening unavailable for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law , when the statute ’s plain text reveals no such limitation .
Pp. 12 –16 .
(c) It is thus necessary to read the Act to preserve the alien ’s right to pursue reopening while respecting the Government ’s interest in the voluntary departure arrangement ’s quid pro quo .
There is no statutory authority for petitioner ’s proposal to automatically toll the voluntary departure period during the motion to reopen ’s pendency .
Voluntary departure is an agreed - upon exchange of benefits , much like a settlement agreement .
An alien who is permitted to stay past the departure date to wait out the motion to reopen ’s adjudication cannot then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure , for the Government ’s benefit — a prompt and costless departure — would be lost .
It would also invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in the country but whose cases are unlikely to be reopened .
Absent a valid regulation otherwise , the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to withdraw from the voluntary departure agreement .
The Department of Justice , which has authority to adopt the relevant regulations , has made a preliminary determination that the Act permits an alien to withdraw a voluntary departure application before expiration of the departure period .
Although not binding in the present case , this proposed interpretation “ warrants respectful consideration . ”
Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer , 534 U. S. 473 .
To safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients , the alien must be permitted to withdraw , unilaterally , a voluntary departure request before the departure period expires , without regard to the motion to reopen ’s underlying merits .
The alien has the option either to abide by the voluntary departure ’s terms , and receive its agreed - upon benefits ; or , alternatively , to forgo those benefits and remain in the country to pursue an administrative motion .
An alien selecting the latter option gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJ ’s alternative order of removal .
The alien may be removed by the DHS within 90 days , even if the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated .
But the alien may request a stay of the removal order , and , though the BIA has discretion to deny a motion for a stay based on the merits of the motion to reopen , it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny a motion for stay where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for reopening .
Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a hard choice , it avoids both the quixotic results of the Government ’s proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioner ’s tolling rule .

The Limits of American Power
In a letter written in 1648 , the Swedish statesman , Axel Oxenstierna , chancellor to both King Gustavus Adolphus and Queen Christina , counseled , “ Know , my son , with how little wisdom the world is governed . ”

The fighting between Russia and the former Soviet republic of Georgia is an unnerving reminder of that , and of how quickly the balance of global power can be tilted from unexpected directions with barely a warning .
Some hawks and neo-cons called for NATO intervention or even suggested we send in Stinger missiles or the 82nd Airborne as a peacekeeping force .
President Bush warned , “ Russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people .
Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century . ”
Perhaps , but the reality of the early 21st century is that , in the short run , at least , the president ’s words ring hollow .
In spite of past promises of support to Georgia , Russia is key to our efforts in the Middle East and our European allies are dependent on Russia for energy .
The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have both our military strength and our international credibility stretched perilously thin at a time when oil - rich Russia is reemerging as a superpower .
We ’ve boxed ourselves in .
It was in that light that I came upon the Oxenstierna quote the other night , while re-reading the late historian Barbara Tuchman ’s The March of Folly , a knowing compendium , from ancient Troy to Vietnam , of the ways in which , given half a chance , those in power will steer their ships of state straight into the rocks .
In the first chapter , she also quotes American President John Adams : “ While all other sciences have advanced ” – you can almost hear him sighing – “ government is at a stand ; little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago . ”
Andrew J. Bacevich probably would agree with all of the above .
The retired Army colonel , a West Point graduate , teaches history and international relations at Boston University .
His latest book , The Limits of Power : The End of American Exceptionalism , explores our nation ’s current predicament , not just on the world stage but here at home as well .
He spoke with my colleague Bill Moyers on this past week ’s edition of the PBS series Bill Moyers Journal .
Bacevich speaks truth to power , no matter who ’s in power , which may be why those of both the left and right are eager to hear his views .
Perhaps it ’s also because when he challenges American myths and illusions , he does so from a genuine patriotism forged in the fire of his experiences as a soldier in Vietnam and the death a year ago of his son , an Army lieutenant in Iraq .
The Limits of Power is dedicated to the young man but the senior Bacevich , a man of quiet , solid gravitas , holds his grief privately between himself and his family .
“ Our foreign policy is something that is concocted in Washington , D.C. , but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want , ” he told Moyers .
“ And what we want , by and large is … this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods .
We want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be …
And we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month , or the end of the fiscal year . ”
To that end , he says , “ One of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of American military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years . …
“ I think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the United States of America , the most powerful nation in the world , as far back as the early 1970 ’s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem , posed a threat , compromised our freedom of action .
How every president from Richard Nixon down … declared , ‘ We ’re going to fix the problem . ’
[ But ] none of them did . ”
He continued , “ The clearest statement of what I value is found in the Preamble to the Constitution .
There is nothing in the Preamble to the Constitution which defines the purpose of the United States of America as remaking the world in our image , which I view as a fool 's errand …
“ I believe that the framers of the Constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here , the way we order our affairs .
To try to ensure that as individuals , we can have an opportunity to pursue our , perhaps , differing definitions of freedom , but also so that , as a community , we could live together in some kind of harmony .
“ And that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities …
With the current crisis in American foreign policy , unless we do change our ways , the likelihood that our children , our grandchildren , the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that we 've had is very slight because we 're squandering our power .
We are squandering our wealth . ”
Bacevich believes , “ The Congress , especially with regard to matters related to national security policy , has thrust power and authority to the executive branch .
We have created an imperial presidency .
The Congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good .
The Congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of Congress . ”
That imperial presidency , he says , “ has made our democracy a false one .
We ’re going through the motions of a democratic political system .
But the fabric of democracy , I think , really has worn very thin . ”
Iraq , Bacevich concludes , “ was a fundamental mistake .
It never should have been undertaken .
And we 're never going to do this kind of thing again . ”
This might , he thinks , “ be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror [ and ] see what we have become .
And perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the American way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the American way of life . ”
Andrew Bacevich ’s words should echo down the corridors of Congress and the halls of the White House , no matter who becomes our next President .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A new book looks at Osama bin Laden through the prism of his family , and suggests that the death of his extrovert playboy brother Salem in a 1988 plane crash was an important factor in his radicalization .

REUTERS / Stringer / Files
“ The Bin Ladens ” , by Pulitzer Prize - winning author Steve Coll , traces the family ’s rise to prominence in Saudi society through the 20th century and how its fate , and that of Osama in particular , was inextricably linked with the royal family’s .
By putting Osama ’s life in the context of his 53 globetrotting brothers and sisters and the upheavals facing Saudi Arabia , Coll seeks to dispel some of the myths surrounding a man often portrayed in the West as an incarnation of evil .
Osama was around nine years old when his father died in a plane crash in 1967 .
While immersing himself in Islamic studies at school , the boy found new father figures in radical mentors who later introduced him to the idea of “ transnational jihad ” .
His elder half - brother Salem was a very different character : a larger - than - life , jetsetting playboy who took over the family business and wooed the Saudi royals with his boyish charm .
The reward was construction contracts in the kingdom and a family fortune that was crucial to Osama ’s role as mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the United States in 2001 .
While the brothers followed different paths , underlining the tensions in Saudi Arabia at the time between a pious past and the new allures of the West , Salem remained an important influence over Osama and the bin Laden clan throughout his life .
The keen pilot ’s death in 1988 in a flying accident left the dynasty adrift , and contributed to Osama ’s growing rifts with his family and with the Saudi authorities , Coll argues .
It also came at a time when the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was winding down , encouraging Osama and other radical leaders to consider a broader armed struggle .
“ I met so many friends of Salem who , without prompting , said if he had lived , 9/11 would not have happened , and you can see their case , ” Coll explained in an interview with Reuters .
“ You can just imagine at that moment in the early 90s ... Salem would just have figured out a way to bring him back in . ”
AFGHAN ADVENTURES , FAMILY RIFTS
Coll was referring to the period when Osama began to quarrel with the Saudi authorities , partly because of his backing for Islamist militants in Yemen and partly due to the deployment of U.S. troops on Saudi soil after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait .
After moving to self - imposed exile in Sudan , he became increasingly critical of the Saudi royal family .
His brothers , who lacked Salem ’s charm and influence , were unable to rein him in and eventually disowned him as an embarrassment .
Osama ’s eldest son abandoned him for Saudi Arabia and a growing sense of isolation probably added to his radicalization .
“ A hint of King Lear in the wilderness began to enter Osama ’s exile , ” Coll writes .
In the early 1980s Osama had begun traveling to Pakistan , where his wealth brought him influence among Islamic radicals backing the anti-Soviet Afghan insurgency .
There he was actively supported by Salem , who was keen to help his brother and serve the royal family ’s clandestine foreign policy in the region at the same time .
Osama moved to Peshawar near the Pakistan - Afghan border in 1986 .
He became increasingly involved in the rebellion , traveled to London to discuss buying missiles , saw battle first hand with his band of Arab volunteers -- and set up al Qaeda .
According to Coll , Osama ’s success at building the radical network stemmed partly from his ability to attract members from a diverse range of nationalities and like - minded movements .
Similarly his father employed Italian engineers and U.S. accountants to build the bin Laden empire and had “ a labor force that was as diverse as any in the Gulf at the time . ”
Osama embraced technology by using satellite phones to coordinate his militant activities at about the same time his family was investing in a pioneering satphone venture .
He also made videos and audio tapes for television and the Internet which revealed something of the showmanship for which his late brother Salem was renowned .

Moore 's Law - we all know it ( or at least think we do ) .
To be annoyingly exact , Moore 's Law is a prediction that the number of components per integrated circuit ( for minimum cost per component ) will double every 24 months ( revised up from every 12 months in the original 1965 prediction ) .
In slightly more useful form , Moore 's Law is often used as a shorthand for the continuing exponential growth of computing technology in many areas - disk capacity , clock speed , random access memory .
Every time we approach the limit of some key computer manufacturing technology , the same debate rages :
Is this the end of Moore 's Law ?
So far , the answer has always been no .
But Moore 's Law is inherently a statement about human ingenuity , market forces , and physics .
Whenever exponential growth falters in one area - clock speed , or a particular mask technique - engineers find some new area or new technique to improve at an exponential pace .
No individual technique experiences exponential growth for long , instead migration to new techniques occurs fast enough that the overall growth rate continues to be exponential .
The discovery and improvement of manufacturing techniques is driven on one end by demand for computation and limited on the other end by physics .
In between is a morass of politics , science , and plain old engineering .
It 's hard to understand the myriad forces driving demand and the many factors affect innovation including economies of scale , cultural attitudes towards new ideas , vast marketing campaigns , and the strange events that occur during the death throes of megacorporations .
By comparison , understanding the limits of computation is easy , as long as you have a working knowledge of quantum physics , information theory , and the properties of black holes .
The " Ultimate Laptop "
In a paper published in Nature in 2000 , Ultimate Physical Limits of Computation ( free arXiv preprint [ PDF ] here ) , Dr. Seth Lloyd calculates ( and explains ) the limits of computing given our current knowledge of physics .
Of course , we do n't know everything about physics yet - far from it - but just as in other areas of engineering , we know enough to make some extremely interesting predictions about the future of computation .
This paper wraps up existing work on the physical limits of computing and introduces several novel results , most notably the ultimate speed limit to computation .
Most interesting in my mind is the calculation of a surprisingly specific upper bound on how many years a generalized Moore 's Law can remain in effect ( keep reading to find out exactly how long ! ) .
Dr. Lloyd begins by assuming that we have no idea what future computer manufacturing technology will look like .
Many discussions of the future of Moore 's Law center around physical limits on particular manufacturing techniques , such as the limit on feature size in optical masks imposed by the wavelength of light .
Instead , he ignores manufacturing entirely and uses several key physical constants : the speed of light c , Planck 's reduced constant h ( normally written as h - bar , a symbol not available in standard HTML , so you 'll have to just imagine the bar ) , the gravitational constant g , and Boltzmann 's constant kB .
These constants and our current limited understanding of general relativity and quantum physics are enough to derive many important limits on computing .
Thus , these results do n't depend on particular manufacturing techniques .
The paper uses the device of the " Ultimate Laptop " to help make the calculations concrete .
The ultimate laptop is one kilogram in mass and has a volume of one liter ( coincidentally almost exactly the same specs as a 2008 Eee PC ) , and operates at the maximum physical limits of computing .
Applying the limits to the ultimate laptop gives you a feel for the kind of computing power you can get in luggable format - disregarding battery life , of course .
Energy limits speed
So , what are the limits ?
The paper begins with deriving the ultimate limit on the number of computations per second .
This depends on the total energy , E , of the system , which can be calculated using Einstein 's famous equation relating mass and energy , E = mc2 .
( Told you we 'd need to know the speed of light . )
Given the total energy of the system , we then need to know how quickly the system can change from one distinguishable state to another - i.e. , flip bits .
This turns out to be limited by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle .
Lloyd has this to say about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle :
In particular , the correct interpretation of the time - energy Heisenberg uncertainty principle ΔEΔt ≥ h is not that it takes time
Δt to measure energy to an accuracy ΔE ( a fallacy that was put to rest by Aharonov and Bohm ) but rather that that a quantum state with spread in energy ΔE takes time at least
Δt = πh/ 2ΔE to evolve to an orthogonal ( and hence distinguishable ) state .
More recently , Margolus and Levitin extended this result to show that a quantum system with average energy E takes time at least
Δt = πh / 2E to evolve to an orthogonal state .
In other words , the Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that a system will take a minimum amount of time to change in some observable way , and that the time is related to the total energy of the system .
The result is that a system of energy E can perform 2E / πh logical operations per second ( a logical operation is , for example , performing the AND operation on two bits of input - think of it as single bit operations , roughly ) .
Since the ultimate laptop has a mass of 1 kilo , it has energy E = mc2 = 8.9874 x 1016 joules .
The ultimate laptop can perform a maximum of 5.4258 x 1050 operations per second .
How close are we to the 5 x 1050 operations per second today ?
Each of these operations is basically a single - bit operation , so we have to convert current measurements of performance to their single - bit operations per second equivalents .
The most commonly available measure of operations per seconds is FLOPS ( floating point operations per second ) as measured by LINPACK ( see the Wikipedia page on FLOPS ) .
Estimating the exact number of actual physical single - bit operations involved in a single 32 - bit floating point operation would require proprietary knowledge of the FPU implementation .
The number of FLOPS as reported by LINPACK varies wildly depending on compiler optimization level as well .
For this article , we 'll make a wild estimate of 1000 single - bit operations per second ( SBOPS ) per FLOPS , and ask anyone with a better estimate to please post it in a comment .
With our FLOPS to SBOPS conversion factor of 1000 , the current LINPACK record holder , the Roadrunner supercomputer ( near my home town , Albuquerque , New Mexico ) , reaches speeds of one petaflop , or 1000 x 1015 = 1 x 1018 SBOPS .
But that 's for an entire supercomputer - the ultimate laptop is only one kilo in mass and one liter in volume .
Current laptop - friendly CPUs are around one gigaflop , or 1012 SBOPS , leaving us about 39 orders of magnitude to go before hitting the theoretical physical limit of computational speed .
Finally , existing quantum computers have already attained the ultimate limit on computational speed - on a very small number of bits and in a research setting , but attained it nonetheless .
Entropy limits memory
What we really want to know about the ultimate laptop is how many legally purchased DVDs we can store on it .
The amount of data a system can store is a function of the number of distinguishable physical states it can take on - each distinct configuration of memory requires a distinct physical state .
According to Lloyd , we have " known for more than a century that the number of accessible states of a physical system , W , is related to its thermodynamic entropy by the formula : S = kB ln W " ( S is the thermodynamic entropy of the system ) .
This means we can calculate the number of bits the ultimate laptop can store if we know what its total entropy is .
Calculating the exact entropy of a system turns out to be hard .
From the paper :
To calculate exactly the maximum entropy for a kilogram of matter in a liter volume would require complete knowledge of the dynamics of elementary particles , quantum gravity , etc .
We do not possess such knowledge .
However , the maximum entropy can readily be estimated by a method reminiscent of that used to calculate thermodynamic quantities in the early universe .
The idea is simple : model the volume occupied by the computer as a collection of modes of elementary particles with total average energy E .
The following discussion is pretty heavy going ; for example , it includes a note that baryon number may not be conserved in the case of black hole computing , something I 'll have to take Lloyd 's word on .
But the end result is that the ultimate laptop , operating at maximum entropy , could store at least 2.13 x 1031 bits .
Of course , maximum entropy means that all of the laptop 's matter is converted to energy - basically , the equivalent of a thermonuclear explosion .
As Lloyd notes , " Clearly , packaging issues alone make it unlikely that this limit can be obtained . "
Perhaps a follow - on paper can discuss the Ultimate Laptop Bag ...
How close are modern computers to this limit ?
A modern laptop in 2008 can store up to 250GB - about 2 x 1012 bits .
We 're about 19 orders of magnitude away from maximum storage capacity , or about 64 more doublings in capacity .
Disk capacity as measured in bits per square inch has doubled about 30 times between 1956 and 2005 , and at this historical rate , 64 more doublings will only take about 50 - 100 years .
This is n't the overall limit on Moore 's law as applied to computing , but it suggests the possibility of an end to Moore 's law as applied to storage within some of our lifetimes .
I guess we file system developers should think about second careers ...
Redundancy and error correction
Existing computers do n't approach the physical limits of computing for many good reasons .
As Lloyd wryly observes , " Most of the energy [ of existing computers ] is locked up in the mass of the particles of which the computer is constructed , leaving only an infinitesimal fraction for performing logic . "
Storage of a single bit in DRAM uses " billions and billions of degrees of freedom " - electrons , for example - instead of just one degree of freedom .
Existing computers tend to conduct computation at temperatures at which matter remains in the form of atoms instead of plasma .
Another fascinating practical limit on computation is the error rate of operations , which is bounded by the rate at which the computer can shed heat to the environment .
As it turns out , logical operations do n't inherently require the dissipation of energy , as von Neumann originally theorized .
Reversible operations ( such as NOT ) which do not destroy information do not inherently require the dissipation of energy , only irreversible operations ( such as AND ) .
This makes some sense intuitively ; the only way to destroy ( erase ) a bit is to turn that information into heat , otherwise the bit has just been moved somewhere else and the information it represents is still there .
Reversible computation has been implemented and shown to have extremely low power dissipation .
Of course , some energy will always be dissipated , whether or not the computation is reversible .
However , the erasure of bits - in particular , errors - requires a minimum expenditure of energy .
The rate at which the system can " reject errors to the environment " in the form of heat limits the rate of bit errors in the system ; or , conversely , the rate of bit errors combined with the rate of heat transfer out of the system limits the rate of bit operations .
Lloyd estimates the rate at which the system can reject error bits to the environment , relative to the surface area and assuming black - body radiation , as 7.195 x 1042 bits per meter2 per second .
Computational limits of " smart dust "
Right around the same time that I read the " Ultimate Limits " paper , I also read A Deepness in the Sky by Vernor Vinge , one of many science fiction books featuring some form of " smart dust . "
Smart dust is the concept of tiny computing elements scattered around the environment which operate as a sort of low - powered distributed computer .
The smart dust in Vinge 's book had enough storage for an entire systems manual , which initially struck me as a ludicrously large amount of storage for something the size of a grain of dust .
So I sat down and calculated the limits of storage and computation for a computer one μm3 in size , under the constraint that its matter remain in the form of atoms ( rather than plasma ) .
Lloyd calculates that , under these conditions , the ultimate laptop ( one kilogram in one liter ) can store about 1025 bits and conduct 1040 single - bit operations per second .
The ultimate laptop is one liter and there are 1015 μm3 in a liter .
Dividing the total storage and operations per second by 1015 gives us 1010 bits and 1025 operations per second - about 1 gigabyte in data storage and so many FLOPS that the prefixes are meaningless .
Basically , the computing potential of a piece of dust far exceeds the biggest supercomputer on the planet - sci- fi authors , go wild !
Of course , none of these calculations take into account power delivery or I/O bandwidth , which may well turn out to be far more important limits on computation .
Implications of the ultimate laptop
Calculating the limits of the ultimate laptop has been a lot of fun , but what does it mean for computer science today ?
We know enough now to derive a theoretical upper bound for how long a generalized Moore 's Law can remain in effect .
Current laptops store 1012 bits and conduct 1012 single - bit operations per second .
The ultimate laptop can store 1031 bits and conduct 1051 single - bit operations per second , a gap of a factor of 1019 and 1039 respectively .
Lloyd estimates the rate of Moore 's Law as 108 factor of improvement in areal bit density over the past 50 years .
Assuming that both storage density and computational speed will improve by a factor of 108 per 50 years , the limit will be reached in about 125 years for storage and about 250 years for operations per second .
One imagines the final 125 years being spent frantically developing better compression algorithms - or advanced theoretical physics research .
Once Moore 's Law comes to a halt , the only way to increase computing power will be to increase the mass and volume of the computer , which will also encounter fundamental limits .
An unpublished paper entitled Universal Limits on Computation estimates that the entire computing capacity of the universe would be exhausted after only 600 years under Moore 's Law .
250 years is a fascinating in - between length of time .
It 's too far away to be relevant to anyone alive today , but it 's close enough that we can't entirely ignore it .
Typical planning horizons for long - term human endeavors ( like managing ecosystems ) tend to max out around 300 years , so perhaps it 's not unthinkable to begin planning for the end of Moore 's Law .
Me , I 'm going to start work on the LZVH compression algorithm , tomorrow .
One thing is clear : we live in the Golden Age of computing .
Let 's make the most of it .

The first E - ink cover for a magazine will come out with the September issue of Esquire , according to Editor - in - Chief David Granger .
Electronic ink paper is created by coating a surface with millions of tiny microcapsules ; they have about the same diameter as a human hair .
Each of the microcapsules contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid .
When a very small electric charge is applied , the black particle will move to the top surface ; that makes a little black dot in that space .
In this way , text characters and even graphic elements can be displayed .
The cover display will flash " the 21st Century Begins Now . "
The cover will have enough energy to run for about 90 days .
“ Magazines have basically looked the same for 150 years , ” Mr. Granger said , showing a prototype e-ink cover .
“ I have been frustrated with the lack of forward movement in the magazine industry . ”
“ The possibilities of print have just begun .
In two years , I hope this looks like cellphones did in 1982 , or car phones . ”
Science fiction readers have been looking forward to this development for a long time , and can give us an idea of what this technology will look like in coming years .
For example , writer Greg Bear had a very clear view of the Esquire E-ink cover in 2003 in " Darwin's Children . "
He wrote about e-paper covers with speaker chips .
If you 'd like to see a more visual representation of the future , go to your video library to see the e-paper newspapers from Stephen Spielberg 's 2002 movie " Minority Report . "
Take a look at what an e-ink display can do in this e-ink cellphone display video .

A judge said today that prominent Linux developer and convicted murderer Hans Reiser rejected a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for only three years for killing his wife , Nina Reiser .
During what was supposed to have been Reiser 's sentencing today , Judge Larry Goodman of Alameda County Superior Court revealed that Reiser was offered a plea bargain last September for a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter .
The judge said he was prepared to give Reiser the minimum sentence of three years in prison in accordance with the deal to spare Nina Reiser 's family the distress of going through a trial .
Had Reiser not maintained his innocence until leading police to the buried remains of his wife yesterday , he would have been out of prison possibly by May 2009 , the judge noted .
By leading police to the body , Reiser struck a new zero - hour deal with prosecutors .
Under the new agreement , Reiser could be sentenced for second - degree murder rather than for the first - degree murder verdict decided by a jury last April .
A first - degree murder charge carries a 25 - years - to - life prison sentence .
A second - degree murder charge carries a 15 - years - to - life prison sentence .
While a reduction to second - degree murder does n't necessarily mean Reiser will have a reduced prison sentence , it does mean he would be eligible for parole sooner .
Goodman defended the agreement saying Nina Reiser 's family is " 100 per cent behind the disposition , because it allows Nina to come home " to be buried .
He stressed any deal the prosecution may have reached with Reiser has n't yet been approved by the court .
Goodman said he " has to be convinced that the deal is ironclad " and that Reiser will fulfill all his obligations , such as waiving his rights to appeal .
The court scheduled a hearing August 13 to review the status of the proposed agreement . ®

The sheer tragedy of the case has n't stopped Wikipedia fiddlers from having a wholesome laugh .
Readers Dennis Smith and Andrew Whitell pointed us to the online encyclopedia 's " Comparison of file systems " article which received an interesting revision .
New to the article 's chart comparing file system features is the category " murders your wife . "
It 's an attribute most file systems have chosen to opt out of , with the exception of ReiserFS and Reiser4 .
It was changed back pretty quickly , but the older revision is still available here .
A coalition of civil rights groups has called the nation 's scheduled move from analog to digital full power television a " transition in trouble " and is urging the government to provide more guidance and money to address the challenge .
" There is an absence of clear Federal leadership and a comprehensive transition plan to address the needs of those most vulnerable to the transition , " Mark Lloyd of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights ( LCCR ) told reporters today .
" And there seems to be no rapid response capability to deal with what we are certain will be problems on or after February 17th , 2009 . "
That 's the Last Day of Analog Broadcasting for full - power TV .
LCCR cites media and government surveys suggesting that the transition will face " very serious problems , " in Lloyd 's words , unless more action is taken .
These include a May 2008 Nielsen report from which the group has concluded that " 23 million households will wake up [ on February 18th ] either completely or partially unready to receive digital broadcast television service , " and a June 10th Government and Accountability Office ( GAO ) survey suggesting that about half of them " are still unprepared for the switch . "
Prominent among these households are non-English speakers , the elderly , people with disabilities ( particularly people with hearing problems ) , and rural households .
Central to LCCR 's critique of transition efforts so far is a lack of any " comprehensive approach " to the challenge similar to the government 's approach to the Y2 K problem in 2000 .
The coalition is particularly concerned about the absence of a " rapid response capability " to deal with households that may wake up on February 18th to find their analog TV sets dead .
" Many Americans owe their lives to emergency weather or public safety warnings broadcast to their television sets , " the coalition warns .
Almost 200 civil rights organizations belong to LCCR , including the NAACP and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund .
LCCR is not the first group to suggest that the Federal government 's response so far has been less than adequate .
The National Telecommunications Information Administration 's ( NTIA ) strategy has been to offer the public two $ 40 dollar discount coupons per household — good for set - top boxes that will convert analog sets into digital - ready receivers .
But LCCR 's report — " Transition in Trouble " — also offers an array of recommendations that address key areas where the transition could go bad after February 17th .
Here are three :
Organize rapid response teams to help people after February 17th
These teams should be ready to move starting on January 1 , 2009 , LCCR says , with the Federal Communications Commission and NTIA providing consumer assistance lines , " fully staffed " with people able to help non-English speakers and TV watchers with disabilities .
" Community - based organizations should be empowered and funded to mobilize teams that will assist their members who are unsuccessful in making the transition . "
LCCR recommends :
" The NTIA and FCC should be prepared to conduct significant and rapid outreach to media outlets that may reach those who have lost television service , such as community and ethnic newspapers and radio . "
Make the converter boxes more accessible and affordable
LCCR suggests that the NTIA eliminate the expiration dates for the converter box coupons " or at the very least extend the expiration date to March 2009 . "
Tens of thousands of already ordered coupons have expired , forcing consumers who have been confused about the process to re-order them .
People with hearing disabilities have had a particularly difficult time identifying which converter boxes are most user friendly .
In addition , LCCR notes that households are eligible for two $ 40 coupons only , a restriction that may limit the benefits of the program to smaller families .
And : " The envelopes used to mail converter box coupons are not sufficiently distinguishable from junk mail by people with visual disabilities , " the group 's report observes .
The NTIA needs to make its mailings clearer .
Put more money and presence into the project
So far Congress has allocated $ 5 million for the DTV transition educational project .
LCCR calls that sum " not nearly enough , " and notes that the government just collected $ 19.5 billion in the recent 700M Hz auction .
" A small portion of that money should be devoted to public education about the transition , " the coalition suggests .
President Bush should produce a public service announcement on the transition , LCCR says , and every government agency should display a DTV transition link on its Web site .
In a related matter , in mid-June the Senate passed Daniel Inouye 's ( D - HI ) DTV Transition Assistance Act , which LCCR spokesperson Nancy Zirkin says will provide " a small bit of funding " to the effort .
The bill provides some flexibility in DTV spending , allowing the NTIA to transfer money intended to help lower power TV ( LPTV ) stations to complete the transition to consumer education , if the LPTV license does n't need the funding .
The money can be used to finance non-profits and public interest groups helping consumers with the transition .

July 29 , 2005 : Counterterrorism Expert Claims Possible 7/7 Bombings Mastermind Was Working for British Intelligence
In an interview on Fox News , counterterrorism expert John Loftus claims that Haroon Rashid Aswat , named in recent reports as the mastermind of the 7/7 London bombings earlier in the month ( see July 7 , 2005 ) , is actually an agent of the British intelligence agency MI6 .
Loftus says : “ [ W ] hat ’s really embarrassing is that the entire British police are out chasing [ Aswat ] , and one wing of the British government , MI6 or the British Secret Service , has been hiding him .
And this has been a real source of contention between the CIA , the Justice Department , and Britain . …
He ’s a double agent . ”
The interviewer clarifies , “ So he ’s working for the Brits to try to give them information about al - Qaeda , but in reality he ’s still an al - Qaeda operative . ”
Loftus replies : “ Yeah .
The CIA and the Israelis all accused MI6 of letting all these terrorists live in London not because they ’re getting al - Qaeda information , but for appeasement .
It was one of those you leave us alone , we leave you alone kind of things . ”
Loftus then explains that Aswat has been wanted by US prosecutors in Seattle since 2002 for attempting to help set up a training camp in Oregon ( see November 1999 - Early 2000 ) .
“ [ W ] e’ve just learned that the headquarters of the US Justice Department ordered the Seattle prosecutors not to touch Aswat [ because ] apparently Aswat was working for British intelligence .
Now Aswat ’s boss , the one - armed [ London imam Abu Hamza al - Masri ] , he gets indicted two years later .
So the guy above him and below him get indicted , but not Aswat .
Now there ’s a split of opinion within US intelligence .
Some people say that the British intelligence fibbed to us .
They told us that Aswat was dead , and that ’s why the New York group dropped the case .
That ’s not what most of the Justice Department thinks .
They think that it was just again covering up for this very publicly affiliated guy with [ the British militant group ]
Al - Muhajiroun .
He was a British intelligence plant .
So all of a sudden he disappears .
He ’s in South Africa .
We think he ’s dead ; we do n’t know he ’s down there .
Last month the South African Secret Service come across the guy .
He ’s alive . ”
The host asks : “ Yeah , now the CIA says , oh he ’s alive .
Our CIA says OK let ’s arrest him .
But the Brits say no again ? ”
Loftus replies : “ The Brits say no .
Now at this point , two weeks ago , the Brits know that the CIA wants to get a hold of Haroon .
So what happens ?
He takes off again , goes right to London .
He is n’t arrested when he lands , he is n’t arrested when he leaves .
[ Even though ] he ’s on the watch list .
The only reason he could get away with that was if he was working for British intelligence .
He was a wanted man . ”
Loftus finally explains that Aswat ’s relationship with British intelligence began in the late 1990s with the war in Kosovo .
The US , Britain , and radical Muslims were all on the same side , helping the Muslims in Kosovo fight the Serbians .
Loftus says that Al - Muhajiroun was involved in recruiting British Muslims to fight in Kosovo , and Aswat was part of that effort .
[ Fox News , 7/29/2005 ]
Two days after Loftus ’s comments , the Sunday Times reports that senior British officials “ deny ‘ any knowledge ’ that he might be an agent for either MI5 or MI6 . ” [ Sunday Times ( London ) , 7/31/2005 ] Entity Tags : Al - Muhajiroun , Haroon Rashid Aswat , Abu Hamza al - Masri , UK Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 ) , John Loftus Timeline Tags : Complete 911 Timeline

BBC News , Sahebganj , Jharkhand
Geologists are calling for an immediate ban on stone mining in the area A treasure trove of history preserved by nature for millions of years in eastern India is threatened with extinction .
Plant fossils , scattered all over the Rajmahal Hills in Sahebganj district of Jharkhand state , are fast finding their way into the hundreds of crusher machines that are reducing them into stone chips to be used in road construction .
Spread over approximately 2,600 sq km , the Rajmahal Hills are home to plant fossils dating back between 68 million years and 145 million years .
Over the years , geologists and palaeobotanists from all over the world have visited the area for their research .
Here , scientists could lay their hands on some of the rarest plant fossils ever conserved by nature .
Examples of these Jurassic age plant fossils - known as Rajmahal Flora - are to be found in many museums across the globe .
The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany in the northern city of Lucknow also has an impressive collection .
' Worried '
But this wonder of nature is fast disappearing and geologists say the fossils may soon all be gone .
The state government of Jharkhand has given out a mining lease in the area to private companies who are practically blowing up the hills to obtain rocks which are then crushed to make stone chips .
" This is what is worrying us .
The treasure which nature has conserved for millions of years would be wiped out in a matter of months if an immediate ban on stone mining is not imposed in the area , " says Syed Raza Imam Rizvi , head of the geology department at Sahebganj College .
" Those who have the mining lease are cutting down the hills .
All the hills need to be conserved for research .
" If proper excavation and study is carried out , we could also find the fossils of reptiles and other animals which existed during the Jurassic and the Triassic age .
Maybe one day we can even find a fossil of a dinosaur here , " Mr Rizvi says .
The villagers in the area , from the Pahadiya tribe , say they are fed up with trying to protect the fossils from suspicious visitors .
" We have been guarding these fossils like our ancestors did in the hope that a park would come up here some day and the government would take care of it .
Now everything is being wiped out , " says Gangu Pahadiya , the headman of Tara village .
' Fossil Road '
When the state of Jharkhand was created in 2000 , the government announced a " Jurassic Park " would be set up in Sahebganj to conserve the rare fossils in their natural habitat .
Local people said the government erected a sign some years ago for the proposed park .
Rare fossils are being crushed and used in road construction
But now the board is gone , and some say the project has been shelved .
Since many villages in the region are inaccessible , the authorities decided to build a road to Tara village , where rare fossils lie scattered around .
The road has been christened " Fossil Road " , but geologists say what is shocking is that the stone chips used for constructing the road are actually fossils .
A forest department official in the area , Pujan Singh , admitted that rare fossils were being used for road construction .
" The entire Rajmahal Hills are full of fossils of plants and reptiles .
Those who have taken the mining lease do n't care about it .
They do n't know about it , " Mr Singh said .
" The fossils are finding their way into the crusher machines that are reducing them into chips .
We have tried to stop it , but there is very little that we can do .
The mining department has allotted them a lease , " he said .
' Precious gifts ' Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda promised the fossils would be protected .
" We are proud of possessing nature 's precious gifts in the form of fossils .
We are working on a proposal to conserve them , " Mr Koda told the BBC .
But geologists say the authorities need to act immediately to save from destruction the evidence of a world that existed millions of years ago .
" The Rajmahal Hills need to be conserved in their natural habitat to facilitate further studies and research .
If mining activities continue at such a pace , everything would be destroyed and the generations to come will never forgive us , " said geologist Nitish Priyadarshi .

TORT REFORM ON STEROIDS ….
Via Josh , I learn that Blackwater has filed a motion in a lawsuit claiming that since the mishap they ’re being sued for ( a plane crash ) happened in Afghanistan , the lawsuit should be adjudicated via sharia law , not U.S. law .
That ’s ironic enough on its own merits , but the explanation is even better :
In April , Blackwater asked a federal judge in Florida to apply Islamic law , commonly known as Shari ’a , to the case .
If the judge agreed , the lawsuit would be dismissed .
Shari ’a law does not hold a company responsible for the actions of employees performed within the course of their work .
Is it really true that corporations are n’t responsible for the negligence of their employees under sharia law ?
If it is , I think we can shortly expect mass conversions to Islam among American CEOs , followed by a plank in the Republican Party platform demanding that sharia be adopted across the board in federal courts .
This is a tort reformer ’s wet dream .
ANGOLA , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
He is not a killer , but the state of Louisiana is determined to execute Patrick Kennedy for his crime .
Patrick Kennedy , 43 , is on Louisiana 's death row for the rape of his 8 - year - old stepdaughter .
The New Orleans native faces that reality as he sits on death row at Louisiana 's maximum security prison , the largest prison in the nation .
The Louisiana State Penitentiary , or Angola Prison , is the size of Manhattan and surrounded on three sides by the Mississippi River .
Unlike the 3,300 inmates awaiting execution nationwide -- including the 94 other men at Angola -- Kennedy , 43 , is a convicted rapist .
The victim was his 8 - year - old stepdaughter .
For the first time in 44 years , a state is preparing to execute a man for a felony other than murder .
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether Louisiana can use capital punishment in child rape cases .
The constitutional question before the justices is whether the death penalty for violent crimes other than homicide constitutes " cruel and unusual " punishment .
The high - profile examination of the death penalty also raises anew a national debate over selective prosecution and race .
" A lot of people think there should not be the death penalty [ in this case ] because the child survives , " said Kate Bartholomew , a sex crimes prosecutor in New Orleans .
" In my opinion the rape of a child is more heinous and more hideous than a homicide . "
Kennedy 's appellate attorney , Billy Sothern , argues , " When we look at what it means to be cruel and unusual , this is exactly the kind of thing that raises these serious concerns of the constitutionality of Mr. Kennedy 's death sentence . "
Kennedy was sentenced to die in 2003 for sexually assaulting his stepdaughter in her bed .
The crime occurred in a quiet neighborhood in Harvey , across the big river from New Orleans .
Besides severe emotional trauma , Louisiana prosecutors said the attack caused internal injuries and bleeding to the child , requiring extensive surgery .
The former moving company driver had claimed two teenage boys committed the crime near the family 's garage , a story the girl -- identified in court papers as " L.H. " -- repeated for 18 months after the ordeal .
An African - American teenager was initially arrested , based on Kennedy 's allegations , but later was cleared of any wrongdoing .
Kennedy also is African - American .
Police in Jefferson Parish quickly turned their suspicions on him as the attacker .
The girl later accused her stepfather , after she returned home from a temporary stay in foster care .
Kennedy has denied the charges , but the state supreme court upheld the conviction and punishment .
The U.S. Supreme Court , both in 1976 and a year later , banned capital punishment for rape -- and by implication any other crime except murder .
But Louisiana 19 years later passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12 .
State lawmakers contended the earlier high court cases pertained only to " adult women . "
Death penalty opponents say Louisiana is the only state to actively pursue lethal injection for child rapists , and argue , among other things , that it could give attackers a reason to murder their victims .
" If they 're going to face the death penalty for raping a child , why would they leave a living witness ? " said Judy Benitez , executive director of the Louisiana Foundation against Sexual Assaults .
Benitez also says testifying in a death penalty case can be deeply traumatic for child .
And the risk of wrongful prosecution may be higher is such cases since children might prove to be unreliable witnesses for the prosecution , because of their susceptibility to suggestive , leading questions .
No one in the United States has been executed for rape since 1964 .
Other state and federal crimes theoretically eligible for execution include treason , aggravated kidnapping , drug trafficking , aircraft hijacking and espionage .
None of these crimes have been prosecuted as a capital offense in decades , if ever .
In the appeal filed with the high court , Sothern argues Louisiana " flouts the overwhelming national consensus that capital punishment is an inappropriate penalty for any kind of rape . "
The law 's supporters counter that besides murder , no crime is more deserving of the death penalty , and the punishment would be used only in the most heinous of circumstances .
For its victims , " It takes away their innocence , it takes away their childhood , it mutilates their spirit .
It kills their soul .
They 're never the same after these things happen , " said Bartholomew , an assistant district attorney in Orleans Parish .
" Louisiana has been a pro-death penalty state for a very long time , " the prosecutor added .
" And I think a lot of people agree with the death penalty for this type of case here in our state . "
Five other states have similar laws .
Four of them -- Florida , Montana , Oklahoma and South Carolina -- have had them for years but not applied them in decades .
Texas enacted its version in June , but no defendant has yet been designated death - eligible for child rape in any state but Louisiana .
Skin color has also played a role in the political and legal debate over expanding capital crimes to include rape .
" When we look at the death penalty in the South we always need to be conscious of the role that race plays , " said Sothern , deputy director at the Capital Appeals Project , which represents all the state 's death row inmates .
" And I think that the fact that Mr. Kennedy [ is ] a black from Jefferson Parish , a place with a troubling record of racial discrimination , I think that that speaks volumes . "
Sothern cites Department of Justice statistics showing that all 14 rapists executed by Louisiana in the past 75 years were African - American .
Nationwide from 1930 to 1964 , nearly 90 percent of executed rapists were black , he said .
Kennedy recently was joined on Louisiana 's death row by another child rapist -- Richard Davis , who is white .
Davis ' legal appeals have barely begun .
The justices will no doubt consider loneliness of Louisiana 's aggressive position when deciding whether a national consensus now exists to allow a broader range of crimes to become subject to capital punishment .
The high court has in recent years banned execution for the mentally retarded , underage killers and those receiving an inadequate defense at trial .
Angola prison officials would not make Kennedy available for comment .
The youngster at the center of the case is now in college and wants to be a lawyer .
Her family says that like most underage victims , she has been scarred forever , and they believe her assailant deserves the jury 's punishment .
" It 's going to be justice , " said Lynn Ray , the victim 's cousin .
" It 's going to be that she can look forwards and not backwards , and not have to look over your shoulders , and one day see him .
Or see him coming after her . "
A ruling from the high court is expected by late June .

All About Capital Punishment • U.S. Supreme Court
We ’ve all heard various experts toot the horn of various elements of SEO : “ Content is king ! ” or “ It ’s all about the links . ”
Others tout their proprietary software tools or throw out terms like latent semantic indexing .
The truth is , all of these things play a part in SEO ( along with a bunch of other things ) , but if you focus on any one of these , you ’re missing the bigger picture .
SEO is about communication !
Communication is defined as : a process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols , signs , or behavior .
The communication process involves a sender and a receiver .
As long as both the sender and receiver both understand the common system of symbols , signs , or behavior , the sender ’s message will be understood .
Sounds simple enough , right ?
The challenge with any communication is that the message has to be properly encoded and then passed along through the communication medium or channel and then decoded and interpreted by the receiver of the message .
With search engine optimization , we are dealing with an intermediary ( the search engines ) who really are n’t our intended receiver at all .
We have to make sure the search engines understand the message we are sending , or the communication process breaks down and never makes it to our intended receiver .
This makes for a much more complicated communication process .
Google has made it perfectly clear that they are making every possible effort to improve the quality of its search engine .
This means they are doing their best to decode the meaning of web pages and other web content — at the same time they are decoding the meaning of users ’ search queries — all in an attempt to match up searchers with what they are looking for .
They are trying to improve the web search communication channel .
Our job as communicators is to create our websites and write content that makes it clear what we are trying to say .
If we send the right signals to Google through the structure and content on our site , internal and external links , and all the other “ seo ” tactics , Google will get the message and move our site to the top of the search heap .
Do n’t forget that getting Google to properly decode and interpret our message is only part of the communication process .
Google is not the final receiver of our message , remember ?
Ultimately you want your customers to find your site , click through and complete the desired action ( lead , sale , call , whatever ) .
Just getting your site to the top of the search engine for your desired keywords does not mean your intended customers will get your message .
If your title and description is just a bunch of mumbo jumbo , you wo n’t get many people clicking through .
Take care to use titles and descriptions that will convey the right message regarding what you have to offer .
Once they click through to your site , the real communication takes place .
If they do n’t immediately see what they were looking for , they will back out and look elsewhere .
If your message is not persuasive enough , the customer will move along to find something more convincing .
Provide enough content and enough value to satisfy the searcher ’s desire to find what they are looking for .
Speak the same language as your site visitors and they will be much more likely to decode your message in the way it was intended .
An important part of the communication process is feedback .
Try to get feedback from your website visitors .
Obviously , when you get get a sale on your website , you know your message was successfully received ( at least by that person ) .
What if you ’re not getting any sales ?
Or what about the other 95 % of the people who did n’t buy ?
Provide other feedback mechanisms to allow your customers to give you feedback about your message .
Provide clear calls to action and give them multiple ways to contact you and provide feedback .
Use your website analytics reports along with tools like ClickTale and CrazyEgg to find out your site visitors ’ behavior .
Spend the time to close the feedback loop so you can refine and improve your communication process .
Do n’t ever forget that SEO is about communication and the search engine is merely the medium to reach your desired recipient .
Ohio GOP illegally funneled $ 495,000 from federal account , top campaign finance official writes John Byrne
Published : Wednesday August 27 , 2008
Print This Email This Money went to support Blackwell gubernatorial bid , GOP spokesman says The Ohio Republican Party funneled $ 495,000 into an account used to support the candidacy of former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell that should have only been used to support candidates for national office , according to a letter from Ohio 's current Secretary of State and a GOP spokesman .
The letter says Ohio's Republican party collected nearly half a million dollars from a federal GOP account in October 2006 .
They also took in $ 20,000 from a state GOP account the same month and another $ 25,000 in November 2007 .
The letter does n't indicate which candidates received the party 's largesse .
But according a state GOP spokesman , the money supported just one candidate -- former Republican Secretary of State Ken Blackwell .
Blackwell ran for governor in 2006 , and lost .
Read the letter in pdf format here .
Blackwell achieved notoriety after allegations he abused his office as the state 's top elections official .
While serving as Secretary of State , which handles statewide elections , he also doubled as state chairman for George W. Bush 's 2004 reelection campaign .
Blackwell has been named in more than ten voter disenfranchisement lawsuits .
He was also named in a 2006 lawsuit after his office publicly disclosed the Social Security numbers of Ohio residents .
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 's office wrote Republican officials Monday .
Brunner is a Democrat .
" Pursuant to R.C. 3517.13 ( T ) ( 1 ) , a state or county political party shall not disburse moneys from any account other than a state candidate fund to make contributions to a state candidate fund , " the Secretary 's campaign finance administrator J. Curtis Mayhew wrote to the Republican Party 's state candidate fund 's treasurer Monday .
"
If that is the case , it will be necessary at this time to refund these contributions back to the party committee that made the expenditure . "
The letter indicated that the state has been attempting to get the Ohio GOP to issue refund checks for the amounts since at least July .
" The full value of the contributions ( $ 495,000 ) must be refunded at this time , " the letter says .
" Please provide a copy of the refund checks as soon as they are written . "
A spokesman for the Ohio Republican Party told a reporter the Secretary 's interpretation was incorrect .
" We 're seeking a legal opinion , " the spokesman said .
" We feel federal funds can be spent on a statewide race . "
Several years into a pair of wars , the Department of Veterans Affairs is struggling to cope with a task for which it was tragically unready : the care of soldiers who left Afghanistan and Iraq with an extra burden of brain injury and psychic anguish .
The last thing they need is the toxic blend of secrecy , arrogance and heedlessness that helped to send many of them into harm ’s way .
“ Shh ! ” said the e-mail in February from Dr. Ira Katz , head of mental health services for V.A. , to a colleague .
“ Our suicide prevention coordinators are identifying about 1,000 suicide attempts per month among the veterans we see in our medical facilities .
Is this something we should ( carefully ) address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it ? ”
Dr. Katz ’s hushed - up figure was nowhere near the number he gave to the House Veterans ’ Affairs Committee last year ; he said there had been 790 suicide attempts in all of 2007 , and denied there was a suicide epidemic .
The veterans affairs secretary , James Peake , apologized for Dr. Katz ’s “ unfortunate set of words ” and promised more candor and transparency .
Give some credit , anyway , to Mr. Peake for realizing that there is no hope of denying or wishing away this problem .
As the economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes made clear in “ The Three Trillion Dollar War , ” their analysis of Iraq , the medical toll of a war rises in a swelling curve for many decades after the shooting stops .
The current suicide figures include a large proportion of aging and ailing veterans of Vietnam .
Suffering for that long , on that scale , will not be covered up .
When tumor cells acquire the capacity to move around and invade other tissues , there is a risk of metastases and cancer treatment becomes more difficult .
At the Institut Curie , CNRS Director of Research Philippe Chavrier and his group have just discovered how breast cancer cells break the bonds that tether them to the tumor .
The basement membrane around the mammary gland is a barrier to the spread of cancer cells .
Three proteins in the tumor cells transport enzymes needed to perforate this barrier , and another protein puts these enzymes in the right place .
These discoveries , published in the 16 June 2008 issue of The Journal of Cell Biology and in Current Biology on 8 July 2008 , shed light on the early mechanisms of the formation of metastases in certain breast cancers .
These findings constitute an essential step in the quest for the early identification of highly invasive tumors , or even the blocking of formation of metastases .
Tissues are generally formed by cells arranged side by side .
Epithelial cells cover an outer surface , such as the skin or an organ such as the mammary gland , and remain tightly bound together .
This cohesion is vital to the body ’s functioning , and the epithelial cells remain in position in their original tissue until they die .
Sometimes , though , they detach and move away , and while such migration is essential during embryonic development as cells give rise to new tissues , when tumor cells break loose this often heralds the formation of metastases .
When tumor cells break loose
Tumor cells accumulate errors , become totally anarchic , and flout all the rules .
Some even become detached from the tumor through complex and poorly understood mechanisms .
The Membrane and Cytoskeleton Dynamics Group headed by Philippe Chavrier ( 1 ) ( UMR 144 CNRS / Institut Curie ) has now shed new light on the way cells , in this case breast cancer cells , escape their shackles .
The mammary gland is separated from the neighboring tissue by the basement membrane , which the tumor cells will have to cross before continuing on their way .
The cell first forms protrusions called invadopodia and anchors them in the basement membrane .
These “ feet ” provide everything needed to breach the membrane .
The tumor cells produce a whole range of proteases that degrade the proteins of the extracellular matrix that hems them in , part of which is the basement membrane .
These proteases cut a hole in the basement membrane through which the cells can escape .
In a first publication , the researchers used a model of metastatic breast cancer cells to show that the proteins sec3 , sec8 and IQGAP1 transport vesicles containing proteases to the invadopodia .
Without sec3 , sec8 and IQGAP1 the vesicles cannot be fastened to the ends of the invadopodia and so the cells fail to escape into the neighboring tissue .
Before the proteases can degrade the membrane , they must first be released from the vesicles .
In a second publication , Philippe Chavrier and colleagues show that the protein Vamp7 fuses protease - containing vesicles with the membrane of tumor cells .
Only then can the proteases at the ends of the invadopodia progressively erode the basement membrane of the mammary gland .
Inactivation of Vamp7 greatly reduces the ability of the breast cancer cells to degrade the extracellular matrix .
So tumor cells can only escape from the mammary gland by accomplishing a whole series of modifications .
Philippe Chavrier and his group have shown how they hijack cellular mechanisms to leave their original tissue , after which they can spread throughout the body and form metastases .
These discoveries may help to explain why certain breast cancers are more aggressive than others , or even to identify highly invasive tumors at an early stage .
It is also conceivable that tumor invasion could be blocked by acting on the underlying mechanisms identified by Philippe Chavrier and colleagues .

The Politico has finally taken note of John McCain 's serial gaffes on the campaign trail , like his recent reference to " Czechoslovakia " , a country that has n't existed for years .
The question is raised , of course , as to whether McCain is too old and senile to be president .
He 'll turn 72 soon , meaning that , if he 's elected and then re-elected , he'd be America 's first octogenarian president .
There 's no denying that 's pretty ancient , for a president .
Anyone who has watched his or her parents enter their eighth decade of life has witnessed them relying on an increasing mixture of medications that has Lord knows what effect on them , breaking down physically and forgetting things like the name of the family that lived next door for 40 years .
By the same token , though , McCain is obviously a fairly vigorous 71 - year - old .
I could n't keep up that campaign schedule .
And I doubt seriously that he really does n't know about the existences of the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
At the same time , some other observers argue Barack Obama does n't have the experience to be president .
It 's certainly the case that his time in the national arena has been brief , and it 's understandable if that gives some voters pause .
Plus , he 's made a few gaffes of his own .
On the other hand , he 's obviously good enough to have gotten this far .
Neither age nor relative inexperience should be , per se , disqualifiers .
The only a priori disqualifier ought to be this : is this person knowledgeable enough to be president ?
Not smart - that 's an IQ question , and lots of people with high IQ 's use that brainpower committing batting averages to memory .
Knowledgeable .
About America and the world .
God knows , after the horrors of the eight years from which we 're emerging , the importance of this should go without saying .
What follows are 20 facts that I would like my president to know , offered to you , my perpetually disgruntled readers , in the form of a quiz .
Give it a whirl .
It 's by definition a little idiosyncratic and not comprehensive , but I 'd hope that most of us would agree that it'd be a good idea if the American president knew most of these things without having to be briefed on them .

Irene Klotz of the Discovery Space website interviewed Edgar Mitchell about his claims that intelligent space creatures have landed on Earth and that the US government has been covering it up .
EM : My major knowledge comes from what I call the old - timers , people who were at Roswell and subsequent who wanted to clear the things up and tell somebody credible even though they were under severe threats and things — this was back in the Roswell days .
Having gone to the moon and being a local citizen out in the Roswell area some of them thought I would be a safe choice to tell their story to , which they did .
Even though the government put real clamps on everybody , it got out anyhow .
Subsequent to that , I did take my story to the Pentagon — not NASA , but the Pentagon — and asked for a meeting with the Intelligence Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and got it .
And told them my story and what I know and eventually had that confirmed by the admiral that I spoke with , that indeed what I was saying was true .
IK : You mean what had been told to you was true ?
EM : Yup , in other words .
There was a UFO crash .
There was an alien spacecraft .
This gentleman tried his damndest to get me in and like so many others in the administration over the last 60 years , since JFK 's time , was unable to .
He was told ' Admiral , you do n't have a need to know , and therefore go get lost , ' essentially .
The magazine said the cartoon " combines ... fantastical images " Barack Obama 's team has decried The New Yorker magazine for a cartoon cover depicting him in traditional Muslim garb and his wife as a terrorist .
The magazine says the cartoon is intended as a satirical comment about some of the distorted right - wing attacks on the Democratic senator .
An Obama campaign spokesman said the cartoon was " tasteless and offensive " .
A spokesman for John McCain , Mr Obama 's Republican rival in the presidential election , also criticised the cartoon .
The image , drawn by Barry Blitt and featured on the front cover of this week 's New Yorker , shows Mr Obama wearing traditional Muslim dress , while his wife , Michelle , is dressed in combat trousers and carrying a machine - gun .
The couple are shown standing in the Oval Office , greeting one another with a " fist bump " , with an American flag burning in the fireplace , and a portrait of Osama Bin Laden on the wall .
' Mirror to prejudice '
In a statement , The New Yorker magazine said the cartoon " combines a number of fantastical images about the Obamas and shows them for the obvious distortions they are . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The New Yorker said the cover , called " The Politics of Fear " , was a critique of unfounded allegations that have tried to portray Mr Obama , a Christian , as a closet radical Muslim .
" The burning flag , the nationalist - radical and Islamic outfits , the fist - bump , the portrait on the wall ?
All of them echo one attack or another .
Satire is part of what we do , and it is meant to bring things out into the open , to hold up a mirror to prejudice , the hateful , and the absurd .
And that 's the spirit of this cover , " the statement said .
The portrayal of the Obamas " fist - bumping " one another was a reference to a campaign rally in St Paul , Minnesota , back in June , at which the couple were seen to " fist - bump " , an action described by one Fox News commentator as a " terrorist fist - jab " .
The presenter - E D Hill who subsequently lost her Fox News show - later apologised for the comments , and insisted that they had not been meant seriously .
The New Yorker said that this week 's edition carried two " very serious " articles about Mr Obama .
But Obama spokesman Bill Burton dismissed the cartoon , saying : " The New Yorker may think ... that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Senator Obama 's right - wing critics have tried to create , but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive .
And we agree . "

The Republican National Committee released a statement today that claimed because of Jim Johnson ’s loans from Countywide , the Obama campaign is full lobbyists and corporate insiders .
“ Barack Obama routinely rails against lobbyists and corporate insiders , yet his campaign is stocked with both . ”
“ Now it turns out that the man leading his vice presidential selection team is receiving highly questionable loans .
With millions of Americans struggling to pay their mortgages , it raises serious questions about Obama ’s judgment when we learn members of his campaign leadership are receiving favors that the average American would never get .
With Obama discussing the economy today , he needs to stand up and address the mortgage scandals within his campaign , ” the statement continued .
Interestingly , the RNC did not name any of the other lobbyists and corporate insiders that the Obama campaign is crawling with .
Of course , the real points of this attack are that Obama is as an elitist with poor judgment .
They want to portray John McCain as the “ real ” voice for change in this campaign .
The problem is that McCain has 134 lobbyists working for his campaign .
Advertisements
To give you a specific example of how deeply the lobbyists have penetrated the McCain campaign , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ran a story a few days ago that McCain ’s top political advisor Charlie Black , his national finance co-chair Wayne Berman , and a member of his judiciary advisory committee Dan Coats have all lobbied for the telecommunications companies in favor of immunity against lawsuits stemming from their participation in the government ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
The presence of these lobbyists helps to explain why McCain changed his position from being against immunity six months ago , to now favoring it today .
If one looks at Obama gigantic grassroots Internet fundraising operation , it is obvious that is not a special interest campaign , but Republicans are so afraid of Obama ’s change message that they will stretch anything to try to build a scandal to stop it .
There are some valid criticisms that can be made of Obama , but saying that his campaign is stocked with lobbyists and corporate insiders is certainly not one of them .

I got all tarted up for the wedding and was dancing with all the guys to Journey and Ton Loc and Timbaland .
I 'm - about - to - strip - and - i'm - well - equipped etc .
God I love weddings .
I probably had a few too many and when that overzealous strapping groomsman who just graduated college decided we were going to twirl only he lifted the wrong arm and clotheslined me in the face and I staggered backward and rolled my ankle .
Wearing four inch strappy stilettos which made me about 6 ' 2 .
And that much farther to fall .
Were you watching me then ?
Yeah I was a trooper .
Ankle was crying out in pain but all I cared about was my next vodka tonic and whether I had enough time to get it before Sex Bomb started playing .
I can tell by your behavior last night you like Tom Jones and Mousse T just as much as I do .
At some point later in the night here I am walking into the local taco joint wearing no shoes .
Politely took them off and left them at the door .
It was raining outside and thankfully the types of dresses I wear to weddings can endure some serious abuse .
I hopped up on the counter , flashed my most engaging smile and demanded two beef softshell badboys and some ice for my swelling ankle .
Was it there that I caught your eye , confident and defiant as I sucked the cheese out of my jalepeno poppers as the nice guys working there prepared an ice pack and listened to my story about how I had hurt my ankle coming to the aid of an elderly woman when some hooligan tried to steal her purse ?
I 'll have you know he went down like a ton of bricks when I pistol whipped him , but while kicking him in the head for good measure I seem to have hurt my ankle .
Tough world out there .
No country for old men , or good samaritans in slinky black dresses and high heels .
I 'll bet you were impressed when they gave me my tacos for free .
Maybe it was in the parking lot that you decided to come home with me .
I could n't really tell .
When I woke up the next morning there was a trail of my clothes and shoes and other various personal belongings .
Apparently I had tipped the bar staff handsomely , and for that they had rewarded me with a to - go cup .
The bed showed signs of struggle .
Reaching for my glass to see if it's empty and surprised at the searing pain radiating not from my ankle , nor my rump , nor my head , nor any orifice , but the back of my knee ?
Imagine my horror when I flung back the colors and saw the damage that you had inflicted in my unconscious state .
You sank your fangs into that cute little dimple behind my knee ( now there 's a fetish I have n't heard of ) , leaving a deep round wound and enough venom to swell my leg up to twice its unbitten size .
Between the numbness and the stiffness I had to stagger around my house like a deranged pirate with a pegleg trying to figure out whether you were still there or had fled stealthily into the night .
But you were long gone .
So please , at least tell me your name or what you look like , and possibly confirm your genus ?
I 've heard that some of you are so nasty your conquests require medical attention or risk serious infection .
At the very least I 'm gonna need to give a description to the doctor tomorrow morning , and the story I 've just told is not going to cut it .
PS . Just so you know , you are not the first to leave me with bite marks in odd places in the morning .
Just the first who was rude enough not to give me a chance to reciprocate .
In more than a year of campaigning , Barack Obama has made a long list of promises for new federal programs costing tens of billions of dollars , many of them aimed at protecting people from the pain of a souring economy .
But if he wins the presidency , Obama will be hard - pressed to keep his blueprint intact .
A variety of budget analysts are skeptical that the Democrat ’s agenda could survive in the face of large federal budget deficits and the difficulty of making good on his plan to raise new revenue by closing tax loopholes , ending the Iraq war and cutting spending that is deemed low - priority .
Like predecessors who also had to square far - reaching promises with inescapable budget realities , they say , a President Obama might need to jettison pieces of Obama-ism .
“ I do n’t think it all adds up , ” Isabel Sawhill , an official in President Clinton ’s Office of Management and Budget , said of Obama ’s spending plans .
Advertisement
“ There will definitely need to be a recalibration of these proposals once someone is in office , ” said Sawhill , now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
“ The fiscal situation just is n’t going to permit doing what Sen. Obama or anyone else would like . ”
On Monday , Obama repeated his commitment to his agenda , as both he and his Republican opponent , John McCain , spent the day highlighting their plans to revive the economy .
McCain , appearing in Denver , said he would create new jobs and balance the budget by the end of his first term in 2013 -- a claim that has drawn skepticism because he wants to extend President Bush ’s tax cuts that are due to expire .
Obama said Monday that his plan would provide more help to struggling middle - class families .

“ I think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in America ’s families , ” the senator from Illinois told reporters in St. Louis , where his plane made an unscheduled stop to resolve a mechanical problem .
In remarks he had intended to deliver in North Carolina , Obama said his plan would “ not only ensure the economic security of middle - class families in the long term , but also the need to give them a chance for some relief in the short term , to make sure that Americans are n’t just getting by but getting ahead . ”
Among other proposals during the course of the campaign , Obama has said he would strengthen the nation ’s bridges and dams ( $ 6 billion a year ) , help make men better fathers ( $ 50 million a year ) and aid Iraqis displaced by the war ( $ 2 billion in one - time spending ) .
Last week , he pledged to give religious and community groups $ 500 million a year to provide summer education to low - income children .
Other proposals are more costly .
Obama wants to extend health insurance to more people ( part of a $ 65 - billion - a - year health plan ) , develop cleaner energy sources ( $ 15 billion a year ) , curb home foreclosures ( $ 10 billion in one - time spending ) and add $ 18 billion a year to education spending .

It is a far different blueprint than McCain is offering .
The senator from Arizona has proposed relatively little new spending , arguing that tax cuts and private business are more effective means of solving problems .
The total price tag of Obama ’s plans , according to his campaign , is $ 130 billion a year .
On top of that , Obama is proposing a middle - class tax cut of about $ 80 billion a year .
Obama ’s campaign says the new spending would be more than offset by cuts to existing federal programs and other savings .
“ His plan reallocates what we ’re spending today on the war in Iraq and wasteful and low - priority government programs into higher - priority investments in our future , ” said Jason Furman , Obama ’s economic policy director .

Some budget experts point to the last Democratic presidency , Bill Clinton ’s , as an example of the budget pressures Obama might face .
Clinton campaigned in 1992 on a platform he called “ Putting People First , ” which included government spending on job training and other programs to help middle - class Americans navigate the economy .
But after his election , Clinton scaled back his ambitions and made deficit - cutting a priority instead , following the counsel of advisors such as Robert E. Rubin .
Clinton wound up charting a centrist course in his two terms , and declared in 1996 that “ the era of big government is over . ”
Rubin is now an advisor to Obama .
One of the men who also wanted Clinton to cut the deficit first was Leon E. Panetta , who eventually became Clinton ’s chief of staff .

Panetta predicts that Obama is in for a similar reckoning .
“ I accept that all candidates throw out a lot of proposals when they ’re campaigning , ” Panetta said in an interview .
“ You have to assume that ’s all part of a campaign strategy to appeal to a lot of different constituencies that are out there .
But once he enters the Oval Office , he ’s going to have to make some hard decisions . ”
Obama ’s staff thinks that ending the Iraq war would free up money -- at least $ 90 billion a year -- that could be redirected to the new government programs .
But it is unclear when that would occur .
Obama has not given a clear date by which the Iraq war might end .
On Thursday , he said he remained committed to withdrawing combat troops in 16 months .
At a debate in September , he would not commit to pulling all U.S. troops out of Iraq by 2013 .
Some budget experts say even a speedy end to the war would not give Obama much money for new programs .
Advertisement
“ You cannot justify a longer - term commitment to a program based on a one - time saving on the war in Iraq , ” said Stuart Butler , who studies domestic policy at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative - leaning think tank .
In addition , replenishing the military and rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan are certain to become expensive priorities once the fighting stops , said Alice Rivlin , who directed the Office of Management and Budget for several years under Clinton .
“ Savings from the Iraq war will not be all that great , ” she said .
Other new sources of revenue in Obama ’s plan include about $ 80 billion a year from closing tax loopholes and $ 100 billion from a variety of cuts in spending and revised government procurement rules .
Advertisement
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center examined Obama ’s plans to eliminate tax loopholes and said it could not confirm the projected savings .
“ If you look at official revenue estimates , the numbers come out to be less than half of what they say they ’re going to raise , ” said Len Burman , director of the center and a former Treasury official in the Clinton administration , referring to Obama ’s campaign staff .
McCain has cited similar proposals to free up revenue as part of his plan to balance the budget by 2013 , saying he would cut pork - barrel spending and other “ wasteful ” programs .
He says that winning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would generate savings that could be plowed into deficit reduction .
Unlike McCain , Obama says he could recoup about $ 100 billion a year by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for families earning more than $ 250,000 annually -- but some analysts question that too .
Advertisement
Those tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2010 , so repealing them a couple of years earlier would hardly result in a windfall that could be used as a continuing funding source , they say .
The Obama campaign responds that tax cuts , once enacted , are usually renewed and do not expire .
Therefore , they say , Obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts .
Obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do .
His $ 10 - billion fund to reduce home foreclosures , for example , is part of a $ 50 - billion plan to stimulate the economy through increased government spending .
Paying for the program through spending cuts would defeat the point of the stimulus , the campaign says .
Advertisement
Also complicating his plans , Obama would inherit a budget deficit projected at more than $ 400 billion .
Another burden is the rising cost of Medicare and other entitlement programs .
In this environment , new programs may prove unaffordable .

HUGE Fire at Universal Studios ( Photos )
Universal Studio
The
There is a large fire ats .
The fire started around 4:45 AM PT on the New York and New England sound stages and continued to spread .
L.A. City Fire Department dispatched over 400 firefighters to the scene to fight the blaze .
Captain Brown from the LAFD stated that 9 firefighters and a sheriff 's deputy were treated for injuries and the fire has been contained , though the thick black smoke plume is still hanging in the air .
There were numerous propane tank explosions in several of the buildings .
Helicopters were seen dropping water onto the burning structures .
Fire officials were concerned about the fire spreading to outlying brush and reported that water supplies were low at times throughout the day .
Investigators have not yet pinpointed how the blaze began .
A total of three blocks of facades dating back to the 1930's were destroyed .
President and COO or Universal Studios Ron Meyer said :
Fortunately , nothing irreplaceable was lost .
The video library was affected and damaged , but our main vault of our motion picture negatives was not .
The Changeling set , Courthouse Square where scenes from Back to the Future were shot , the Earthquake ride and the King Kong exhibit were destroyed .
Between 40,000 and 50,000 videos and reels in vaults were damaged but duplicates are kept at another location .
This is not the first fire to threaten the studio .
Six major blazes have struck the Universal backlot over the years , as far back as 1932 and as most recently as 1997 .
Check out photos of the blaze on the next page .

Eleven years ago , a woman who had immigrated from South America several years earlier went to Battery Park with her sister to see the Statue of Liberty .
At her sister ’s urging , she brought along a Statue of Liberty costume that she made for the previous Halloween , a papier - mâché mask and a canvas sheet she had sprayed green .
At the park , her sister took a picture of her fully regaled , and almost immediately , strangers started crowding around .
Could she pose for a picture ?
How about another ?
Now another ?
Everyone wanted a photo taken with Miss Liberty , and a lot of them started pressing money on her to say thanks : a dollar here , a quarter there .
After a few hours , Miss Liberty had so much cash that she felt less like a symbol of American freedom than a walking piggy bank .
So she did n’t walk — she threw off her robe , stuffed it and her wad of cash in a bag , and ran all the way to the subway .
She had been working as an illustrator , but the work was irregular and solitary .
So Miss Liberty started showing up with her costume at Battery Park during slow spells and collecting money from eager tourists , eventually getting a permit from the city .
Miss Liberty made new friends at work — for example , Silver Man , a Battery Park performer who covered himself in silver face makeup and silver garb and moved like a robot for the crowds .
Silver Man ’s doctor did n’t like what his job was doing for his skin , so Miss Liberty invited him to join her line of work near Castle Clinton , where tourists get tickets for the ferry to the Statue of Liberty .

“ Once they reach the end of the season , ” Dr. Karsten said , “ they ’re done , ” and they will drop from the trees with the papery grace of autumn leaves .
Assuming the execution orders are somehow part of the chameleon ’s program , researchers might be able to identify the specific genetic or hormonal assassins in lizard cells , find their analogues in human cells and put a cap in them .
The new work also underscores the growing use of so - called life history theory to trace the history and contours of life on Earth .
Scientists have determined that many essential features of an animal ’s portfolio are linked , among them whether at birth it looks fetal and helpless like a newborn kitten or precocious and competent like a neonatal giraffe ; how big the average litter is ; the speed with which the animal reaches sexual maturity ; the length of time between births ; and the pace at which an adult ages .
Try to improve or optimize one of these parameters and you end up paying somewhere else along the line .
“ One of the most robust things to come out of life history theory is that trade - offs exist , ” said Steven N. Austad , the author of “ Why We Age ” and a professor of cellular and structural biology at the University of Texas Health Science Center .
“ If you increase the number of young , the cost is often accelerated aging .
If you get something that lives longer , you get costs early in life , with lower fertility and even sterility . ”

Selective pressures in the environment push species toward one life history course or another .
One example is that if you ’re a species in which the great majority of adults end up being killed by predators or disease , it ’s best to invest your resources in breeding early and often and not to bother worrying about long - term needs like a robust DNA repair system .
And so it is that rodents beloved by carnivores everywhere have high fecundity and relatively poor longevity .
There has been the most extraordinary series of postings at Climate Audit over the last week .
As is usual at CA , there is a heavy mathematics burden for the casual reader , which , with a bit of research I think I can now just about follow .
The story is a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cyncism that is rife among climate scientists , and I 'm going to try to tell it in layman 's language so that the average blog reader can understand it .
As far as I know it 's the first time the whole story has been set out in a single posting .
It 's a long tale - and the longest posting I think I 've ever written and piecing it together from the individual CA postings has been a long , hard but fascinating struggle .
You may want to get a long drink before starting , and those who suffer from heart disorders may wish to take their beta blockers first .
At some time or another , most people will have seen the hockey stick - the iconic graph which purports to show that after centuries of stable temperatures , the second half of the twentieth century saw a sudden and unprecedented warming of the globe .
This was caused , we were told , by mankind burning fossil fuels and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
For a while , the hockey stick was everywhere - unimpeachable evidence that mankind was damaging the planet - an impact that would require drastic measures to reverse .
The stick 's most famous outing however was just a couple of years ago when it made a headlining appearance in Al Gore 's drama - documentary , An Inconvenient Truth .
The revelation of the long , thin graph with its dramatic temperature rise in the last few decades , and the audience gasps that accompanied it , is something of a key moment for many environmentalists .
Shortly after its publication , the hockey stick and its main author , Michael Mann , came under attack from Steve McIntyre , a retired statistician from Canada .
In a series of scientific papers and later on his blog , Climate Audit , McIntyre took issue with the novel statistical procedures used by the hockey stick 's authors .
He was able to demonstrate that the way they had extracted the temperature signal from the tree ring records was biased so as to choose hockey - stick shaped graphs in preference to other shapes , and criticised Mann for not publishing the cross validation R2 , a statistical measure of how well the temperature reconstruction correlated with actual temperature records .
He also showed that the appearance of the graph was due solely to the use of an estimate of historic temperatures based on tree rings from bristlecone pines , a species that was known to be problematic for this kind of reconstruction .
The controversy raged for several years , involving blue riband panels , innumerable blog postings , endless name - calling and dark insinuations about motivations and conflicts of interest .
In May 2005 , at the height of the controversy , and on the very day that McIntyre was making a rare public appearance in Washington to discuss his findings , two Mann associates , Caspar Amman and Eugene Wahl , issued a press release in which they claimed that they had submitted two manuscripts for publication , which together showed that they had replicated the hockey stick exactly , confirmed its statistical underpinnings and demonstrated that McIntyre 's criticisms were baseless .
This was trumpeted as independent confirmation of the hockey stick .
A few eyebrows were raised at the dubious practice of using a press release to announce scientific findings .
Some also noted that on the rare occasions that this kind of announcement is made , it tends to be about papers that have been published , or at least accepted for publication .
To make such a dramatic announcement about the submission of a paper was unusual in the extreme .
The first of these papers ( " the GRL paper " ) was submitted to Geophysical Research Letters , the journal of the American Geophysical Union .
It took the form of a rebuttal of a McIntyre paper that had attacked the hockey stick and had been published in the same journal .
From the first , the McIntyre paper had been controversial .
Apart from Amman and Wahl 's paper , there were three other papers taking issue with it .
However , it turned out that some of these attempted rebuttals were less well formed than others .
In fairly short order , Amman and Wahl 's paper was rejected , many of its criticisms either relating to other McIntyre papers than the one at hand , or relying on the second paper for their arguments .
Since the second paper was unpublished , it was effectively impossible for McIntyre to defend himself against these criticisms .
Shortly after Amman and Wahl 's paper was rejected , another of the rebuttals , that of a physicist called David Ritson , was also shot down by the journal 's editors .
Meanwhile the second , longer paper ( " the CC paper " ) had started its long road to publication at the journal Climatic Change .
This article purported to be a replication of the hockey stick and confirmation of its scientific correctness .
However , in a surprising turn of events , the journal 's editor , prominent global warming catastrophist Steven Schneider , mischievously asked none other than Steve McIntyre to be one of the paper 's anonymous peer reviewers .
We have seen above that one of the chief criticisms of the hockey stick was the fact that its author , Michael Mann , had withheld the validation statistics so that it was impossible for anyone to gauge the reliability of the reconstruction .
These validation statistics were to be key to the subsequent story .
At the time of their press release Wahl and Amman had made public the computer code that they 'd used in their papers .
By the time their paper was submitted to Climatic Change , McIntyre had reconciled their work with his own so that he understood every difference .
And he therefore now knew that Wahl and Amman 's work suffered from exactly the same problem as the hockey stick itself : the R2 number was so low as to suggest that the hockey stick had no meaning at all , although another statistic , the reduction of error statistic ( or RE ) was relatively high .
It was only this latter figure that had been mentioned in the paper .
In other words , far from confirming the scientific integrity of the hockey stick , Wahl and Amman 's work confirmed McIntyre 's criticisms of it !
McIntyre 's first action as a peer reviewer was therefore to request from Wahl and Amman the verification statistics for their replication of the stick .
Confirmation that the R2 was close to zero would strike a serious blow at Wahl and Amman 's work .
Caspar AmmanWahl and Amman 's response was to refuse any access to the verification numbers , a clear flouting of the journal 's rules .
As a justification of this extraordinary action , they claimed that they had shown that McIntyre 's criticisms had been rebutted in their forthcoming GRL paper , despite the fact that the paper had been rejected by the journal some days earlier .
At the start of July , with his review of the CC paper complete , McIntyre took the opportunity to probe this point , by asking the journal to find out the anticipated publication date of the GRL paper .
Wahl and Amman were forced to admit the rejection , but they declared that it was unjustified and that they would seek publication elsewhere .
Sir John HoughtonWith the replication of the hockey stick in tatters , reasonable people might have expected some sort of pause in the political momentum .
Seasoned observers of the climate scene , however , will be unsurprised to hear that global warming eminences grises like Sir John Houghton and Michael Mann continued to cite the Wahl and Amman papers despite the CC paper being in publishing limbo and the GRL paper being apparently dead and buried .
The Wahl and Amman press release was not withdrawn either .
Events soon took another surprising turn . ,
It was announced that the editor in chief of Geophysical Research Letters , Jay Famiglietti , had taken over the file for the McIntyre paper and its responses .
This was justified he claimed , because of the high number of responses - four - that the McIntyre paper had received .
That two of those responses had been rejected and were no longer in play was not mentioned .
The reason for the change quickly became apparent though when , at the end of September , the rejected response from David Ritson turned out not only to have been re-submitted but had also been accepted for publication .
This was another clear breach of the journal 's rules , which required that an article 's author should be able to comment on responses before they were accepted .
Famiglietti however refused to make any on - the - record comments about why he behaved as he did .
Jay Famiglietti
If McIntyre had any suspicions about the implications of Famiglietti's malfeasance , he must have been quite certain when , shortly afterwards , hockey stick author Michael Mann commented on his RealClimate blog that both the CC and the GRL papers were going to be accepted shortly .
Sure enough , in the last week of September , the GRL paper was resubmitted and revisions were made to the CC paper .
Both papers were back in play again .
As 2005 neared its end , two important events loomed large .
The first was the year end deadline for submission of papers for the IPCC 's Fourth Assessment Report on the state of the climate , and realisation soon dawned on McIntyre and the observers of the goings - on at GRL :
the IPCC needed to have the Wahl and Amman papers in the report so that they could continue to use the hockey stick , with its frightening and unprecedented uptick in temperatures .
Mountains were going to be moved to keep the papers in play .
The other important happening was the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union , which would be attended by many of the big names in paleoclimate and at which both McIntyre and Amman would be making presentations .
McIntyre 's plan was to use the question and answer session after Amman 's presentation to once again press for the R2 number for the hockey stick , a figure that had never been released , despite it being constantly requested over the previous years by McIntyre , journals , politicians and journalists .
Sure enough , when confronted , Amman once again prevaricated .
After the session , McIntyre attempted to clear the air by inviting Amman to lunch .
In the circumstances , this seems to have been a relatively amicable affair , but McIntyre 's suggestion that he and Amman write a joint paper outlining where they agreed and where they differed was not taken up .
When McIntyre later formalised this offer in an email , Amman failed even to acknowledge it .
While the AGU was meeting in San Francisco , Climate Change had provisionally accepted Wahl and Amman 's CC paper , any objections which might have been raised by McIntyre swept aside by simple means of not inviting him to review the second draft .
The resubmitted version of the paper turned out to be almost identical to the old one , except that a new section on the statistical treaments had been added , presumably as a condition of acceptance .
And here there was an upside because , buried deep within the paper , Amman and Wahl had quietly revealed their verification R2 figures , which were , just as McIntyre had predicted , close to zero for most of the reconstruction , strongly suggesting that the hockey stick had little predictive power .
Their decision to reveal these key data is necessarily obscure , but may well have been prompted by McIntyre 's decision to file a complaint of academic misconduct about Amman with his employers , UCAR .
Although the complaint was rejected , it may well have put sufficient pressure on Amman and the journal to show the numbers that everyone wanted to see .
The CC paper 's provision acceptance date was December 12th , just a few days before the AR4 deadline .
Strangely the version that was accepted seems to have been dated 24th Feb 2006 , so according to its rules the IPCC should n't have been able to considered it .
And what is more , it appears that the new sections discussing the statistical verifications were only added in this post year - end version .
As McIntyre put it :
So under its own rules , is IPCC allowed to refer to Ammann and Wahl [ 2006 ] ?
Of course not .
Will they ?
We all know the answer to that .
When they refer to Ammann and Wahl [ 2006 ] , will they also refer to its confirmation of our claims about MBH verification r2 statistics .
Of course not .
That information was not available to them in December .
But wait a minute , if Ammann and Wahl was in press in December , would n’t that information have been available to them ?
Silly me .
In other words , the version of the paper which had gone forward to the IPCC did n't include the adverse verification statistics , but the version accepted by the journal did .
The IPCC got their rebuttal of McIntyre and the journal got a fig leaf of respectability to cover up its duplicity .
By March , the CC paper had been fully accepted , but there was to be another hiccup that would threaten its existence .
After all the shenanigans at GRL with the replacement of the editor and the resubmission of letters , the journal decided once again to reject Wahl and Amman 's attempt to rebut McIntyre 's work .
Ostensibly this was because the arguments were " already out there " , but the truth was surely that there were so many holes in the statistical arguments as to make their publishing an embarrassment to the journal .
This new rejection was a problem for the CC paper , as I will explain below .
When using an R2 verification , researchers can refer to tables of benchmarks to gauge the significance of their results .
Now that the fact that the hockey stick and Amman and Wahl 's replication of it were public , Amman was arguing that the correct measure of significance was in fact the alternative RE statistic .
His problem was that for RE statistics , there are no tables of benchmarks for the researcher to refer to - he has to establish a benchmark of his own by other means .
And Amman had done this in the GRL paper which had just been rejected .
Without the GRL paper , he could n't even argue that his results in CC were statistically significant .
There is a rule of thumb for RE statistics : this says that positive RE numbers have some significance while negative ones do not .
Unfortunately for Amman , this rule applies only to linear regressions ; as the hockey stick was clearly not linear , it could n't apply .
The original hockey stick authors had claimed that they had created a benchmark through other means , and that the figure was still zero .
Now , while they had been silent on the issue in their original GRL submission , Amman and Wahl announced in their resubmission that they had performed benchmarking calculations and that had confirmed that the significance level for the RE should remain at zero .
However , now that the resubmission had been rejected by GRL , the " establishment " of this benchmark was cancelled out , and the statistical arguments in the CC paper which relied on it could no longer be maintained .
And then silence .
A year later , the CC paper was nowhere to be seen , despite having been accepted for publication .
It was stuck in a kind of publishing limbo once again .
This left the IPCC and Climatic Change with a problem .
McIntyre observed :
I ’m intrigued as to what the final Wahl and Ammann version will look like .
They have an intriguing choice : the inclusion of a reference to this article in AR4 was premised on their article being “ in press ” which would prohibit them from re-working their article to deal with the GRL rejection .
But the article needs to be re-worked since it will look pretty silly to describe their GRL article as “ under review ” over 18 months after it has been rejected .
In the background , howevrer , much had been happening .
Suddenly in September 2007 , and with the IPCC report published , the CC paper suddenly appeared , preceded in the same journal by another paper by the same authors .
What had happened was that Wahl and Amman were quietly allowed to rewrite their rejected GRL paper and submit it to Climatic Change instead .
All reference to the rejected GRL paper in the CC paper could be replaced by reference to the new paper , ( which I will call the Jesus paper , in light of its extraordinary resurrection and for lack of any less confusing name ) .
With identical authorship , and a maze of cross-references between them , the two CC papers were carefully designed to make understanding how their arguments relied on each other as difficult as possible .
The beauty of this approach was that it allowed for retention of the original acceptance date for the CC paper , and hence its inclusion in the IPCC process .
It did leave them with the embarrassing problem that a paper that was allegedly accepted in March 2006 relied upon another paper that even the journal itself said was only received until August ( and in reality , is was even later than that )
Readers should note that this matters because unless the paper was accepted by the journal by the deadline , it should not have been accepted by IPCC for inclusion in the Fourth Assessment Report .
But the IPCC needed the CC paper and despite the inconsistency being pointed out to them , the IPCC they waved the objections aside as irrelevant .
The CC paper argument leads from the text , to the appendix and then onto the Jesus paper .
At places in the Jesus paper the argument referred back to the CC paper creating a neat , if logically flawed , circular argument .
One notable feature of the CC paper and the Jesus paper was that they relegated some of their key argumentation to their Supplementary Information ( SI ) sections , online appendices to the published papers .
In particular , the Jesus paper stated that the statistical discussions and more precisely , the establishment of RE benchmarks could be seen there .
To have key arguments in the SI was most unusual and it quickly became apparent why it had been done : the SI was nowhere to be seen .
Even the peer reviewers appear not to have had access , and once again , Amman refused McIntyre 's request for the data and code .
His reply to this request was startling ( and remember that Amman is a public servant ) :
Under such circumstances , why would I even bother answering your questions , is n’t that just lost time ?
Again , everything fell silent .
For the next year nothing more was heard of the two papers .
McIntyre pressed from his blog for release of the SI and the politicians were able to quietly take advantage of the political space created by the IPCC report .
Then , just a few weeks ago , and entirely unannounced , Wahl and Amman 's Supplementary Information suddenly appeared on Caspar Amman 's website , some three years after that first press release announcing the refutation of McIntyre 's work .
With it , and a godsend to McIntyre , was the code used to establish the benchmark for the RE statistic .
With no more than a few days work , McIntyre was able to establish exactly what had been done .
You will remember that Amman and Wahl had claimed that they had established a benchmark of zero for a 99 % significant RE score - that is to say , there is only a 1 % chance that you might have got that score by chance .
McIntyre had , much earlier , shown that if you ran red noise through the process , you could get RE scores of more than 0.5 .
( Red noise is best described as a " random walk " - a line which wiggles at random , but is not entirely random like white noise . )
To reduce your chance of random error to 1 % you actually needed to score 0.54 for RE .
How Amman had come up with zero as his benchmark was a mystery .
Now , with the code in front of him , McIntyre could see exactly what Wahl and Amman had done .
And what they had done was to calculate almost exactly the same figure as he had !
The number they had arrived at was 0.52 , just a whisker away from McIntyre 's own 0.54 , but they had reported to the world that it was sufficient only to score a positive number !
Of course , this was n't picked up by the peer reviewers because , as we 've seen , they did n't have access to the Supplementary Information , but the IPCC 's purposes had been served - the hockey stick found its way intact into the Fourth Assessment Report , unscathed by skirmishes with inconvenient statistical truths .
However , the figure of 0.52 was insufficient for W&A 's purposes .
Their problem was that the key component of the hockey stick had a verification RE of 0.48 , leaving it tantalisingly just below the calculated benchmark .
They needed it to be in the top rank and getting it there was going to be tricky .
For each simulation , a thousand runs through the statistical sausage machine were perfomed and the RE number , the correlation with the temperature record , was recorded .
Then all the runs were sorted in order of RE value , the best runs having the highest RE and the worst the lowest .
W&A needed to show that the hockey stick RE was right up there with the best simulations - in the top one percent .
While its RE was high , it was n't good enough .
And it was no good simply removing runs which had a higher score than the hockey stick , since this would not increase its position enough - they would have been reducing the total number of runs as well as the number of runs which were scoring better than the hockey stick .
To get the answer they needed , the higher scoring runs had to be made to be lower than the hockey stick , but left in the calculation .
To do this , Wahl and Amman came up with a value which they called a calibration / verification RE ratio .
As the name suggests , this was the ratio of the two RE numbers for calibration and verification .
This ratio is however , entirely unknown to statistics , or to any other branch of science .
But it was not plucked out of the air .
The ratio and the threshold value which was set for it by Wahl and Amman was carefully calculated .
They argued that any run with a ratio less than 0.75 should be assigned a score of - 9999 .
Since the hockey stick had a score of 0.813 , 0.75 was pretty much the highest level you could go to without rejecting the hockey stick itself .
However if you set your ratio threshold too low , not enough runs would be rejected and the hockey stick would no longer be " 99 % significant " .
Some of the results of this ratio were entirely perverse - it was possible for a run that had scored a reasonably good RE in the calibration ( there was a good correlation between it and the actual temperatures ) to be thrown out of the final assessment on the grounds that it had done very well in the verification - the correlation with actual temperatures was considered too good !
With this new , and pretty much entirely arbitrary hurdle in place , Wahl and Amman were able to reject several of the runs which stood between the hockey stick and what they saw as its rightful place as the gold standard for climate reconstructions .
That the statistical foundations on which they had built this paleoclimate castle were a swamp of misrepresentation , deceit and malfeasance was , to Wahl and Amman , an irrelevance .
For political and public consumption , the hockey stick still lived , ready to guide political decision - making for years to come .
12 Aug : Minor updates for typos etc .
Also , I think I 'm right in saying that the correct usage in UK English is " blue riband " , not " blue ribbon " , or that they are at least valid alternatives .
Apologies to my North American readers .

4 Sept . It was pointed out that I 've used the term " CC paper " before defining it .
I 've changed the relevant paragraph to read " second paper " .
Over the last two decades , I have used every flavour of Windows and Mac OS , but ' til now had never used a Linux desktop .
My only encounter with Linux has been flashing my wifi access point with dd - wrt firmware ( which is great , btw ) - but that is obviously not the same thing !
George Wright recently convinced me to take home a laptop with Fedora9 installed .
Would it be possible to easily connect to wpa2 - protected wifi ?
Will it recognize my digital camera - and if so , how easy will it be to manage my pictures ?
How good will the web browsing experience be given the various plugins one needs to make today 's websites work ?
Lots of questions ; time to find out for myself ...
To my surprise , I found the experience pretty good .
Connecting to my home network was easy and web browsing worked fine using Firefox .
I tried BBC iPlayer streaming using Flash and that worked fine too .
Getting pictures of the kids transferred was not a problem .
I did have some issues with connecting to my network - attached storage , but that is probably my lack of knowledge .
While I think the user experience has some way to go in order to catch up with commercial operating systems , the basic functionality is there .
The one thing I was surprised about was the performance , or lack thereof .
I would have expected the operating system to squeeze everything out of the dual processor laptop .
Perhaps the issue would be addressed by new updates which were available , but I could not get it to install properly .
Another more fundamental thing I wondered about is the mainstream business applications most people use every day .
While good progress is being made with efforts like OpenOffice , I think that future evolutions of Google Docs and the like have a better change of moving the needle .
I am glad that I got a chance to test drive Fedora and as a result have come to believe in the potential of Linux as a mainstream operating system .
As Ashley said in this post last year , the BBC does a lot of work with open standards already - but in the future we plan to do more .
We want to make iPlayer work on all operating systems including open source ones like Fedora and I am confident we 'll make good progress on this before the end of the year .
And we also encourage communities to play with our stuff for example at events like Mashed where several hundred developers gather in Alexandra Palace to bring the best technologies together with cool content .
Mashed happens this weekend and Matthew Cashmore has more details .

A team led by Wendelin Stark , assistant professor at the Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering of ETH Zurich , said that it has developed a self - disinfecting polymer that is effective against pathogenic bacteria and only becomes active in a targeted manner if bacteria are growing in the vicinity , making it cost effective .
The research group ’s findings , published in the science journal , Small , ​demonstrate that the film is significantly more lethal against the bacterium E coli​ than conventional silicon - based silver preparations .
“ Within 24 hours of the plastic film being applied to a surface , less than one bacterium out of one million bacteria will survive , ” ​ claims Stark .
Wide applications ​
The film will be of interest to food manufacturers as microbial growth can affect food quality and safety and can damage a firms reputation and profits following costly recalls .
Stark told FoodProductionDaily.com that both the food handling and processing industries could benefit from self - sterilizing surfaces .
He said that areas like walls , machine covers and conveyor belts could be covered with the film to inhibit recontamination from product - touching surfaces .
“ We also see particularly interesting applications in terms of the packaging of perishables like meat , fish , pastry and convenience food , ” ​ added Stark .
Stark said that the patent protected active ingredient , which renders surfaces self - sterilizing , can already be obtained through a spin - off company of ETH Zurich called Nanograde GmbH .
He added that the inventors are interested in giving out specific licenses in terms of large - scale applications .
Germ - fighting properties ​
Current methods for rendering surfaces antibacterial are the use of synthetic peptides , the design of surfaces to hinder bacterial adhesion and materials that release antimicrobial agents , such as antibiotics , according to the study .
The researchers said their project was motivated by concerns over increasing antibiotic resistance in humans and the growing demand for alternatives to antibiotic releasing antimicrobial agents .
According to the chemical engineers , silver has traditionally been used as an antiseptic and disinfectant and recent studies have found that impregnating other materials with silver nanoparticles is a practical way to exploit its germ - fighting properties , in particular because of its low toxicity to humans .
Major consumer goods manufacturers already produce goods that utilise the antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles .
Current applications for silver nanoparticle - impregnated materials include household items , clothing ( for example , socks to prevent foot infections for soldiers deployed in jungles ) , and laundry detergents .
Technology ​
Polymer surfaces containing silver on calcium phosphate nanoparticles were tested on a series of bacteria including A. ​niger​ , S. aureus , P. aeruginosa ​and E. coli . ​
Stark explained that the project is informed by the fact that bacteria rely on calcium for their metabolism and as such the calcium phosphate particles are used by the micro-organisms as nutrition .
“ When the bacteria consume the calcium phosphate , thousands of small silver nanometre particles are released .
It is these tiny silver particles that kill the bacteria and prevent germs from growing and spreading , ” ​ said Stark .
The researchers claim that this is the first time that silver has been applied in this targeted and measured way .
Results ​
The team said they conducted experiments with carrier substances calcium phosphate and silicon dioxide , each coated with the silver nanoparticles , and each showed different effects on various bacterial strains in the test .
The calcium phosphate substrate had an efficiency factor of up to 1,000 times stronger than silicon dioxide on E. coli , claims the study , with a five to six log reduction after 24 hours .

[ digg- reddit - me ] Last week , Charles Hawley , writing for Der Spiegel , declared that “ The Social Democrats [ of Germany ] have no Obama . ”
This is the second article in Der Spiegel in the past month to reprise this theme .
Around the world , with David Cameron in the United Kingdom gaining strength and Gordon Brown losing it ; with Silvio Berlusconi taking power again in Italy ; with Nicolas Sarkozy , though struggling today , still the dominant figure in French politics ; with Angela Merkel in Germany , Stephen Harper in Canada , Felipe Calderon in Mexico , Lee Myung - bak in South Korea , and Ma Ying - jeou in Taiwan – all center - right politicians – taking power in the past four years ; and with Russia ’s drift towards a 19th century autocracy and China ’s successful resistance to liberalization , it seems that the world is drifting rightward .
Since September 11 and especially since George W. Bush ’s reelection in 2004 , most of the leading world democracies and many of it ’s leading autocracies have reversed progressive trends and generally adopted a center - right course .
But the worldwide left today has one figure it can look to – standing against this tide in one of the most rightward leaning democracies – and succeeding in ways that are redefining American politics : Barack Obama .
That is why when evaluating the state of Italian politics or German politics – liberals bemoan their lack of success , their lack of inspiration by saying : “ We have no Obama . ”
This seems to be an attitude that Obama himself would reject .
In observing the crowds thronging to his speeches , the enthusiasm that has swept him to the nomination , the excitement in the air , the sense of hope and opportunity at long last , Obama observed to Michael Powell of The New York Times :
“ I love when I ’m shaking hands on a rope line and ” – he mimes the motion , hand over hand – “ I see the little old white ladies and big burly black guys and Latino girls and all their hands are entwining .
They ’re feeding on each other as much as on me … .
It ’s like I ’m just the excuse . ”
[ My emphasis . ]
Although Obama ’s campaign has enabled his success , he understands that the success is not his own .
It is of this particular moment in history – this American moment – and he understands that he is not the cause of this movement or this moment , but merely the excuse .
Obama himself is just an excuse to allow Americans to find themselves again , to find their way again , to reclaim their nation , to restore our values to our government .
What Obama ’s campaign offers and his presidency will offer is not solutions imposed from Washington , but an opportunity for us to engage with our government , to affect our politics , to make America once again a government of the people .
Obama is proposing modest steps – as the tinkerer he is – to make the deliberations behind health care public ; to create a website that encourages citizens to provide suggestions and feedback about government programs ; to encourage transparency in law - making ; to create “ a web site , a search engine , and other web tools that enable citizens easily to track online federal grants , contracts , earmarks , and lobbyist contacts with government officials ” ; to require “ his appointees who lead Executive Branch departments and rulemaking agencies to conduct the significant business of the agency in public ” and online ; and to make as much government data as universally available as possible .
He ’s providing a good excuse , but we still need to do the work .

BERLIN , July 19 ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki told a German magazine he supported prospective U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's proposal that U.S. troops should leave Iraq within 16 months .
In an interview with Der Spiegel released on Saturday , Maliki said he wanted U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraq as soon as possible .
" U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months .
That , we think , would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes . "
It is the first time he has backed the withdrawal timetable put forward by Obama , who is visiting Afghanistan and us set to go to Iraq as part of a tour of Europe and the Middle East .
Obama has called for a shift away from a " single - minded " focus on Iraq and wants to pull out troops within 16 months , instead adding U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan .
Asked if he supported Obama 's ideas more than those of John McCain , Republican presidential hopeful , Maliki said he did not want to recommend who people should vote for .
" Whoever is thinking about the shorter term is closer to reality .
Artificially extending the stay of U.S. troops would cause problems . "
Maliki , who is due to visit Germany this week , has suggested a timetable should be set for a U.S. withdrawal but U.S. officials have been more cautious , despite an improving security situation .
The White House said on Friday President George W. Bush and Maliki had agreed that a security deal under negotiation should set a " time horizon " for meeting " aspirational goals " for reducing U.S. forces in Iraq .
" The Americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them .
But it is n't , " Maliki told Der Spiegel .
Some five years after the U.S. - led invasion , there are still some 146,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq .

This post is part of the Beautiful Code series .
I saw two really wonderful examples of computer - generated code in Beautiful Code .
First was a chapter by Charles Petzold — yes , that Charles Petzold — who was discussing image processing .
Petzold ’s example is fairly complex , so I ’ll try to give a simpler example , to illustrate the general concept .
Suppose you have an array of integers , and for each integer , you want to add 1 to the number if it ’s less than 10 .
A ridiculously contrived example , but it is simple enough to explain the concept .
Now suppose your array includes 5 items , with the following values :
{ 1,16,72,2,4}
function someRidiculousFunction ( ) {
int anArray [ 10 ] = { 1,16,72,2,4} ;
anArray [ 0 ] ++;
anArray [ 3 ] ++;
anArray [ 4 ] ++;
}
function moreRealisticFunction ( ) {
int anArray [ ] = generateArray ( ) ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < anArray.length ; i++ ) {
if( anArray [i ] < 10 )
anArray [ i ]++;
}
}
if
someRidiculousFunction ( )

Using the C preprocessor limits you to the syntax available ; it ’s its own little language .
However , with awk , or similar languages , you have the power of regular expressions at your fingertips , and can do some very complex text manipulation , if necessary .
The C preprocessor is available to you if you ’re writing code in C , or C++ , and there are some similar things being added to later versions of Java for performing certain tasks , but using something like awk would work for any programming language you choose .
The handling of locking assertions deserves more explanation .
For each argument , the code lists the state of its lock for three instances : when the function is entered , when the function exits successfully , and when the function exits with an error — an elegantly clear separation of concerns . ….
The following code excerpt indicates that the rename call arguments fdvp and fvp are always unlocked , but the argument tdvp has a process - exclusive lock when the routine is called .
All arguments should be unlocked when the function terminates . #
# % rename fdvp U U U
# % rename fvp U U U
# % rename tdvp E U U
#
The locking specification is used to instrument the C code with assertions at the function ’s entry , the function ’s normal exit , and the function ’s error exit .
For example , the code at the entry point of the rename function contains the following assertions : ASSERT_VOP_UNLOCKED(a-> a_fdvp , " VOP_RENAME " ) ;
ASSERT_VOP_UNLOCKED(a-> a_fvp , " VOP_RENAME " ) ;
ASSERT_VOP_ELOCKED(a-> a_tdvp , " VOP_RENAME " ) ;
#
#
# % rename fdvp U U U
# % rename fvp U U U
# % rename tdvp E U U
#
//#
//# % rename fdvp U U U
//# % rename fvp U U U
//# % rename tdvp E U U
//#
//#
#
If you knew that ahead of time , then you could write code like this :
We know that the first , fourth , and fifth elements in the array are less than 10 , so they need to be incremented .
In real life , however , chances are our code would n’t know which elements are less than 10 , and which are n’t .
The code might not even know how many elements are in the array .
So the code is more likely to look more like this :
We need a loop , to cycle through the elements of the array , and we need anstatement , to determine if each element in the array is less than 10 , before incrementing it .
The first code sample just is n’t realistic ; there are very few instances in real life when you ’d be able to write code like that .
Not only that , but for an array of any size , the second function will be much more readable and maintainable by future programmers .
Having a function with a hundred lines after each other , like in the first example ( if the array were bigger ) would numb the mind .
But the thing is , would be more efficient than thewould !
If only we did know ahead of time , when we were writing the program , how many elements there would be in the array , and which ( if any ) needed to be incremented , then we would n’t need the loop , or thestatements .
Petzold presents a much more complex situation , having to do with processing images .
Because an image ( such as a JPG or GIF file ) will potentially have millions of bytes , representing many , many pixels , processing each pixel to do things like adding blur effects can be a time consuming process .
Anything that can be done to streamline the process would present an amazing time savings to the program — but the issue is that you need all of thosestatements and loops , to go through the image .
His solution is to use .
NET ’s ability to generate code on the fly .
When you ’re writing your program for manipulating images , you ca n’t necessarily write code like you could for , but you can have your program generate code that works that way , in which case you can avoid the tediousstatements and looping , and just generate mountains and mountains of procedural code .
Since it is being generated at runtime , there is no worry about maintaining the code afterward , so you do n’t need to worry about how pretty or understandable ( or beautiful ) that code is ; you only need to worry about maintaining the code that generates that code .
( Too meta for you ?
Read through it again .
Or , better yet , buy the book , and read Petzold ’s chapter . )
That ’s at runtime , but what about at compile time ?
Most programmers are familiar with the C preprocessor , and the ability to create macros that will expand within the code at compile time , but most programmers are also aware of the limitations of the C preprocessor ’s abilities .
But that does n’t mean that generating code at ( or near ) compile time is a .
In a chapter by Diomidis Spinellis I came across a novel idea : use awk ( or a similar text processing language ) as your code preprocessor !
( Note : Spinellis kept italicizing “ awk , ” so I am too .
I do n’t know if it really has to be italicized . )
Suppose you have highly repetitive pieces of code , repeating throughout your program .
Instead of typing it out over and over again , you can include a simple notation instead , which can be processed by a language like awk , and expanded into real code , which would then be compiled .
That is : write your source code , potentially involving a special notation ; save your source code files ; run those files through a program written in awk , which would process the special notations within your source code and generate more source code ; save the new code into a new file ; run the new file through the compiler , to create the program .
Doing this in awk instead of the C preprocessor has two advantages that I can think of :
Let ’s look at an example from Spinellis .
Now , the code starting withcharacters is n’t actually C code .
In fact , the C compiler would throw errors at those lines .
But that does n’t matter because awk is going to replace those lines with real C code , which the compiler will like .
In fact , for each line of #- prefixed code above , 3 lines of code would be inserted into the code — tedious , error - prone code , which has nothing to do with the actual logic the programmer was trying to accomplish .
According to Spinellis , “ In the FreeBSD version 6.1 implementation of the vnode call interface , all in all , 588 lines of domain - specific code expand into 4,339 lines of C code and declarations .
” If your code has a lot of repetitious , error - prone code in it , and if you have the ability to insert awk or a similar tool into your compilation process , this technique can save you not only time , but debugging effort , too .
Then again , with modern IDEs — especially ones that compile your code as you work , but even ones that just warn you about syntax errors — you ’ll also need to contend with code that your IDE keeps warning you about .
One solution might be to include your special notations in comments , that the IDE will ignore , and have awk process that .
For example , instead ofyou might do something like this , instead :
You just need to alter the regex ’s in your awk script to useinstead ofwhen looking for lines to process .

Total solar eclipses take place when the Earth , Moon and Sun are aligned and the shadow of the Moon touches the surface of the Earth .
At mid-eclipse , observers within the lunar shadow briefly see totality , where the silhouette of the Moon completely covers the Sun , revealing the beautiful outer solar atmosphere or corona .
On August 1st , 2008 there will be a total eclipse visible from Canada , northern Greenland , Svalbard , the Barents Sea , Russia , Mongolia and China .
People in the British Isles will see a partial solar eclipse , with between 1/10th and 1/3rd of the Sun obscured by the Moon .
Top : view of the Sun from Baja California during an eclipse on July 11 , 1991 .
Bottom : a view toward Earth from the perspective of space , taken by astronauts on the Mir Space Station during a total solar eclipse over Eastern Europe on August 11 , 1999 .
Credit : NASA
At its broadest , in this eclipse the lunar shadow is only 237 km ( 148 miles ) wide but the shadow describes a path thousands of km long , traced out as the Earth rotates .
It begins in northeastern Canada , where observers will see the eclipse at sunrise , and then crosses northern Greenland , the Arctic , Barents Sea , Russia and Mongolia before ending in China where the eclipse is visible at sunset .
On the ground the maximum duration of totality is 2 minutes 27 seconds but observers away from the centre of the track and at either end will see a significantly shorter event .
Away from the path of the total eclipse the Sun is only partly obscured by the Moon .
This partial eclipse is visible across a large part of the northern hemisphere , including much of Europe and the whole of the UK , where it will take place in the morning .
How to view the eclipse
If you 're not near an observatory that can let you safely view it , here are instructions on how to get a look without having the cornea seared out of your eye .
In case it is unclear DO NOT EVER DIRECTLY VIEW THE SUN , EVEN ECLIPSED , WITH THE NAKED EYE .
That goes double for binoculars and telescopes .
If you want to make your own , know that safe solar filters should transmit less than 0.003 % ( density ~ 4.5 ) [ 1 ] of visible light ( 380 to 780 nm ) and no more than 0.5 % ( density ~ 2.3 ) of the near - infrared radiation ( 780 to 1400 nm ) .
Welder 's glasses and other filters
Generally , the Sun can only be viewed directly with special filters , usually having a thin layer of chromium alloy or aluminum deposited on their surfaces
One of the most common filters for safe viewing is shade number 14 welder 's glass .
An inexpensive alternative is aluminized mylar manufactured specifically for solar observation - do n't use those " Space blankets " you bought at Kennedy Space Center or something from your garden .
The ultimate geek alternatives
The most esoteric solar observers will use two layers of black - and - white film that was fully exposed to light and then developed to maximum density .
The metallic silver contained in the film emulsion is the protective filter .
Newer black and white films that use dyes instead of silver are not safe , nor are negatives with images on it .
Less photographically inclined geeks can also use CDs as protective filters by covering the central openings and looking through the disk media , though the quality will be poor .
Beware : some CDs are made with thin aluminum coatings which are not safe so if you can see through the CD in normal room lighting , do n't use it .
The cheapest way - a cardboard pinhole projector
When making a pinhole projector , the best way is with a long box and a piece of white paper and some aluminum foil .
The longer the box , the bigger the image , so if you can get one 6 feet , that is perfect .
To get an idea of what you will see , multiple the length ( in inches ) by 0.00873 and that will tell you the size of the image .
So at 6 feet you will see an image 0.63 inches in diameter .
You can also tape two boxes together .
Steps :
1 ) Cut a hole in one end of the box .
2 ) Tape your aluminum foil over that hole .
3 ) Poke a small hole in the aluminum foil with a pin .
4 ) Cut a square hole in the box near the opposite end of the box .
5 ) Put the white paper at the end of the box opposite the aluminum foil , so you can see it with the hole you cut .
6 ) At eclipse time , point the aluminum foil end of the box toward the sun .
Adjust the box so the sides form no shadows on the paper .
The image you see on the paper will be the eclipse .
Too poor for a box ?
Assuming you can scrape up a piece of white paper , lay it on the ground .
Holding up both of your hands with the fingers overlapping at right angles causes the holes between your fingers to make the pinholes you need .
Happy viewing !
P.S. If you skipped to the end , do n't look directly at the sun .

Climate change is coming fast and furious to the Tibetan plateau .
Jane Qiu reports on the changes atop the roof of the world .
M. EVERTON / CORBIS
The Tibetan plateau gets a lot less attention than the Arctic or Antarctic , but after them it is Earth 's largest store of ice .
And the store is melting fast .
In the past half - century , 82 % of the plateau 's glaciers have retreated .
In the past decade , 10 % of its permafrost has degraded .
As the changes continue , or even accelerate , their effects will resonate far beyond the isolated plateau , changing the water supply for billions of people and altering the atmospheric circulation over half the planet .
The plateau 's pivotal role is due almost entirely to its height .
Being an average of 4 kilometres above sea level makes it peculiarly cold for its latitude — colder than anywhere else outside the polar regions .
Lhasa , capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region , is by Tibetan standards relatively low - lying , at 3,650 metres — yet it is higher even than La Paz , Bolivia , the highest capital city of a country .
Lhasa 's year - round average temperature is 8 °C ; at the same latitude Houston , Texas , has an average temperature of 21°C .
The altitude makes Tibet cold , especially in winter ; its snow and ice cover , by reflecting sunlight , make it colder still .
The very bulk of the plateau affects how winds circulate above it , and its altitude also places the surface simply closer to the stratosphere than is normal .
The proximate cause of the changes now being felt on the plateau is a rise in temperature of up to 0.3 °C a decade that has been going on for fifty years — approximately three times the global warming rate .
The questions are how much more change to expect in the future , and how severe the effects will be on the planet 's climate as a whole .
“ Our understanding of global climate change would be incomplete without taking into consideration what 's happening to the Tibetan plateau , ” says Veerabhadran Ramanathan , an atmospheric scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California .
Perhaps surprisingly given its significance , the potential impact of the Tibetan plateau is still unfamiliar to many climatologists .
One reason is that there are far fewer data available compared with the Arctic and Antarctic , which have seen a far greater number of scientific expeditions to plumb their secrets .
Although fieldwork there can be tough , the plateau offers the same physical isolation coupled with political challenges , at least for Western researchers .
“ The plateau 's remoteness , high altitude and harsh weather conditions make any research on the region very challenging , ” says Yao Tandong , director of the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research , headquartered in Beijing , of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
Ice cores being carried down to base camp .
Yao and his colleagues should know : in the 1980s , they were among the few researchers persevering in difficult field conditions to gather data on the plateau 's past climate history .
They drilled ice cores , up to 300 metres long , from Himalayan glaciers 7,200 metres high .
“ It 's all done manually , and we had to carry them down the mountain .
There were no helicopters , no heavy equipment , ” he says .
“ It 's - 30 °C , with the wind cutting through us like a knife .
It 's no mean feat . ”
Such ordeals seem to have paid off : in collaboration with glaciologist Lonnie Thompson of Ohio State University in Columbus , the team 's work on oxygen isotopes within the cores yielded the most comprehensive temperature reconstruction for the plateau , showing a large - scale warming trend that began in the twentieth century and is amplified at higher elevations1 .
Their findings are consistent with temperature records from meteorological stations that have made continuous measurements since the 1950s [ ref. 2 ] .
Some of this is what you would expect in a world undergoing greenhouse warming , but there are regional factors on the plateau that exacerbate the effect .
In summer , dust from regional deserts blows towards and up against the northern and southern slopes of the plateau .
One recent satellite study , for instance , tracked dust wafting in from the Taklamakan desert to the north3 .
“ We were really surprised to find this much dust over the plateau , ” says Huang Jianping , an atmospheric scientist at Lanzhou University and lead author of the study .
The dust layers can reach as high as 10 kilometres above sea level , where they both absorb and reflect sunlight , changing the amount of radiation that reaches the plateau .
Combining with the dust to drive climate change are emissions of ' black carbon ' , the soot that results when people cook with biofuels such as wood , crop waste or dung .
Southeast Asia , including the Himalayas , is one of the global hotspots for black - carbon emissions4 .
Using unmanned aircraft , Ramanathan and colleagues measured the amount of sunlight absorbed by black carbon , and found that it contributes as much as 50 % of the solar heating of the air5 .
“ It 's the second - largest contributor to atmospheric warming in the region , after carbon dioxide , ” he says .
He estimates that the combined effect of black carbon and greenhouse gases may be sufficient to account for a warming trend of 0.25 °C per decade in the Himalayas , roughly what has been observed so far .
Plumes from dust storms in the Taklamakan desert , such as this one in June 2005 , can reach the Tibetan plateau and affect the climate there .
NASA / MODIS RAPID RESPONSE TEAM
When black carbon settles on Himalayan glaciers , it darkens the snow and ice so that they absorb more heat and become warmer .
“ The melting seasons on the plateau now begin earlier and last longer , ” says Xu Baiqing of the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research .
Glaciers at the edge of the plateau tend to melt more than those in the middle ; one study , for instance , showed that glaciers in the eastern part of the Kunlun Mountains retreated by 17 % over the past 30 years , which is ten times faster than those in the central plateau .
If current trends hold , two - thirds of the plateau glaciers could be gone by 2050 , says Yao .
Floods and droughts
The melting glaciers are starting to leave behind dangerous glacial lakes , in which meltwater ponds behind a dam of debris left by the retreating ice tongue .
Scientists have identified 34 such glacial lakes on the northern slopes of the Himalayas , and 20 outburst floods have been recorded in the past 50 years .
The risk of floods , though , is but a short - term danger far exceeded by long - term issues with water supplies atop the plateau .
Runoff from the region 's mountains feeds the largest rivers across Southeast Asia , including the Yangtze , Yellow , Mekong , Ganges and Indus rivers .
If glaciers continue to retreat and snowpack shrinks atop the plateau , the water supplies of billions of people will be in danger6 .
“ A large - scale thaw of permafrost would result in the loss of its water content and trigger an ecological catastrophe . ”
Ouyang Hua
Permafrost is also at risk , as rising temperatures cause the ' active ' ground layer — which freezes and thaws every year — to thicken .
That , in turn , affects how heat and moisture flow between the ground and the atmosphere , further perturbing the system7 .
Degradation of permafrost will not only put the Qinghai–Tibet Railway at risk8 , but also endangers the plateau 's alpine ecosystems , which rely on permafrost to trap water in the topmost layers of soil to allow plants to thrive at an altitude that would otherwise be too hostile for them .
“ A large - scale thaw of permafrost would result in the loss of its water content and trigger an ecological catastrophe , ” says Ouyang Hua , deputy director of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research in Beijing .
As permafrost stores one - third of the world 's soil carbon , vegetation loss would lead to a huge amount of carbon entering the atmosphere , exacerbating global warming .
Competing forces
With all the changes the Tibetan plateau is undergoing — a warming climate , retreating glaciers , degrading permafrost and alpine ecosystems — what are the implications for the regional and global climate ?
The first and most important victim could be the Indian monsoon .
This strong seasonal wind results from differences in the thermal properties between land and ocean .
In summer , the vast land in Asia heats up more than the Indian Ocean , leading to a pressure gradient and the flow of the air and moisture from the ocean .
The rise of the Tibetan plateau starting 50 million years ago ( see ' Lifting the roof of the world ' ) is thought to have strengthened this effect .
As the land surface absorbs more sunlight than the atmosphere , the plateau creates a vast area of surface warmer than the air at that elevation , thereby increasing the land–ocean pressure gradient and intensifying the monsoon .
Some climate models show that global warming would lead to a greater increase in the plateau 's surface temperature than over the ocean , thus augmenting the monsoon .
On the other hand , some models suggest that aerosols that absorb solar radiation , and changes in land use in the region , could weaken the monsoon .
“ The intensity of the monsoon is likely to depend on which of these two competing forces dominates , ” says Ramanathan .
No matter what the causes are , some studies indicate that the weakening force may be prevailing , or has prevailed for at least the past three centuries .
Duan Keqin , of the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute in Lanzhou , and his colleagues reconstructed a 300 - year history of snow accumulation by analysing ice cores from the Dasuopu glacier9 .
They believe the ice there preserves an estimate of monsoon variations in the Himalayas .
“ We found that the warmer it was , the weaker the monsoon , ” says Duan .
On average , a temperature increase of 0.1 °C was associated with a decrease of 100 millimetres in snow accumulation .
But similar studies on other parts of the plateau are needed to confirm the results , he notes .
“ Changes in the Indian monsoon are not the only threat in Asia to the global climate , ” adds Rong Fu of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta .
Her research shows that convection over the Tibetan plateau can transport water vapour and pollutants to the stratosphere10 , the atmospheric layer that is immediately above the troposphere and contains most of the Earth 's ozone .
“ The strong , horizontal wind in the stratosphere could then spread the water vapour and pollutants globally , ” says Fu .
Yao Tandong working on a glacier .
Water vapour has a stronger greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide per molecule , but it normally reaches no higher than 1 – 2 kilometres below the stratosphere .
The situation is different over the plateau , over which the convection layer is shifted some 6 kilometres further up so that its top boundary is around 18 kilometres up , in the lower stratosphere .
In addition , the troposphere is thinner over the plateau , and the heat emitted by the surface can reach higher and make the air warmer at the base of the stratosphere .
“ So more water vapour is able to get to the stratosphere without being frozen or precipitated , ” says Fu. Warmer temperatures over the plateau can resulting increased glacial melting and water - vapour transport — which , in turn , causes strong convection and lifts even more water vapour up .
“ It 's very worrying to think that a lot of it may reach the stratosphere , ” she says .
“ Worrying ” , indeed , best captures the mood of researchers who work on the Tibetan plateau .
They are keen to undertake large - scale , comprehensive studies and to collect as many data as possible .
“ We know so little about it and understand it even less , ” says Yao .
One ongoing study is to document all the glaciers in China , recording characteristics such as their location , area , length , thickness and the position of the snow line .
A similar survey was conducted between 1978 and 2002 , which scientists believe could serve as a reference point to reveal any major changes .
In addition , glaciologists continue to identify and closely monitor potentially dangerous glacial lakes in hopes of heading off any potential outburst floods .
Quick way out
“ Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and black carbon should be the top priority . ”
Xu Baiqing
Meanwhile , others focus on the bigger picture of how to tackle pollution problems in Asia .
“ Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and black carbon should be the top priority , ” says Xu. Ramanathan reckons that cutting down on black - carbon emissions could be a “ quick way out of the mess ” , given that its half - life in the atmosphere is about 15 – 20 days compared with the century - scale half - life of carbon dioxide .
His simulations suggest that , just by removing traditional ways of cooking with wood , dung and crop residues , some 40 – 60 % of the black - carbon emissions would be gone .
This could be “ a short - term fix , a low - hanging fruit that is much cheaper and faster ” than reducing carbon dioxide , he says .
“ The key is to give villagers access to better forms of energy . ”
In the end , the Tibetan plateau may be a crucial testing ground for how humans and the environment collide in a globally warmed world .
Can the world 's third pole be saved ?
“ Let 's hope that the changes the plateau is going through are only transient , ” says Yao .
“ What we do about them probably will determine what 's going to happen to it in the future . ”

When was the last time that you read your health insurance policy , and I mean , really sat down and read it cover to cover ?
I happened to read the changes section to our policy and found they had added some new benefits this year .
I found that our insurance company will reimburse us for many of the activities that we currently participate in .
In addition , I found some others that we can do for free or very little because our policy will pay for all or almost all of the cost .
Here ’s a summary of the new benefits and some of the old ones that are worth taking advantage of .
Health Insurance Benefits to Save You Money
Healthy food .
Some of the plans now reimburse for the cost of buying fruit and vegetables through CSAs .
Wow !
What better than to get money back on groceries ?
Recreational activities .
We get reimbursed for community involvement for each person in the family .
We got $ 100 back on my son ’s swimming lessons .
In addition , it will cover any activities that get you moving … softball leagues , family sports teams , and run / walks come to mind .
Frequent teeth cleaning .
Our plan now covers four dental cleanings a year instead of two .
I love having my teeth cleaned , so I ’m now going every three months .
Weight loss and smoking cessation programs .
These have been around for awhile , but they are important for your health .
And if you are taking part anyways , why not have your insurance policy pick up the cost ?
Fitness programs .
Our HMO is now offering fitness classes at our clinic and hospital .
The classes are convenient and inexpensive .
I plan to look into the fall list and try some out if it fits into my new schedule .
Educational programs .
In addition to the fitness programs , they are offering a range of educational classes focused on many topics including healthy living , parenting , and support groups .
Unusual claim submission process .
Our policy will actually consider covering a procedure or treatment that is not normally covered , if it will save the insurance company money in the long run .
You must have a doctor submit the claim , but it proved worthwhile the one time we used it .
Some might argue that using the plan more frequently , for example going to the dentist four times a year instead of two will raise premiums , however , I would argue that preventative measures are far cheaper in the the long run .
Even though these are specific to my health insurance company , the current trend for health insurers is to find ways to keep down the continual increase of premiums .
One way they are handling it is to encourage healthy living and preventative care .
Check with your insurer to see what they are doing and you might find some savings in the small print .
Why is it Sneaky ?
Many of these seem like routine programs .
However , you ’ll often find that the insurance companies are not advertising them .
Some of our programs were added years ago , but we never found out about it .
You have to read your policy to find them !
What programs has your health insurance company added recently ?

Scientists are liars .
Here are seven robots that reached for " life - like , " and came up with a big handful of your worst nightmares .
Scientists say they can now build near - perfect replications of a human being , and that they finally have the technology to bring the inanimate to life .
7 Geminoid
The Geminoid was built by Professor Hiroshi Ishiguro of Osaka University .
He 's used a mold of his own body for the overall shape of the robot , programmed his body language and voice into it , and even implanted his own hair into the android 's skull .

Prof .
Ishiguro , in summary , would very much like to be killed and replaced by a robot , stopping just short of sending out beautiful , handwritten invitations to the T - 1000 , requesting its presence at his upcoming All - Night Knife and Choking Party .
The professor often speaks through the robot , rather than personally attending company board meetings .
So , perhaps this is a good time to stop bitching about your boss .
At least he 's not forcing you to pitch your latest project to a dead - eyed robot clone of himself .
Why It's So , So Creepy
On top of the simple implication that we can all be replaced by robots , the Geminoid is mostly creepy because it 's not quite an exact replica of Ishiguro .
It 's more like Ishiguro built a slightly retarded younger brother for himself , giving it a permanent expression of intense confusion and frustration .

It 's like the Geminoid is always trying to figure out just what the fuck it 's doing here , much like you probably are right now .
It also reacts a little too convincingly when they start repeatedly poking it directly in the face , hard .
It seems to grow annoyed -- almost enraged -- but then they stop just short of provoking a killing spree , and it goes right back to puzzling out what the hell all that was about .
This suggests a level of reasoning and consciousness that is intensely disturbing .
You probably do n't want that robot figuring out that there are two things in this room that can pass for Professor Ishiguro , and only one of them does n't have to sit in a folding chair getting poked in the face by research assistants for the next 20 years .
It is important to anybody who is gluten intolerant that they can still enjoy a variety of healthy and tasty recipes and this is no different when it comes to pizza !
This wheat free recipe will make a delicious and safe pizza recipe that can be enjoyed wholeheartedly .
Ingredients
The Pizza Crust
1 tablespoon of dry yeast
2/3rds cup brown rice flour or sorghum flour
1/2 cup of tapioca flour
2 level teaspoons of xanthan gum
1/2 level teaspoon salt
1 level teaspoon of unflavoured gelatine powder
1 level teaspoon Italian herb seasoning
2/3rds cup of warm milk or non-dairy liquid
1/2 level teaspoon of sugar
1 teaspoon of olive oil
1 teaspoon of cider vinegar
Extra rice flour for sprinkling onto the crust
The Pizza Sauce
1 can ( 8 oz. ) tomato sauce
1/2 level teaspoon of dried oregano leaves
1/2 level teaspoon of dried basil leaves
1/2 level teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary
1/2 level teaspoon of fennel seeds
1/4 level teaspoon of garlic powder
2 level teaspoons of sugar
1/2 level teaspoon of salt
Toppings of your choice to suit your taste and mood !
Instructions
For the Sauce : Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat .
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes , while Pizza Crust is being assembled .
This will make about 1 cup .
For The Crust : Prepare your oven .
If you still do n’t own a proper pizza oven , you can see some options clicking here .
In medium mixer bowl using regular beaters ( not dough hooks ) , blend the yeast , flours , xanthan gum , salt , gelatine powder , and Italian seasoning on a low speed .
Add warm milk , sugar , oil , and vinegar .
Beat on high speed for 2 minutes .
( If the mixer bounces around the bowl , the dough is too stiff .
Add water if necessary , one tablespoon at a time , until dough does not resist beaters . )
The dough will resemble soft bread dough .
Put mixture on a greased 12 - inch pizza pan .
Liberally sprinkle rice flour onto dough , and then press dough into pan , continuing to sprinkle dough with flour to prevent sticking to your hands .
Make edges thicker to hold the toppings .
Bake pizza crust for 10 minutes .
Remove from oven .
Top the Pizza Crust with sauce and your preferred toppings .
Bake for another 20 - 25 minutes or until top is nicely browned .

They had one sweet job .
Maureen Zuccarini , Donna Magliaro and Stefanie Bonfiglio sampled flavors and sweeteners that go into products like Trident gum , Swedish fish and Certs breath mints , making $ 10 an hour by working their taste buds .
In mid-March , while they were still in training , their class sampled an experimental high - intensity sweetener that Cadbury hoped would be the next big thing in flavor .
Instead , it left them with oral lesions and chemical burns that they say are affecting their ability to taste normally and eat certain foods without a burning sensation .
Cadbury 's handling of the situation and refusal to tell them what they were given has left them with such a bitter taste that the three are suing the confectionery giant over their injuries .
" I know they did something bad to us , " said Magliaro , of Denville .
" I want to know what they gave me . "
Montville attorney Robyne LaGrotta filed three lawsuits in Superior Court in Morristown against Cadbury and Spherion Atlantic Enterprises LLC , a staffing company that hired the three Morris County women to work at Cadbury 's research facility in East Hanover .
The lawsuits became public today .
Cadbury spokeswoman Katharine Beyer said the United Kingdom company , which has its U.S. headquarters in Parsippany , would not comment on pending litigation .
" We were so happy to get the job , " Zuccarini said .
More than 1,000 people had answered a newspaper ad to become taste - testers for a major confectionery company and only 12 were chosen , Zuccarini and Magliaro said in a telephone interview .
When they found out the company was Cadbury , that was icing on the cake , Zuccarini said .
" I love the Swedish fish they make , " Magliaro said .
She said she felt honored to work for a company whose products are so well known .
The day they sampled the sweetener , they say Cadbury employee Maura Titone told them it was safe but not yet approved for use in the United States , according to the lawsuits .
When Magliaro asked if previous testers had experienced reactions , Titone told her they'd had only minor ones and not to worry , her lawsuit said .
Titone could not be reached for comment today .
Zuccarini , a Parsippany resident , was the first affected by the compound , LaGrotta said .
On the second day of chewing a gum that contained it , she developed eight pustules on her tongue and had a reaction under her tongue and along her right lower cheek , the lawsuit said .
Magliaro said her initial reaction was n't as severe as Zuccarini's , but that she later was assigned to taste an intense spearmint .
" My tongue was on fire , " she said .
Magliaro said Cadbury had her tasting again before a dentist that the company sent them to for their injuries had cleared them to resume work .
Magliaro said she was fired at the end of April when she started asking questions of her more experienced colleagues at a staff meeting about whether they had ever been asked to sign documents and take experimental compounds .
Magliaro and Zuccarini believe the company gave the sweetener to the trainees because they did n't know procedure .
They claim they were not given copies of forms they signed .
Zuccarini and Bonfiglio quit a week after Magliaro left .
The three women had met on the job , they said .
" It 's as if they were n't taking us seriously , " Zuccarini said .
She said she has a chronic metallic taste in her mouth and her tongue burns if she drinks carbonated beverages or tastes mint .
" I do n't know when it 's going to stop . "
Ezra Zygmuntowicz , founder of EngineYard and Merb developer , presented his latest project — Vertebra — at RailsConf 2008 .
The presentation slides are available on Ezra 's blog .
We talked to Ezra to learn what Vertebra is and what his plans for it are .
Vertebra is a fairly large scope project .
It is best described as a next generation Cloud Computing Platform .
Built with Erlang / Ruby and centered around Ejabberd and XMPP .
Vertebra can be used for automating the cloud as well as for distributed real time application development .
The whole idea of Vertebra is to democratize the cloud , abstracting the cloud interface API 's and allowing folks to utilize multiple cloud providers based on a number of cost / benefit factors .
It also has large potential for enterprise integration projects .
If you have some old legacy service that needs to join a modern architecture , you can write a simple agent to get your legacy service on the Vertebra message bus where it can be addressed by anything else on the message bus in a standard way .
Vertebra itself is the ' backbone ' of a new platform .
We are using it to automate many many servers , but it also has big implications for application developers working on the real time web .
It is basically an integration system , any language with an XMPP library that implements our protocol can join the XMPP cloud and become part f a larger organism of machines and services .
So Vertebra will come with tools for automating deployment of applications and virtual servers in the cloud .
But will also be useful as a backend messaging and distributed computing system that runs behind web apps , giving them powerful tools for running compute heavy jobs in parallel ala map / reduce .
It will also allow for dispatching based on least loaded nodes .
Say you get a request to your web app that includes some image processing and you have a farm of 20 backends that can process images .
When you get the request to your web app , you make a call to vertebra asking for the least loaded node that can service this particular request , vertebra returns a list of least loaded nodes and allows you to dispatch based on this or many other factors .
We were also interested in the Ruby–Erlang combination and wanted to know how they work together .
[..] significant portions of the system are written in Erlang , Engine Yard recently hired two kick ass Erlang programmers to work on the system .
The security / discovery mechanism , the state machine workflow system and the distributed key - value storage system are all written in Erlang .
The agent framework for writing agents is all ruby though and the actual functionality of the agents is ruby .
But Vertebra is about integration of disparate systems so any language can become part of the XMPP cloud by simply implementing our protocol .
So when is all this technology going to be released , and under what license ?
I 'm happy to say that I got approval to release all of Vertebra as open source with a GPL license .
We will offer paid support for Vertebra as well as hosted Jabber / Erlang infrastructure as a service .
I cannot say a definitive release date as it is still in flux .
We have to finalize some aspects of our protocol and write up the XEP jabber standard document in order to get our protocol recognized as an official XEP .
Of course we want to get this out there as soon as possible because I think Vertebra has far reaching ideas and I 'm excited to see what other folks do with it .
We should be able to open it up this summer once we have locked down the protocol and written decent documentation .
I think web 3.0 is going to be about the real time web .
XMPP is going to play a major role in this movement , Vertebra will be a great platform to build and integrate many disparate services .
Rasmussen Reports
July 8 , 2008
The percentage of voters who give Congress good or excellent ratings has fallen to single digits for the first time in Rasmussen Reports tracking history .
This month , just 9 % say Congress is doing a good or excellent job .
Most voters ( 52 % ) say Congress is doing a poor job , which ties the record high in that dubious category .
Last month , 11 % of voters gave the legislature good or excellent ratings .
Congress has not received higher than a 15 % approval rating since the beginning of 2008 .
The percentage of Democrats who give Congress positive ratings fell from 17 % last month to 13 % this month .
The number of Democrats who give Congress a poor rating remained unchanged .
Among Republicans , 8 % give Congress good or excellent ratings , up just a point from last month .
Sixty - five percent ( 65 % ) of GOP voters say Congress is doing a poor job , down a single point from last month .
Voters not affiliated with either party are the most critical of Congressional performance .
Just 3 % of those voters give Congress positive ratings , down from 6 % last month .
Sixty - three percent ( 63 % ) believe Congress is doing a poor job , up from 57 % last month .
Just 12 % of voters think Congress has passed any legislation to improve life in this country over the past six months .
That number has ranged from 11 % to 13 % throughout 2008 .
The majority of voters ( 62 % ) say Congress has not passed any legislation to improve life in America .
Voters hold little positive sentiment about the future .
Just 41 % find it at least somewhat likely that Congress will address important problems facing our nation in the near future , while 55 % find this unlikely .
Despite these negative attitudes towards Congress , Democrats continue to enjoy a double digit lead on the Generic Congressional Ballot .
Most voters ( 72 % ) think most members of Congress are more interested in furthering their own political careers .
Just 14 % believe members are genuinely interested in helping people .
A separate Rasmussen survey found that half of all voters believe America ’s best days are in the past .
However , another survey found that 64 % of voters also believe that the world would be a better place if more countries were similar to the United States .

Insight from Oak Ridge National Laboratory , commitment from two Michigan companies and funding from the Department of Energy have led to the commercialization of a lightweight urban transit bus with double the fuel efficiency of conventional hybrid buses .
This new green technology 40 - foot bus features a high - strength stainless steel body and chassis and a hybrid power system that drives the bus primarily with stored electrical energy .
This approach reverses the paradigm of conventional parallel hybrid designs that use electric energy only to supplement the acceleration and torque requirements of a diesel engine .
At the heart of the bus is a chassis made of Nitronic 30 , a nitrogen - strengthened stainless steel that is stronger and stiffer than conventional steel .
These attributes translate into less material required for a chassis , resulting in reduced weight .
" Nitronic stainless steel is incredibly durable and enables our chassis designs to have significantly longer service life vs. ordinary steel vehicles , " said Bruce Emmons , president of Autokinetics ( http://www.autokinetics.com/) of Rochester , Mich. , which developed the bus .
" The fact that stainless is also 100 percent recyclable and more environmentally friendly to produce than aluminum makes this an ideal green raw material for vehicle structures . "
Additional advantages of Nitronic 30 include excellent mechanical properties at sub-zero and elevated temperatures along with low - temperature impact resistance and superb resistance to high - temperature oxidation .
While this material is more costly than conventional steel , Emmons noted that the additional cost is offset by design innovation , parts consolidation and streamlined manufacturing processes .
" The benefits of improved strength - to - weight performance quickly compound to all other vehicles systems such as smaller tires , lighter brakes , batteries , motors and so on , " Emmons said .
" By optimizing the total vehicle we have been able to cut the weight almost in half , which has led to performance improvements , most notably fuel economy gains . "
In addition to its reduced weight and hybrid power system , the bus will incorporate a number of advanced design features and advantages , said Gregory Fisher , chief executive officer of Fisher Coachworks ( http://www.fishercoachworks.com/), which licensed the technology , has produced a prototype and plans full commercialization .
The bus made its debut today and deliveries of the bus are expected to begin in 2009 .

Some of the advantages are improved vehicle safety for passengers , lower cost , reduced noise and improved ride dynamics .
The major advantage , though , will be in cost to operate , according to Fisher .
Specific contributions from ORNL included computer crash studies and infrared thermal imaging to evaluate the quality of some of the initial laser welds in the structure .
Early tests showed some problems with the laser welding technique , so Autokinetics chose to use resistance spot welding in most places and tungsten inert gas welding for the remainder of the joining needs .
But even before its technical contributions , Emmons said ORNL had a huge impact .
" ORNL was the first to suggest the possibility of applying Autokinetics ' light - weighting ideas and technologies to the bus field , " Emmons said .
" Without that insight , this program would never have happened . "
Phil Sklad of ORNL 's Materials Science and Technology Division served as the program manager and technical monitor and noted that DOE 's $ 2.5 million investment in this project is being rewarded with a revolutionary bus .
" This is a perfect example of how the Department of Energy , a national laboratory and the private sector can collaborate to produce something that is potentially of great value to society , " Sklad said .
Fisher Coachworks , located in Troy , Mich. , is planning to use this patented technology for transit buses and other commercial vehicle market segments that would benefit from vastly improved fuel economy in urban stop and start applications .
Fisher Coachworks was formed in 2007 to focus on production of advanced hybrids using an ultra- lightweight stainless steel unibody construction .
Funding for this project was provided by DOE's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program .

The chart above shows oil prices , net oil exports (
data here
) and world GDP , quarterly from 2002:Q1 to 2008 : QII .
The data for OECD world GDP and oil prices are from
Global Financial Data
( subscription required ) .
Oil prices are on the right scale in $ / bbl. , and world GDP and net oil exports are on the left scale , both expressed as an index equal to 100 in 2002 : QI .
The graph above was inspired by the CFTC report and graph of world GDP and oil production , featured on
this CD post
.
I added oil prices and used net oil exports ( from
Net Oil Exports
) instead of oil production .
Bottom Line :
The graph shows that world GDP , net oil exports and oil prices were all increasing at about the same rate from 2002 to early 2006 .
Starting in about mid-2006 , the three series started to diverge as world GDP continued to increase , but net oil exports started to decline .
It was at that point of departure in 2006 between global output ( GDP ) and the global supply of oil that oil prices started to rise significantly ( see shaded area ) .
It 's taken decades for the message to get through , but at last we are turning to greener motoring .
The demand for hybrid cars in the UK is at an all - time high and waiting lists for the proven technology are long .
In Japan , drivers have been shaken so seriously by the oil shocks that they became the first in the developed world to experience declining car ownership .
They are also poised to benefit from the biggest experiment with electric cars since the milk float .
This is all terribly green and worthy , but these solutions mean forking out for another car .
Would n't it be better to adapt our existing vehicles ?
And while giving up our gas - guzzlers is one thing , what should we do with the billions of old - tech cars already on the road ?
After all , simply to scrap them means building new cars .
As Conor Faughnan of the AA points out : " Most of the pollution associated with cars actually relates to their construction . "
In first gear
A Japanese start - up company says it might have the answer .
It is proposing to retrofit our existing cars with tiny hydrogen generators that work off the car exhaust and supplement existing combustion .
Makoto Okuda , director of Hrein Energy , says : " Adding about 3 % of hydrogen to the intake air results in a lean burn , which has never been made possible with gasoline alone . "
His company , based in Hokkaido , develops systems to make , store and supply hydrogen .
He says " We have improved fuel efficiency by 30 % and reduced CO2 emissions by 30 % in recent tests . "
Now working with Japanese carmakers , Okuda says he hopes to have a system on the market in two to three years .
The beauty of the new system is that it employs the otherwise wasted heat generated by car engines - up to 40 % in some cases - to convert an easily transportable liquid organic hydride ( a hydrogen - storing chemical ) into a gaseous state .
This hydrogen is then added to the intake air resulting , says Okuda , in reduced emissions .
The emissions are so low , claims the company , that they will conform to the new EU regulations expected on CO2 emissions in 2012 .
Hrein suggests retro-fitting all cars with the system .
Scientists agree that transporting hydrogen in a liquid state makes more sense than filling up from service stations equipped to handle frozen hydrogen .
" Hydrogen does have fantastic potential , says Faye Sunderland of greencarwebsite.co.uk .
" Retail network distribution is always a problem with new alternative fuels .
A UK company called ITM recently announced they had developed a home refuelling unit for hydrogen cars .
So a solution is forming . "
Says Sunderland : " The key problem with hydrogen technology so far has been retail distribution of hydrogen and economic and environmental viability of the technology .
So far hydrogen has been held back because the easiest way to produce hydrogen was to burn fossil fuels which meant the well - to - wheel CO2 emissions were actually higher than if you just put the fossil fuels directly into the car .
As a result , it was a bit of an expensive non-starter . "
Hrein says all its hydrogen production comes from wind - generated sources on Hokkaido , Japan 's most northerly island .
But although Japan is the home of the hybrid and host to more electric plug - in cars than the rest of the planet put together , as well as being a leader in the number of hydrogen outlets for vehicles , renewable energy is not something Japan has been strong on so far .
There are doubts about whether it would be possible to scale up renewable operations to meet the demand necessary for all this hydrogen needed to be mixed with petro - fuel at service stations .
Hydrogen storing technology , however , does have potential , according to papers published on the technology since the 1970s .
The system , they generally conclude , " appears feasible " .
" Organic hydrides are a high - efficiency high - density storage media for hydrogen , " says Masaru Ichikawa of Hokkaido University , who worked with Hrein on the formula .
" The end product can be transported alongside petrol in fuel delivery lorries and deposited at petrol stations just like today 's conventional fuels . "
But if the technology has been available since the 1970s , asks John Turner , a research fellow at the US 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory , why did n't the automakers turn to it to provide themselves with an edge over competitors ?
Dirty work
" Conspiracy theories aside , the automakers have some very smart engineers and if they see something that will easily give them a 30 % boost in fuel economy then they are going to take a hard look at it , " he says .
" Modifying an existing technology , unless it is mandated by some government agency , will not likely go anywhere . "
Hrein , with its take on delivering a little hydrogen to clean up the dirty work of gasoline , may be about to do that , according to the company 's representative in the UK .
Hrein is talking to the UK government to discuss bringing the technology to the UK .
Should Downing Street give the system a green light , it could provide a stopgap in the march towards the zero emission car .
It would certainly provide many of us who can only afford second - hand bangers with a cleaner conscience , if not a cleaner engine .

Anyone have any idea why it 's called " wheel " ?
The guy who wrote the group functionality was both a buddhist and a Journey fan .
He was listening to " Wheel in the Sky " while trying to figure out a way to give more people administrative rights without giving too much access .
In a fit of enlightment , he came up with a special group for administrators .
Since they were the ones who kept things turning , it only seemed appropriate that " wheel " be immortalized in the /etc / group file .

In recent days I have been asked on three separate occasions whether I think physicists are going to destroy the world the moment they switch on the Large Hadron Collider - the huge underground particle accelerator in Geneva - later this year .
They ask if , as has been reported , the energies it will produce when beams of near light - speed subatomic particles are smashed together will create mini black holes that will swallow up the whole planet .
Add to this the more rational worries many people have about the global catastrophe of climate change if we do n't act fast enough to curb our reliance on fossil fuels , or about GM crops producing Frankenstein food , hybrid embryo research producing Frankenstein babies , and nuclear power leaving future generations a legacy of toxic radioactive waste , and one is left with the impression that the average person is pretty scared about the rate of current scientific advances .
Of the above doom - laden list , the only issue I am unable to provide any sort of reassurance on is climate change , where I am just as worried as everyone else .
The rest , I would argue , are based on unfounded fears arising from a misunderstanding of the science involved .
It is of course quite right that the implications - ethical or otherwise - of all manner of scientific research are high on the agenda of government decision - making and research funding .
Science ethics is even being taught as part of new science curriculums in UK schools .
While the issue of ethics in medical research has always been around , it can only be healthy that we are beginning to apply the same standards to other areas of science , not just so that scientists themselves think more responsibly , but to encourage them to explain what they do to the rest of society , particularly if they work in academia and are funded by public money .
For many , concerns with some scientific research are linked with the unease about living in a nanny state that they feel often passes through legislation and enacts policies without real consensual debate .
So I would like to share with you what was , for me , a quite surprising example of the ultimate nanny state making some remarkably sensible decisions .
On a recent visit to Iran , I was allowed unrestricted access to the Royan Institute in Tehran where , by all accounts , world - class work in genetics , infertility treatment , stem cell research and animal cloning is carried out in an atmosphere of openness quite dramatically at odds with my expectations .
Much of the work at the Royan is therapeutic and centred on infertility treatment .
But their basic research in genetics was remarkably advanced , despite the restrictions on many of the researchers ' travel to international meetings and the difficulties in publishing their work in the leading international journals .
What struck me most was the way the authorities overseeing the research seem to have dealt with the ethical minefields of parts of the work , in stark contrast with the howls of protest from some quarters in the UK in the run-up to the human embryo research bill that went through parliament recently .
At the Royan I spoke to one of the imams who sits on their ethics committee .
He explained that every research project proposed must be justified to his committee to ensure that it does not conflict with Islamic teaching .
Thus , while issues such as abortion are still restricted ( it is allowed only when the mother 's life is in danger ) , research on human embryos is allowed .
In this country the Catholic church has branded research on human embryonic stem cells immoral and says tinkering with life in this way is tantamount to playing God .
So I was taken aback by the Iranian imam who pointed out , quite rightly , that all that is produced in this research is just a clump of cells and not a foetus , and so what was all the fuss about ?
It is these stem cells that then differentiate into the specialist cells that are used to grow healthy tissue to replace that either damaged by trauma , or compromised by disease .
Among the conditions that scientists believe may eventually be treated by stem cell therapy are Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease , heart disease , strokes , arthritis , diabetes , burns and spinal cord damage .
The fundamental question is whether the original single zygote ( the fertilised egg ) is defined as a human being .
If so , then it can be argued that it is morally wrong to destroy the embryo , as is done of course once the stem cells are harvested .
Many in the Catholic church do indeed believe that the moment of fertilisation is also the beginning of human life - a notion not shared in Islam .
The embryo - is - a - human argument is based on the idea that the fertilised egg contains everything that is needed to replicate and that this is sufficient .
But is this " potential " of becoming a human being really enough ?
I mean why stop there ?
Surely the unfertilised egg also has the potential of becoming a human , as indeed does each and every sperm cell ( a notion immortalised in Monty Python 's The Meaning of Life ) .
But I would argue that this is more than just a metaphysical issue .
An embryo just a few days old is no more than a bundle of homogeneous cells in the same membrane , which do not form a human organism because they do not function in a coordinated way to regulate and preserve a single life .
So while each individual cell is " alive " , it only becomes part of a human organism when there is substantial cell differentiation and coordination , which occurs around two weeks after fertilisation .
Until that time , for instance , there is still the chance that the embryo can split into two , to form identical twins .
If each embryo develops into an individual person , how can the undivided embryo be said to have a separate existence ?
Asensible definition of the beginning of human life is that it takes place sometime during the foetus 's development .
For many , both religious and non-religious , this is defined as when consciousness switches on .
This crucial stage lies long after that of the embryonic stem cells with their " potential " , rather it is when that potential is fulfilled .
But too strong a link with consciousness can lead to the absurd situation of questioning the rights to life of a newborn baby if one subscribes to the view , held by some neuroscientists , that it is not really conscious .
According to Islamic teaching , I discovered , the foetus becomes a full human being only when it is " ensouled " at 120 days from the moment of conception , and so the research at Royan on human embryonic stem cells is not seen as playing God , as it takes place at a much earlier stage .
Thus , while there is much that the west finds unpalatable about life under Islamic rule , when it comes to genetics they are not held back by their religious doctrine .
Like a number of other developing Islamic countries , such as Malaysia , Iran 's scientific research is moving forward in leaps and bounds .
I had hoped to visit one of its nuclear research facilities , but given the current political climate and Israel 's threats of military action , it was no big surprise that my film crew and I were denied access at the last minute .
Nevertheless , whatever criticisms we may have of the regime in Iran , I was left in no doubt that its researchers can hold their heads high .
And we in the UK might learn a lesson or two from them before we complain too quickly about our own nanny state .

After six Nobel Prizes , the invention of the transistor , laser and countless contributions to computer science and technology , it is the end of the road for Bell Labs ' fundamental physics research lab .
Alcatel - Lucent , the parent company of Bell Labs , is pulling out of basic science , material physics and semiconductor research and will instead be focusing on more immediately marketable areas such as networking , high - speed electronics , wireless , nanotechnology and software .
The idea is to align the research work in the Lab closer to areas that the parent company is focusing on , says Peter Benedict , spokesperson for Bell Labs and Alcatel - Lucent Ventures .
" In the new innovation model , research needs to keep addressing the need of the mother company , " he says .
That view is shortsighted and may drastically curtail the Labs ' ability to come up with truly innovative discoveries , respond critics .
" Fundamental physics is absolutely crucial to computing , " says Mike Lubell , director of public affairs for the American Physical Society .
" Say in the case of integrated circuits , there were many , many small steps that occurred along the way resulting from decades worth of work in matters of physics . "
Bell Labs was one of the last bastions of basic research within the corporate world , which over the past several decades has largely focused its R&D efforts on applied research – areas of study with more immediate prospects of paying off .
Without internally funded basic research , fundamental research has instead come to rely on academic and government - funded laboratories to do kind of long - term projects without immediate and obvious payback that Bell Labs used to historically do , says Lubell .
Most of the scientists working in the company 's fundamental physics department have been reassigned , says Benedict .
Nature , which first reported the news , says just four scientists are left working the fundamental physics department in Murray Hill , New Jersey .
Benedict would n't confirm or deny that .
Computing and wireless technologies owe much to advancements in physics , though the connection may not always be immediately apparent .
An example is the Global Positioning Systems or GPS .
For instance , an integral element of GPS are atomic clocks , which stemmed from the creation of the hydrogen maser .
The hydrogen maser , or hydrogen frequency standard , uses the properties of a hydrogen atom to serve as a precision frequency reference .
" GPS is based on very accurate timing mechanisms , " says Lubell .
" So the measure of time and the frequency standards that are used to do it date back to research in optical pumping which led to the development of hydrogen maser . "
In the past Bell Labs was the place where such fundamental research that impacts the fields of both computing and physics could meet .
Bell Labs was founded in 1925 by Walter Gifford , then president of AT&T .
AT&T , a monopoly , established Bell Telephone Laboratories , popularly known as Bell Labs , as a joint venture with Western Electric , AT&T 's manufacturing subsidiary .
The Labs became the Mecca for researchers in science , computers and mathematics .
Deregulation , however , forced AT&T in 1995 to spin off Bell and other parts of the company into Lucent Technologies .
The move marked a shift in fortunes for the research arm as research budgets came to be trimmed and Alcatel - Lucent faced increasing pressure from stockholders .
" Bell Labs could do the kind of fundamental research it did in the past because it was functioning as part of a monopoly , " says Lubell .
" With that gone the landscape changed dramatically . "
In recent years , Bell Labs ' physics unit had its share of controversy when researcher J. Hendrik Schön was found to have published data in the area of molecular - scale transistors between 1998 and 2001 that had been manipulated and falsified .
That 's a long way from where the Labs once stood with its position as a Nobel Prize magnet .
In 1937 , Bell Labs researcher Clinton Davisson shared the Nobel Prize in physics for demonstrating the wave nature of matter .
Nearly twenty years later , in 1956 came the Nobel prize for inventing the transistor and it was shared by William Shockley , John Bardeen and Bell scientist Walter Brattain .
In the seventies , Bell Labs won two Nobel prizes in physics back - to - back in the years 1977 and 1978 .
Philip Anderson shared the Nobel for developing an improved understanding of the electronic structure of glass and magnetic materials .
The next year Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were feted for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation .
Former Bell Labs researcher Steven Chu shared the Nobel in 1997 for developing methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light .
A year later Horst Stormer , Robert Laughlin , and Daniel Tsui were awarded a Nobel for the discovery and explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect .
In the last few years , Lucent has sold its semiconductor business and that means research in areas connected to that had to be scaled back , especially in areas such as integrated circuits and Microelectromechanicals Systems ( MEMS ) .
Meanwhile , Alcatel - Lucent continues to hack away at its jewels .
Though Murray Hill in New Jersey , the company 's U.S. headquarters , and the site of many great scientific discoveries remains safe , Alcatel - Lucent has sold its Holmdel campus .
Holmdel 's technological contributions include contributions to Telstar , the first communications satellite and Chu's Nobel Prize - winning work .
Still for fundamental physics research there will be life after Bell Labs , though it will be dependent on the whims of the federal government .
Increasingly , long - term research is being carried out in universities and national laboratories with federal grants , says Lubell .
For Bell Labs , yet another chapter in its storied history of comes to a close taking the once iconic institution closer to being just another research arm of a major corporation .

VLC is one of the most well - known media players out there , and it ’s been almost 4 years since they ’ve released a major new version .
VLC 0.9.0 is on the horizon , and it packs in 2 years of development … so you can expect some great things .
There ’s just one gotcha : Windows 98 / ME and Mac OS X 10.3.9 are no longer supported operating systems .
So what ’s new in this release ?
One of the biggest things would have to be the revamped interface seen in the screenshot above .
The preferences have been drastically overhauled , and are now broken up into “ simple ” and advanced settings .
That way new users are n’t overwhelmed by the number of things that can be configured .
Beauty is only skin deep though , and that ’s why there ’s much more than the flashy new interface that ’s worth a look :
Improved playlist support : Shoutcast TV listings , Audioscrobbler / Last .
FM support ( in supported countries ) , album art , and more
Better tag support
Supports most types of subtitles
New and enhanced filters
Improved mouse gestures
Full support for meta data editing ( ID3 v2 , Ogg / Vorbis , AAC , APEv1/2 )
and more …
If you ’re looking for the Last .
FM support you ’ll have to dig through the options ( Tools -> Preferences ) .
You ’ll need to be in the “ advanced ” view by filling in the All bubble located in the lower - left corner .
Then navigate to Interface -> Control Interfaces -> Audioscrobbler .
From there you can enter in your Last .
FM username and password .
Then click on the Control Interfaces section , and check the “ Submission of played songs to Last .
FM ” box .
VLC will share your listening habits with Last .
FM from there on out .
You can grab a pre-release version of VLC 0.9.0 ( Windows installer ) , or you can wait for it to reach final form .
From what I can tell this is shaping up to be a nice release .

Virtual Dating , Real Disaster
Normal dating may have its downsides , but at least you do n’t regularly encounter crazy wenches who duct tape their dogs to your bathtub … then threaten you with BBs .
That ’s just the pickle one guy found himself facing when he made the mistake of trying to score from the depths of the virtual dimension .
Let me set the scene for you , as police describe it : Kimberly meets Mark* in the Second Life virtual world .
The two begin “ cyber - dating , ” during which time we can only assume Kimberly did not show Mark her real photo .
They eventually agree to meet .
Immediately after , Mark ends their “ relationship . ”
Fast forward several months .
Kimberly , torn to pieces by the loss of her “ boyfriend , ” decides to go apeshit ( to use the technical term ) .
She finds Mark ’s workplace — a good 600 miles and four states away from her home , mind you — and tries to kidnap him .
She does not succeed .
Two weeks go by .
Kimberly decides to turn the psycho - knob up a few more notches .
She spends four days seeking out Mark ’s home , then breaks in — carrying with her a set of handcuffs , some duct tape , a Taser , a BB gun , and her dog .
She inexplicably decides to duct tape the dog to the bathtub , then waits for Mark to get home .
He senses something is amiss upon his arrival and calls police .
Kimberly is arrested .
The moral of the story :
While in some cases technology aids evolution , in others , it gets in the way .
Some members of the species simply should not be engaging in any form of the mating ritual .
Virtual worlds mask this otherwise obvious designation .
So , if you must utilize the virtual world … for the love of humanity , keep your habits within it .
Do not under any circumstances try to spread your cyberseductions into real life .
As the case of Kimberly and Mark demonstrates , attempting to get in the downtheres of a downright deranged dame will most certainly end in disaster .
* The man ’s name has been changed with the goal of protecting his identity .
The woman ’s name has not been changed with the hopes of exposing hers .
It was a wedding straight out of Sex and the City : a rehearsal dinner looking out over the Eiffel Tower from the Trocadero , a garden ceremony and dancing reception in a grand château outside Paris , topped off by a private fireworks display .
The groom was a thirtysomething American lawyer with friends in high places , the bride a dark - eyed designer with social sheen , and the guest list a mix of family and what Noël Coward once called Nescafé Society .
But the real cynosure of the occasion last August was the smiling , snowy - haired man who is the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral he attends , the 42nd president of the United States , Bill Clinton .
He had come to the City of Light with the motley crew that constitutes some of the post - presidential rat pack to celebrate the marriage of Douglas Band , the man who for the last decade has been his personal aide , gatekeeper , enforcer , and — more recently — counselor in the multifarious business , philanthropic , and political dealings that keep Clinton restlessly circling the globe .
Also in attendance was Ron Burkle , the California supermarket billionaire and investor who is Clinton ’s bachelor buddy , fund - raiser , and business partner .
Burkle had come with an attractive blonde , described by a fellow guest as “ not much older than 19 , if she was that . ”
Burkle ’s usual means of transport is the custom - converted Boeing 757 that Clinton calls “ Ron Air ” and that Burkle ’s own circle of young aides privately refer to as “ Air Fuck One . ”
Clinton himself had arrived on the private plane of another California friend , the real - estate heir , Democratic donor , liberal activist , and sometime movie and music producer Steve Bing , whose colorful private life includes fathering a child out of wedlock with the actress Elizabeth Hurley and suing the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian for invasion of privacy , alleging that private investigators for Kerkorian swiped Bing ’s dental floss out of his trash in a successful effort to prove that Bing ’s DNA matched that of a child delivered by Kerkorian ’s ex-wife , the former tennis pro Lisa Bonder .
( The suit was later settled out of court . )
In fairness , it should be said that Clinton ’s entourage that weekend also included his daughter , Chelsea , and her boyfriend , Marc Mezvinsky , and no one who was there has adduced the slightest evidence that Clinton ’s behavior was anything other than proper .
Nor , indeed , is there any proof of post - presidential sexual indiscretions on Clinton ’s part , despite a steady stream of tabloid speculation and Internet intimations that the Big Dog might be up to his old tricks .
On any given visit to London , for example , Clinton is as apt to dine with Tony Blair or Kevin Spacey as with anyone who might raise an eyebrow .
But among the not - so - small cadre of Clinton friends and former aides , concern about the company the boss keeps is persistent , palpable , and pained .
No former president of the United States has ever traveled with such a fast crowd , and most 61 - year - old American men of Clinton ’s generation do n’t , either .
“ I just think those guys are radioactive , ” one former aide to Clinton who is still in occasional affectionate touch with him told me recently , referring to Burkle and ( to a lesser extent ) Bing .
“ I stay far away from them . ”
Another former aide , trusted by Clinton for his good judgment , said , “ On the sort of money , women , all that stuff … I ’m the bad guy .
All this stuff is kept away from me .
Whatever they ’re doing , they definitely view me as somebody you cannot confide in . ”
A longtime Clinton - watcher , who has had ties to the former president since his first campaign for governor of Arkansas , said of Clinton ’s sometimes questionable associations , “ I do n’t know what to make of any of that , if it ’s a voyeuristic experience , or if he ’s participating in it . ”
Eight years ago , then Governor George W. Bush revealingly joked about his backers at the 2000 Al Smith Dinner .
" This is an impressive crowd - the haves and the have - mores , " Bush said , adding , " Some people call you the elites ; I call you my base . "
With his own quip Saturday night that " $ 5 million " is his definition of rich , " John McCain made no mistake that he is Bush 's natural heir .
Now , there is nothing wrong with being happily rich and utterly detached .
Nothing , that is , unless you make criticizing your political opponent as " elitist " and " out of touch " a centerpiece of your campaign .
Which is why McCain beat a hasty retreat in an interview today with the Politico .
( In that same interview , McCain with no sense of irony called lobbyists " birds of prey . " )
Without naming a number , McCain said :
" I define rich in other ways besides income .
Some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them .
Others are poor if they ’re billionaires . "
Of course , by any accounting , the $ 100 million McCains are fabulously well - off ( see the gold - plated details below the fold ) .
But John McCain 's staggering detachment from the real lives of the American people can truly be measured in dollars – and sense .
For starters , McCain in April declared that there had been " great progress economically " during the Bush years .
On more than one occasion , he diagnosed Americans ' concerns over the dismal U.S. economy as " psychological . "
( Phil Gramm , McCain 's close friend and adviser supposedly excommunicated over his " whiners " remarks , was back with the campaign last week . )
McCain , a man who owns eight homes nationwide , in March lectured Americans facing foreclosure that they ought to be " doing what is necessary -- working a second job , skipping a vacation , and managing their budgets -- to make their payments on time . "
And when all else fails , McCain told the people of the economically devastated regions in Martin County , Kentucky and Youngstown , Ohio , there 's always eBay .
In his defense , McCain 's shocking tone - deafness may just be a matter of perspective .
When you 're as well off as he is , anything below a $ 5 million income ( a figure exceeding that earned on average by the top 0.1 % of Americans ) seems middle class by comparison .
The $ 100 Million Man .
Courtesy of his wife Cindy 's beer distribution fortune ( one her late father apparently chose not to share with her half - sister Kathleen ) , the McCains are worth well over $ 100 million .
( In the two - page tax summary she eventually released to the public , Cindy McCain reported another $ 6 million in 2006 . )
As Salon reported back in 2000 , the second Mrs. McCain 's millions were essential in launching her husband 's political career .
Unsurprisingly , the Weekly Standard 's Matthew Continetti , who four years ago called Theresa Heinz - Kerry a " sugar mommy , " has been silent on the topic of Cindy McCain .
The Joys of ( Eight ) Home Ownership .
While fellow adulterer John Edwards was pilloried for his mansion , John McCain 's eight homes around the country have received little notice or criticism .
His properties include a 10 acre lake - side Sedona estate , euphemistically called a " cabin " by the McCain campaign , and a home featured in Architectural Digest .
The one featuring " remote control window coverings " was recently put up for sale .
Still , their formidable resources did not prevent the McCains from failing to pay taxes on a tony La Jolla , California condo used by Cindy 's aged aunt .
The Anheuser - Busch Windfall .
As it turns out , the beauty of globalization is in the eye of the beholder .
While John McCain apparently played a critical role in facilitating DHL's takeover of Airborne ( and with it , the looming loss of 8,000 jobs in Wilmington , Ohio ) , Cindy McCain is set to earn a staggering multi-million dollar pay - day from the acquisition of Anheuser - Busch by the Belgian beverage giant , In Bev .
As the Wall Street Journal reported in July , Mrs. McCain runs the third largest Anheuser - Busch distributorship in the nation , and owns between $ 2.5 and $ 5 million in the company 's stock .
Amazingly , while Missouri 's politicians of both parties lined up to try to block the sale , John McCain held a fundraiser in the Show Me State even as the In Bev deal was being finalized .
McCain's $ 370,000 Personal Tax Break .
Earlier this year , the Center for American Progress analyzed John McCain 's tax proposals .
The conclusion ?
McCain 's plan is radically more regressive than even that of President Bush , delivering 58 % of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 % of American taxpayers .
McCain 's born - again support for the Bush tax cuts has one additional bonus for Mr. Straight Talk : the McCains would save an estimated $ 373,000 a year .
Paying Off $ 225,000 Credit Card Debt ?
Priceless .
That massive windfall from his own tax plan will come in handy for John McCain .
As was reported in June , the McCains were carrying over $ 225,000 in credit card debt .
The American Express card - do n't leave your homes without it .
Charity Begins at Home .
As Harpers documented earlier this year , the McCains are true believers in the old saying that charity begins at home :
Between 2001 and 2006 , McCain contributed roughly $ 950,000 to [ their ] foundation .
That accounted for all of its listed income other than for $ 100 that came from an anonymous donor .
During that same period , the McCain foundation made contributions of roughly $ 1.6 million .
More than $ 500,000 went to his kids ' private schools , most of which was donated when his children were attending those institutions .
So McCain apparently received major tax deductions for supporting elite schools attended by his children .
Ironically , the McCain campaign last week blasted Barack Obama for having attended a private school in Hawaii on scholarship .
That attack came just weeks after John McCain held an event at his old prep school , Episcopal High , an institution where fees now top $ 38,000 a year .
Private Jet Setters .
As the New York Times detailed back in April , John McCain enjoyed the use of his wife 's private jet for his campaign , courtesy of election law loopholes he helped craft .
Despite the controversy , McCain continued to use Cindy 's corporate jet .
For her part , Cindy McCain says that even with skyrocketing fuel costs , " in Arizona the only way to get around the state is by small private plane . "
Help on the Homefront .
In these tough economic times , the McCains are able to stretch their household budget .
As the AP reported in April , " McCain reported paying $ 136,572 in wages to household employees in 2007 .
Aides say the McCains pay for a caretaker for a cabin in Sedona , Ariz . , child care for their teenage daughter , and a personal assistant for Cindy McCain . "
Well - Heeled in $ 520 Shoes .
If clothes make the man , then John McCain has it made .
As Huffington Post noted in July , " He has worn a pair of $ 520 black leather Ferragamo shoes on every recent campaign stop - from a news conference with the Dalai Lama to a supermarket visit in Bethlehem , PA . "
It is altogether fitting that McCain wore the golden loafers during a golf outing with President George H.W.
Bush in which he rode around in cart displaying the sign , " Property of Bush # 41 .
Hands Off . "
And so it goes .
John McCain proclaims $ 5 million finally makes you rich .
Meanwhile , ABC's Charlie Gibson thinks a $ 200,000 income makes you middle class .
And his colleague Cokie Roberts claims Barack Obama 's vacation to his home state of Hawaii was " exotic . "

Otto Moerbeek ( otto@ ) recently found and fixed an ancient bug ( some 33 years old ) in yacc ( 1 ) .
Here is his story :
My malloc has been tested by many and has been in snapshots for a while now .
Some time ago I received a bit of a puzzling report from Nikolay Sturm ( sturm@ ) that on sparc64 compiling big C++ projects would sometimes fail with an Internal Compiler Error ( ICE ) .
For a start , it was not clear if my new malloc was involved , but I setup my sparc 64 machine for testing .
It soon turned out I could reproduce the problem .
Switching to the in - tree malloc made the problem go away .
So I was facing a malloc bug or a gcc bug , I thought .
As some of you know I have been working on a new implementation of malloc , the general purpose memory allocator that 's used by userland programs .
See this link for more details about it .
Otto continues below ...
My new malloc has some features not found in the current malloc : it moves allocations smaller than a page but bigger than half a page to the end of the page , to have a greater chance of catching buffer overflows .
Even without guard pages , this works most of the time , since we have a randomized mmap ( 2 ) : there 's a pretty big chance that there is a hole after a page allocated .
Accessing that hole leads to a segmentation fault .
So I put my malloc back in , and started investigating .
The first thing I tried was to switch off the code that moves small allocations : and yes , that made the bug go away .
Using an unstripped version of the compiler , I could interpret the backtrace in gdb , and it soon turned out that the compiler was dying in yyparse ( ) . yyparse( ) is the main function generated by the parser generator yacc ( 1 ) .
After compiling obj / cp / parse.c with debug options and some fighting with wrong line numbers reported by gdb , I saw the offending statement was the second statement below ;
yym = yylen [ yyn ] ; yyval = yyvsp [ 1 - yym ] ;
yym
yyvsp [ 1 ]
Yacc has an implicit action that does :
$ $ = $ 1 ;
$ $
$ 1
yym
But if the actions are part of a rule that has no right hand side :
A : /* empty */ { foo( ) ; } ;
$ 1
yym
$ $
But if the stack is at maximum size , this will overflow if an entry on the stack is larger than the 16 bytes leeway my malloc allows .
In the case of of C++ it is 24 bytes , so a SEGV occured .
Funny thing is that I traced this back to Sixth Edition UNIX , released in 1975 .
A very similar problem can be spotted here .
The lines :
yypv =- yyr2 [n ] ; yyval=yypv [ 1 ] ;
yy r2 [ n ]
=-
-=
The bug was only triggered on sparc 64 , since it uses 8 k pages .
The default yacc stack size for C++ is 24 * 200 = 4800 bytes , which is larger than a page on most platforms .
In this case malloc returns a page aligned object , no moving of the allocation inside a page occurs .
I 'm really happy this turned out to be a yacc bug , and not a malloc bug .
It 's actually a malloc feature in action . ;-)
The commit that fixes this can be found here .
When people talk about economic competitiveness , the focus tends to be on nation states .
In the 1980s , many were obsessed with the rise of Japan .
Today , our gaze has shifted to the phenomenal growth of Brazil , Russia , India and China .
But this focus on nations is off the mark .
The real driving force of the world economy is a new and incredibly powerful economic unit : the mega-region .

Fahamu ( Oxford ) granted permission for full reprint .
In the Congo , where hundreds of thousands of women are brutally raped every year , Dr. Denis Mukwege repairs their broken bodies and souls .
Eve Ensler visits him and finds hope amid the horror .
I have just returned from hell .
I am trying for the life of me to figure out how to communicate what I have seen and heard in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
How do I convey these stories of atrocities without your shutting down , quickly turning the page or feeling too disturbed ?
How do I tell you of girls as young as nine raped by gangs of soldiers , of women whose insides were blown apart by rifle blasts and whose bodies now leak uncontrollable streams of urine and feces ?
This journey was a departure for me .
It began with a man , Dr. Denis Mukwege , and a conversation we had in New York City in December 2006 , when he came to speak about his work helping women at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu .
It began with my rusty French and his limited English .
It began with the quiet anguish in his bloodshot eyes , eyes that seemed to me to be bleeding from the horrors he 'd witnessed .
Something happened in this conversation that compelled me to go halfway around the world to visit the doctor , this holy man who was sewing up women as fast as the mad militiamen could rip them apart .
I am going to tell the stories of the patients he saves so that the faceless , generic , raped women of war become Alfonsine and Nadine - - women with names and memories and dreams .
I am going to ask you to stay with me , to open your hearts , to be as outraged and nauseated as I felt sitting in Panzi Hospital in faraway Bukavu .
Before I went to the Congo , I 'd spent the past 10 years working on V - Day , the global movement to end violence against women and girls .
I 'd traveled to the rape mines of the world , places like Bosnia , Afghanistan and Haiti , where rape has been used as a tool of war .
But nothing I ever experienced felt as ghastly , terrifying and complete as the sexual torture and attempted destruction of the female species here .
It is not too strong to call this a femicide , to say that the future of the Congo 's women is in serious jeopardy .
I learned from my trip that there are men who take their sorrow and helplessness and destroy women 's bodies -- and there are others with the same feelings who devote their lives to healing and serving .
I do not know all the reasons men end up in one or the other of these groups , but I do know that one good man can create many more .
One good man can inspire other men to ache for women , to fight for them and protect them .
One good man can win the trust of a community of raped women -- and in doing so , keep their faith in humanity alive .
Dr. Mukwege picks me up at 6:30 A.M.
It is a lush , clean morning .
Eastern Congo , where Panzi Hospital is located , is wildly fertile .
You can almost hear the vegetation growing .
There are banana trees and cartoon - colored birds .
And there is Lake Kivu , a vast body of water that contains enough methane to power a good portion of the sub - Sahara - - yet the city of Bukavu on its banks has only sporadic electricity .
This is a theme in the Congo .
There are more natural resources than almost anywhere else on the planet , yet 80 percent of the people make less than a dollar a day .
More rain falls than one can imagine , but for millions , clean drinking water is scarce .
The earth is gorgeously abundant , and yet almost one third of the population is starving .
As we drive along the semblance of road , the doctor tells me how different things were when he was a child .
" In the sixties 50,000 people lived here in Bukavu .
It was a relaxed place .
There were rich people who had speedy boats in the lakes .
There were gorillas in the mountains . "
Now there are at least a million displaced Congolese , many of whom arrive in the city daily , fleeing the numerous armed groups that have ravaged the countryside since fighting erupted in 1996 .
What started as a civil war to overthrow dictator Mobutu Sese Seko soon became " Africa 's first world war , " as observers have called it , with soldiers from neighboring countries joining in the mayhem .
The troops have various agendas : Many are fighting for control of the region 's extraordinary mineral wealth .
Others are out to grab whatever they can get .
But you have to go back further than 1996 to understand what is going on in the Congo today .
This country has been tortured for more than 120 years , beginning with King Leopold II of Belgium , who " acquired " the Congo and , between 1885 and 1908 , exterminated an estimated 10 million people , about half the population .
The violent consequences of genocide and colonialism have had a profound impact on the psyche of the Congolese .
Despite a 2003 peace agreement and recent elections , armed groups continue to terrorize the eastern half of the country .
Overall the war has left nearly 4 million people dead -- more than in any other conflict since World War II -- and resulted in the rape of hundreds of thousands of women and girls .
In Bukavu , the people escaping the fighting walk from early morning to late at night .
They walk and walk , searching for a way to buy or sell a tomato , or for a banana for their baby .
It is a relentless river of humans , anxious and hungry .
" People used to eat three meals a day , " says Dr. Mukwege .
" Now they are lucky to eat one . "
Everyone knows the doctor , an ob - gyn .
He waves and stops to inquire about this person 's health , that person 's mother .
Most doctors , teachers and lawyers fled the Congo after the wars started .
It never occurred to Dr. Mukwege to leave his people at their most desperate hour .
He first became aware of the epidemic of rape in 1996 .
" I saw women who had been raped in an extremely barbaric way , " he recalls .
" First , the women were raped in front of their children , their husbands and neighbors .
Second , the rapes were done by many men at the same time .
Third , not only were the women raped , but their vaginas were mutilated with guns and sticks .
These situations show that sex was being used as a weapon that is cheap .
" When rape is done in front of your family , " he continues , " it destroys everyone .
I have seen men suffer who watched their wives raped ; they are not mentally stable anymore .
The children are in even worse condition .
Most of the time , when a woman suffers this much violence , she is not able to bear children afterward .
Clearly these rapes are not done to satisfy any sexual desire but to destroy the soul .
The whole family and community are broken . "
We arrive at Panzi Hospital , a spread - out complex of about a dozen buildings .
Eight years ago Dr. Mukwege created a special maternity ward here with an operating room .
Panzi as a whole has 334 beds , 250 of which now hold female victims of sexual violence .
The hospital and its surrounding property have become , essentially , a village of raped women .
The grounds are overwhelmed with children and hunger and need .
Every day at least two children here die from malnutrition .
Then there are the many problems that result from severe trauma : women with nightmares and insomnia , women rejected by their husbands , women who have no interest in nurturing the babies of their rapists , women and children with nowhere to go .
It is early morning , and the hospital courtyard has been transformed into a temporary church .
Women dressed in their most colorful , or perhaps only , pagne ( a six - yard piece of brightly patterned cloth that can be wrapped into a dress or skirt ) sit waiting for the doctor to arrive and lead the prayer service that begins each day .
A dedicated staff of female nurses and social workers are there as well , dressed in their starched white jackets .
There is singing , a combination of Pentecostal calls and Swahili rhythms , Sunday - morning voices calling up Jesus .
This morning service is a kind of daily gathering of strength and unity .
When the women sing , everything else seems to disappear .
They are with the sun , the sky , the drums , each other .
They are alive in their bodies , momentarily safe and free .
As they sing , Dr. Mukwege tells me stories about the women in the chorus .
Many were naked when they arrived , or starving .
Many were so badly damaged he is amazed they are singing at all .
He takes enormous pride in their recovery .
" I will never be ashamed , " the women sing .
" God gave me a new heart that I can be very strong . "
" At the beginning I used to hear patients ' stories , " Dr. Mukwege tells me .
" Now I abstain . " I soon understand why .
I meet Nadine ( like others in this story , she agreed to be photographed , but asked that her name be changed , as she could be subject to reprisals for speaking out ) , who tells me a tale so horrendous it will haunt me for years to come .
When we begin talking , Nadine seems utterly disassociated from her surroundings -- far away .
" I'm 29 , " she begins .
" I am from the village of Nindja .
Normally there was insecurity in our area .
We would hide many nights in the bush .
The soldiers found us there .
They killed our village chief and his children .
We were 50 women .
I was with my three children and my older brother ; they told him to have sex with me .
He refused , so they cut his head and he died . "
Nadine 's body is trembling .
It is hard to believe these words are coming out of a woman who is still alive and breathing .
She tells me how one of the soldiers forced her to drink his urine and eat his feces , how the soldiers killed 10 of her friends and then murdered her children : her four - year - old and two - year - old boys and her one - year - old girl .
" They flung my baby 's body on the ground like she was garbage , " Nadine says .
" One after another they raped me .
From that my vagina and anus were ripped apart . "
Nadine holds onto my hand as if she were drowning in a tsunami of memory .
As devastated as she is , it is clear that she needs to be telling this story , needs me to listen to what she is saying .
She closes her eyes and says something I cannot believe I 'm hearing .
" One of the soldiers cut open a pregnant woman , " she says .
" It was a mature baby and they killed it .
They cooked it and forced us to eat it . "
Incredibly , Nadine was the only one of the 50 women to escape .
" When I got away from the soldiers , there was a man passing .
He said , ' What is that bad smell ? '
It was me ; because of my wounds , I could n't control my urine or feces .
I explained what had happened .
The man wept right there .
He and some others brought me to the Panzi Hospital . "
She stops .
Neither of us has breathed .
Nadine looks at me , longing for me to make sense of what she 's related .
She says ,
" When I got here I had no hope .
But this hospital helped me so much .
Whenever I thought about what happened , I became mad .
I believed I would lose my mind .
I asked God to kill me .
Dr. Mukwege told me : Maybe God did n't want me to lose my life . "
Nadine later tells me that the doctor was right .
As she fled the slaughter , she says , she saw an infant lying on the ground next to her slain parents .
Nadine rescued the girl ; now having a child to care for gives her reason to keep going .
" I can't go back to my village .
It 's too dangerous .
But if I had a place to live I could go to school .
I lost my children but I 'm raising this child as my own .
This girl is my future . "
I stay for a week at Panzi .
Women line up to tell me their stories .
They come into the interview numb , distant , glazed over , dead .
They leave alive , grateful , empowered .
I begin to understand that the deepest wound for them is the sense that they have been forgotten , that they are invisible and that their suffering has no meaning .
The simple act of listening to them has enormous impact .
The slightest touch or kindness restores their faith and energy .
The strength of these women is remarkable , as is their unparalleled resiliency .
Dr. Mukwege tells me I need to meet Alfonsine ( her name also has been changed ) .
" Her story really touched me , " he says .
" Her body , her case is the worst I have ever seen , but she has given us all courage . "
Alfonsine is thin and poised , profoundly calm .
She tells me she was walking through the forest when she encountered a lone soldier .
" He followed me and then forced me to lie down .
He said he would kill me .
I struggled with him hard ; it went on for a long time .
Then he went for his rifle , pressed it on the outside of my vagina and shot his entire cartridge into me .
I just heard the voice of bullets .
My clothes were glued to me with blood .
I passed out . "
Dr. Mukwege tells me , " I never saw such destruction .
Her colon , bladder , vagina and rectum were basically gone .
She had lost her mind .
I was sure she would n't make it .
I rebuilt her bladder .
Sometimes you do n't even know where you are going .
There 's no map .
I operated on her six times , and then I sent her to Ethiopia so they could heal the incontinence problem , and they did . "
" I was in bed when I first met Dr. Mukwege , " Alfonsine says .
" He caressed my face .
I lived at Panzi for six months .
He helped me spiritually .
He showed me how many times God makes miracles .
He built me up morally . "
I look at Alfonsine 's petite body and imagine the scars beneath her humble white clothes .
I imagine the reconstructed flesh , the agony she experienced after being shot .
I listen carefully .
I cannot detect a drop of bitterness or any desire for revenge .
Instead , her attention is fixed on transforming the future .
She tells me with great pride , " I am now studying to be a nurse .
My first choice is to work at Panzi .
It was the nurses who nurtured me day after day , who loved me back into living . "
Alfonsine has ambitions that go beyond Panzi : " I feel like a big person in my community ; I can do something for my people .
Women must lead our country .
They know the way . "
Every day about a dozen new women arrive at Panzi Hospital .
Most come for surgery to repair a fistula , a rip in their internal tissue .
There are two types of fistulas seen here :
One is the aftermath of brutal rape , the other the result of birth complications , something that could be prevented if there were adequate maternity health care .
These obstetric fistulas are the result of abnormal tearing during the birth process .
Many occur when women flee the militias while they are in labor ; there is no time to give birth , and the baby dies inside .
The women who make it here are the lucky ones .
They limp on homemade canes made from tree branches ; they trudge slowly in deep pain .
Some have walked 40 miles .
Because it takes so long to get to the hospital , women have no chance to receive the anti-HIV medications that must be taken within 48 hours after rape .
Health experts fear that in a few years , there will be an explosion of AIDS in the Congo .
Dr. Mukwege was once the only doctor at Panzi Hospital able to perform fistula surgery ; now he has trained four others .
The hospital does 1,000 such operations a year .
I sit in on a typical operation in a clean , safe , but seriously underequipped operating room ( nurses use torn pieces of a green dressing gown to tie the woman 's ankles to the stirrups ) .
I am able to see the fistula - - a hole in the tissue between the woman 's vaginal wall and bladder .
A hole in her body .
A hole in her soul .
A hole where her confidence , her esteem , her spirit , her light , her urine leak out .
Because of the prevalence of fistulas , the Panzi complex is soaked in urine .
The smell pervades everything .
Pee spills out of women in a huge , dirt - floored hangarlike space where hundreds sit all day .
Pee spills out in classrooms , leaving puddles on the floor .
The women are always wet .
Their legs chafe and their skin burns .
There are many little girls in pee-stained dresses roaming around Panzi ; shy and ashamed , they , too , are victims of rape .
The week of my visit , a state agency had turned off the water for the hospital after billing Panzi $ 70,000 ( an insane amount by Congolese standards ) because it heard that the hospital , which is private , was receiving money from the West .
Staff had to bring in buckets of water from the surrounding neighborhood .
To have hundreds of women with fistula - caused incontinence and no water seemed like a crime upon a crime .
I can't help wondering what happened in Dr. Mukwege 's life that compelled him to work here , sometimes 14 hours a day .
" I was born in Bukavu on March 1 , 1955 , " he tells me .
" During my young age my mother was suffering with asthma .
In the night when she became ill , I was the one who would go and look for a nurse or bring her medication .
We all thought she would die .
Even now , each birthday she celebrates , I am so happy to see her alive .
" My father was a pastor .
He was very gentle , very human .
From him I got the caring to treat patients .
When we would go and visit sick people together , he would pray .
I would ask , ' Why can't you give them tablets or prescriptions ? '
He said , ' I am not a doctor . '
I decided then that prayer is not enough .
People must take things into their own hands .
Asking God does not change anything .
He gives us the ability to say yes or no .
You must use your hands , your mind .
When I receive women here who are hungry , I can't say , ' God bless you . '
I have to give them something to eat .
When someone is suffering , I can't tell her about God , I have to treat her pain .
You can't hide yourself in religion .
Not a solution . "
Dr. Mukwege began as a general practitioner , focusing on pediatrics .
When he worked in a clinic in Lemera , a village south of Bukavu , he saw dreadful things happening in maternity .
" Women were coming in bleeding day after day , many with severe infections .
A woman had a baby and carried it dead in her vagina for a week .
It was terrible .
This helped me make a total engagement in a new career . "
He went back to school to study gynecology in Angers , France , and then returned to Lemera to train the staff in obstetrics and gynecology .
After he moved to Bukavu he created a special maternity ward at Panzi .
Women who were victims of extreme sexual violence began to arrive .
The number grew every day .
Who was -- and is -- raping the women ?
The better question might be , who is n't ?
The perpetrators include the Interahamwe , the Hutu fighters who fled neighboring Rwanda in 1994 after committing genocide there ; the Congolese army ; a loose assortment of armed civilians ; even U.N. peacekeepers .
Christine Schuler Deschryver , who works for a German aid organization and is a fierce advocate for Panzi Hospital and Congolese women , says , " All of them are raping women .
It is a country sport .
Any person in uniform is an enemy to women . "
Many women do not even report the violations , because they are afraid of rejection by their husbands and families .
Although there are laws against rape in the Congo , if a woman reports her rape and her rapist is arrested , he can pay his way out and come back and rape her again .
Or murder her .
Dr. Mukwege , in contrast , is motivating a different kind of healing army .
I speak with a hospital employee named Bonane .
" I was in Uganda , " he says .
" I saw the doctor on TV .
He was explaining the atrocities .
I realized these are my mothers and sisters .
I was so inspired , I came here to work with him . "
Dr. Mukwege is married with five children , but his brother , Herman , tells me his family does n't see him much because his devotion to the women has consumed his life .
Although the doctor 's energy never flags , I notice an underlying exhaustion in his face and his being , a sleepless despair that comes from dwelling constantly amid violence and cruelty .
He says to me , " When you rape a woman , you destroy life and you destroy your own life .
Animals do n't do this .
When a pigeon has sex with another pigeon , it is kind .
I am wondering how man has the power of such destruction . "
And yet , the status of women in the Congo was dismal long before the wars started .
The women work all day in the field and market , carrying the Congo on their backs ( sometimes up to 200 pounds in bags strapped to their foreheads ) .
They prepare the dinner , wash the clothes , clean the house , take care of the children , have mandatory sex with their husbands .
They have no power , no rights and no value .
Many women I talk to ask why I am " wasting my time " with them .
I interview a man who is the keeper of a gorilla preserve .
He tells me that when dangerous militias began staking out territory in the park , he went to their commanders and asked if their soldiers would work with him to protect the gorillas .
In the end they all agreed .
I ask him why he did n't feel compelled to do the same for the women .
The question surprised him .
He had no answer .
I ask the doctor about the Congo 's leader , Joseph Kabila , who in November 2006 became the country 's first democratically elected president in 46 years and promised to be the " craftsman of peace . "
Are things getting better ?
Dr. Mukwege sighs .
" Kabila , " he says , " has done nothing .
The fighting here in the east has not stopped .
During 2004 my life was threatened ; I got phone calls warning me to stop my work or die .
The calls have ceased , but it is still very dangerous .
" Visitors come from the international community , " he continues .
" They eat sandwiches and cry , but they do not come back with help .
Even President Kabila has never put his foot here .
His wife was here .
She wept , but she has done nothing . "
UNICEF , ECHO ( the humanitarian aid office of the European Commission ) and PMU ( a Swedish humanitarian organization ) are the major supporters of Panzi .
Although the hospital can always use more money , the real need is for a political response to the violence .
Barring that , Dr. Mukwege would at least like to get real protection for the women once they leave the hospital .
" I patch them up and send them back home , " he says , " but there is no guarantee they will not be raped again .
There have been several cases where women have come back a second time , more destroyed than the first . "
On my last day , the doctor asks me if I will lead some exercises for the women that will help alleviate their trauma .
We go to the hangarlike building where 250 depressed and sick women are waiting .
We begin with breathing .
Inhale , exhale .
Inhale , exhale .
Then we attach a noise to the breath .
Other noises follow .
One after another , noise after noise .
Then we attach a movement .
There is stomping .
There is punching .
There is mad waving of arms .
The women are up on their feet , screaming , releasing guttural sounds of sorrow , rage , terror .
In a matter of minutes , I watch them go from broken , mute women to wild , laughing , ferocious beings .
In the midst of this energy , Dr. Mukwege challenges the women to a dance contest .
Celebration and power explode from their bodies .
A part of each woman is fierce , unbreakable .
No one has killed their spirits .
The doctor whispers to me , " When I see this joy , this life in the women , I know why I must come back here every day . "
The women 's frenzy builds and builds .
They dance in the hot African sun .
They dance in the open road .
They literally dance us up a steep hill , hundreds of women and children moving in a single , radiant feminine mass .
If 250 women who have been raped , torn , starved and tortured can find the strength to dance us up a mountain , surely the rest of us can find the resources and will to guarantee their future .

How you can help
The women of Eastern Congo , V - Day and UNICEF - the latter acting on behalf of United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict are launching a new campaign to urge an end to the femicide and raise money for women 's groups in the Congo .
You can ...
Write a letter addressed to His Excellency , the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Joseph Kabila Kabange ; demand that he take action to stop the attacks on women .
Send it to U.N. Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict , P.O. Box 3862 , New York , NY 10163 , and it will be delivered to Kabila .
Donate directly to Panzi Hospital through vday.org .
Money donated to Panzi also goes to establish a City of Joy , a safe haven for the healed women , where they 'll learn to become political leaders .
This post seems to have struck a nerve .
And not to be elitist , of course , but he means " affects " not " effects " .
And the sentence ,
" It is hardly as if it was [ sic ] a novel insight of mine that the Democrats have had a problem seeming like elitists "
requires a subjunctive .
I think what Jonah means is that it's ok to be part of a nepotistic , moneyed elite but not ok if you work your way up from food stamps to editor of the Harvard Law Review .
Now that kind of effort is what today 's conservatives really feel contempt for .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Shocking display of indiscretion :
Republican presidential candidate John McCain commented on Friday on the unannounced timing of a high - security trip by Barack Obama to Iraq , saying he believed his Democratic rival was going this weekend .
But McCain ’s spokesman said the Arizona senator knew nothing about Obama ’s schedule .
Obama said last month he would go to both Iraq and Afghanistan soon .
But his campaign has given no dates , seeking to cloak the trip in a measure of secrecy for security reasons .
“ I believe that either today or tomorrow — and I ’m not privy to his schedule — Sen. Obama will be landing in Iraq with some other senators ” who make up a congressional delegation , McCain said at a Republican fund - raiser .
It did n't happen in a dark alley , in the dead of night , with nobody in sight .
" I got mugged , " said 50 - year - old English High School teacher Art Garcia , " in the Copley library . "
It happened on a Saturday last month .
At around two in the afternoon .
As he talked with three teenagers he was tutoring .
It was there , at a second - floor open space in the Boston Public Library 's main branch , that Garcia had gathered the advanced placement biology students to prepare for an exam .
He was in the midst of going over the concept of chi-square analysis , he said , when he was jumped from behind by an apparently deranged homeless man who , according to a fellow street person , is known in the city 's shelters for launching unprovoked attacks .
Garcia described the weapon that cut his right ear as an unusual one , except at a library : a book .
Blood rushing from his lobe , Garcia was later patched up at a local hospital after he and library security collared the assailant , according to the teacher and a Boston police report .
Garcia said he is upset that his students had to witness that kind of bushwhacking within such hallowed halls .
" This happened in full view of everybody , " he said .
" My kids did n't deserve to see that . "
The midday ambush not only gouged Garcia 's ear .
It also tore open the latest chapter in an everlong debate that centers around the mighty ideals of personal safety and civil rights .
Some critics say that the BPL 's noble embrace of everyone , as inscribed in the words above its entranceway , " FREE TO ALL , " has led to a free - for - all at the Copley Library .
The BPL 's beloved main branch , they say , has become a home away from home for homeless folks , street people , transients , and unstable individuals .
Yet homeless advocates and library staff say it is dangerous to judge a book by its cover .
" Public is pretty much in the middle of our name - we 're the Boston Public Library , " said Mary Bender , the BPL 's acting communications manager .
" As they walk in the door , we should make a decision about whether they are welcome or not at the Boston Public Library based on sight ?
That 's a horrible idea to me . "
Public safety vs. public access is a divide that has long bedeviled public libraries .
The mayor of New Bedford earlier this year offered safety proposals following the alleged rape of a 6 - year - old boy at the city 's main branch library by a convicted sex offender .
One notion was that all would have to have a proper ID to enter the building .
Some critics say that condition unfairly targets homeless people , many of whom do n't have up - to - date IDs and prefer to be unknown .
At the BPL , Bender said last month 's outburst against the teacher was an anomaly .
Boston Police Department records show that the location of the central branch - which has an annual gate tally of 1.3 million - is a hectic one : From January 2005 through this May 28 , police assistance has been sought inside and just outside the Copley library about 13 times a month .
The reasons for summoning police range from purse - snatching to assault and battery .
The numbers denote raw calls , not necessarily confirmed offenses .
" It 's a really unfortunate incident that happened here , " Bender said , alluding to the May 10 broadside .
" We strive every day to keep the thousands of people who come through our doors safe . "
Police have not revealed the name of the alleged perpetrator in Garcia 's case because the courts are still sifting through the facts and no charges have yet been filed .
Still , the man is often well dressed and carrying a briefcase , according to the acquaintance , a homeless man named Ken Thomas .
Yet the mere appearance at the library of those who may not look like they live in Back Bay brownstones seems to rub some the wrong way .
Under the heading , " The homeless problem at the Boston Public Library , " here 's what " web entrepreneur " Colin Nederkoorn wrote on his " Top Startup " blog last year after a visit to the BPL : " One guy looked dirtier than the other so I sat next to the least dirty looking homeless man .
I started to read , but could n't ignore the foul stench surrounding me . . .
What bothers me the most was not the smell , nor was it the fact that homeless people are in the library .
It 's the fact that they are sleeping !?!?
If you 're homeless and in a library . . .
READ A BOOK !
You 've obviously got nothing better to do with your time , so why not get a little education ? . . .
Instead , they are busy wasting taxpayer dollars sleeping . "
Nederkoorn could not be reached by phone or e-mail , as he was biking across the United States , according to his blog .
Jim Stewart , a longtime advocate for the homeless , said such rants make insidious assumptions .
" Nobody knows someone 's economic or housing status by someone 's personal hygiene , " said Stewart , director of the First Church Shelter in Cambridge .
" If you said the same thing about black people or gay people based on hygiene or appearance , you'd be a bigot and nobody would have any time for you . "
With many area homeless shelters shut during the warm - weather daytime hours , and , advocates say , a dwindling number of spaces around the city that are accomodating to street people , a regular cadre of homeless folks still find the library a refuge from things like the harsh climate - or their own personal turbulence .

Global warming consensus takes another battering
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Wednesday , July 16 , 2008
Three top scientists have once again contradicted the claim that a “ consensus ” exists about man-made global warming with research that indicates CO2 emissions actually cool the atmosphere , in addition to another peer - reviewed paper that documents how the IPCC overstated CO2 ’s effect on temperature by as much as 2000 per cent .
Professor George Chilingar and Leonid Khilyuk of the University of Southern California , and Oleg Sorokhtin of the Institute of Oceanology of the Russian Academy of Sciences have released a study that they claim completely contradicts the link between CO2 and global temperature increases .
“ The writers investigated the effect of CO2 emission on the temperature of atmosphere .
Computations based on the adiabatic theory of greenhouse effect show that increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere results in cooling rather than warming of the Earth ’s atmosphere , ” states the preamble to the paper .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The full study , which appears in the Energy Sources journal , is sure to cause ire amongst climate cult adherants .
No global warming has been observed for the past 10 years as temperatures have gradually declined and studies indicate that there will be no further warming for the next 10 years .
In a related development , the peer - reviewed Physics and Society journal has published evidence proving that the UN IPCC ’s 2007 climate summary “ overstated CO2 ’s impact on temperature by 500- 2000 % . ”
According to the paper , “ Computer models used by the UN ’s climate panel ( IPCC ) were pre-programmed with overstated values for the three variables whose product is “ climate sensitivity ” ( temperature increase in response to greenhouse - gas increase ) , resulting in a 500 - 2000 % overstatement of CO2 ’s effect on temperature in the IPCC ’s latest climate assessment report , published in 2007 . ”
The paper also outlines evidence to confirm that Mars , Jupiter , Neptune ’s largest moon , and Pluto warmed at the same time as Earth warmed , a factor attributed to the Sun having been more active than at almost any other time in the past 11,400 years .
The paper concludes , “ CO2 enrichment will add little more than 1 °F ( 0.6 °C ) to global mean surface temperature by 2100 . ”

Git is one hell of a powertool .
Like with any such tool , as soon as you get to know it enough , you start pushing the boundaries .
Git gives you a lot of control over your repository :
trivial branching and merging ( even with long lived branches ) ;
rebasing as a cleaner alternative to merging ;
stashing aside your changes for a quick fix elsewhere ;
extracting logical , distinct commits from a multi-hours coding spree ;
The list goes on …
More traditional version control systems do n’t give you as much power as Git by any stretch of the mind .
They are like taking a walk in the woods with your parents , at age 14 .
You ’re probably gonna see and do neat stuff , but you sure ai n’t gonna get lost or anything .
Using
Git on the other hand is more akin to being handed a cool motocross to go play alone in the woods …
Also at age 14 .
We all know what ’s bound to happen , right ?
You ’ll smash into a tree .
The source control equivalent to slamming into a tree is losing commits .
Getting all of Git ’s power and flexibility at once can be somewhat dangerous .
You ’ll find it so easy and helpful to branch and merge that you ’ll start doing it way more often .
On the other hand – especially in the beginning – you ’ll misunderstand or plainly miss some important warnings , and make errors .
Or you may just end up in weird merging situations you never thought of , and do n’t necessarily understand .
These situations can often result in losing commits or whole branches .
My goal with this article is to make sure you understand the situation you ’re really in : you have temporarily lost commits or branches .
Disclaimer
This article assumes a basic knowledge of how git works , e.g. committing , branching and merging .
My first time
The first time I lost a commit was a good while ago .
I ca n’t remember the details , but basically I got bit by the fact that under the covers , Git uses hard links liberally .
Which means that copy / pasting your code directory as a recovery solution is n’t going to save your ass when you attempt a potentially damaging operation you do n’t fully understand .
Note that compressing your code directory will , though .
So there I was , after attempting an operation I did n’t really understand .
I knew I had failed what I attempted and I knew I had lost my last commit .
Ironically , I still had Gitk open , displaying that very commit .
As long as I did n’t refresh the Gitk view with F5 I could see the lost commit .
Here ’s a fun fact : under OSX ( not sure about Linux ) you cannot select and copy text from Gitk ’s interface , except for the SHA1 field [ 1 ] .
I knew Git probably had a way to recover from that …
But you know , I just wanted to get back to work and NOT search documentation and blog posts endlessly .
So I took screenshots , passed them real quick through GOCR , just to see how far it would get .
The result : GOCR does n’t like the font Monaco :-)
How to ( really ) recover lost commits with Git
Recently I lost a commit again .
This time however , Gitk was not up to date .
I knew I ’d just lost something I would n’t necessarily remember in its entirety .
It was a commit an hour old , touching many files .
And I have a crappy memory .
This time I had to do it the right way .
I found out it ’s really easy ( once you figure it out ) , but I found no really clear explanation anywhere .
So here goes .
Initial setup
If you wanna follow along – and I strongly recommend it – here ’s the boring few steps to create a dummy repo and bring it up to speed with for the rest of this article .
We ’re going to beat the hell out of this repo and it ’s going to be fun .
So just paste the following into a console :
mkdir recovery ;cd recovery git init touch file git add file git commit -m " First commit " echo " Hello World " > file git add .
git commit -m " Greetings " git branch cool_branch git checkout cool_branch echo " What up world ? " > cool_file git add .
git commit -m " Now that was cool " git checkout master echo " What does that mean ? " >>
file
Ok , let ’s look at where we ’re at :
gitk ––all &
The ––all option lets you see all branches at the same time , as well as your stashes .
Click here to enlarge your picture !!1
We can see the cool_branch as well as some yet uncommitted changes over the master branch .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ ls -l total 16 - rw - r--r-- 1 mathieu staff 15B 7 Jun 18:19 cool_file - rw-r--r-- 1 mathieu staff 33B 7 Jun 18:19 file
Got my 2 files , I ’m good to go .
Let ’s make a mistake
Let ’s say I decide I want to bring in these cool changes in master .
I ’ll do it with a rebase .
I know there ’s no big risk of conflicts so that ’s a no-brainer .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git rebase cool_branch file : needs update
Now if you look carefully you ’ll notice I was n’t paying attention when Git gave me a feeble complaint about ‘ file ’ .
Everything ’s well , so I think “ Ok , I do n’t need cool_branch anymore ” .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git branch -d cool_branch error :
The branch ' cool_branch ' is not an ancestor of your current HEAD .
If you are sure you want to delete it , run ' git branch - D cool_branch ' .
Huh ?
Whatever you say , Linus .
Let ’s get on with it .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git branch - D cool_branch Deleted branch cool_branch .
Ahh , it feels good to be a Git ninja .
Now let ’s see where we ’re at and refresh Gitk with F5 .
Oops , my cool commit is gone !
That thing ca n’t be right .
Let ’s panic :
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ ls file [ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git status #
On branch master # Changed but not updated : # ( use " git add < file > ... " to update what will be committed ) # # modified : file # no changes added to commit ( use " git add " and / or " git commit - a " ) [ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git diff diff -- git a / file b/ file index 557db03..f2a8bf3 100644 --- a/ file +++ b/ file @@ - 1 +1,2 @@ Hello World + What does that mean ?
Oh sh!t
So the ‘ file : needs update ’ message back there meant that the rebase did n’t happen , because I had pending changes .
Helpful .
Recovering a lost commit
Since I do n’t think my uncommitted work is complete , I ’ll just stash it instead of committing it .
Then I ’ll hunt down my lost work .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git stash save " Questioning the universe " Saved working directory and index state " On master : Questioning the universe " HEAD is now at 6da726 f ...
Greetings
In the name of paranoïa , let ’s make sure this got in right :
Ok , let ’s get on with our rescue mission :
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git fsck −−lost - found dangling commit 93b0c51cfea8c731aa385109b8e99d19b38a55be
That sounds right , exactly one commit in the lost and found .
Let ’s just make sure :
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git show 93b0c51cfea8c731aa385109b8e99d19b38a55be | mate
Bingo !
Different ways to recover the commit
There are a few different ways to recover that commit .
Obviously we can just copy and paste that snippet , but in the case of a bigger commit , that approach will just amount to a lot of error - prone busywork .
I ’ll reclaim my Git ninja status and try it a few different ways .
Recover it with rebase
Let ’s just replay this change on top of master :
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git rebase 93b0c51cfea8c731aa385109b8e99d19b38a55be
First , rewinding head to replay your work on top of it ... HEAD is now at 93b0c51 ...
Now that was cool Fast - forwarded master to 93b0c51cfea8c731aa385109b8e99d19b38a55be .
Neat !
Now I feel like a ninja worthy of the title again .
So let ’s rewind one commit and try it another way .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git reset -- hard head ^ HEAD is now at 6da726 f ...
Greetings
Ok , the commit ’s gone .
( Do n’t tell anyone but my inner ninja is feeling queasy again . )
Recover it with merge
There are cases where rebase is not powerful enough .
For example when you expect to face a lot of conflicts .
In this case merge is a better solution :
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git merge 93b0c51cfea8c731aa385109b8e99d19b38a55be Updating 6da726f..93b0c51
Fast forward cool_file | 1 + 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 0 deletions ( -) create mode 100644 cool_file
Too easy …
Rewind !
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git reset -- hard head ^ HEAD is now at 6da726 f ...
Greetings
Recover it with cherry - pick
If instead you had a few commits one after another but you just want to pick the last one , rebase and merge wo n’t do .
They would bring the whole branch back in master .
That ’s a situation for cherry - pick .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git cherry - pick 93b0c51cfea8c731aa385109b8e99d19b38a55be
Finished one cherry - pick .
Created commit f443703 : Now that was cool 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 0 deletions ( -) create mode 100644 cool_file
Insane !
This only leaves one open question : WHO ’S YOUR DADDY NOW , GIT ?
Now that we ’ve established the answer to that question , let ’s get back to work !
Let ’s make a second mistake
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git stash clear
Or was it Git stash apply ?
Oh jeez , there we go again …
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git fsck −−lost - found dangling commit 24e3752f7a73ae98b361ce1c260e1f285d653447 dangling commit 93b0c51cfea8c731aa385109b8e99d19b38a55be
Ok , we still see the one we lost earlier , 93b0c51 …
Let ’s look at the other one .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git show 24e3752f7a73ae98b361ce1c260e1f285d653447 commit 24e3752f7a73ae98b361ce1c260e1f285d653447 Merge : 6da726 f... c90f079 ...

On master : Questioning the universe diff -- cc file index 557db03,557db03..f2a8bf3 --- a/ file +++ b/ file @@@ - 1,1 -1,1 +1,2 @@@ Hello World ++ What does that mean ?
Spot on .
Let ’s try something wild , while we ’re here .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git checkout 24e3752f7a73ae98b361ce1c260e1f285d653447 Note : moving to " 24e3752f7a73ae98b361ce1c260e1f285d653447 " which is n't a local branch
If you want to create a new branch from this checkout , you may do so ( now or later ) by using -b with the checkout command again .
Example : git checkout - b < new_branch_name > HEAD is now at 24e3752 ...
On master : Questioning the universe [ email protected ] recovery ( 24e3752 ... ) $
As you may have noticed , my console always indicates which branch I ’m in , so far [ 2 ] .
But now I seem to be in some kind of twilight zone , which Gitk confirms .
Let ’s follow Git ’s suggestion and make that a branch .
[ email protected ] recovery ( 24e3752 ... ) $ git checkout - b recovery Switched to a new branch " recovery " [ email protected ] recovery ( recovery ) $
Looks weird , like stashed items always do , but at least we have our commit .
After fiddling around with what ’s been recovered from the stash , I recommend NOT keeping it as a commit .
If you try to replay the change in the recovery branch over master ’s most recent commit , you lose the “ Questioning the universe ” commit .
Probably because a stash is a weird kind of commit , or maybe because of a bug .
I do n’t know .
( Do n’t follow this one in your console )
[ email protected ] recovery ( recovery ) $ git rebase master # I said do n't do this one First , rewinding head to replay your work on top of it ... HEAD is now at 93b0c51 ...
Now that was cool Nothing to do .
If instead I checkout master and then rebase its last change over the ‘ recovery ’ branch it seems to work .
However since I just saw a commit disappear when rebasing the other way around , I get the feeling that this is n’t a normal commit and it may come back to haunt me later .
Recover it by applying a diff
Let ’s just apply the diff to master .
I ’ll do as if it actually was a substantial commit , involving lots of modifications on lots of files , and apply it automatically with ‘ git apply ’ .
First let ’s visualize where we ’re at , again :
A diff against master is not what we want since master includes a new ( very cool ) commit .
Instead we just want to see the changes introduced by the current commit .
To do this we can compare it with the common ancestor between the master and recovery branches .
So let ’s start by finding it ’s ID .
[ email protected ] recovery ( recovery ) $ git diff 6da726f37683c83947d54314cd32ca1ee9d490e0 diff -- git a / file b/file index 557db03..f2a8bf3 100644 --- a/ file +++ b/ file @@ - 1 +1,2 @@ Hello World + What does that mean ?
Looks good .
Now we throw that diff upstairs .
git diff 6da726f37683c83947d54314cd32ca1ee9d490e0 > ../recovery.diff
Then get apply it to our master branch .
[ email protected ] recovery ( recovery ) $ git checkout master Switched to branch " master " [ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git apply ../recovery.diff
And we finally confirm that everything ’s under control .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git status #
On branch master # Changed but not updated : # ( use " git add < file > ... " to update what will be committed ) # # modified : file # no changes added to commit ( use " git add " and / or " git commit - a " ) [ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git diff diff -- git a / file b/ file index 557db03..f2a8bf3 100644 --- a/ file +++ b/ file @@ - 1 +1,2 @@ Hello World + What does that mean ?
This change was first stashed rather than committed because I felt it was not complete .
Applying it with Git apply only introduces it as an unstaged change , which works perfectly for this situation .
Now I can keep banging at the code until I feel this actually deserves to be committed .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ echo " I do n't know " >> file [ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git commit - a -m " Conversation of staggering depth " Created commit 65a4794 : Conversation of staggering depth 1 files changed , 2 insertions (+ ) , 0 deletions (-)
Cleaning up the crud
Ok , so now I still have this weird looking recovery branch .
Since it ’s now useless we can get rid of it .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git branch -d recovery error :
The branch ' recovery ' is not an ancestor of your current HEAD .
If you are sure you want to delete it , run ' git branch - D recovery ' .
Aha !
This time everything ’s committed correctly , so I know I can delete it for real .
Git is complaining because that commit was not included through its normal merge or rebase commands .
So it warns me that I may be about to lose something .
However I know I got everything through the diff I made and re-applied .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git branch - D recovery Deleted branch recovery .
Now that I ’m aware that commits are reachable even if they ’re not in a branch anymore , I wonder about my repo ’s size .
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git gc Counting objects : 22 , done .
Compressing objects : 100 % ( 14/14 ) , done .
Writing objects : 100 % ( 22/22 ) , done .
Total 22 ( delta 7 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) [ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git prune
Fair enough .
I would expect the unused commits to now be unreachable , but strangely enough :
[ email protected ] recovery ( master ) $ git fsck −−lost - found dangling commit 49ed65 cdea22443af3f1fd400754fe1517421b24 dangling commit 4b1bf4792cba929e88114379d7d5e86a2dc9990f dangling commit 6cdf88318109dede7bd3c1a75be76c7255708ded dangling commit 715a6b2cfe797383216d0f9b04fe8f50e90e779f dangling commit f443703e5060d9f3b4d97504bda5f97e5a0b31e8
If anyone finds out what that ’s all about , please let me know !
Maybe
Git ’s just refusing to do any work unless it ’s going to actually save a considerable amount of space ?
I have no idea .
Conclusion
Once you know how to recover from bad mistakes , you ’ll find that Git is not only a very powerful tool , but also a very forgiving one .
As opposed to a motocross .
The following commands will help you figure you way out of most bad situations :
git show
git fsck −−lost - found
git diff
And these ones will actually get out of these bad situations :
git rebase
git cherry - pick
git merge
git apply
As I think I demonstrated , Git gives you the ability to recover from most bad mistakes .
The fact that any single commit can be cherry - picked , checked out , rebased or merged makes it really easy to recover from hairy situations .
The only case where you might actually lose information is when something has not been committed or stashed yet , which I think is perfectly reasonable .
So if you take only one thing away from this article , let it be this .
Git is much safer than a motocross .

Let the ( Logo ) Games Begin
This Friday , more than 10,000 international athletes will descend upon Beijing , China to compete in the Games of the XXIX Olympiad .
The 17 - day games will feature 302 events across 28 different sports , and will draw an unparalleled number of viewers from television , on - line , and mobile devices worldwide .
The competition will feature the first digital broadcast of the Olympics , and will boast the largest number of host cities , highest number of doping tests and most merchandise - ready mascots ( five ) in Olympic history .
In the spirit of that global competition , I set up a similar challenge among a few players in a space that many SpeakUp readers follow with a passion similar to that of the sports - obsessed : online logo design .
There has been much written , both positive and ( mostly ) negative , regarding the impact of inexpensive online logo design companies on our industry .
The customer testimonials on many logo design sites , crafted to give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside , share numerous success stories of local churches ( et al. ) getting a new logo in just a few days without having to fleece the flock to afford it .
The other end of the argument , of course , speaks to the devaluation of the design process altogether , particularly in brand development and identity design , which many consider the pinnacle of our field .
Diluting a process that traditionally takes weeks or months of research , development , strategy and design down to 2 - 3 business days for a fraction of the fair market value is certainly a cause for concern for working designers everywhere .
But is this really an epidemic poised to shake identity design as we know it to the core , or simply an updated version of the desktop publishing vs. graphic design argument from the late ‘ 80 ’s that caused similar rumblings , and died quickly thereafter ?
I will take a begrudgingly open - minded approach to this challenge to try and answer the previous question , and will defer judgment until the competition ’s results are neatly delivered to my inbox .
The Challenge : Hire four online logo design companies , give them the same visual identity problem to solve , then critique the results .
The Kitty : Spend less than $ 1,000 USD total on all four companies , getting as many distinct variations as possible .
The Players : But how to choose ?
Simply googling logo design returns 11.7 M hits in a mind - boggling .13 seconds .
However , companies that play in this online space must successfully manage their search engine optimization , or SEO , to ensure that they appear at or near the top of search engine results consistently .
Their business development depends upon it .
Acknowledging this , I chose the top four non-sponsored returns from my Google search .
The contestants , in search results order , are : the Logo Loft , Logo Design Pros , LogoBee and the notorious thousand - pound gorilla of online logo companies , Logoworks .
The Task : Invent a fictional client in need of a new logo .
It should be fun , fast , colorful and kick - ass … rollerderby , of course !
It ’s a ‘ sport ’ familiar to most , but not so actively followed by the masses to make for an easy identity job without a modicum of research into the history and aesthetic of what is known in the biz as flat track derby .
I found a rich collection of active clubs on the Women ’s Flat Track Derby Association www site .
There ’s also a great Q & A section on the official rules for rollerderby , which are much more complex than I ever imagined .
e.g. Q : “ When do referees stop the jam - in - progress for a jammerless jam ? ”
No , I ’m not making this stuff up .
The Client : Troy , NY ( id29 ’s hometown ) was one of the original nine cities that in 1871 formed the National Association of Professional Baseball Players , which survives today as Major League Baseball ’s National League .
Although Troy ’s team only lasted two years , they did sport a winning record ( 28 - 25 , ) and I discovered with some amazement that the domain name was available — perfect for my fictional upstart rollerderby team — the Troy Haymakers Flat Track Derby Club .
Let the games begin .
No . 1
The Logo Loft
Representing Montgomery , Alabama USA
$ 99.00
What makes the Logo Loft different ?
According to their site , “ Any logo designer is capable of interpreting and fleshing out your logo design ideas , but what truly sets the Logo Loft and it ’s [ sic ] logo designers apart from the competition is our dedication to your satisfaction …
According to the Graphic Artists Guild you ’ll pay $ 2,000 to $ 10,000 for a corporate logo design at a traditional logo design firm .
With the Logo Loft you save thousands on your new logo design !
Complete corporate identity for only $ 99 . ”
Wow !
Why pay $ 10,000 when you can get the same thing for $ 99 ?
Excited , I pored over the numerous options that the Logo Loft offers as packages : anywhere from one to five designers working on as many as six custom logos .
The more expensive options feature “ unlimited revisions , ” which , as a design firm principal , makes my skin crawl .
Given my budget , I opted for the Logo Loft ’s Starter Package for $ 99 :
One designer , one custom logo design delivered in four business days and , of course , their 100 % satisfaction guarantee .
All of the Logo Loft ’s packages — as well as most of their competitors — promise final electronic file delivery in vector and pixel - based formats , and offer upgrade packages for www design , letterhead , business cards , etc …
The online order process was amazingly simple .
In addition to collecting my credit card info at the start , the Logo Loft asked only a few optional questions such as :
What colors would you like to see in your logo , what colors to avoid and what companies have logos that you like ?
There was a series of checkboxes to select a “ feel ” for my new logo such as high tech , formal / corporate , artsy , industrial , kids , etc … I chose “ other ” and text entered , “ Sports .
Fast paced .
Violent .
Entertaining . ”
For color preferences , I chose ‘ blood red ’ and suggested avoiding pastels .
A no -brainer .
Logo Loft critique : The Logo Loft sent me three slight variations on a single design .
My initial reaction was , “ what is Marvin the Martian doing in my rollerderby logo , and why does he have condoms for feet ? ”
Unfortunately , the illustrated figure floating over the gray tribal ‘ tattoo ’ art is far too masculine for a woman ’s flat track derby club .
The emphasis should be tough * and* feminine .
This is a critical piece of information for this job that I did n’t explicitly disclose during the ‘ client briefing ’ process .
I was interested in seeing how much research these companies would actually do in advance of beginning the design process .
The Women ’s Flat Track Derby Association site is very easy to find online , and the members ’ page links directly to more rollerderby club sites that you would normally want to visit in one sitting .
The color palette of blood red , black and gray feels on target , and the stylized and outlined retro-script face that “ Troy Haymakers ” is set in is both strong and memorable enough to probably do most of the heavy lifting for this mark all on its own .
This text works better in a single arched measure ( version one ) than it does stacked .
The “ Flat Track Derby Club ” text , set underneath in two different weights of Copperplate Gothic does n’t quite integrate with the script , and the tension between the “ D ” in “ Derby ” and the bigger of the two condom feet ( version one ) is visually problematic .
In addition to Troy ’s involvement with the genesis of Major League Baseball , the city was an integral part of America ’s 19th - century Industrial Revolution , particularly in the collar - and cuff - making industries .
Is the inclusion of Frederic Goudy ’s Copperplate Gothic here — which utilizes that Victorian display type aesthetic — a well thought out reference to that rich history ?
I ’m hoping that it is , and I will give the use of that typeface here the benefit of the ( considerable ) doubt and deem it ‘ spot on ’ for this identity .
Well played , Logo Loft !
Variation three is the strongest of the group , focusing on the central typographic elements , and downplaying the illustrations .
Opening this version in Photoshop and erasing the illustrative elements altogether would improve it considerably .
Overall , there are some serviceable typographic parts here , but the conceptual disconnect caused by the tribal art and stylized cartoon character make all three variations weaker as a whole .

Logo Design Pros
Representing Wilmington , Delaware USA
$ 198.00
Logo Design Pros ’ web site is incredibly similar to the Logo Loft , featuring multiple “ 100 % guarantee ” animated bursts and stock photographs of attractive female customer service reps wearing headphone mics poised to help upon mouse over — much like the ubiquitous Mac Warehouse girl from back in the day .
Memories .
What does Logo Design Pros offer above and beyond their competition , you ask ?
How about Unlimited Concepts !
Simply purchase package three for $ 498 , and they will “ provide an unlimited number of entirely new concepts for your logo design , created by other designers , if you are n’t satisfied with the initial concepts . ”
Whoa , they have upped the ante from the Logo Loft ’s “ unlimited revisions ” above .
Unlimited new concepts ?
The image of a hamster endlessly spinning in a wheel immediately comes to mind .
“ Logo Design Pros offers the lowest and cheap [ sic ] prices for custom logos to be found on the net . ”
Unfortunately , I found that statement to be less than believable , as I had to lay down a whopping $ 198 for their least expensive option , the Startup Business Package .
However , for this price I have been promised four logo samples created by two designers .
I chose to be patient and wait the 2 - 3 days as advertised , rather than pay a $ 100 up - charge for 24 hour delivery .
If you thought the requested client information to begin the design process for the Logo Loft was extremely thin , Logo Design Pros has simplified this process even further , requiring only : A name for the logo , a brief description of the business and an optional question , “ what type of overall feeling would you like to project with your new logo ?
( corporate , fun , high - tech , etc … )
Leave this field blank if you would like us to make this determination . ”
The idea that Logo Design Pros could somehow determine the appropriate overall feeling for a new visual identity with only the business name and a brief description seems ludicrous to me , and totally at odds with the idea of offering unlimited concepts .
I think I hear the hamster wheel again .
Sufficiently scared , I throw them a bone , and offer , “ all women , rough , fast - paced , raw , exciting , dynamic , LIVE action ! ”
This is perhaps the shortest client brief in history .
Logo Design Pros critique : Logo Design
Pros hit their deadline , and delivered four versions of my new logo exactly on the third business day after I placed the order .
There was no indication separating the marks between the two designers that were advertised to work on this job , but it was visually obvious that versions one and two were from the same artist .
More like visual ‘ treatments ’ than logos or discrete identities , both remind me of over - stylized clip art and miss the mark entirely by focusing on wafer - thin and leggy fashion models over the rough - and - tumble look that defines rollerderby athletes .
Version one is unusable altogether as it depends on a black background for legibility .
Version two looks like a stock illustration for a débutante ’s ball .
I ’m not sure what the point is of including a detailed close - up or the knock - out version , but it does serve to reinforce the point above about the lack of usability of version one .
The typography is neither inspiring nor memorable , and looks timely ( and already dated ) to my eye .
Versions three and four do a better job of marrying illustration and letterforms in a more traditional ‘ logo design ’ sense .
However , version three seems disjointed with the floating skates below the text , and the illustration bears a striking resemblance to that used in the Minnesota Roller Girls logo — from the simple orange / yellow gradated wordmark and linear helmet to the two black swashes of hair on the left .
Coincidence ?
I certainly hope so .
The fourth version features Adrian Frutiger ’s Univers - Condensed Bold Oblique , usually a solid choice , but a star with stripes and the use of red and blue on a white ground immediately makes me think of a political banner destined for a metal sign holder and a front yard somewhere in November .
Finding suitable images on the internet to use as reference material for illustration purposes is nothing new for designers .
For identity design , where originality and distinctiveness are paramount , this practice can be a slippery slope if done hastily and without care .
To me , the image in version four looks a bit too much like the stock vector roller skate drawn by Gesche Wendebourg available for public download on istockphoto.com .
Convincing me that the yellow stars on the sides of both skates were developed independently of one another might be possible , but would make for a difficult argument .
Not terribly impressive work on the whole from Logo Design Pros in these four variations — but I do have two more to go !
No . 3
LogoBee
Representing Montreal , Quebec , Canada
$ 249.00
Bringing some international buzz to the competition is Montreal ’s LogoBee .
Self - described as a “ multiple award - winning logo design company …
LogoBee , Inc. , has been providing its customers with high quality logo design for over eight years … winning top honors at the Summit Creative Awards and American Design Awards . ”
Following the latter link , I found they did win a second place prize in the 2006 Winter Semi-annual American Design Awards .
The awards page is rather thin on content all around , with no indication what the mark is — or who it is for — but it is well drawn nonetheless .
Can LogoBee bring that level of visual goodness and originality to my upstart rollerderby club ?
After the entries above , I certainly hope so .
LogoBee ’s different packages are easier to understand than most .
The Google link where I originally found LogoBee had a coupon code for $ 20 off , and it worked ( shocker ! )
I selected the “ Special Package ” for $ 249 ( plus save a cool Jackson with the code . )
This package gives me six logo design samples and 6 revisions .
I ’ll have to wait five business days after my payment with LogoBee — not quite as fast as Logo Design Pros ’ 2 - 3 business day guarantee — but hopefully the results will be less “ stock - a- riffic . ”
Immediately after my LogoBee order was placed and my credit card was charged , I got a personal email from Karina , my project coordinator .
Karina gave me her email address and a phone number ( with extension ) and invited me to view some logo samples from their site , noting what I liked about some , but did n’t like about others .
Furthermore , she had some specific questions for me regarding the look and direction I wanted , such as : Who are your clients ?
What is your business ’ history ?
What kind of fonts do you like ?
Would you like something more serious and traditional , or modern and artistic ?
She gave me a personal URL that I could use to view my logo samples when they were ready .
Trying to the keep the playing field level , I responded with the same information I gave the Logo Loft and Logo Design Pros .
LogoBee critique : Like clockwork , my custom URL was populated with 6 variations of brand new Troy Haymakers ’ logos in five business days .
Unlike Logo Design
Pros submissions , the six logos from LogoBee were most likely designed by one staff artist .
I have no problem with that — the package I bought did n’t advertise more than one designer .
However , the majority of the marks feature very similarly styled illustrations of skaters with colored swashes designed to indicate movement and speed .
From the quality of the drawings , it ’s reasonable to assume I did n’t get the same designer who won the American Design Award in 2006 .
Fair enough .
As interchangeable as some of these marks appear , what really struck me in all six was a lack of typographic quality in general .
As an obsessive type - nerd who has aced the Rather Difficult Font Game numerous times , it ’s a rare day when I can look at six separate logotypes and not recognize the primary typeface used in a single one .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen any of these fonts before , and that surprised me .
One easy way to tell cheap ( or free downloadable ) fonts from properly drawn typefaces is by looking at the kerning pairs in use .
Professionally produced faces have had their kerning pairs fined - tuned by font designers .
The huge space in version five between the “ A ” and “ Y ” in “ HAYMAKERS ” is indicative of an inexpensive typeface without font metrics that would normally include character widths and kerning pair information .
Regardless of the origin of the font , that gap should have been optically adjusted by the designer long before I ever saw it .
Typography 101 .
Visually , the symbol used in version five is the most appealing to my eye .
However , it ’s also the least original design on the page .
Based upon the same convention of a silhouetted figure splitting a red and blue field as Major League Baseball ’s and the NBA ’s logos , this illustration also shares a good deal formally with the aforementioned Women ’s Flat Track Derby Association mark .
If I were forced to move forward with any of these designs , it would probably be with a revised version of one of the original illustrations with much improved typography .
Perhaps removing the bratwurst from the right hand of the skater in version four would improve it significantly .
Perhaps not .
Either way , caveat emptor on paying for a logo package that features six discrete variations , especially when four of the six are as interchangeable as these .
No . 4
Logoworks
Representing American Fork , Utah , USA
$ 299.00
If your were even remotely involved in the online design community three years ago , it would have been impossible to ignore the firestorm of blogging brimstone and treacle that was launched at — and defended against by — Logoworks in 2005 .
Rather than retell the entire saga blow - by - blow , I will point you to a few of the existing sites that somehow seemed to weather what I understand was a storm of cease - and - desist letters : here , here and right here .
On April 24 , 2007 , HP announced it had acquired Arteis , “ a privately held company that operates Logoworks , a leading distributed web - based graphic design service provider . ”
This was big news in the blogosphere , as many of Logoworks critics felt this legitimized what they considered less - than - honest business practices regarding authorship in identity design .
Regardless of where your opinions may lie on this subject , Logoworks is the biggest player in this business space , boasting over 100 employees , 45,000 + customers and a 98 percent satisfaction rate on their about us page .
Why choose Logoworks over their competition ?
Here are 10 reasons , including a few comical tidbits from that page I could n’t help but call out :
• The other guys :
Most design companies expect you to go to them for multiple meetings , or they flat out ignore you .
• Then there are ad agencies that require time - consuming live meetings , where you are charged for their time .
• Some design companies are limited to a small in - house design team , or do not have any freelance designers .
If they cannot afford a large team in both areas , they limit their creativity and flexibility .
I direct the small in - house design team here at id29 , and I can say unequivocally that the last statement above could n’t be farther from the truth .
Increasing staff size limits flexibility on almost every level in a design firm , and employing a large global stable of freelancers is a sure way to dilute your design process , not increase your creativity .
As far as our need to actually meet clients face - to - face , we are guilty as charged .
We operate under the somewhat antiquated notion that actually getting to know our clients might help us better understand their communications needs , and , as a result , do a better job defining and articulating their message in an engaging and compelling way .
Crazy , I know .
I ’ve spent $ 526 to date so far in this competition , and in my quest to keep the budget under $ 1000 total , I selected Logoworks ’
$ 299 Silver Package : four original logo concepts , two designers , two logo revisions and zero time - consuming live meetings .
To Logoworks credit , their process for obtaining relevant client information before beginning the design process is much more thorough than their competition .
No doubt being the industry leader has helped them hone this process to a point that minimizes false starts and client complaints , and maximizes their customer satisfaction rate .
That ’s just good business .
Once my payment cleared , I was directed to their “ 7 - question wizard ” which is a well - developed series of web pages created to collect as much information about my visual preferences as possible .
The questions are richly illustrated , and lead the customer through a series of tests , such as : Color wheels designed to gauge preferences , typographic samples which offer different font styles ( serif , sans serif or script , etc … ) and a ‘ logo traits ’ page which asked me to make preferential selections from a series of paired logos , such as Mountain Dew ( youthful ) vs. Coca - Cola ( traditional / classic . )
After about 10 minutes , the “ wizard ” determined my rollerderby club ’s profile to be a “ strong , confident and sophisticated business . ”
Sophisticated ?
Perfect , if I were TAG Heuer or BMW .
Logoworks critique :
Oy !
After investing a solid ten minutes with the wizard , I expected much more from the initial round of marks from Logoworks .
I ’m having a hard time imagining how anyone could defend any aspect of these designs as strong , confident or sophisticated .
After I praised their online briefing process , the designers at Logoworks apparently decided to abandon those survey results altogether .
Version one features a childlike untied roller skate , that would look more at home in Disney / Pixar ’s Cars than it would on the back of a rollerderby uniform .
Version two looks a lot like LogoBee ’s version 5 ( above , ) but not nearly as well drawn .
The use of black is a welcome addition to this convention , but the red - stroked exterior circle effectively kills the dynamic created by the figure ’s negative space extending out of its circular bounds .
Questionable typographic choices in these first two versions are made worse by the wrong hierarchy altogether in the nomenclature .
The emphasis should be placed on “ Troy Haymakers , ” not “ Flat Track Derby . ”
Somebody did n’t get the memo .
Fortunately , versions three and four got the club name correct as “ hierarchy one , ” and “ Troy Haymakers ” is read first .
Unfortunately , versions three and four exist .
Like any Olympic competition , to the victors goes the hardware — however , there ’s no room on the medal platform for Logoworks this time around .
Closing Ceremonies :
There ’s a brilliant interview from 1993 with former NEXT Chairman , Steve Jobs on working with Paul Rand to design the NEXT identity .
Paul Rand was a master of semiotics , and an iconic American identity designer until his death in 1996 .
Jobs asked Rand if he would come up with a few options .
Rand replied , “ No .
I will solve your problem for you , and you will pay me …if you want options , go talk to other people . ”
Jobs goes on to describe the “ refreshing ” clarity with which Rand spoke of the designer - client relationship — it was obvious that he had given this subject deep thought for many years .
It would be unfair to compare the designs above with the work of Paul Rand , but what interested me in the interview was how Rand ’s singular method to solving NEXT ’s identity problem was totally at odds with how these online logo companies approach the same situation .
Rather than focusing on clearly understanding the client ’s business and needs , the general solution put forth seems to be simply providing more and more sketches until something visually clicks — or the client ’s budget is depleted .
For smaller groups or organizations with extremely tight purse strings , these companies might provide some level of solution to their quick identity needs .
They might find themselves redesigning in a year or two , but hopefully they ’ve been successful enough in twelve months time to budget another $ 199 for identity design .
A better approach for businesses in this situation would be to contact their local AIGA chapter , and inquire about freelance designers ( or even student members . )
Sitting down with a graphic designer and outlining your business ’ history , objectives and aspirations usually does n’t take a full - day working session .
For $ 825 — the amount I spent above — a single solution that was original and spoke to my demographic in an engaging and memorable way would be well worth it .
As far as the pending demise of identity design as we know it caused by online logo companies taking over the world , note to working designers currently reading this :
Do n’t quit your day jobs .
Doug Bartow is a founding Principal and the Design Director of id29 , conveniently located above the brewpub on the Hudson River in historic downtown Troy , NY .
id29 has been meeting face - to - face with happy clients since 2003 , and has done identity work for AOL - founder Steve Case , Scholastic ’s Harry Potter , Pitney Bowes and MASS MoCA to name a few .

Why do n't I like football ?
Maybe it 's because I was a timid child and I was made to play it against my will .
Memories of cold , dark autumn afternoons in the 1980s , standing in the corner of a sports field hoping nobody would kick the ball anywhere near me , die hard .
At school , it was immediately clear that I was n't prepared to risk the slightest graze , trip or knee - muddying , let alone an elbow in the stomach or a kick to the shins , in order to obtain the ball or to prevent my arbitrarily appointed opponents from doing precisely what they wanted with it .
I was once briefly put in goal , which was even worse .
" You mean to say that , if somebody kicks the ball hard , I 'm supposed to get in the way of it ? " I felt like asking .
" Why on Earth would I want to do that ? "
I swear it would have taken a modern Premier League - level salary to motivate me to do so .
My only successes as goalie came because I was n't particularly skilled at getting out of the way .
I was like a third post , oscillating wildly between the fixed two , and occasionally ricocheting a shot away despite my best efforts .
As I grew older , I found sports I was willing to play - games like tennis , table tennis and squash , where I was confident enough that I would n't get hurt to be able to make an effort .
But the excluding feeling of " not being sporty " as I huddled around a muddy goalmouth with two or three other swots - I picture us looking a bit like a frightened platoon of Roman soldiers from an Asterix book - comes back to me whenever football is on TV .
Incidentally , I can't imagine how much I 'd hate watching rugby if anyone had made me play that .
As it is , they did n't and I consequently enjoy it - but very much in the way one of that ragged platoon might , on his day off , enjoy watching a Christian being eaten in the Colosseum : it 's a great spectacle but it 's not going to make him find a friend in Jesus .
So , for me and my fellow football - hating former shivering weeds , this should be the best time of year .
It 's bang in the middle of the tiny gap which a bullying pro-football world permits between seasons - a gap made even shorter by Euro 2008 , which we should n't have had to watch anyway because no British teams were playing .
July should provide some respite - even if it 's just a brief pause in the shelling while the enemy bring up more ammunition .
" Why do n't you like football ? " the world has been screaming for the last 10 months .
Surely sometime it has briefly to draw breath ?
But no .
Despite the fact that no matches are being played , football still dominates the press .
And what are they talking about ?
Transfers .
Essentially , " Human Resources " .
So - and - so is reported to be meeting what 's - his - name about a new job .
AN
Other is in talks with thingummy about a move down south .
I mean , what 's next ?
Reports on clubs ' heating bills ?
In - depth analysis of a damp problem in one of the stands at Anfield ?
Even for football - lovers , those who do n't find the game dull and alienating , this transfer guff must still be pretty boring .
So why is it so avidly read ?
Are other sports so hated and inadequate that their actual matches are considered less interesting than football 's behind - the - scenes admin ?
Is football really such a " beautiful game " , such an all - consuming passion for everyone except me and a tiny number of other freaks , that the majority cannot bear to be parted from thoughts of it even for a few weeks ?
If everyone loves it so much , am I being cruel for disparaging it at all , and not accepting its media domination as rightful ?
If so many people genuinely cannot let a day go by without immersing themselves in news of it , then perhaps I should be quiet .
Maybe when there 's such a consensus about something it means that , if I disagree , there 's something wrong with me .
Because I just can't see the appeal .
Football seems maddeningly dull to me .
There are an average , I believe , of just over two goals per Premier League match .
That 's about one event every 40 minutes .
And people say that cricket 's slow !
Even in the dullest
Test match there are the equivalent of six shots at goal every over .
Now I know there 's more to it than that - there must be - but I have watched far more football than any other sport I can't stand , purely because it 's so inescapable , and to me it still looks like it always has : they randomly kick it around and , very occasionally , with little or no warning , a goal happens .
Why am I so blind ?
Is everyone else really as keen as they claim ?
If there are n't millions whose football enthusiasm is a conformist affectation then I am indeed not completely human .
Please tell me it is n't so .
Do n't get me wrong , I do n't think football is evil or should be banned .
I just want to be reassured that disliking it is n't as perverted as disliking sunshine or laughter , or wanting to keep spiders for pets .

The Benefits of Cogeneration
August 19th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
It took me awhile to see the word as CO - generation not COGeneration , and then another few minutes to understand just what cogeneration was , but I finally got there .
And needless to say , I was immediately intrigued by the possibilities , and similarly confused as to the lack of implementation of cogeneration .
Cogeneration , according to the wonderful Wikipedia , is the use of a heat engine or a power station to simultaneously generate both electricity and useful heat .
For example , look at a power station : in its production of our electricity , through the burning of fossil fuels like coal , a power station will often end up excising the generated heat by heating up water , and then venting the steam out through the massive cooling towers .
Imagine the opportunity we have to harness that heat , in addition to the electricity that is created .
This latest train of thought was sparked by an article at Policy Innovations , which looked at how cogeneration can cut carbon and costs .
The authors of the article , Roy Morrison and Pentti Aalto , believe that , in conjunction with heat - pump technology and plug - in vehicles , cogeneration could help see an 80 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions within 10 to 20 years .
Chicago is already making use of cogeneration .
They ’ve committed to produce 1.5 billion kilowatt hours of electricity by 2010 using cogeneration , a process that is 90 % efficient .
Roy Morrison refers to Southern New Hampshire University ’s designs to install a “ … wood gasifier using sawdust to run gas engines that will generate an estimated 2 million kWh of electricity as well as heat the east side of campus . ”
Cogeneration is not a new idea , and has been around for a couple of decades now .
It is used all over the world , and taking yourself on a quick tour through Google will showcase a number of such examples .
But until cogeneration is implemented across a larger and wider variety of installations , real change is not going to happen .
We have the technology , we have working examples , now we just need the drive to make it work .

I do n’t only collect Nazi stuff , I collect objects from all the ‘ axis countries . ’
Also from countries who are n’t even mentioned anymore as former part of the axis .
Like Latvia , Lithuania , Estonia , Finland , Hungary .
OK , in the end , they all said , ‘ We ’re no Nazis ’ when they saw that the Germans were losing it .
But five years before that , they went , ‘ Yeah ! ' ” … I ’ll tell you something about history .
From the beginning of time , the bad guys always had the best uniforms .
Napoleon , the Confederates , the Nazis .
They all had killer uniforms .
I mean , the SS uniform is fucking brilliant !
They were the rock stars of that time .
What you ’re gonna do ?
They just look good .
Do n’t tell me , I ’m a Nazi ’cause I have uniforms .
In 1967 I had my first black girlfriend and a lot of more ever since then .
I just do n’t understand racism , I never thought it was an option .
It ’s not particularly surprising to hear that Motorhead ’s Lemmy Kilmister has a large collection of Nazi paraphernalia .
Umlaut enthusiasts who write songs named “ Killed By Death ” and title their albumsandshould be expected to have an interest in the darker aspects of world history .
That said , there ’s little excuse for wearing a Nazi cap in a photo promoting an upcoming show in a Germany–and thanks to that little whoopsie , the Warted One is now under criminal investigation .
Was Lemmy just making a fashion statement or indulging in “ anti-constitutional propaganda ? ”
According to the Kilmister , it ’s the former , baby !
“ I mean , the SS uniform is fucking brilliant !
They were the rock stars of that time .
What you ’re gonna do ?
They just look good . ”
Hey , a similar sense of futility is what got Germany in trouble the first time , dude .
Ah , the old “ some of my best lays were black ” defense .
Have n’t heard that in a while .

When in doubt , blame the latest technology .
Socrates thought the advent of writing would wreak havoc on the powers of the mind .
Christian theologians denounced the printing press as the work of the devil .
The invention of the telephone was supposed to make letter - writing extinct , and the arrival of the train — and later the car and plane — was going to be the death of community .
Now comes a technological bogeyman for the 21st century , this one responsible for a supposed sharp uptick in American shallowness and credulity : the Internet and its digital spawn .
Witness the wave of books and essays implicating the wired world in a sudden rise in uncritical thinking and attention deficits .
In a recent Atlantic Monthly cover story , Nicholas Carr asks : " Is Google Making Us Stupid ? "
( A : No , but it makes a handy scapegoat for an inability to cope with information overload . )
Lee Siegel 's Against the Machine : Being Human in the Age of the Electronic Mob suggests that the Web makes us both moronic and narcissistic ( not that a moron can be expected to know what a narcissist is ) .
Maggie Jackson 's Distracted : The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age is a tiresome indictment of multitasking .
And in The Dumbest Generation : How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future ( Or , Don't Trust Anyone Under 30 ) , Mark Bauerlein delivers a grim assessment of the state of young minds , rattling off statistics about faltering education and using such figures to buttress his assertion that the Internet , videogames , and IMs all serve to numb and dumb .
To be sure , there is plenty of evidence that ignorance and irrationalism are rampant .
Pernicious fallacies have found a purchase among educated people who ought to know better : Vaccines cause autism , Saddam Hussein was behind the attacks of 9/11 , power lines give you cancer , cell phones kill honeybees , and global warming is a scam orchestrated by tree - hugging liberals .
Yes , it must be acknowledged that the Web provides remarkably easy access to such bogus ideas .
On top of that , there 's the human tendency to seek out information that supports preexisting assumptions , a behavior psychologists have dubbed homophily .
The Web magnifies this echo - chamber effect .
But the latest crop of curmudgeons fail to acknowledge that there is not much new in this parade of the preposterous .
The US has a long and colorful history of being taken in by the erroneous and irrational : Salem witches , the " War of the Worlds " radio broadcast , phrenology , and eugenics are just a few choice examples .
The truth is that Americans often approach information — online and off — with a particular mindset .
" Antirational junk thought has gained social respectability in the United States during the past half century , " notes Susan Jacoby in The Age of American Unreason .
" It has proved resistant to the vast expansion of scientific knowledge that has taken place during the same period . "
Jacoby argues that long - standing American values like rugged individualism and the need to question authority have metastasized into reflexive anti-intellectualism and disdain for " eggheads , " " elites , " and pretty much anyone who might be described as credentialed .
This cancerous irrationalism is n't pretty , but it is n't technology 's fault , either .
On the contrary :
The explosion of knowledge represented by the Internet and abetted by all sorts of digital technologies makes us more productive and gives us the opportunity to become smarter , not dumber .
Think of Wikipedia and its emergent spinoffs , like Wiktionary .
Imperfect as they may be , the collective brainpower contained within these kinds of sites — and the hunger for learning and accurate information they represent — is something human history has never known before .
( Even Encyclopedia Britannica will soon be accepting user contributions . )
Or consider the Public Library of Science :
By breaking the publishing industry 's choke hold on the circulation of scientific information , this powerful online resource arms scientists and the masses alike with the same data , accelerating new discoveries and breakthroughs .
Not exactly the kind of effect one would expect from a technology that 's threatening to turn us into philistines .
It 's naive to think that the digital age will magically remedy stupidity .
We need better schools as well as a renewed commitment to reason and scientific rigor so that people can distinguish knowledge from garbage .
The Web is not an obstacle in this project .
It 's an unparalleled tool for generating , finding , and sharing sound information .
What 's moronic is to assume that it hurts us more than it helps .

Do you work out at the gym ?
Do you live near a beach and want to listen to your favorite audiobook while walking ?
Then you ’ll want some wireless headphones to avoid having to place wires all around your body .
Wireless headphones today are waterproof and allow you to make phone calls or checking the weather simply by saying a command .
Here ’s everything you need to know about the world ’s best headphones .
1. Apple Airpods Pro
Apple Airpods
Pro are great if you have a computer like a MacBook Pro 16 inch or an iPhone 11 .
With Siri built - in , you can operate your Apple devices simply by asking for Siri and asking it the latest news , the temperature outside or you can even get Siri to answer emails for you .
Airpods
Pro have a noise - canceling feature that normal Airpods do n’t which means you can truly block out the outside world .
They are also splash - proof so if you drop them in water it wo n’t matter and you can continue to listen to your Airpods Pro even if it begins to rain .
The cons to the Airpods Pro are that you could run the battery out pretty easily – within 12 months in some cases – and you cannot replace it .
Instead , you would need to buy a whole new set of AirPods .
You would not be covered under warranty .
If you ’re looking for an alternative to Airpods then you could consider BlackPods Pro which many consider the best bass wireless headphones at the moment .
2. Beats Noise Cancelling Headphones 700
Where Airpods are discreet , Beats Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 go for comfort .
They fit snugly over the ear and mean you can rest easy knowing they will never fall out as you go for your morning run .
They have 20 hours of battery life and come with the solid noise canceling feature to ensure you are left in peace and your own little world .
With a price tag at double the Airpods Pro , you are going to be spending a lot and will need to establish whether the additional quality and bulkiness are worth it .
3. EarFun Free
These headphones come with Bluetooth 5.0 for lightning - fast connection and USB-C and wireless charging .
They are even waterproof making them a great all - rounder .
Where these earphones are lacking is in quality .
You wo n’t get the quality of sound that you would do in a more well - known brand such as the Airpods or Beats headphones .
The World ’s Best Headphones ?
Depends On You
So what are the world ’s best headphones ?
There is no right answer , this depends on your individual needs and your budget .
If you care more about features and having your headphones connected up to your devices then getting yourself some Apple AirPods Pro could be a great match .
You can listen to audiobooks , hear the news , and reply to emails all from the comfort of your ear , without having to lift a finger .
If , however , you want headphones that are bulkier and feel nicer around the ears that also have a great sound quality then some Beats Noise Cancelling Headphones are for you .

The 100 Best SNES Games Ever On September 30 , 2006 , I unveiled my pet project to the world : A list of the 100 best NES games ever .
The list was n't perfect - lists never are - but the reception was generally warm .
At the very least , it was warm enough to warrant a sequel .
So now here we are , fourteen months later .
It has now been three full years since the launch of SydLexia.com , and I figured there 's no better way to celebrate than with a list of 100 best SNES games ever .
Real fucking creative , I know .
I had wanted to do a list of the best Game Boy titles ever , but the preliminary meetings did n't go well .
There was this whole huge argument about whether or not the list should be just original Game Boy games or if Game Boy Color games counted as well .
Then one guy kept saying we should include Game Boy Advance games because he was born in 1991 and he had no idea what this " Super Mario Land " thing that everyone kept bringing up was .
Then someone pointed out to him that he could have looked it up on Wikipedia instead of whining that he did n't know what it was .
Punches were thrown , blood was spilled , and everyone accused at least one other person of being gay .
So then I did what any self - respecting American would do in my situation : I gave up on my dream and decided to attempt something significantly easier .
Thus , the SNES list was born .
I could n't undertake a project of this magnitude on my own , so a team of expert voters was assembled to help create the master list .
Some of those people worked on the original list , some of them were newcomers .
After everyone 's picks were ranked and filed , everything was ready to go .
Well , almost .
Not everyone who was involved in the voting process was available to comment on the final version of the list , while others were n't invited to comment due to their inability to successfully find the Shift button on their keyboards .
So instead , I assembled an elite team of people who I personally think are awesome to comment on the list .
They are : greeneyedzeke of 2D - sprites .
His comments appear in green .
Valdronius of SydLexia.com .
His comments appear in cyan .
Murdar Machene of BiteMeDumpy.com .
His comments appear in dark green .
Douche McCallister of [??? ] .
His comments appear in yellow .
DarkMaze of Dark Maze Studios and Press Start .
His comments appear in red .
Knyte of Knyte 's Video Game Museum .
His comments appear in blue .
My comments appear in white .
The rules for voting were the same as they were with the NES list .
Each player picked 100 games and ranked them from 1 - 100 , with 1 being their top pick and 100 being their lowest .
In order to be eligible for inclusion a game had to be available in North America and have received a commercial release .
Therefore games such as Final Fantasy V , which was only released in Japan , and Steven Seagal Is The Final Option , which was never officially released , were not valid picks .
Players were also required to vote on a game based on its merits as a Super NES game .
So classic games such as Mortal Kombat and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Turtles In Time which debuted in the arcade and had to be altered for the SNES hardware will not necessarily appear on this list .
This list also has some known limitations .
None of us have played every single game released for the SNES in North America , but I have come fairly close in recent years .
Since we all voted for games they actually played , the list is somewhat biased in favor of the types of games that each of us personally favored .
Here are some of the known biases :
We favor platformers .
We heavily favor RPGs , and I DON'T mean rocket - propelled grenades .
Actually , I think we can all agree that rocket - propelled grenades are pretty fucking sweet .
If you or any of your family members are currently fighting in Iraq , I apologize for the previous statement .
It was insensitive .
We do n't have a lot of love for sports games .
Sorry Madden '93 .
We do n't seem to like puzzle games either .
Valdronius tried to vote for a bunch of fan - made hentai games .
He 's kind of a dick .
I said this when I did the NES list , and I 'll say it again now : it is nigh impossible to come up with a Top 100 list that satisfies everyone 's sensibilities .
I have no illusions that this list is anywhere near perfect .
There are some omissions that disappoint me and some inclusions that disgust me .
So if you think you can do better , go for it .
Otherwise , shut the fuck up and enjoy this article for what it is : a look at 100 SNES games that are worth playing .

CLICK HERE TO BEGIN !!!
The rumors are true .
The Federal Drug Enforcement Agency is sending 200 agents to Northern Humboldt to crack down on marijuana growers , according to sources .
The full - blown bust - a- thon will take place June 22 -30 .
300 houses have already been targeted by way of high electric bills .
Perhaps our readers at PG&E can tell us to how the feds got those records .
Did they use warrants or just ask nicely ?
Rumors that every room at the Eureka Red Lion has been booked between June 23 - 30 may also have legs .
One industrious Craig ’s List user consulted hotels.com in attempt to book rooms for those dates but the website said no rooms are available during that time .
The federal government does n’t recognize proposition 215 — the Compassionate Use Act — passed by California voters in 1996 , which legalized marijuana for medical purposes .
Arcata grow houses made national news recently with reports in the LA Times , NY Times and Fox News .
The issue also came up repeatedly during the 3rd District Supervisor race .
While some of the upcoming busts will target illegal operations under California law , others will take aim at patients protected by Prop.
215 . Will Humboldt County Sheriffs or city police participate in raids that violate laws of the state ?
We ’ll know the answer in seven days .
UPDATE : More info at Humboldt County News .
They write “ Rumors were circulating a couple weeks back that the feds were going to raid dispensaries in Arcata , and as a result all but one of those facilities did not open for business on Friday , June 6 . ”
Those rumors turned out to be false .
While the creatures that scare humans most are usually large , it is the smallest that are probably the most dangerous and painful .
While we can be thankful that most of us will not experience the suffering caused by the creatures on this list , many people do every year .
This is not a list of the most deadly , but rather the most dangerous or painful creatures .
The list excludes creatures from the sea .
9 Ticks
Ticks are second only to Mosquitoes for their disease spreading properties .
Ticks feed on blood and attach themselves to other animals ( including humans ) .
They can be difficult to remove and removal must be done carefully as they can leave part of their head behind causing serious infection .
According to Wikipedia , hard ticks can transmit human diseases such as Lyme disease , Rocky Mountain spotted fever , tularemia , equine encephalitis , Colorado tick fever , African Tick Bite Fever , and several forms of ehrlichiosis .
8 Tarantula Hawk
Tarantula hawks are named for the fact that they hunt tarantulas as food for their larvae .
It ’s sting is rated as one of the most painful in the world ( though not as painful as the bullet ant ) .
One researcher described the sting as causing “ [ … ] immediate , excruciating pain that simply shuts down one ’s ability to do anything , except , perhaps , scream .
Mental discipline simply does not work in these situations . ”
The Tarantula Hawk is the official state insect of New Mexico .
7 Tsetse Fly
A large biting fly fom Africa that feeds on the blood of vertebrate animals .
They are known to cause Sleeping Sickness in humans and Nagana in cattle .
Sleeping sickness is a parasitic disease in people and animals that is caused by Trypanosoma , a protozoa transmitted by the tsetse fly .
The symptoms for sleeping sickness begin with fever and headache then a swell on the back of the neck .
Afterwards , the victim may experience daytime slumber and insomnia .
It could lead to death afterwards .
6 Africanized Bees
Also called killer bees , are descendants of 26 Tanzanian queen bees that bred with other species after they were accidentally released from a hive in Brazil .
What makes the bees deadly is their defensive nature and tendency to swarm .
Also , they tend to follow victims even when already far from the hive .
This aggressiveness when attacking potential threats ensure a very painful death for the victim .
The venom that they secrete , however , is just as potent as a honey bee’s .
5 Deathstalker
A species of scorpion that is highly dangerous because of its venom .
The venom is actually a powerful mixture of neurotoxins .
Although , the poison would not kill a healthy adult , it could be fatal to kids and the elderly .
Ironically , a component of the venom ( peptide chlorotoxin ) has the potential to cure human brain tumors while the other toxins may help against diabetes .
4 Black Widow
One of the most well - known spiders , especially because its venom could be fatal to humans .
The venom is said to be more potent than that of rattlesnakes , however , their size and the amount secreted reduce its effectiveness .
Both male and female have an hourglass shaped marking underneath their abdomen .
The females are relatively larger than the males and contrary to popular belief , the females rarely eat the males after mating .
3 Army Ants
While not dangerous on their own , these ants live and travel in swarms .
They are found mostly in Africa and Asia and they build temporary anthills while traveling .
The greatest risk these ants pose to humans is when they are swarming through homes .
When food supplies are low , these ants will swarm in sizes of up to 50 million single ants .
There are reports of humans – usually young or infirm being killed through suffocation ( the ants will often enter the lungs of the person ) and be entirely consumed .
Their mandibles are so strong that in some parts of Africa they are used individually as emergency sutures when medical supplies are not available .
2 Bullet Ant
A bite from a Bullet ant will not kill you , but you will never forget it .
The Bullet ant ( thus named because a bite feels like being shot ) inflicts the most painful bite of any creature known to man .
It is number one on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index where it is described as causing “ waves of burning , throbbing , all - consuming pain that continues unabated for up to 24 hours ” .
1 Anopheles Mosquitoes
Deemed the most dangerous creature on Earth .
This mosquito causes more than 300 million cases of malaria annually , which results in between 1 to 3 million deaths .
They can also carry dengue , elephantiasis , and yellow fever .
They are usually active during the nightime so one way to protect yourself is to apply insect - repellents and wear longer sleeves .

Tim points out that this massage chair , seen at Sharper Image , looks really familiar .
You know , we think he 's right , but we can't quite get a grasp on it .
We just hope they keep on selling these things even after their stores close - you know , for the human touch .
Seriously , it 's like on the tip of our tongue .
What is this thing ?
It 's gotta be staring us right in the eye .

Massive US deficit spells austerity policy for next administration
By Jerry White
30 July 2008
The Bush administration this week predicted that the US budget deficit will hit a record $ 482 billion in 2009 .
This means that the next president , whether Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain , will follow a policy of unprecedented austerity , including gutting entitlement programs , such as Medicare and Social Security .
Although the deficit figure is $ 74 billion higher than what the White House predicted just two months ago , it is widely acknowledged that it severely underestimates the real scope of the coming shortfall .
The amount announced by White House budget director Jim Nussle includes only $ 70 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — which could cost at least three times as much .
Moreover , the estimate ignores the $ 100 billion — or hundreds of billions , which could be the eventual cost — being allocated for the Treasury Department ’s rescue of the mortgage finance companies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The estimate was based on projections of better - than - expected economic growth , corporate tax revenues , unemployment and inflation estimates and a slowing down of the fall in housing prices .
These were quickly discredited by news that real estate prices had fallen by a record 15.8 percent in 20 major US cities over the past year .
The same day that the White House released the estimate , Merrill Lynch was forced to write - down $ 5.7 billion in mortgage - backed assets and was essentially bailed out by investors from Singapore .
“ That ’s not the real number , ” former Bush Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill said of the deficit in a comment cited in the Washington Post .
“ It ’s upward of $ 500 billion and counting .
It ’s a mind - boggling number . ”
This staggering rise in government indebtedness — which has more than doubled in the current 2008 fiscal year to $ 389 billion , from $ 162 billion in 2007 and will be nearly half a trillion in 2009 — further undermines the international creditworthiness of the US and places even greater downward pressure on the US dollar .
According to the New York Times , “ When Mr. Bush took office , he predicted that federal debt held by the public — the amount borrowed by the government to pay for past deficits — would shrink to just 8 percent of the gross domestic product in 2009 .
He now estimates that it will amount to 40 percent . ”
There is an overwhelming consensus in the economic and political establishment that ordinary Americans will have to pay for the crisis of American capitalism and a budget deficit that has been fueled by massive war spending , tax cuts for the wealthy and the provision of unlimited public resources to bail out major financial institutions .
“ This is going to make it extraordinarily difficult for whoever ’s going to become president , ” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( Democrat - North Dakota ) told the Washington Post .
“ I do n’t care who the president is — when they come and meet with their secretary of the Treasury , the Federal Reserve chairman , their top economists , it will be a sobering moment . ”
If he wins the November elections , whatever minimal spending proposals Barack Obama has made during the campaign — including his so - called universal health care plan , tax credits for middle and low - income families and miniscule increases in infrastructure spending — will quickly be shelved in the name of “ fiscal responsibility . ”
Moreover , the political groundwork for major cutbacks in vital social services is already being laid .
In their reports on the budget deficit , both the New York Times and the Washington Post complained of “ fiscal pressures ” due to the growing Medicare and Social Security costs — a thinly veiled suggestion that the next president will have no choice but to gut these programs , upon which tens of millions of seniors depend for income and health care .
Nowhere is there a suggestion that military spending — which at nearly $ 700 billion consumes well over half of the US government ’s discretionary spending and is more than the rest of the world ’s military spending combined — should be cut , let alone eliminated .
For his part , Obama has pledged to expand the military by nearly 100,000 soldiers and marines and increase spending .
Given the costs of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as new weapons systems , “ It ’s hard to see how we could spend less on the military in the near term , ” Richard Danzig , a former Navy secretary who advises Obama on national security , told Reuters in an interview last week .
While McCain calls for the extension of Bush ’s tax cuts for the rich , Obama would only raise the top tax rates to the levels that existed under the Clinton administration — to 36 percent and 39.6 percent , from the current 33 percent and 35 percent .
He has repeatedly rejected any return to higher tax rates on the wealthy as “ confiscatory ” and has told the Wall Street Journal he would also consider cutting corporate taxes .
On Monday , Obama held a Washington meeting with leading figures from corporate America and both Democratic and Republican parties .
These included billionaire financier Warren Buffett , the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase , PepsiCo and Google , as well as Bush ’s former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill , now a special advisor to the private equity firm Blackstone Group .
Also participating were top Obama economic advisors Robert Rubin , chairman of Citigroup and Clinton ’s former treasury secretary , and Paul Volcker , who served as Federal Reserve chairman under the Carter and Reagan administrations .
Ruben played a decisive role in the deregulation of the financial markets that helped create the mortgage and real estate bubble and made billions for wealthy speculators .
Volcker spearheaded the attack on the working class in the early 1980s by driving up interest rates to record levels and deliberately provoking the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s in order to use unemployment as a hammer to drive down wages and living standards .
With bureaucrats from the AFL - CIO and Change to Win union federations present to perpetuate the fraud that Obama speaks for the interests of workers , the Democratic presidential candidate said , “ There were some irresponsible decisions that were made on Wall Street and in Washington .
In the past few years , I think we learned an essential truth that in the long run we can’t have a thriving Wall Street if we do n’t have a thriving Main Street . ”
Bipartisan measures were needed , he said , to “ stabilize financial markets ” and encourage entrepreneurship and the free market .
On Tuesday , Obama held discussions with current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Bush ’s Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , where he signaled support for the government ’s bailout of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
While unlimited public funds are being made available to bail out wealthy investors , there will be no relief for masses of working people in the US facing layoffs , home foreclosures , unsustainable levels of personal debt , declining wages and skyrocketing prices for basic necessities .
Once again , both parties will use the lie that there is “ no money ” to meet social needs , while hundreds of billions are squandered on imperialist wars and channeled into the pockets of the wealthiest one percent of the population .
This guarantees that under the next administration , the working class occupants of “ Main Street ” will continue to face unprecedented levels of social distress and economic insecurity , while the country ’s infrastructure — its roads , schools , bridges and public services — continue to crumble from neglect
Meeting the basic needs of the population — for decent paying jobs , high quality health care and education and affordable housing — requires a complete reorganization of economic life .
Social and political priorities must be turned inside out , rejecting the anarchic prerogatives of the capitalist market and placing the needs of working people first .
This underscores the need for a break with the Democratic and Republican parties and the building of a mass political movement of the working class based on a socialist alternative to the profit system .
There is a chemistry experiment happening in Cleveland -- a project so volatile that it can last for only the 2008 season .
The subjects are Derek Anderson and Brady Quinn , two talented quarterbacks under the age of 25 .
The problem is only one can sit in the cockpit of one of the NFL 's most exciting offenses , which includes Pro Bowlers Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow and a stellar offensive line .
The chemist is Cleveland Browns general manager Phil Savage , who decided this offseason that it was more important to keep both quarterbacks than accept draft picks to strengthen other positions .
The decision has drawn more ire than praise in Northeast Ohio .
There is a saying that behind NBA star LeBron James , the backup quarterback is the most popular athlete in town , and without a doubt , Quinn is the people 's choice in Cleveland .
Quinn 's Golden Boy image screams franchise quarterback .
He was a first - round pick , has a deep pedigree from Notre Dame and is one of their own , born in Columbus , Ohio , about 120 miles south .
Quinn 's jersey is the top seller in Cleveland , and he has yet to start a game .
It 's a popularity contest Anderson will never win , not even with his 3,787 yards , 29 touchdowns and spot in the Pro Bowl this past season .
He was even booed at home when returning from injury in the Browns ' season finale , because it took Quinn off the field in his only action last season .
" Derek has played over 1,000 snaps , and there 's still people that have doubts outside of our building , " Savage said .
" Brady 's played 10 snaps , and people are convinced that he 's the guy .
It 's really kind of illogical . "
This type of experiment has been done before .
From 2004 to 2005 , the San Diego Chargers delicately balanced their quarterback tandem of Philip Rivers and Drew Brees .
Both were high draft picks and starting - caliber quarterbacks , but only one could see the field on Sundays .
Brees played well for the Chargers .
In his last two seasons with them , he led the team to 21 victories and a 2004 playoff berth .
But after sitting its first - round pick for two seasons , the organization had to choose between the two and went with Rivers .
Brees in turn signed a long - term deal with the New Orleans Saints .
" All I know is we had talented quarterbacks and in time we addressed it , " Chargers general manager A.J. Smith said .
" [ The Browns ] are in the exact same boat .
They 're pretty comfortable with the talent they have there right now , and they 'll worry about next year next year . "
Smith understands what Savage is going through because he faced similar pressure , but he believes the Browns made the right move in re-signing Anderson .
Quarterback injuries " can happen in a second , " Smith says , and the Browns were able to protect themselves without making a long - term commitment .
Anderson signed a three - year contract worth $ 24 million on Feb. 29 .
" They rest will take care of itself , " Smith said .
" It could take care of itself through performance .
It can take care of itself through injury .
It can take care of itself through contract situations they might not be comfortable with . "
Indeed , both contracts indicate Savage will have to split the two quarterbacks after this season .
Anderson is due a guaranteed roster bonus of $ 5 million in March 2009 , and it 's unlikely the Browns will pay it unless they are convinced he is the long - term solution .
Meanwhile , the longer Anderson plays , the more money Quinn loses in his incentive - laden , five - year deal .
If Quinn does n't see the field , he will be one of the NFL 's lowest - paid quarterbacks this season .
Cleveland is paying Quinn the second - year league minimum of $ 370,000 in 2008 .
His salary could increase to $ 1.693 million if he plays 45 percent of the snaps , but that 's unlikely , unless Anderson falters or is injured .
Including all incentives , the maximum value of Quinn 's deal was $ 30 million .
But if Quinn continues at this pace without playing time , he will end up making just less than $ 8 million over five years -- a difference of $ 22 million .
Quinn received most of his guaranteed money in March when the Browns paid him a $ 4.255 million option bonus .
" It 's a great situation for the team , " Savage said of having both quarterbacks .
" It 's not so hot for Brady Quinn , because only one of them can play at a time . "
For now , Savage 's influence has prevented Quinn and super - agent Tom Condon from demanding a trade .
But rest assured , the player and his agent will not sit idle for a third straight year .
" Dr. Phil " has done an impressive job of massaging the egos of both quarterbacks and their representation .
Savage and the coaching staff convinced Anderson to re-sign with the Browns by giving him their backing to be their starter in 2008 .
Savage in turn has consoled Quinn and Condon that the team remains high on the second - year quarterback .
It 's a diplomatic high - wire act that Savage walks every day in his own building .
Money eventually will end this chemistry experiment .
But not until Savage and the Browns find out which quarterback is the right fit for their team .

On Launch Pad 39A at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center , STS - 124 mission specialist Akihiko Hoshide sits in his seat aboard space shuttle Discovery following the simulated launch countdown for the May 31 , 2008 launch of Japan 's Kibo lab to the ISS .
WhenJapanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide launches spaceward aboard NASA ?s shuttleDiscovery on Saturday , he will help carry his country ?s hopes - literally - into orbit .
Hoshide andsix crewmates are preparing to haul Japan ? s$ 1 billion laboratory Kibo ( which means ?
Hope ? in Japanese ) to the InternationalSpace Station .
The module , a massive orbital room the size of a large tour bus , will be the station ?s largest laboratory once installed .
? It ?s goingto be a great mission and it ? s very exciting , especially for the Japanesefolks , ?
Hoshide , 39 , said Wednesday after arriving with crewmates atNASA ?s Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) spaceport in Cape Canaveral , Fla .
Commandedby veteran U.S. spaceflyer Mark Kelly , Discovery and its Kibo lab cargo are setto lift off Saturday at 5:02 p.m. EDT ( 2102 GMT ) from their seaside launchpad at KSC .
Hoshide , Kelly and their crewmates plan to deliver Kibo duringthree spacewalks , perform station maintenance and swap out a member of theoutpost ? s three - man crew during their 14 - day mission .
? I am veryexcited , and also very privileged , to be on this team , ? said Hoshide , who ismaking his first spaceflight with Discovery ?s STS - 124 mission .
?
I am veryconfident we ?re going to get this mission done successfully .?
ForHoshide , the trip to space began while he was a child living in New Jersey in1968 , when his father took him on a trip to NASA ?s Florida spaceport , where hewas awed by the size of the agency ? s
Saturn V moon rockets and drawn to sciencefiction like ?
Star Trek ? and ?
Star Wars .?
? That had ahuge impact , ?
he said in a NASA interview .
?
All that influenced me and by thetime I was probably 10 , you know , I was set for space .?
Born inTokyo , Hoshide is married and holds degrees in mechanical and aerospaceengineering .
He joined what is now the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) in 1992 and was selected to join the country ?s astronaut corps in 1999 .
He is rated to serve as a flight engineer aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft .
? I amlooking forward to probably a long - duration mission after this flight , ?
Hoshidetold reporters .
?
I think that ?s the plan for the Japanese space agency to haveeveryone ready and lined up for a long - duration mission so we can get some utilizationof the Kibo module done .?
But first , Kibo must reach the space station .
Flyingbit by bit
Launchingaboard Discovery with Hoshide is Kibo?s robotic - arm equipped pressurized laboratory , a hollow cylinder nearly 37 feet ( 11 meters ) long and about 14.4 feet ( 4.4meters ) wide .
Hoshide will use the space station ?s robotic arm to attach the Kibo lab to an open port - side berth near the front of the outpost .
It is thesecond of three segments that will make up the 15.9 - ton Kibo facility andfollows an attic - likestorage room delivered by shuttle astronauts earlier this year .
Astronautsplan to move the storage module from a temporary berth to its permanent homeatop the main Kibo module during Discovery ?s STS - 124 mission .
Anexternal , porch - likeplatform will complete the Kibo lab once it launches next year , with asmall airlock in the main module allowing astronauts to swap out experiments asneeded .
? I thinkthe Kibo module will have a uniqueness once we get the exposed platforminstalled , ?
Hoshide said .
Kibo isdesigned for a 10 - year mission lifetime , though NASA and the U.S. have not yetdecided whether to extend their involvement in the space station project beyonda planned 2014 end date .
? We dostill need help from the U.S. side for the core portion of the space station , ?Hoshide said .
? I? m hoping that it will be resolved in some way .?
Japaneseresearchers are planning a host of materials science and life scienceexperiments for Kibo , with JAXA officials developing a homegrown cargo ship - the H - 2 Transfer Vehicle - to supply the laboratory and station as a whole .
? I hope the Japanese science community will further be engaged in space exploration and wecan accomplish a lot of scientific activities , ?
Hoshide said of Kibo ?s impact .?
But more than that , I think that it would expand the possibility on orbit , especially for the Japanese community .
So that is my hope .?
Hoshide isexpected to open the Kibo lab in a ceremony , but how he will commemorate theevent is still a mystery .
? I guessI ?ll probably have to make a speech , ?
Hoshide said with a smile .
?
But I ?m stillthinking about what to say .?

Why your internet experience is slow
Here is a random - ish URL from Salon.com , a not too unusual online magazine : http://www.salon.com/tech/col/smith/2008/05/09/askthepilot276/.
This HTML page contains the first chunk of a piece of journalism by Patrick Smith ; the actual body copy runs to approximately 950 words of text .
The average word in English is 5.5 characters long ; add 1 character for punctuation or whitespace and we would reasonably expect this file to be on the close order of 6.5 Kb in size .
( Patrick , if you 're reading this , I am not picking on you ; I just decided to do some digging when I got annoyed by how long my browser was taking to load your words . )
In actual fact , the web page my browser was downloading turned out to be 68.4Kb in size .
The bulk of the extra content consists of HTML tags and links .
It 's difficult to say how much cruft there is — much of it is Javascript , and I used a non-Javascript web browser for some of this analysis — but a naive dump of the content reveals 128 URLs .
So , we now have an order of magnitude bloat , courtesy of the salon.com content management system adding in links and other cruft .
But that 's just the text , and as we all know , no web page is complete without an animated GIF image .
So how big is this article , really ?
I stared at it for some time while it loaded over a 10 mbps cable modem connection .
Then I switched off my browser anti-advertising plugins ( AbBlock and NoScript ) , hit " reload " , and then saved the web page .
Inline in the page are : 4 JPEG images , 4 Shockwave FLASH animations , 4 PNG images , 8 GIF images ( of which no less than five are single - pixel web bugs ) , 4 HTML sub - documents , 6 CSS ( style sheet ) files , 22 separate Javascript files ... and a bunch of other crap .
The grand total of extras comes to 860 Kb by dry weight , meaning that in order to read 950 words by Patrick Smith my cable modem had to pull in 948Kb , of which 942Kb was in no way related to the stuff I wanted to actually read .
With AdBlock and Noscript switched back on , the cruft dropped off considerably , but not completely — the core HTML file squished down to 52 Kb ( after a bunch of Javascript extensions failed to load ) and the hairball of advertising cruft dropped from 62 to 41 included files , for a grand total of 372Kb of crap ( from 840 Kb ) .
Finally , I updated my /etc / hosts file to include this blacklist of advertising sites , redirecting all requests for objects hosted on them into the bit bucket : the final download came to 40Kb of HTML in the main file and 208Kb of unwanted crap .
Let me put this in perspective :
This is a novel in HTML , with three small image files ( totaling about 10 Kb ) .
" Accelerando " runs to 145,000 words ; it fits in about 400 pages , typeset as a book , using very small print .
It is 949Kb in size , or about 10 Kb larger than a Salon.com feature containing 950 - odd words .
Here 's another novel , available for download in HTML .
" Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom " runs to 328Kb in HTML ; it 's about 180 pages in book form , and it 's still 40 Kb smaller than the hairball you get from Salon.com after you switch AdBlock and NoScript on .
If content is king , why is there so little of it on the web ?
And why are content providers like Salon always whining about their huge bandwidth costs , given that 99 % of what they ship — and that is an exact measurement , not hyperbole — is spam ?
( Note : these are rhetorical questions .
Despite the burning certainty that someone on the internet is wrong , you do n't need to try and explain how the advertising industry works to me .
Really and truly .
I 'm just taking my sense of indignation for a Sunday walk . )

@szrimaging : Oh dude .... come to Houston ... freeway construction 24hrs a day 365 days a year ... NO JOKE !
I can't ever remember a day in my 10 + years in this city that there was not a major freeway being worked on .
But at least they are n't replacing your FREEways with TOLLways
( My anguishing and piercing gaze is upon you TXDOT and Harris County )
Each year , more than one trillion photos are captured across the globe .
Thanks to smartphones , we are never far from a camera and can easily capture important memories .
But , what do you actually do with all those photos sitting on your phone ?
Do n’t let them just sit in your phone storage .
If your phone breaks or your data is cleared , you could lose all of your photos in seconds .
Start preserving those memories by doing something with your photos .
Keep reading to discover creative ways to get your stunning vacation photos off your phone .
1. Create a Photo Book
In previous years , parents would spend hours laying out scrapbooks to preserve precious family moments .
This involved developing rolls of film , choosing the perfect images , and using stickers or borders to complete the pages .
But , when digital photos came around , that time - consuming practice fell to the wayside .
But , thanks to technology , you can now create photo books online and have them delivered straight to your door .
Start by finding an online photo book retailer .
Then , choose the vacation pictures you want to see in print .
If you have a lot of photos , that does n’t mean you need to have a never - ending photo book .
Instead , use online photo collage templates to fit multiple photographs onto one page without sacrificing aesthetics .
Once you ’ve narrowed down your photos , it ’s as simple as dragging and dropping them into the photo book template .
Once you ’re happy with your layout , complete the book and pay for your order .
Then , when it ’s delivered , find a place in your home to proudly display your memories .
2. Make a Vacation Video
Like scrapbooks , the family video is a family tradition that is n’t as popular as it once was .
Instead , our memories are captured in second - long videos that are uploaded to social media and quickly forgotten about .
But , if you ’re wondering what to do with travel photos , combine them into a vacation video .
Start by gathering all your photos and short videos from your vacation .
Ask other family members and friends who traveled with you to contribute their own content too .
Then , use a video editing tool to combine everything together .
Add a royalty - free song to the background to complete the video .
Then , make sure to upload it to social media and transfer it onto a CD or DVD to safely store it .
3. Start a Travel Blog
The last thing to consider for vacation picture ideas is to start a travel blog .
There are many free blogging sites that allow you to upload your own photos and written copy .
This allows you to write about your trip and use your favorite photos or videos to add to your content .
The great thing about a travel blog is that you can add to the website after each vacation .
The memories remain online and you can revisit your favorite memories from any device at any time .
Once Your Vacation Photos Are Sorted , Move Onto the Rest of Your Photos
Using these ideas , you can preserve your vacation photos for years to come .
But , do n’t let the momentum stop with just your vacation photos .
All of the above ideas can be used for photos from any part of your life .
Create a photobook of your children ’s first years , a video of holiday celebrations over the years , or a blog with your cooking photos .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A newly independent Ticketmaster will likely take on about $ 750 million in debt and have $ 450 million in cash as it is spun off from parent IAC / InterActiveCorp , a top IAC executive said on Monday .
IAC Chief Financial Officer Thomas McInerney said Ticketmaster and sibling units HSN and Interval would initially be capitalized with net debt as they are spun off .
IAC is also planning to spin off online mortgage unit LendingTree.com , with the process for all four units likely to be completed in late July or early August , McInerney said .
“ In general we ’re making good progress on the timeline we have discussed , ” McInerney said on a conference call with analysts .
Sean Moriarty , chief executive of Ticketmaster , said on the call that the company saw substantial new opportunities in expanding its international ticket sales services , its ticket resale functions and helping artists market themselves to a growing fan base that no longer listens to the radio .
Ticketmaster faces new competition in the live entertainment ticketing market from concert promoter Live Nation , which is due to end a long - term partnership between the companies this year .
Moriarty said on Monday that he expects Ticketmaster to see profit growth in 2009 despite the departure of Live Nation , which accounts for about 15 percent of revenue and 10 percent to 15 percent of bottom line income .
Ticketmaster currently operates in 20 countries and expects to nearly double that number in the coming five years , Moriarty said .
Shares of IAC were down 13 cents , or 0.6 percent , to $ 20.46 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq .
Alternative Energy Vehicles
There are several alternative fuels for operating vehicles , besides fossil fuels .
The first vehicles to run on something other than horses or oxen , used steam power .
Today , we are looking into electrical vehicles powered by batteries , hydrogen fuel cells , fossil fuel generators , bio fuels including methane , biodiesel and ethanol , compressed air and there 's even a claim of running on water .
Let 's look at each category to see what 's in production now , what 's been demo'd , in the design stage and what 's being hyped ( without any details ) .
Light Weight Vehicle - Edison2 - E85 Hydrogen for Fuel - should even we go there ?
Compressed Air - looks promising Water for Fuel - to good to be true !
Propane for Fuel - interim step only .
Light Weight Vehicle Edison 2 - over 100 MPG
Winner of the 2010 X - Prize for a Mainstream vehicle ( 4 passenger ) obtaining over 100 MPG !
The Edison 2 runs on a 250 cc modified motorcycle engine burning E85 .
The design team originally figured a hybrid or electric car would be required to break the 100MPG barrier , thus the name .
Their research however , indicated WEIGHT as the biggest factor - result equals the Light Weight Vehicle .
Edison 2 X - Prize from Johnny St. Ours on Vimeo .
The overall design of this vehicle can be applied to " mainstream " production - producing 4 passenger vehicles with a very good MPG rating .
Hopefully we 'll see this design in production very soon .
Website : www.Edison2.com Hydrogen Powered Vehicles Honda FXC Clarity
The Honda FXC Clarity is the first commercial production ever of a hydrogen fuel cell - powered car .
This car will be produced in very small quantities and will only be leased , not sold .
Sounds like the first electric cars from GM ?
The car runs on electricity from a fuel cell battery that is powered by hydrogen fuel .
Water is the only byproduct and it can be driven for about 280 miles before needing to be refueled .
Honda claims it is the first company to have a hydrogen car certified for regular commercial use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Hydrogen cars are not going to be widely driven anytime soon as Honda estimates it will lease only 200 FCX Clarity vehicles over the next three years .
Mazda Premacy & RX - 8 Mazda has worked on hydrogen vehicles for several years and has test vehicles available in Japan and Norway .
Their Premacy and RX - 8 models combine electric ( battery ) power with Hydrogen as a second fuel .
They also include gasoline as a 3rd power source , which can easily be switch to , if you run out of hydrogen .
The Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid is an innovative concept car combining the hydrogen rotary engine and a hybrid system .
It was first showcased as a reference exhibit at the 40th Tokyo Motor Show in 2007 and we began commercial leasing of the vehicles in March 2009 .
While borrowing some technology from the RX - 8 Hydrogen RE , such as the dual - fuel system that also enables the car to run on gasoline , this car boasts a hybrid system that substantially increases its driving range and power .
Hydrogen as a Fuel - should we even go there !
There is considerable debate as to whether hydrogen is truly energy efficient when the entire food chain is taken into consideration .
Present mass production methods require a large input of electricity to separate hydrogen from water or methane .
Hydrogen must then be compressed , transported and stored , before it is used in a vehicle .
At best , this is just a replacement for a battery - and the Honda Clarity still requires a battery for the storage of the electricity it produces ( though not as large a pure electric vehicle ) .
My personal opinion is that we should skip hydrogen powered passenger vehicles all together .
Maybe hydrogen will have a place in the future , within commodity transportation ( trucking ) .
Time will tell .
Return to Top Compressed Air - looks promising
There are a few companies working on compressed air as fuel for small cars .
Initial press would indicate these vehicles can get 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) per tank of air and take only minutes and a couple of dollars , to refill .
Some of the companies involved include : The Air Car & Tata Motors
The air car , also known as the Mini- CAT or City Cat , can be refueled in minutes from an air compressor at specially equipped gas stations and can go 200 km on a 1.5 euro fill - up -- roughly 125 miles for $ 3 .
The top speed will be almost 70 mph and the cost of the vehicle as low as $ 7000 .
The car features a fiberglass body and a revolutionary electrical system and is completely computer - controlled .
It is powered by the expansion of compressed air , using no combustion at all , and the exhaust is entirely clean and cool enough for use in the internal air conditioning system .
Tata Motors is known for its interest in innovation and has been selling compressed gas buses since 2000 .
MDI Air Pod
In spring 2009 , Air France Industries and KLM Engineering & Maintenance are to launch a 6 - month trial of zero-emission compressed - air powered vehicles .
Developed by MDI ( Motor Development International ) , the vehicles , dubbed AirPod , are designed as people carriers for small / medium volume loads .
The 4 - seat vehicles are two meters long and weigh 220 Kg. Per - km operating costs are extremely low with a 40 mph top speed and a 130 mile range .
The AirPod has a very small turning circle and is driven with one hand using a joystick system .
Return to Top Water Powered Vehicles - see editor 's comments at end of article Genepax unveiled a car in Osaka on June 12 , 2008 , saying that a liter ( 2.1 pints ) of any kind of water — rain , river or sea — was all you needed to get the engine going for about an hour at a speed of 80 km ( 50 miles ) .
“ The car will continue to run as long as you have a bottle of water to top up from time to time , ” Genepax CEO Kiyoshi Hirasawa told local broadcaster TV Tokyo .
“ It does not require you to build up an infrastructure to recharge your batteries , which is usually the case for most electric cars , ” he added .
Once the water is poured into the tank at the back of the car , the a generator breaks it down and uses it to create electrical power , TV Tokyo said .
Whether the car makes it into showrooms remains to be seen .
Genepax said it had just applied for a patent and is hoping to collaborate with Japanese auto manufacturers in the future .
Most big automakers , meanwhile , are working on fuel - cell cars that run on hydrogen and emit — not consume — water .
( Writing by Chika Osaka , editing by Miral Fahmy and Chang - Ran Kim ) Editor ’s Comment : Sounds a bit on the “ to good to be true ” side .
Seems to me that you require energy input , in order to separate hydrogen and oxygen from water .
Will watch this one to see what develops , but there 's been no proof to date !
Return to Top Propane Powered Vehicles
During the run-up in oil prices of the 1970's , propane powered fleet vehicles became popular .
Then the price per barrel of oil dropped and so did the use of propane .
Yes , propane is a fossil fuel .
Thus it 's not renewable and it does contribute to greenhouse gases and air pollution ( smog ) .
On the positive side however , it burns much cleaner than gasoline or diesel and is more efficient .
According to Richard Ivey School of Business professor Gerry Higgins , propane burns 30 percent cleaner than gasoline and produces 26 percent fewer greenhouse gases .
On the down side , propane conversion kits are quite expensive ( $ 5,000 ) and the fuel is not appropriate for heavy trucks .
Thus , propane is best suited for small , light - duty fleets , such as taxis , police vehicles , and utility fleets ( gas , water , phone , cable ) .
Given the pros and cons of propane , it can only be considered as an interim step .
Worth the conversion for high usage , light - duty fleets due to the increase in mileage and drop in pollution .
However , it 's still a fossil fuel and thus still part of the problem , not the solution .

I bought my first van to use as a weekend getaway .
I never decided to make it my home , any more than I decided to be 5ft 11 in tall .
It was just the way my life was going .
Indolence , if I 'm honest , was a factor , and I wanted to be flexible , worried that I might miss that perfect opportunity .
A degree course had filled me with ideas and energy , but failed to make me employable .
So I turned to climbing , and got a job in an outdoor shop .
It was there that the idea of slipping away to the margins of society began to creep around my mind .
When rent was due for the room in which I felt only fidgety and bored , my frustration helped these thoughts to flourish until I could see myself , in vivid colour , trundling across the continent , following the good times and the good weather , shaking sand from my shoes and waking up exactly where I wanted to be , in my own mobile kingdom .
Convention was the only thing stopping me , until I returned from spending a few weeks in the Alps .
I 'd moved out of my room before I had left , but made no plans for my return .
I spent a few weeks sleeping on friends ' floors until I felt I 'd outstayed my welcome , then I moved into the van .
Whenever anyone asked me where I lived , there was an awkward pause .
" Well , nowhere really ... "
I would begin , while I decided the most appropriate way to explain .
The usual response was of sympathetic concern - " Do n't you get cold ? "
Others were jealous : " Wow , that 's such a cool idea ! "
Some people just did n't understand .
" You live in a van ?
What , like a camper van ? "
" No , just a Renault 5 van . "
At first , I felt as if I 'd discovered a loophole in the game of life .
Without rent , I was able to work less , and the freedom was exhilarating .
Of course , there were downsides .
Waking on dank autumn mornings was hard , and sometimes I was burdened by a sense of social displacement , of always moving against the grain , even harbouring a desire to join commuter traffic .
I felt vulnerable to crime so worked hard to be inconspicuous , but in three years I was never bothered by anyone but for the odd policeman .
The first time it happened , I awoke panicked by feet crunching on gravel , but then I heard the police radio .
I relaxed and stuck my head out of the door .
" Hello mate , what are you doing out here ? " he asked .
" Oh .
My girlfriend kicked me out , " I replied .
" Well , as long as you 're OK , I 'll leave you in peace .
Women , eh ? "
The girlfriend yarn became standard after that .
That van broke down , and , at about the same time , I decided I 'd wasted enough of my life slumped over a shop counter .
I quit my job , then hung around in a jobless , homeless hinterland , hoping an opportunity would come by .
It never did , so I bought another , bigger van ; a 10 - year - old lightly rusty , white rectangle - on - wheels .
I got a new job building climbing walls in the Peak District .
The work was dirty and tedious but it finished mid-afternoon , so most days I 'd drive to the dales and climb and socialise .
Then I 'd park in a quiet spot for the night , thankful I 'd not had to drive back to the city and an evening of unfinished housework .
For a while I felt I had got things just right , but towards the middle of that summer it began to rain .
After work , I 'd sit cramped and festering , reading books and watching my plans for the summer trickle down the windscreen .
Or I 'd drive to friends ' houses and hang out , but always with a burden of guilt ; or was it pride damaged by my loss of self - reliance ?
The rain kept falling , midsummer came and the van was getting damp .
Mildew advanced from the corners of my home and my books wilted .
High summer passed beneath sagging skies and I woke each morning to increasingly stiff joints .
By September I 'd had enough .
I paid rent that month for the first time in three years , for a small room in a sparsely furnished terraced house .
I was pleased by the convenience of it - more than I 'd imagined I 'd be - and by being part of a social scene again .
I still lead a relatively frugal life , but now I live in a house my living standards are beginning to creep back up .
I suppose that 's human nature , but if I ever feel I am becoming a slave to material desires , I can always move back into the van .

Gay bashing worked for Republicans in 2002 and 2004 , and on this today 's Fox News Sunday , The Weekly Standard 's Fred Barnes suggests that it's a winning issue for John McCain in 2008 :
Download Download
" He needs to touch on , and - some of the social issues which energize the right .
In particular , gays in the military for one .
We know Barack Obama is for allowing gays in the military , and Bill Clinton tried to do and then backed off .
This is not a popular issue .
Gay marriage is another one .
These are both issues that I think McCain 's gonna have to use .
He can't ignore the right .
If he does , he 'll lose . "
I 'll agree with Fred , this kind of bigotry will win McCain a few points with the fringe haters that make up the shrinking base of the GOP , but the climate in 2008 is much different than in previous election years .
I do n't see gay bashing as a strong issue this year as voters are much more focused on issues such as their empty gas tanks and bank accounts , as well as the overwhelming need to find a solution to get our troops out of Iraq and a strong desire to avoid war with Iran .

Is there life beneath the soil ?
Researchers say its spectral signature has been tentatively detected by sensors on board the European Space Agency 's orbiting Mars Express craft .
Ammonia survives for only a short time in the Martian atmosphere so if it really does exist it must be getting constantly replenished .
There are two possible sources : either active volcanoes , none of which have been found yet on Mars , or microbes .
Suite of molecules
" Ammonia could be the key to finding life on Mars , " one US space agency ( Nasa ) scientist told BBC News Online .
Spectral evidence for the gas was seen by the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer ( PFS ) on Mars Express .
Professor Vittorio Formisano , principal investigator for the instrument , is expected to release details of new findings from the PFS at an international conference being held next week in Paris .
The PFS is sensitive to radiation in the spectral region of 1.2 - 5 microns and 5 - 50 microns - a region rich with important molecules such as water and carbon dioxide .
Ammonia has a spectral line at 10 microns .
Although Mars Express has been in orbit around Mars since December 2003 , scientists have so far only analysed a fraction of the data the PFS has produced .
Researchers say this is because they are still coming to terms with the complexities of the PFS as well as coping with some nagging power problems on Mars Express .
So far the PFS has observed a depletion of carbon dioxide and an enrichment of water vapour over some of the large extinct volcanoes on Mars .
But it is the detection of minor compounds , possible in the sensors high - resolution mode , which are causing excitement .
The tentative detection of ammonia comes just a few months after methane was found in the Martian atmosphere .
Methane is another gas with a possible biological origin .
Ammonia is not a stable molecule in the Martian atmosphere .
If it was not replenished in some way , it would only last a few hours before it vanished .
One possibility the scientists have had to rule out is that the ammonia comes from the air bags of the failed Beagle 2 mission .
Analysis has revealed that the suspected ammonia 's distribution is not consistent with this explanation .
Life on Mars ?
The importance of ammonia is that it is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen .
Nitrogen is rare in the Martian environment but because no form of terrestrial life can exist without it , the presence of ammonia may indicate that Martian microbial life is hoarding it .
" There are no known ways for ammonia to be present in the Martian atmosphere that do not involve life , " the Nasa scientist said .
The twin US rovers that landed on the Red Planet in January will be unable to answer the question of the ammonia 's origin as they are designed for geological work .
But future missions could include sensors to analyse the ammonia to determine if it has a biological or volcanic origin .
Lava deposited on to the surface , or released underground , could produce the gas .
But , so far , no active volcanic hotspots have been detected on the planet by the many spacecraft currently in orbit .
Highly - paid footballers and celebrities are setting a bad example , according to the survey , put out today .
It listed spitting and swearing as the most offensive forms of behaviour .
Almost nine out of 10 people - 86.2 per cent - think Britons have become ruder than a decade ago , the poll for the ITV1 Tonight television program found .
" I suppose it 's part of the breakdown in society , the fact that we stopped having respect for figures in authority , partly because those in authority did n't command it , '' Diana Mather , an etiquette coach , said .
Britons traditionally liked to think of themselves as superior to foreigners at things like queuing and giving up their seats on public transport to disabled people or pregnant women .
But the rise of football culture - and football hooligans creating mayhem - has long dented this image abroad , and now Britons themselves acknowledge they have a major problem .
More than half of those asked - 56.5 per cent - thought bad manners were the biggest problem in the country , according to the survey based on answers from some 2800 adults .
Spitting caused the most offence for 27.6 per cent , ahead of swearing by 20.2 per cent , followed by queue - jumping , talking loudly on mobile phones , not saying " please ' ' or " thank you , '' and belching or passing wind in public .
Nearly 75 per cent of Britons think the behaviour of celebrity footballers encourages bad manners in society .
But when asked to name the worst influence on children 's manners , 63.8 per cent blamed the behaviour and lack of discipline of parents , with over 90 per cent saying parents are failing to pass on basic manners to their children .
Some 15.9 per cent said celebrities and footballers were the worst influence , followed by 5.4 per cent for television program .
" I think my generation has a lot to answer for because I think the youth culture in the 60s and early 70s threw out every rule book and thought it was really clever to use four letter words and so on , '' Esther Rantzen , patron of Campaign for Courtesy , said .
" But I think things should go back , not to the old deference , not to grovelling , not to any of that , but just to feeling respect , because I think that would make everyone 's life pleasanter . ''

Bill Clinton knows , Chelsea knows and Hillary Clinton knows .
Coming out of yesterday ’s primaries without any decisive win , but rather a very decisive loss in North Carolina , running or even being out of money , she does n’t stand a chance to win the nomination now .
A view that is mainly reflected in the English newspapers of today :
The Times
In headline terms it might have looked like a split decision .
In the latest instalment of the long - running Democratic primary election saga on Tuesday , Sen Barack Obama won North Carolina and Sen Hillary Clinton won Indiana .
These results went roughly as expected – one for each camp .
So at least in terms of the state - wide winners it was a tie , and the race looks set to go on through the final few primaries in the next month .
But beneath the headlines , this was clearly a triumphant night – and perhaps even a decisive one – for Sen Obama . ( more … )
The Independent
The split outcome will mean that the struggle of the Democratic nomination is not over yet .
It will give cause for relief and for frustration in each of the camps – as well as grief for the party ’s hierarchy which frets that the longer the slug - fest between them continues the better it is for the Republicans . ( more … )
The Guardian
Barack Obama took North Carolina by … let ’s just say it ’s a generous portion .
His 14 - point victory was far in excess of what his supporters had hoped .
Far more than Hillary ’s people had dreamed .
Words like “ rout ” and “ devastating ” come to mind .
No one saw a win this big in the cards .
Hillary was pumping plenty of cash into the air , here , but Obama won North Carolina on the ground .
For two weeks his supporters had been acting as if Hillary were breathing down their necks .
The Rev. Jeremiah Wright , the race - baiting , the questioning of Obama ’s patriotism – even James Carville ’s shot at his masculinity – all of it had Obama ’s people in NC convinced that his once - commanding lead here was slipping away .
So they made one more phone call .
They knocked on one more door .
They put up one more sign .
That ’s how elections are won . ( more … )
The Telegraph
According to Russert , Clinton has cancelled appearances on the morning shows .
There are also reports that Hillary has had to give her own campaign another loan .
While there was nothing in her speech that indicated she was about to drop out , she ’ll be conferring with her advisers , some of whom will have the courage to deliver some hard truths .
Here are 10 things she might want to consider as she ponders whether to remain in this race .
( more … )
The Economist
BARACK OBAMA once said that of the three contests in Pennsylvania , North Carolina and Indiana , the last would be the “ tie - breaker ” .
He was right .
His Democratic presidential rival , Hillary Clinton , won the first .
He won the second on Tuesday May 6th , romping home in North Carolina with 56.2 % to Mrs Clinton ’s 41.5 % .
The margin of victory , nearly 15 points , was much larger than had been expected .
As for the tie - breaker , Mrs Clinton won in Indiana , but by such a small margin ( 50.9 % to 49.1 % ) , that it all but counts as a victory for Mr Obama . ( more … )
Der Spiegel
The former first lady bet everything — and lost .
Barring some kind of miracle , Barack Obama will become the Democratic Party ’s presidential candidate .
A dramatic finale on Tuesday night brought an end to the Clinton era . ( more … )
It ’s time to look ahead now .
There is a Republican out there who wants to become the next President and we can’t have that , can we ?
It is going to be hard work after this grueling primary campaign and is better started right away .

The public perception of the Profumo Affair does not
correspond with reality .
Stephen Ward was a KGB agent .
The scandal was designed to replace the Macmillan government with one more receptive to the globalist agenda .
The " Profumo Affair " was staged by the KGB , along with the MI - 6 , CIA and Mossad , the operating arms of the Illuminati .
" It was always a posh crowd who would arrive in chauffeur - driven Bentleys or Rolls Royces .
It seemed to me that having money dictated that you had group sex as often as you possibly could . "
Updated from June 25 , 2008
by Henry Makow Ph.D .
Christine Keeler 's memoir" The Truth At Last " ( 2001 ) puts the scandal which helped topple Harold Macmillan 's government in 1963 in the context of the Illuminati conspiracy .
Keeler 's mentor Stephen Ward ( 1912 - 1963 ) was a Russian agent , part of a spy ring that included royal art curator Sir Anthony Blunt and Sir Roger Hollis , head of MI - 5 ( 1956 - 1965 . )
In her presence , they conspired to give British Defense secrets to the USSR .
She told the police and Lord Denning but it was suppressed because English Masonry 's control of both England and the USSR was not public knowledge .
Based on what we know about Victor Rothschild and from Heinrich Muller , Communism was a creation of British Freemasonry which in turn is an instrument of the Rothschild banking empire .
( The Illuminati is the top rung of Freemasonry . )
The British establishment is rotten with traitors if that word has any meaning when treason is the norm .
Our view of the world as warring nation - states does not reflect reality .
History and current events are theater .
A tightly - knit satanic sex cult subtly controls all states and pits them against each other in a profitable and diverting Punch - and - Judy show .
The nearly accomplished goal : world government tyranny .
( Ward and Keeler )
Left - Right distinctions are also meaningless .
Keeler witnessed the " Communist " Stephen Ward meeting with " Fascist " leader Oswald Mosley . ( 99 )
In Oct. 1962 , she overheard Stephen Ward tell Eugene Ivanov , his Soviet contact : " a man like John Kennedy will not be allowed to stay in such an important position of power in the world , I can assure you of that . "
( 146 ) Indeed Ward operated another honey pot in NYC and entrapped JFK .
Stephen Ward was prosecuted for being a pimp and Keeler for prostitution but this did not reflect reality .
Ward ( an Osteopath who supposedly committed suicide while on trial ) was a KGB spy master who used the innocent Keeler to get information from important men .
The Minister of War , John Profumo , 48 , married and a father , was touted to become Prime Minister .
Yet , he betrayed this great private and public responsibility by having a schoolboy affair with a nineteen - year - old girl .
Keeler describes him as simply unable to control his lust .
Ward made his subordinate Soviet Naval Attache Ivanov seduce Keeler in order to compromise Profumo .
Stephen Ward was a Soviet agent whose job was to undermine the Conservative government to make way for Harold Wilson 's Labor Party .
The " Profumo Affair " was staged by the KGB , along with the MI - 6 , CIA and Mossad , the operating arms of the Illuminati .
MASONIC ELITE DEPRAVITY
Christine Keeler was a beautiful teenager who mostly gave it away in return for admission to the fast lane .
She slept with everyone from Ringo Starr to George Peppard , to the Captain and officers of the ocean liner New Amsterdam .
" I had sex with captain and officers because I could , because I had the power to make them want me . " ( 137 )
She became a symbol for sexual " liberation " in the early 1960's , a siren like Marilyn Monroe .
But what was presented as a relaxation of sexual repression was just getting the camel 's nose under the tent .
( " Scandal " is a great movie but story is fictitious .
" I 'm sorry , but that film was just a snapshot of what really went on , " Keeler wrote .
" The surface has barely been rippled . " )
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold wo n't likely get a break this summer as investors seek out alternatives to falling confidence in the economy , and the strong investment demand may couple with physical demand in the fourth quarter to lift prices back into record territory , analysts said .
" The gold market in the past has been seasonal , with the rule being ' sell in May and go away ' , " said Julian Phillips , an analyst at GoldForecaster.com .
The seasonal pattern usually meant that gold would see a lull in demand beginning in May and lasting until the middle to the end of August , with main demand appearing in the final quarter of the year and lasting until the end of May , he said .
But for the month of June , gold futures prices climbed more than 4 % and they gained almost 11 % in the first half of this year .
" Expectations of a quiet summer in the gold pits have been summarily dismissed as a confluence of bullish factors have led gold to rally sharply and test the high side of the recent trading range , " said Mark O'Byrne , a Dublin - based executive director at Gold and Silver Investments Ltd .
And gold 's likely to continue its rally in the second half of the year -- " as it did last year and has done most years since the inception of the gold bull market , " he said .
Some analysts say the latest bull market began in 2002 .
That 's when prices began a steep climb from around $ 280 an ounce .
O'Byrne , like many analysts , expect gold prices to climb right back to their futures price record of nearly $ 1,034 an ounce , seen in mid-March , and maybe even beyond .
He expects to see $ 1,200 in the coming months before the precious metals suffers from a bout of correction and consolidation .
Still , there are lots of changing influences for gold traders to consider these days .
Investment party
The average gold price in the first half of 2008 was around $ 910 , according to Jon Nadler , a senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers , and the price is up almost 43 % in June from a year ago .
" The widening trading range and added volatility will remain the principal features of the market as we turn the corner into the second half . "
Investment buying has been key to gold 's success .
It 's made the yearly " doldrums for gold , a vigorous season of its own , " said Phillips .
Demand is at a much higher level than ever seen in the market before with the investment side of demand reflecting the performance of " gold as a monetary metal , " he said .
Overall demand for gold climbed to $ 20.9 billion in the first quarter -- more than double the level of four years earlier , according to a report from the World Gold Council released in May .

“ ' Sub - $ 1,000 gold days are drawing to a close [ and ] by the end of this year , I would find it difficult to explain a sub - $ 1,000 gold price . ' ” — Peter Spina , GoldSeek.com
" Gold will continue to attract increasing monetary demand and the result will be a much higher price , " said Peter Spina , an analyst at GoldSeek.com .
" Sub - $ 1,000 gold days are drawing to a close [ and ] by the end of this year , I would find it difficult to explain a sub - $ 1,000 gold price . "
Meanwhile , " global macro-economic and currency markets ... look awful with little effective action going on to rectify matters , " Phillips said .
Since January , the U.S. dollar has weakened against every major currency except for the Canadian dollar , Kathy Lien , chief strategist at DailyFX.com said in a research note issued on Monday .
And gold has been moving in the opposite direction of the U.S. dollar over the past few months .
" The gold price is and will be more influenced by currency and economic factors than by physical demand , " said Phillips .
U.S. stocks have suffered a steep loss , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % down more 14 % in the first half of the year .
See Market Snapshot .
Strength in oil has helped drive prices for gold higher as well .
Prices have reached record levels well over $ 140 per barrel .
See Commodities Corner .
But the price for " paper oil " may be " over extended , " said Ned Schmidt , editor of the Value View Gold Report .
He expects oil prices to fall below $ 100 per barrel by the year 's end .
" Gold may still need to test $ 850 , " before summer is over , to put a final bottom in place , he said .
" This would allow for gold to move back to more than $ 1,000 by New Year 's Eve . "
Physicality
Later in the year , the gold market usually sees an uptick in physical demand .
From the middle to the end of August , the Indian market " revives " following the harvest gathering and after the monsoons , said Phillips .
Some 70 % of gold buyers come from the agricultural sector in India and then they stay in the market until May the following year , he said .
No tax is paid on agricultural profits so in India " it disappears from view into gold and property , " said Phillips .
Also , the " developed fabrication world begins to buy in September to fabricate in time for the year - end festivities . "
Given that , " gold 's high season lies in the final and first quarter of the year , " Phillips said .
So " expect a ' golden ' second half for precious metals .
Price guess
Blanchard expects gold to continue to climb and likely pass the $ 1,000 mark at some point in the next few months , then reach $ 1,150 by the end of the year , said David Beahm , a vice president at the coin and precious metals retailer .
Nadler said Kitco has raised its initial 2008 trading range estimate for gold by " only a small margin " -- to $ 730 - $ 1,030 , from a range of $ 640 - $ 940 .
Kitco expects the average price to mark a slow decline from the $ 910 area to the mid-$ 800s as the market approaches the end of the year .
" Barring surprise geopolitical developments or significant financial implosions , which could catapult the metal to new pinnacles for a brief shining moment , the outlook is for a U.S. dollar recovery in the second half and for a retreat in gold towards the $ 730 area it initially touched back in May 2006 , " said Nadler .
But overall , O'Byrne sees the situation for the gold market -- weak supplies , increasing investment demand macroeconomic and geopolitical risk -- as " a very toxic combination . "
And in " these circumstances , it is absurd to suggest that the gold price could fall materially from these levels in the second half of the year , " he said .
" The inflation adjusted high of some $ 2,300 per ounce remains a very likely price target in the long term and looks more likely with every passing week , " said O'Byrne .
