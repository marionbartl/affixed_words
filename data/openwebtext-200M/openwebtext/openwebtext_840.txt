State Sen. Linda
Gray got taken to school about etiquette when she chastised a high - school freshman for her poor writing skills , suggesting the student would have trouble passing the AIMS language test and is a poor learner .
Gray , R - Phoenix , bristled when she got an e-mail last week from a ninth - grader at Sunnyslope High School .
The student wanted to know why lawmakers cut the education budget , and questioned why " you do n't cut any money from your budget ? "
The e-mail was an unbroken string of sentences with no punctuation .
Gray noted this in her pointed response : " I have grave concerns on your ability to pass the AIMS language test , " she wrote .
" Why did n't you take to ( sic ) time to write an e-mail with the proper punctuation ?
By your poorly written e-mail , your example tells me that all the money we have spent on your education shows a lack of learning on your part . "
The e-mail ended up circulating among the student 's friends and teachers at Sunnyslope , a local TV station and on the liberal Daily Kos blog .
Gray was even more mortified when she heard the student has special needs , something she learned when the girl 's physical - education teacher sent the senator an e-mail .
Gray said she apologized via e-mail and invited the student to shadow her at the state Legislature .
In reply , the student asked Gray to accompany her during a day at Sunnyslope High , which the senator agreed to do .
" I spoke harsh words to her , " she said , attributing it to her frustration with how the recent state cuts to education are being portrayed as draconian reductions .
" I do n't know what got into me that day . "
The student did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Tabbed Browsing is a prominent feature of modern browsers .
We think it 's one of the key elements that makes the browser a window manager for the web .
Since we thought of the tab as the " container " element within which all other aspects of the browser lived , we designed the Chrome UI with the tab strip at the very top .
But we did n't stop at aesthetic upheaval .
As we were designing Google Chrome , we designed our tab strip behavior with an eye to making heavy use efficient .
Observing how we were using our existing browsers , we were able to identify some pain points and come up with solutions targeted at fixing them .
In this post I 'll talk a bit about some of the things we 've done .
Ordering
One of the most persistently annoying issues with tabbed browsing was the following situation :
You have a full tab strip and a " hub " page open towards the left of the strip .
Perhaps its your RSS reader , or a news site like Google News .
You open interesting links in new tabs so you can keep reading through the headlines .
The problem is , the new tabs open at the end of the tab strip , beyond many other unrelated tabs that also happen to be open .
Sometimes , because of the " many - tab overflow "
UIs in existing browsers , the tabs that you are queuing up to read in just a moment may disappear off the end of the strip .
In short : finding tabs can sometimes be a challenge .
In addition , when you 're done reading one of the articles you opened and close its tab , selection jumps back to the opener .
This was one of the improvements I made to the tab strip in Firefox a couple of years ago , but with some extended use it turns out to not be the best action when there are multiple tabs opened from the same opener .
Worse still , when combined with the " overflow " UI I mentioned above , the result was disorienting " bouncing " between the left and right ends of the tabstrip .
What did we do ?
In Google Chrome , we open tabs opened from links in the background adjacent to their opener tab .
This keeps the spatial proximity of related tasks close .
So you do n't end up with the " bouncing " scenario I just described .
We also maintain loose grouping relationships between such related tabs , so that when you are done reading one of several articles opened from a hub page , we shift selection to the next in the group , rather than going back to the hub .
We think this makes the news reading use case a lot simpler .
We do n't persist this group relationship when you switch to an unrelated tab , though , to avoid situations that might lead to unpredictable switching behavior if you move on to a different task .
Cleaning Up
Another common annoyance was related to closing several tabs quickly .
In most tab strips , when you close a tab the other tabs expand to fit the space that has just been made available .
The upshot of this is that the close boxes of the remaining tabs all move around slightly , which makes it harder to quickly close tabs by clicking in the same spot .
Older versions of Firefox solved this by putting the close box in a static position at the end of the tab strip , but lab research showed this approach had usability and discoverability problems for novices not used to tabbed browsing , so the close box was moved into the tab ( which now seems to be the standard location for tabbed browsers ) .
For Chrome , we came up with something a little different .
Realizing that maintaining a fixed width for tabs when closing them would keep close buttons aligned under the mouse pointer , we designed a system whereby the tab strip will re-layout when you close a tab to fill the gap left , but not resize the remaining tabs , until you move your mouse away from the tab strip ( thus signaling you 're done closing tabs ) .
Open Issues
Based on feedback we 've received so far , here are a few areas where our tab strip design needs further improvement :
Many Tab Overflow
We do n't have a complete system for handling many open tabs right now .
We let tabs grow infinitely smaller .
This ends up looking bad when there are a very large number of tabs open .
We chose not to go with an overflow menu or scrolling tab strip like in some other browsers because we think there are other usability problems with those approaches .
Specifically , when you implement an overflow solution you generally pick a minimum " readable " width for the tab and overflow tabs when there are too many at that width to fit .
The problem is usually that that width seems to be too wide , so there can be unnecessary overflow in conditions where a smaller tab width would have meant all of the tabs would have fit .
We also do n't really like the drop - down menu approach as it has a spatial disconnect ( vertical scanning vs. horizontal tabs ) that makes it clumsy to use quickly .
In the end , we would like a system that does n't over - zealously clip tabs out of the tab strip so that people with many tabs can still access their tabs with one click .
Disoriented Anchor Tabs
Opening tabs next to the tab that opened them can mean for some use cases that the behavior of having a few " anchor " tabs positioned at the left edge of the strip is more difficult since tabs opened from them are opened in between .
We like the idea of " tab pinning " or " locking " as a solution for this , but have n't invested a lot of time in designing how this might work just yet .
There may be some overlap with " startup tabs " in Options .
Restoring Mistakenly Closed Windows
We also do n't prompt when you close a window with several tabs .
The reason we do n't do this is that one of our core design philosophies has been to avoid modal question prompts that interrupt the user when they 're trying to get things done ( in this case , use a standard window control to close the window ) .
We 're aware that the prompt has saved people ( including ourselves ! ) using other browsers from losing tabs , but we have been trying to come up with a more creative system for helping this scenario that does n't interfere with the window 's close button .
In recent trunk builds , you 'll find that you can re-open a recently closed window from the New Tab Page , and that the " Recently Closed " section of the New Tab Page now spans multiple sessions .
This is a good way to " undo " an accidentally closed window , in the same way you can " undo " an accidentally closed tab .
To try this out you can get on the Google Chrome Dev Channel
In all of these areas we 've resisted adding options to control behavior .
Keeping our set of options minimal is a good forcing function for us as user interface designers to come up with the right approach , since we never rely on the crutch of making the user decide what we were unable to .
Instead , our approach has been to experiment with different behaviors and end up taking the approach that works the best .
We are heavy users , and we 've designed this user interface for heavy web users , so we hope it scales as well for you as it does for us !

Introduction
Here , I would like to introduce a 2D mobile robot simulator .
With this simulator , we can design how a robot will navigate in a 2D world by using a set of rules that we design .
The rules are designed by using Lua script .
Lua itself is a powerful , fast , lightweight , embeddable scripting language .
Using Lua will offer us many benefits in designing algorithms for mobile robots .
For the world editor , we use GDI Device Context programming .
Users can create the environment for testing the robots by using the click and drag method .
Here is a summary of the features :
Differential steering robot
Multiple - robot simulation
Sonar and laser beam type distance sensor
Embedded Lua script for the robot code
Graphical world editor
Code editor with syntax colorization and auto completion
Knowledge in Lua is also necessary .
Lua is not something difficult to learn .
You can check the Lua website .
The Robot Theory
The robot that we have here is a wheeled robot .
It has two wheels .
It navigates with a differentially steered drive system .
A differentially steered drive system is like a wheeled chair .
Steering a wheeled chair can be done by varying the speed of its wheels .
If one wheel is rotating faster , the wheeled chair will make a curved path .
If both wheels are on the same speed , it will make a straight path .
The Robot Mathematics
For details about mobile robot theory , you can refer the G.W. Lucas tutorial .
To make it simple , here are the equations used to model differential steering behaviour :
If the left wheel and the right wheel are at the same speed , the equation above cannot be implemented since it will result in division by zero error .
Using L'Hospital 's rule , it can be shown that the equation has limits approaching a straight line ( check again the G.W. Lucas tutorial ) .
So , when the left wheel and the right wheel are at the same speed , use this equation ( please notice that dx / dt means the difference between the current x position and the previous x position ) :
To get the current position of the robot , we only need to input the time , left wheel speed , and the right wheel speed to the equation above .
The robot angle is something that we also need to calculate .
Here is the equation to calculate the robot angle :
Finally , here is the implementation code for those equations :
void CRobot : : goRobotGo ( double * t ) { if ( canResetTime ) {
*t = 0 ; canResetTime = false ; } int plusFactor = m_robot .
rWheelSpeed + m_robot.lWheelSpeed ; int minusFactor = m_robot.lWheelSpeed - m_robot .
rWheelSpeed ; if ( m_robot.lWheelSpeed - m_robot .rWheelSpeed != 0 . 0 ) { m_robot.
theta = m_theta0 + minusFactor * ( *t ) / m_robot.size ; m_robot.pos.x = ceil ( m_pos0.x + m_robot.size / 2 * plusFactor / minusFactor * ( sin(minusFactor * ( *t ) / m_robot.size + m_robot.theta0 ) - sin(m_robot.theta0 ) ) ) ; m_robot.pos.y = m_pos0.y - m_robot.size / 2 * plusFactor / minusFactor * ( cos(minusFactor * ( *t ) / m_robot.size + m_robot.theta0 ) - cos(m_robot.theta0 ) ) ; } else { m_robot.pos.x = plusFactor / 2 * cos(m_robot.theta ) * ( * t ) + m_pos0.x ; m_robot.pos.y = plusFactor / 2 * sin(m_robot.theta ) * ( * t ) + m_pos0.y ; } }
All things related to the robot are put in the class CRobot in the files Robot.h and Robot.cpp .
The World Editor
The world editor is simply an implementation of GDI device context programming .
We use simple graphs such as rectangle , ellipse , and line to create rooms and obstacles .
With a little math , we can make those graphs selectable , moveable , and resizable .
This world editor is based on my own previous work .
I know it is very simple and also not good since I received several bad responses on it .
I will make it better if I have time .
All things related to the world editor are in CCanvas in the files Canvas.h and Canvas.cpp .
The Code Editor
For the code editor , I use the Scintilla library .
With the Scintilla library , we can easily make an editor that supports syntax colorization .
I learned about this library from an article I found on CodeProject .
Check here and here .
All things related to the world editor are in the files EditorDlg.h and EditorDlg.cpp .
The Embedded Lua
Lua is a very nice programming language .
It is a light - weight , small - footprint programming language designed for extending applications .
Here , I embedded several C++ functions to Lua by using the Lua script C++ wrapper created by RhicadS .
readsensor ( integer index ) accepts the sensor index ; returns the measured distance of the active robot .
accepts the sensor index ; returns the measured distance of the active robot .
setspeed ( integer left , integer right ) accepts the left and right wheel speed of the active robot ; returns nothing .
accepts the left and right wheel speed of the active robot ; returns nothing .
getangle ( ) accepts nothing ; returns the current angular position of the active robot ( in radians ) .
accepts nothing ; returns the current angular position of the active robot ( in radians ) .
getnumofrobots ( ) accepts nothing ; returns number of existing robots .
accepts nothing ; returns number of existing robots .
getposition ( ) accepts nothing ; returns x and y position of active robot .
accepts nothing ; returns x and y position of active robot .
gettarget ( int index ) accepts index of target ; returns x and y position of selected target .
accepts index of target ; returns x and y position of selected target .
textline ( string msg ) accepts the message to be displayed ; returns nothing .
accepts the message to be displayed ; returns nothing .
setactiverobot ( integer index ) activates a certain robot .
activates a certain robot . stepforward ( ) runs simulation one time step .
Basically , those functions are used to manipulate the robot .
Lua itself has many internal functions that you can use to develop your algorithm .
You can check the Lua reference manual to see the available functions such as : functions for math , string , or file manipulation .
How to Use
You can display the code editor window by clicking View >>
Editor , or by clicking View code editor on the toolbar ( Ctrl+E ) .
A world file is saved with a *.wld extension , while the code file is saved with a *.lua extension .
Loading and saving them are done separately .
Let 's give a try .
First , draw a big ellipse on the world editor .
Then , draw another smaller ellipse inside the first ellipse ( or you can load file doubled_wall.wld ) .
Drag the robot inside the alley made by these two ellipses .
Load the code editor and paste the following code .
Run the simulation .
When the robot disappears , click the menu Robot >>
Reset Position .
function azolla.main( azolla ) azolla: setspeed ( 20,20 ) while true do a = azolla:readsensor ( 1 ) b = azolla:readsensor ( 5 ) if ( a - b > 2 ) then azolla: setspeed ( 30,20 ) end if ( a - b < - 2 ) then azolla : setspeed ( 20,30 ) end if ( ( a - b > - 2 ) and ( a - b < 2 ) ) then azolla: setspeed ( 20,20 ) end azolla: stepforward ( ) end end
The above code is to make the robot move forward following the wall .
See how it reads the sensor value .
There are six sensors in the robot ( by default ) .
You can modify the number of sensors using the menu Robot >>
Set properties .
They are all laser beam type distance .
As we know , there are also sonar type distance sensors .
Take a look at the picture .
Sensor numbering starts from the robot head , and the index increases in the clockwise direction .
Let 's try another .
Within the demo , I included two files trinity . wrl and trinity .lua .
Load the two files .
Copy and paste the following code :
function azolla.main( azolla ) azolla: textline ( " START ...
" ) while ( true ) do for i = 0 , azolla:getnumofrobots ( ) - 1 do azolla:setactiverobot( i ) front = azolla:readsensor( 0 ) left = azolla:readsensor ( 5 ) right = azolla:readsensor ( 1 ) if ( front < 10 ) then azolla : setspeed ( 4 , - 4 ) else delta = 0.5 * ( right - left ) azolla : setspeed ( 4 + delta,4 - delta ) end end azolla: stepforward ( ) end end
Let 's take a closer look .
function azolla.main ( azolla ) will always be first called .
It 's the main function .
The function is always written with something like this : function azolla.function_name(azolla ) < function_name(parameter_if_exist ) >< />.
In the code above , the robot will travel around the maze using simple P( proportional ) algorithm .
The robot will read input from left and right sensor .
Control signal ( delta ) will be calculated based on the difference between left and right sensor value .
This control signal will be used to correct the speed of both wheels . < />
Multiple Robot Simulation
Since version 1.0.2 , Azolla now supports multiple robot simulation .
We can add several robots and run all of them at the same time .
To activate a certain robot , setcativerobot must be used .
Take a look at the following code :
function azolla.main ( this ) azolla: setspeed ( 20,20 ) while true do --ACTIVATE THE ROBOT ONE BY ONE !!! for i = 0 , azolla:getnumofrobot ( ) - 1 do -- This part is for wall following azolla:setactiverobot ( i ) a = azolla:readsensor ( 1 ) b = azolla:readsensor ( 5 ) if ( a - b > 2 ) then azolla: setspeed ( 30,20 ) end if ( a - b < - 2 ) then azolla : setspeed ( 20,30 ) end if ( ( a - b > - 2 ) and ( a - b < 2 ) ) then azolla: setspeed ( 20,20 ) end end azolla: stepforward ( ) end end
The above code is to control several robots so that those robots will move forward following walls in left and right side .
It is the same as the first example ( doubled_wall.wld ) .
We can use the same code for wall following part .
As we can see , before moving the robot , we should decide which robot we want to move .
We can do iteration to move all the robots sequentially .
Limitations
Azolla is not a real time robot simulator .
If we add more and more robots , the simulation will run slower .
To make simulation faster , we can increase time step for simulation .
While for sensor reading , it is based on pixel reading of the screen .
In this case , we must make sure that the simulation is run in the area of the main window .
If the robot goes out of the main window , the sensor algorithm will read the wrong screen pixels .
And also , if we have another window on top of the main window and that window can be reached by sensor of the robot , the sensor algorithm will also read the wrong screen pixels .
For the next release , I plan to implement geometrical method for sensor instead of reading screen pixel values .
Points of Interest
I really hope you try this simulation software .
There have been plenty of improvements I made since the first release .
Previously , the simulation did n't work in a multi-core computer .
That bug has been fixed .
Excessive CPU usage issue has also been fixed .
Overall , I can say it works very nicely .
I hope you like it and it is helpful for you .
You can read the History section to see the details of the improvements made .
For further information , please take a look at the provided PDF file .

Future Work
For future work , I want to make this simulation software more reliable so it can be used for study and research purposes in the area of mobile robots .
To reach that goal , there are many things that need to be done .

Middle - aged people who drink moderate amounts of coffee significantly reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease , a study by Finnish and Swedish researchers showed Thursday .
" Middle - aged people who drank between three and five cups of coffee a day lowered their risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer 's disease by between 60 and 65 per cent later in life , " said lead researcher on the project , Miia Kivipelto , a professor at the University of Kuopio in Finland and at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm .
The study , which was also conducted in cooperation with the National Public Health Institute in Helsinki and which was published in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease this month , was based on repeated interviews with 1,409 people in Finland over more than two decades .
They were first asked about their coffee - drinking habits when they were in their 50s and their memory functions were tested again in 1998 , when they were between 65 and 79 years of age .
A total of 61 people had by then developed dementia , 48 of whom had Alzheimer 's , the researchers said .
More and more often , humans are discovering weird marine life that would tax even Dr. Suess ' imagination .
These were found in places ranging from oil fields to tropical waters to Antarctica and even aquariums !
1. Barreleye Fish
Macropinna microstoma , or the barreleye fish has a transparent head and eyes that can roll around inside to see in all directions .
The green domes are its eyes ; the bits that look like eyes are organs more like nostrils .
Â
See a video of this fish in action .
2. Psychedlic Frogfish
Histiophryne psychedilica is the new name of the frogfish discovered in the waters off Indonesia .
This weird - looking fish hops along the bottom of the ocean using his fins as legs and his gills as a jet - propulsion unit .
See a video here .
3. Solar Sea Slug
Elysia chlorotica pushes the limits of what is plant and what is animal .
This sea slug harnesses the power of the sun by eating algae and then incorporating the alga 's chlorophyll into its own system .
After two weeks of ingesting algae , the slug can go without eating anything for a year - as long as it's exposed to sunlight .
4. Dracula Fish
Danionella dracula , or dracula fish is a new species discovered by accident when a shipment of aquarium fish were found to be very different from what the Natural History Museum in London expected .
When the fish died , autopsies revealed that instead of teeth , the Dracula fish has bone spike protruding from its jaws !
They are native to one particular stream in Burma , but may be lurking in other aquariums all over the world .
5. Trilobitoides
Ceratoserolis trilobitoides is an isopod that resembles a prehistoric trilobite .
This one was found during an international Antarctic expedition last year called the Census of Marine Life .
6. Tunicates
The Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census sent three ships on a two - month mission to Antarctica to study marine life in late 2007 .
Among the weird species they found were these tunicates that look like tulips growing out of the sea floor .
They are actually animals that feed by pumping sea water through their stems .
They grow up to a meter tall .
7. Magnapinna
The rarely seen Magnapinna squid was recorded on video in 2007 by a Shell Oil remotely - controlled exploration vehicle at a depth of 7800 feet in the Gulf of Mexico .
Scientists can't tell which exact species it is , either M. atlantica or M. pacifica , both of which inhabit the Gulf of Mexico .
8. Vampire Squid from Hell
Vampyroteuthis infernalis literally means " vampire squid from hell " .
Though technically neither a squid nor an octopus , this cephalopod shares traits with both .
It lives up to 3,000 feet deep in the ocean .
It has good control over its photospheres , spots that produce light .
It can pull its arms over its head like an umbrella to hide from attackers , but if some other creature bites an arm off , it will regenerate .
Instead of ink , the vampire squid can expel a cloud of bioluminescent mucus .
But you wo n't know how truly weird it is until you see it in action in this video .

Brief Four managers at a Caterpillar Inc plant in Grenoble are being held hostage by workers , AFP reports .
The agency cites an " unidentified union official " as the source of the latest French managment imprisonment news .
Earlier this month , workers at a Sony plant in Pontonx - sur - l ' Adour , south - west France , held the company 's local chief exec in protest at redundancy packages offered to 300 dismissed staff .
Last week , 3 M workers in Pithiviers , near Orleans , mounted a similar action , barricading the group 's industrial director in an office - a drastic move provoked by plans to lay off 110 employees .
In both cases , the captives were released once unions had been promised a return to the negotiating table . ®

By listening in on the chatter between neurons in various parts of the brain , researchers from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) have taken steps toward fully understanding just how memories are formed , transferred , and ultimately stored in the brain -- and how that process varies throughout the various stages of sleep .
Their findings may someday even help scientists understand why dreams are so difficult to remember .
Scientists have long known that memories are formed in the brain 's hippocampus , but are stored elsewhere -- most likely in the neocortex , the outer layer of the brain .
Transferring memories from one part of the brain to the other requires changing the strength of the connections between neurons and is thought to depend on the precise timing of the firing of brain cells .
" We know that if neuron A in the hippocampus fires consistently right before neuron B in the neocortex , and if there is a connection from A to B , then that connection will be strengthened , " explains Casimir Wierzynski , a Caltech graduate student in computation and neural systems , and first author on the Neuron paper .
" And so we wanted to understand the timing relationships between neurons in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex , which is the front portion of the neocortex . "
The research team - - led by Athanassios Siapas , a Bren Scholar in the Caltech Division of Biology and an associate professor of computation and neural systems -- used high - tech recording and computational techniques to listen in on the firing of neurons in the brains of rats .
These techniques helped them pinpoint a number of neuron pairs that had precisely the kind of synchronous relationship they were looking for -- one in which a hippocampal neuron 's firing was followed within milliseconds by the firing of a neuron in the prefrontal cortex .
" This is exactly the kind of relationship that would be needed for the hippocampus to effect changes in the neocortex - - such as the consolidation , or laying down , of memories , " adds Wierzynski .

Once these spike - timing relationships between the hippocampal and prefrontal cortex neurons had been established , the team used their high - tech eavesdropping techniques to hear what goes on in the brains of sleeping rats -- since sleep , as Siapas points out , has long been thought to be the optimal time for the memory consolidation .
As it turns out , those thoughts were right -- but only part of the time .
The team did indeed hear " bursts " of neuronal chatter during sleep -- but only during a phase of sleep known as slow - wave sleep ( SWS ) , the deep , dreamless periods of sleep .
" It turns out that during slow - wave sleep there are these episodes where a lot of the cells in the hippocampus will all fire very close to the same time , " says Wierzynski .
In response , some cells in the prefrontal cortex will fire in near unison as well , just milliseconds later .
" What 's interesting is that the bulk of the precise spike timing happens during these bursts , and not outside of these bursts , " he adds .
On the other hand , during rapid - eye - movement ( REM ) sleep , the previously chatty neuron pairs seemed to talk right past each other , firing at the same rates as before but no longer in concert .
" It was surprising , " says Wierzynski , " to find that the timing relationship almost completely went away during REM sleep . "
Since REM sleep is the phase during which dreaming occurs , the scientists speculate that this absence of memory - consolidating chatter may eventually help to explain why dreams can be so difficult to remember .

As intriguing as that idea may be , the researchers caution that these findings only raise possibilities , providing avenues for further research in the field .
" Now that we 've shown this link , " says Siapas , " we have a framework we can use to study these questions further .
This is just a step toward our goal of some day fully understanding the relationship between memory and sleep . "
Other coauthors on the paper included Evgueniy Lubenov , a postdoctoral scholar in biology at Caltech , and Caltech graduate student Ming Gu .

Just when I thought I was out … they pull me back in .
Michael Corleone in The Godfather , Part 3
I had n’t planned on doing two vaccine posts with such a short interval between them , but all too often , as the they say in the weakest of the Godfather movies , I get pulled back in again .
So , after noting last week that 2009 was shaping up–fortunately –to be a very bad year for antivaccinationists , I should have expected a counterattack from the antivaccine fringe .
Indeed , the only thing that surprised me after the twin blows of the revelations about scientific fraud on the part of the originator of the claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism , Andrew Wakefield , and the resounding defeat of the first three test cases of the Autism Omnibus proceedings , was that it took longer than I had expected .
True , a group had formed , proclaiming that “ we support Dr. Andrew Wakefield . ”
Also true , the antivaccine activists at the Age of Autism have been working overtime to attack the Autism Omnibus as being hopelessly rigged .
Indeed , our “ old friend ” Dr. Jay Gordon has even likened attempts to refute antivaccine pseudoscience to tobacco companies ’
P.R. and astroturf campaigns back in the 1950s through 1980s to cast doubt on the strong scientific and epidemiological evidence showing that cigarettes cause lung cancer .
But those contortions of science , epidemiology , law , and logic were merely a warmup for the real counterattack .
On February 25 , Generation Rescue purchased this full page ad in USA Today :
Unfortunately , the advertisement above was only the beginning .
Generation Rescue managed to team up the chief progagandist for the antivaccine movement , David Kirby , along with Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , whom I have discussed before for his total support of the antivaccine movement .
The question then becomes :
Where would these two team up to spread their message against vaccines ?
Do you even have to ask ?
Their twin articles appear on that repository of all things antivaccine , The Huffington Post , under the title Vaccine Court : Autism Debate Continues .
As I will explain , these twin articles represent yet another example of what I have at times referred to as the “ incredibly shrinking vaccine - autism hypothesis . ”
Let ’s take a look first at the article by RFK , Jr. , Another Autism Case Wins in Vaccine Court :
The New York Times joined the government Health Agency ( HRSA ) and its big pharma allies hailing the decisions as proof that the scientific doubts about vaccine safety had finally been “ demolished . ”
The US Department of Health and Human services said the rulings should “ help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism . ”
The Times , which has made itself a blind mouthpiece for HRSA and a leading defender of vaccine safety , joined crowing government and vaccine industry flacks applauding the decisions like giddy cheerleaders , rooting for the same court that many of these same voices viscously derided just one year ago , after Hannah Poling won compensation for her vaccine induced autism .
But last week , the parents of yet another child with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) were awarded a lump sum of more than $ 810,000 ( plus an estimated $ 30 - 40,000 per year for autism services and care ) in compensation by the Court , which ruled that the measels - mumps - rubella ( MMR ) vaccine had caused acute brain damage that led to his autism spectrum disorder .
Yes , it ’s the Hannah Poling case all over again , except this time the antivaccine movement is not rebranding autism as a mitochondrial disorder .
What it is trying to rebrand autism as again , you will see in a moment .
In the meantime , RFK , Jr. spins and twists :
The family of 10 - year - old Bailey Banks won their case quietly and without fanfare in June of 2007 , but the ruling has only now come to public attention .
In the remarkably clear and eloquent decision , Special Master Richard Abell ruled that the Banks had successfully demonstrated that “ the MMR vaccine at issue actually caused the conditions from which Bailey suffered and continues to suffer . ”
Bailey ’s diagnosis is Pervasive Developmental Disorder — Not Otherwise Specified ( PDD - NOS ) which has been recognized as an autism spectrum disorder by CDC , HRSA and the other federal health agencies since at least the 1990s .
PDD - NOS is indeed one of the conditions that fall under the category of disorders known as autistic spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) and is thus considered an ASD .
The ruling concluded that , in the case of Bailey Banks , the MMR had caused a condition known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( ADEM ) .
Here is the passage that RFK , Jr. quotes in his HuffPo article :
The Court found that Bailey ’s ADEM was both caused - in - fact and proximately caused by his vaccination .
It is well - understood that the vaccination at issue can cause ADEM , and the Court found , based upon a full reading and hearing of the pertinent facts in this case , that it did actually cause the ADEM .
Furthermore , Bailey ’s ADEM was severe enough to cause lasting , residual damage , and retarded his developmental progress , which fits under the generalized heading of Pervasive Developmental Delay , or PDD [ an autism spectrum disorder ] .
The Court found that Bailey would not have suffered this delay but for the administration of the MMR vaccine , and that this chain of causation was … a proximate sequence of cause and effect leading inexorably from vaccination to Pervasive Developmental Delay .
This is not an exact quote of what Special Master Richard Abell ’s ruling .
Note the term “ an autism spectrum disorder ” in brackets .
There ’s just one problem .
PDD is not an autistic spectrum disorder .
Let ’s look at the very beginning of the Special Master ’s ruling :
On 26 June 2002 , the Petitioner filed a petition for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 ( Vaccine Act or Act ) 2 alleging that , as a result of the MMR vaccination received on 14 March 2000 , his child , Bailey , suffered a seizure and Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis ( “ ADEM ” ) , 3 which led to Pervasive Developmental Delay ( “ PDD ” ) , a condition from which he continues to suffer ( the “ Petition ” ) .
Note the difference .
The claim in the ruling is not that ADEM led to pervasive developmental disorder , not otherwise specialized ( PDD - NOS ) .
The ruling is about pervasive developmental delay ( PDD ) .
The difference is more than a matter of semantics , as Kev points out .
PDD is not the same thing as PDD - NOS .
In fact , the ruling itself makes this point very , very clear in one of its footnotes :
Pervasive Developmental Disorder , Not Otherwise Specified ( PDD - NOS ) is a ‘ subthreshold ’ condition in which some – but not all – features of autism or another explicitly identified Pervasive Developmental Disorder are identified .
PDD - NOS is often incorrectly referred to as simply “ PDD . ”
The term PDD refers to the class of conditions to which autism belongs .
PDD is NOT itself a diagnosis , while PDD - NOS IS a diagnosis .
The term Pervasive Developmental Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified ( PDD - NOS ; also referred to as “ atypical personality development , ” “ atypical PDD , ” or “ atypical autism ” ) is included in DSM - IV to encompass cases where there is marked impairment of social interaction , communication , and / or stereotyped behavior patterns or interest , but when full features for autism or another explicitly defined PDD are not met .
In fact , PDD - NOS is a subset of PDD , but there are other forms of PDD .
This is what RFK , Jr. says about it :
Bailey ’s diagnosis is Pervasive Developmental Disorder — Not Otherwise Specified ( PDD - NOS ) which has been recognized as an autism spectrum disorder by CDC , HRSA and the other federal health agencies since at least the 1990s .
It ’s not .
Read the decision .
Granted , the terms PDD and PDD - NOS seem to be used almost interchangeably and sloppily so , but latching on to that does n’t “ prove ” anything .
In fact , if you read through the ruling , you ’ll also see that even the facts of the case do not represent the slam dunk that RFK , Jr. seems to think they do .
Indeed , the Special Master even acknowledges that and feels the need to justify his decision :
Despite their accord on certain factual predicates contained in Bailey ’s medical records , there is , unsurprisingly , a pronounced conflict between the parties as to the following issues : whether a biologically plausible link exists between ADEM and pervasive developmental delay ( PDD ) in a direct chain of causation , whether Bailey did in fact suffer from ADEM , and ultimately whether the administration of the MMR vaccine to Bailey actually caused ADEM which would then cause PDD that currently besets Bailey today .
Note that Special Master Abell referred to PDD as “ pervasive developmental delay . ”
I ’ll grant you ( and even the antivaccine movement ) that Abell seems to flip back and forth between using PDD to mean pervasive developmental delay or PDD - NOS in a confusing manner , trying to explain himself in the footnotes and failing .
My point is not that Bailey Banks does n’t have PDD - NOS .
Rather , it is that the antivaccine fringe reads far more into the terminology than is warranted .
Reading the entire judgment , whatever neurological disorder Bailey has , I consider it arguable whether Bailey actually has an ASD .
He very well might have PDD - NOS ; he might not .
In fact , the title of the ruling should tell you how sure Special Master Abell was that the MMR caused Bailey Banks ’ autism : Non-autistic developmental delay ; Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis ; Expert Credibility ; Evidentiary Reliability ; Scientific Validity ; Burden of Proof ; Causation in Fact ; Proximate Causation .
More importantly , even if Bailey does have PDD - NOS , the chain of causality gets more strained when we consider ADEM .
For one thing , it ’s not even entirely clear that Bailey actually had ADEM , as the testimony in the case reveals .
However , clearly something happened ; so , for the sake of argument , let ’s say for the moment that he definitely did suffer a vaccine - induced incident of ADEM .
Here ’s where the problem comes in :
There ’s close to no scientific literature to support an epidemiological or pathologic link between ADEM or PDD ( or PDD - NOS , for that matter ) .
Basically , the ruling is best read as saying that in this case MMR probably ( i.e. , with a 51 % or more probability ) caused Bailey ’s ADEM , a rare condition after vaccination that is compensable , and that Bailey ’s ADEM further might have resulted in PDD or PDD - NOS .
That ’s a lot different than RFK , Jr. ’s confident assertion that this case is a slam - dunk indication that the Vaccine Court has accepted the general principle that vaccines can cause autism .
Such nuances undermine the antivaccine spin on the case , however ; so they ca n’t be mentioned .
What I find more troubling , however , is this statement in Special Master Abell ’s ruling , quoted by David Kirby in his article :
In response , Respondent ’s expert stated that , although ADEM may result in “ permanent neurological sequelae , ” nevertheless “ all the medical literature is negative in that regard ; ” however , soon thereafter , he corrected this statement by clarifying , “ I can find no literature relating ADEM to autism or [ PDD ] . ” Tr. at 84 - 85 .
It may be that Respondent ’s research reveals a dearth of evidence linking ADEM to PDD , but that is not the same as positive proof that the two are unrelated , something Respondent was unable to produce .
Therefore , the statement that “ all the medical literature is negative ” is incorrect .
I have one request of anyone who fervently believes that the Vaccine Court is overwhelmingly biased against the petitioners who bring cases before it .
Read the above paragraph .
Then read it again .
Then read it over and over .
That single paragraph tells you all you need to know about the true attitude and “ bias ” of the Vaccine Court , which most definitely are not what Kirby represents them as .
The above paragraph reveals a Special Master of the Vaccine Court bending over backwards to give the petitioner ’s experts the benefit of the doubt even in the absence of any positive peer - reviewed medical literature supporting the petitioner ’s hypothesis of causation for the vaccine injury claimed .
Abell even appears to be chiding the government ’s expert witness for being too particular about actually requiring some evidence published in the peer - reviewed journals to back the petitioner ’s claim that the MMR caused ADEM , which resulted in PDD - NOS .
Moreover , Abell ’s statement above that the observation that there is a “ dearth of evidence linking ADEM to PDD , but that is not the same as positive proof that the two are unrelated ” suggests that he think that science can ever “ positively ” prove a negative .
It cannot ; it can only suggest probabilities .
In any case , the Special Master appears to be going beyond even that .
He appears to be looking for a reason to reject the Respondent ’s defense .
Now do n’t get me wrong .
Special Master
Abell ’s misunderstanding of how science works aside , for the most part , as a matter of public health policy this bias of the Vaccine Court towards granting petitioners ’ claims is probably a good thing .
After all , if we as a society are going to require mass vaccination programs of our children , even though the benefits far outweigh the risks , there are small risks , and there will always be a small number of adverse events .
Children who suffer an adverse event deserve to be compensated in an expeditious fashion .
Indeed , the Vaccine Court was set up to do just that by streamlining the compensation process .
Given that Bailey had a reaction close enough to his vaccination that the law considers it likely that the vaccination caused it as a matter of law , it is probably not unreasonable that the Vaccine Court decided to compensate him .
But , please , let ’s not confuse a legal ruling with science .
As I pointed out when I discussed the recent rejection of the claims of causation by the first three test case petitioners in the Autism Omnibus , I was pleasantly surprised that , in the instance of the Omnibus at least , the law got the science right .
Far too often , it does not .
The rulings and litigation over silicone breast implants that bankrupted Dow - Corning in the 1990s come to mind .
To boil it all down , the antivaccine movement is doing nothing other than what it did in the Hannah Poling case , attempting to “ rebrand ” autism .
RFK , Jr. and David Kirby are throwing people a big red herring .
What the court admitted is that Bailey ’s seizures occurred soon enough after the MMR to be considered a vaccine injury and accepted that his neurologic problems could be the result .
It did not “ admit that vaccines cause autism ” any more than it did in the Hannah Poling case .
Indeed , it bent over backward to give the petitioner every opportunity to come up with a concept of how vaccines might contribute to autism and argue it , primarily based on the relatively close temporal proximity .
It even in essence ignored testimony that there was no convincing evidence in the peer - reviewed medical literature linking ADEM to PDD .
I did the PubMed searches myself , and there really is n’t much of anything .
David Kirby , characteristically , is a bit more careful–and , of course , weaselly –about the issue .
Clearly he is the smarter and cleverer of the two .
What Kirby does is to throw Andrew Wakefield under the bus , metaphorically speaking , at least as far as how he claimed that MMR caused autism :
Is vaccine - induced ADEM ( and similar disorders ) a neurological gateway for a subset of children to go on and develop an ASD ?
That question will now become subject to debate .
Thousands of parents have reported similar reactions and symptoms following vaccination , yet they lack radiological proof of ADEM or related disorders in the form of an MRI .
Meanwhile , most children with autism do not present with myelin damage , but many do test positive for antibodies to myelin basic protein ( MBP ) .
But what were these reactions ?
Kirby described them earlier :
Most cases of ADEM ( 80 % ) are in children .
Symptoms usually appear within a few days to a couple of weeks .
They include : headache , delirium , lethargy , seizures , stiff neck , fever , ataxia ( incoordination ) , optic nerve damage , nausea , vomiting , weight loss , irritability and changes in mental status .
I know of thousands of parents who witnessed many of these same symptoms afflict their children shortly after vaccination , most typically the MMR .
Did these children with autism also suffer initially from ADEM or some subclinical version of the disorder ?
We may never know ( physical signs like myelin damage are transitory ) .
This is yet another “ I ’m just asking ” gambit by David Kirby , the same sort of rhetorical prestidigitation he performed for the Hannah Poling case , connecting condition after condition without any firm scientific evidence that a connection is warranted , each connection getting more tenuous as he continues .
He ’s also playing a subtler game that that in that he is implicitly attributing all sorts of nonspecific neurological symptoms to “ regressive autism ” without specifically saying that that ’s what he ’s doing .
Let ’s look at it this way .
Again , let ’s go beyond what we conceded to the antivaccine movement for the sake of argument .
Let ’s concede that , in the case of Bailey Banks , MMR caused ADEM , which then lead to PDD - NOS or even full blown autism , exactly as David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. are claiming .
Here ’s the problem .
ADEM occurring after vaccination is very rare–so rare that , epidemiologically , it has been very difficult to determine whether it ’s even correlated with a vaccine at all .
For example , this study looking at post - marketing adverse events from vaccines in Japan reported the total estimated incidence of serious neurological incidents , including ADEM , encephalitis or encephalopathy , and Guillain - Barré syndrome , after vaccination as being in the range of 0.1 - 0.2 per million immunization practices .
That ’s incredibly rare .
Fellow SBM blogger Dr. Lipson has pointed out that the incidence of ADEM after measles and some other viral infections is 5,000 to 10,000 times higher than after vaccination , on the order of 1 in 1,000 .
In other words , even in the worst case scenario and granting every single link between vaccines , ADEM , and ASDs that David Kirby and RFK , Jr. speculate about , the risk of a child ’s suffering a bout of ADEM after getting the measles is several orders of magnitude higher than it is after MMR vaccination –if there even is an elevated risk of ADEM after MMR vaccination at all !
By David Kirby ’s and RFK , Jr. ’s own arguments , vaccination with MMR is vastly safer and vastly less likely to result in neurological sequelae than not vaccinating .
Of course , Kirby has a ready answer for this :
ADEM is said to be rare , but the disorder may be grossly under - diagnosed ( or misdiagnosed ) .
Even the government ’s chief witness against Bailey ’s case testified that he sees patients with ADEM “ on a fairly regular basis .
Note the cleverness , so pathognomonic of Kirby ’s writing style .
ADEM itself may not be incredibly rare , but ADEM associated with vaccination is very rare and much more common after at least one of the diseases that vaccination prevents .
At the end of the article , Kirby repeats the sentiment :
People will argue that ADEM is rare ; that vaccines “ only ” caused PDD in Bailey ; and that this was a legal and not scientific decision .
The problem is we do n’t know how prevalent ADEM is because we never looked ; while “ PDD ” is interchangeable with “ ASD ” in the language of public health .
And , the three cases that lost were also “ legal ” decisions .
This is just plain incorrect .
Scientists and doctors have looked .
There are numerous epidemiological studies and post - marketing surveillance studies looking for neurological sequelae after vaccination , be it with MMR or any other childhood vaccine .
These studies just have n’t found what Kirby wants them to find .
I strongly suspect that Kirby ’s definition o which is why his definition of “ look ” is to do CT scans and MRIs on every child brought to the emergency room with any complaint at all after vaccination .
Also remember that Bailey underwent an MRI because he had a seizure associated with fever .
I have on occasion referred to the vaccine - autism hypothesis as the “ incredible shrinking causation hypothesis . ”
This tag - team assault by two luminaries of the antivaccine movement is yet more evidence of just how puny this hypothesis has become .
Remember , the original claim of the antivaccine movement was not that a couple of very rare conditions predispose a child to vaccine injury , which predisposes them to developing autism .
It was not that vaccines might cause autism in one or even two in a million children .
No !
It was that vaccines are a major cause , if not the main cause of an alleged “ autism epidemic ” that has been going on since the mid-1990s .
Of course , the real cause of the apparent increase in autism diagnoses appears to be largely due to diagnostic substitution and the broadening of the diagnostic criteria for autism , but to antivaccine advocates , correlation must equal causation , and the increase in autism diagnoses correlated roughly with an increase in the number of vaccines in the recommended childhood vaccine schedule .
In the case of the discredited hypothesis that the mercury in the thimerosal preservatives in vaccines causes autism , Generation Rescue , for example , before its shifting of the goalposts declared autism to be a “ misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning ” due to vaccines .
After the science became so overwhelming that even antivaccine activists had a hard time blaming autism on thimerosal anymore , GR describes autism in much vaguer terms :
We believe these neurological disorders ( “ NDs ” ) are environmental illnesses caused by an overload of heavy metals , live viruses , and bacteria .
Proper treatment of our children , known as “ biomedical intervention ” , is leading to recovery for thousands .
The cause of this epidemic of NDs is extremely controversial .
We believe the cause includes the tripling of vaccines given to children in the last 15 years ( with unstudied ingredients like mercury , aluminum and live viruses ) ; growing evidence also suggests that maternal toxic load and prenatal vaccines , heavy metals like mercury in our air , toxic ingredients in our water , pesticides ; and the overuse of antibiotics are also implicated .
Generation Rescue ’s mission is to support continued research on causative factors and treatment approaches for NDs .
So what do we have now from the antivaccine movement , now that the thimerosal hypothesis has been discredited scientifically and Andrew Wakefield ’s MMR work has been thoroughly repudiated ?
Vague ideas about “ toxins ” in vaccines .
I want to emphasize it again :
What we now see now is truly the incredibly shrinking hypothesis .
By latching onto a rare mitochondrial disorder as the “ linking factor ” between vaccines and autism last year and now latching onto a very rare possible complication of vaccination , ADEM , as a “ gateway ” to autism , using only a questionable legal ruling and in essence no science , Kirby and Kennedy are showing just how small the vaccine hypothesis for autism has become .
Even if such a link exists between the MMR and ADEM and autism and is ultimately scientifically confirmed ( unlikely ) it could not possibly account for very many cases of autism–just as mitochondrial disorders could n’t account for very many cases .
Moreover , even more so than neurological complications in children with mitochondrial disorders , neurological complications due to ADEM are more likely to occur in the unvaccinated because measles is more likely in such children .
Science , facts , and reason notwithstanding , look for a lot of very bad “ science ” to pour out of the “ labs ” of Thoughtful House , Mark and David Geier ’s basement , and Boyd Haley ’s lab , wherever that may be these days .
I also find it rather convenient that the antivaccine movement seemingly forgot all about this particular ruling .
After all , the ruling was originally issued in 2007 and Kathleen Seidel even blogged about it and other similar rulings nearly a year ago .
One wonders why Generation Rescue waited until now to trot it out .
Coincidence ?
I think not .
Here ’s what I think , and I believe I have good reason behind my thinking : Pre-Autism Omnibus ruling , even the antivaccine movement considered the Banks case thin gruel , too thin to make much of a stink about .
Indeed , if that were n’t the case , the Banks case would almost certainly have received major hype when its ruling was originally announced a year and a half ago .
I also do n’t buy the argument that this ruling was “ hidden . ”
The antivaccine movement is very aware of rulings made by the Vaccine Court , as they are always looking for a ruling to use .
Now , post - Autism Omnibus ruling and Andrew Wakefield revelations , the antivaccine movement needs something to distract people from the drubbing they ’ve taken scientifically and legally .
So they pull an old ruling out of the closet , tart it up a bit using their post - Poling spin skills , and send it flouncing down the runway in the hope that it impresses .
And if that does n’t work , RFK , Jr. in his own inimitable fashion cranks up the paranoia :
Although the vaccine court is mandated to fairly serve the victims of vaccine injuries , their primary purpose and raison d’etre is to protect the vaccine program and vaccine makers .
Damages are doled out from a 75 - cent tax on every vaccine sold and not from the vaccine makers .
“ You can understand why special masters , burdened with their duty to protect vaccine programs , might be unwilling to make the direct causal link between autism and vaccines , ” Krakow observed .
“ If you ask the big question and answer it in the affirmative , there is a sense that it will damage the vaccine program irreparably . ”
Vaccine Court judges are equipped with a draconian armory of weapons deployable against plaintiffs intent on proving the causal connection between vaccines and autism .
Jury trials are prohibited .
Damages are capped ; awards for pain and suffering are strictly limited and punitive damages banned altogether .
Vaccine defenders have an army of Department of Justice attorneys with virtually unlimited resources for expert witnesses and other litigation costs .
Plaintiffs , in contrast , must fund the up front costs for experts on their own .
In a cultural choice that clearly favors defendants , vaccine court gives overwhelming weight to written medical records which are often inaccurate — over all other forms of testimony and evidence .
Observations by parents and other caretakers are given little weight .
I have one question for David Kirby and RFK , Jr. :
If the proceedings of the Vaccine Court are so rigged against the petitioners , why is it that the U.S. government pays their legal fees , win or lose ?
Readers may or may not have heard of a certain lawyer named Clifford Shoemaker , who abused the subpoena process to punish Kathleen Seidel .
What caused him to go after Kathleen Seidel with legal thuggery ?
What led him to take abusive retaliatory legal action was Seidel ’s revelation of just how much money he had made from representing Vaccine Court petitioners .
In fact , the Vaccine Court goes beyond paying legal fees , even for those who lose .
As Kathleen Seidel has explained , the law guarantees payment of attorney ’s fees and costs incurred by petitioners in presenting a claim to the Vaccine Court , as long as the claim is brought in good faith and the costs are deemed reasonable and necessary .
Particularly odd to me is RFK , Jr. ’s rant that the court gives overwhelming weight to written medical records .
What on earth else is the court supposed to give the most weight to when considering medical - legal claims ?
Humans are very prone to confusing correlation with causation , as well as confirmation bias , and the tendency to subconsciously adjust memories to conform to beliefs .
Medical records may indeed be fallible , but eyewitness testimony is even more fallible .
Indeed , the Michelle Cedillo case shows that , given how the parents insisted that her neurological problems started after her vaccine .
Videotapes made by her parents before she was vaccinated and before her neurologic symptoms manifested themselves to her parents showed that her abnormalities were pre-existing .
Experts could see the early signs ; her parents did n’t know what to look for and did not .
Finally , to cap off the advertisement in USA Today and the tag team crankfest of David Kirby and RFK , Jr. , Generation Rescue pulls out all the stops , trotting out–yes , you guessed it !
–Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey .
Check out this press release :
“ It was heartbreaking to hear about Bailey ’s story , but through this ruling we are gaining the proof we need to open the eyes of the world to the fact that vaccines do , in fact , cause autism , ” said Jenny McCarthy , Hollywood actress , autism activist , best - selling author and Generation Rescue board member .
“ Bailey Banks ’ regression into autism after vaccination is the same story I went through with my own son and the same story I have heard from thousands of mothers and fathers around the country .
Our hope is that this ruling will influence decision and policy - makers to help the hundreds of thousands of children and families affected by this terrible condition . ”
Chiming in immediately after is her boyfriend :
Jim Carrey , Hollywood legend and Generation Rescue board member , reacted to the news , “ It seems the U.S. government is sending mixed messages by telling the world that vaccines do n’t cause autism , while , at the same time , they are quietly managing a separate ‘ vaccine court ’ that is ruling in favor of affected families and finding that vaccines , in fact , were the cause .
For most of the autism community the question is no longer whether vaccines caused of their child ’s autism .
The question is why is their government only promoting the rulings that are in favor of the vaccine companies . ”
No , Jim , the question is why you and Jenny think your Google University education and personal anecdotal experience trumps science , epidemiology , and the accumulated knowledge based on mountains of epidemiological and scientific evidence , and why you think that a legal ruling on science decides science .
I could go on , so much misinformation is there , especially in RFK , Jr. ’s article , where he complains to high heaven about how plaintiffs ’ attorneys supposedly can’t get access to the Vaccine Safety Datalink .
Likely this is another one of RFK , Jr. ’s exaggerations , but even if it were n’t , I ’d have to wonder if , assuming the court may be indeed reluctant to give plaintiff ’s attorneys access to the VSD , this reluctance has anything to do with concerns about the confidential medical information under HIPAA for the millions of medical records contained in that database .
Or perhaps it is knowledge of how Mark and David Geier once tried to alter file extensions and merge datasets , very possibly to match names with cases .
True , they denied it , but as Kathleen Seidel wrote :
To justify their attempt to merge datasets , they refer to the absence of direct identifiers in patient records , apparently unaware or dismissive of the well - documented fact that aggregation of indirect identifiers ( such as race , sex , birthweight , APGAR , maternal age , gestation , and date of vaccination ) would compromise the confidentiality of private health information .
Modern data mining software heightens the risk that patient confidentiality might be compromised by statistical researchers , hence the proliferation of guidelines for the conduct of such research .
Of course , legitimate researchers can get access to the VSD .
Even lawyers for petitioners for the Vaccine Court can get access .
Indeed , numerous studies have looked at the VSD data on vaccines , none finding any correlation between vaccines or thimerosal in vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders .
If the antivaccine movement had any scientists other than crank scientists , it could do studies using the VSD data too .
All it takes is a protocol that can be approved by an IRB .
What we are seeing here is desperation .
The leadership of the antivaccine movement sees the writing on the wall .
Study after study have failed to find even a whiff of a link between mercury and autism or vaccines and autism .
The Vaccine Court , which , as the Banks case shows , is about as petitioner - friendly as can be , has recently conclusively ruled against the vaccine - autism hypothesis .
The hero of the antivaccine movement has been revealed for the world to see as not just a dishonest man in the pay of lawyers suing vaccine manufacturers and hiding his conflict of interest , not just an incompetent scientist , but as an outright scientific fraud .
They know that , in the reality - based world , the last nails are being driven into the coffin of the vaccine - autism hypothesis , which , zombie like , keeps pounding on the lid of the casket to try to loosen them and get out .
Science does not support them ; so all that is left is spin and P.R .
I have now owned my iPhone longer than any other mobile .
Over the past decade or so , I ’ve gone through a slew of pagers and cell phones .
None of them sticking around as long as my iPhone .
They each got boring or broken or sold on eBay .
The iPhone , however , still feels brand new to me even though it currently holds the longest tenure of any other phone I ’ve owned .
After 18 months of daily use , I ’ve develop quite a few habits and familiarities .
Such as the position I hold the phone when talking on it ; or the direction it goes into my pocket ; where I place in my car ; the way I spin it when I ’m bored ; or how I hit the Lock button to end a phone conversation .
There is one thing that I still have not gotten used to : the location of the ‘ Decline ’ and ‘ Answer ’ buttons when there ’s an incoming call and the phone ’s screen is not locked .
This throws me off every single time .
My screen is nearly always locked ; it ’s another one of my habits .
I always lock it when I ’m done with it , even if it ’s sitting on my desk .
Leaving the screen unlocked is like leaving the top off a bottle of Coke — it just feels wrong .
And besides , it wastes the battery .
And so , when my phone rings , it usually looks something like this :
But inevitably there are the times when I get an incoming call and , for whatever reason , the screen is not locked .
( Usually because I ’m using the phone for any number of reasons other than talking on it . )
And when that is the case , the incoming call screen looks a bit different :
The reason you have to “ slide to answer ” an incoming call on a locked screen is so you do n’t accidentally reach into your pocket and answer a call you did n’t want to .
But if the screen is already unlocked you are given a different way to answer .
You now have the option to simply tap a button to answer or tap another to decline .
The locked versus unlocked options make sense .
If you ’re in the middle of using your phone and someone calls but you want to decline , it does n’t make sense to wait 15 seconds for the thing to finally stop ringing , or be forced to lock your phone .
The feature here is n’t the ease of answering a call — tapping the Answer button is just about as simple as sliding — rather , it ’s the ability to quickly decline the call and get right back to what you were doing .
The trouble happens if you do want to answer the call .
Now you ’re dealing with the fact that iPhone offers two different locations to touch in order to answer an incoming call .
If answering from a locked - screen state , you touch the bottom - left corner and slide to the right ; if answering from a non-locked - screen state you touch the bottom - right corner .
If my screen is not locked and I answer an incoming call by muscle memory alone , chances are good I will accidentally decline the call when what I wanted was to answer it .
Usually what happens is I press the area of the screen where the Decline button is by habit , but then realize I ’m pressing ‘ Decline ’ and not ‘ Answer ’ .
So I hold my thumb down and slide it off the Decline button and then tap the Answer button .
If you do push the Decline button , and slide over onto the Answer button nothing happens because the Decline button is activated on release .
Unlike the single - tap - hack for the period button before the 1.1.1 software update , you ca n’t answer a phone call by starting on the Decline button , sliding over to Answer and then releasing ( a gesture that would duplicate the “ slide to answer ” action ) .
Furthermore , there are times that I press the Decline button , but realizing I pressed the wrong one , panic by letting off quickly and ( in this case ) sending my sister straight to voicemail .
( Sorry Sis . )
If your standard response to an incoming call is to answer it , then the standard location is actually not where you ’re used to it being — the bottom left corner .
On the other hand , if your standard response to an incoming call is to not answer it , this still does n’t justify the placement of the Decline button .
When locked , if you want to decline the call you can ( a ) ignore it , or ( b ) press the Lock button on the top of the phone two times ( one press to silence the ringer and another press to send the caller to voicemail ) .
You can still do this if the screen is unlocked and the Decline button is there , though it will interrupt your previous task .
This flip - flopped button placement does n’t end here …
On the Visual Voicemail screen , the green Call Back button can be found on the bottom - left .
During a phone call , if you navigate to the keypad , the red End Call button is the one on the bottom - left of the screen , whereas the “ continue - type ” button ( ‘ Hide Keypad ’ ) , though not green , is on the bottom - right .
Finally , the default location of the Phone App ’s green icon is the bottom - left corner of the iPhone ’s Dock .
Context vs. Consistency
As Jason Fried pointed out regarding the seemingly strange , right - hand alignment of the iTunes icon in the iPhone OS 1.1 update , button placement is not always done for the sake of consistency .
Sometimes it ’s for the sake of context .
They didnâ€™t put it where consistency tells you to put it .
That would be on the left side .
They put it where context tells you to put it .
On the right side right above the iPod icon .
Even the iconâ€™s arrow points right down to the iPod . [… ]
I love that Apple favored context over consistency in this design decision .
Consistency is the easy choice .
Context is the thinking choice .
Although the flip - flopping placement of iPhone ’s “ initiate a phone conversation ” buttons is not consistent , they may be rightly placed given each one ’s context .
On iPhone , standard movement between screens means that to get more detailed , or to “ drill down ” within an app , you should move to the right .
Getting less detailed , or “ drilling up ” , means you move to the left .
In context to the “ slide to answer ” button on a locked screen , the thumb moves from left to right — in essence , drilling down to the next screen which is , in this case , a live phone conversation .
If this is truly the case , then the Decline and Answer buttons on a non-locked screen — though opposite in terms of consistency — are accurate in terms of context .
To “ drill down ” to the next screen ( which is the live phone call ) you should be led to the right .
Thus , the placement of the Answer button on the right - hand side .
But wait …
Even though drilling down to more detail means moving to the right , and drilling up means moving to the left , those directions are almost always led by the buttons on the top of an application ’s screen , not the bottom ( i.e. Mail , Text , Settings , iPod , Notes and others ) .
On a phone with physical buttons there is no choice but to design by consistency because the buttons are always in the same place .
Since iPhone ’s screen has no physical buttons , the placement of each screen ’s buttons can also be designed to be relevant given the context of the current screen .
Thus , there are times when a design decision can be based on more than just consistency — it can also include context .
When writing about my MacBook Pro in early 2008 , I wrote about the implementation of multi- touch on the trackpad , saying :
Just like on the iPhone , the multi - touch gestures make perfect sense in context .
Which means I donâ€™t have to think about them .
Once I settled that three fingers swiping from left to right means â€œnextâ€ 
I find myself naturally using it in places I hadnâ€™t even thought about , without thinking about it .
It already feels natural .
In iCal the three - finger swipe takes you to the next or previous day / week / month in your calendar .
In Appleâ€™s Mail the swipe takes you to the next email message .
In Preview , you get the next page .
And itâ€™s the same with pinching :
On the desktop , pinching enlarges or shrinks your icon sizes .
In Preview , it enlarges the image or document .
My point being : when you are designing by context the user is best served when they do not have to stop and think about how to make the choice they ’re being presented with .
Consider context verses consistency in a car .
When driving forward , turning the steering wheel to the left turns the car to the left .
When driving in reverse , turning the steering wheel to the left turns the car to the right .
Imagine if auto engineers decided that turning the steering wheel to the left should always steer the car to the left rather than the wheels .
If that were the case , the front wheels may react completely opposite to the steering wheel ’s input depending on what gear the transmission was in .
There are times when designing by context is better than designing by consistency alone .
Though the placement of the Decline and Answer buttons may make sense in context , it is so far from consistency that , in this case , it is the wrong decision .
And after 18 months of use the dumb thing still throws me off .
A growing number of healthy bank chains across the country are bailing out of the $ 700 - billion federal banking bailout program , saying it has tarnished the reputation of banks that took the money and tangled them in unwieldy regulations .
When the program began last fall , it was billed by then - Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson as an investment in strong banks to make them even stronger .
Traditionally conservative local banks around the country began applying for the program , accepting Paulson ’s explanation that participation would be a sign of financial strength .
But not long after the program began , it became clear that the bulk of early funding was going to a handful of financially crippled giants such as Bank of America Corp. , Merrill Lynch & Co. , American International Group Inc. and Citigroup Corp .

“ It was supposed to be a badge of honor if you were able to get this money , but now it ’s a badge of honor if you did n’t take it , with all the bad publicity it has attracted , ” said Alan Rothenberg , chairman of 1st Century Bank in Century City .
Rothenberg ’s bank took a look at the Treasury program and decided to avoid it .
More than 100 banks were approved by federal regulators to get money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , and then backed out before getting any , a senior Treasury official disclosed .
The department said earlier this week that 489 banks have received funding and about another 1,000 are still being evaluated .
But a growing number of banks that have received the money now want to give it back .

“ The TARP money is tainted and we do n’t want it , ” said Jason Korstange , a spokesman for Minnesota - based TCF Financial Corp. , which received $ 361 million and announced this month that it wanted to pay it back .
“ The perception is that any bank that took this money is weak .
Well , that is n’t our case .
We were asked to take this money . ”
The bank issued a toughly worded statement earlier this year , saying that the money had put the financially strong banking chain at a “ competitive disadvantage ” and that the bank now believed it was “ in the best interest of shareholders ” to return it .
Chicago - based Northern Trust Corp. , which took $ 1.5 billion , seems even more anxious for a quick exit .
It found itself the object of national ridicule several weeks ago when it put on a golf tournament for its well - heeled customers at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades .
In a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , the bank said it did n’t need the money and in fact had a profit of $ 795 million in 2008 .
What ’s more , the golf outing , which has raised $ 50 million for charity through the years , did not draw on the federal funds , the bank said .
A spokesman said Tuesday that the bank wanted to pay the $ 1.5 billion back as fast as possible .

Frank , one of the toughest critics of the banks , was caught up in his own bank bailout controversy when he inserted legislation to assure TARP money for a bank in his own district .
He defended that action by saying the bank was a victim of the credit meltdown , not a cause of it .
When the program began in October , the Bush administration pushed banks to take the money , particularly the first nine big institutions that included Bank of America , Citigroup and Merrill Lynch .
At the time , it was n’t entirely clear how wobbly their conditions were , and so many healthy banks also jumped in , not anticipating what kind of party they were attending .
And some of those mid-size banks were strongly encouraged to accept the funds by federal regulators .
Wayne Abernathy , executive vice president of the American Bankers Assn. , said the financial industry now has a generally dim view of how the Treasury Department handled the program in its early days .
“ It was sold as something good for the economy and something showing that the participating banks are strong , but that is n’t how it played out , ” he said .
Advertisement
After the initial program was enacted , Congress went back and added provisions that covered executive compensation , financial disclosure requirements and conditions on acquisitions and mergers , Abernathy said .
“ It was not popular when it was born and it did n’t get any more popular as time went by , ” he said .
“ They added so many strings to it that it is pretty much unworkable . ”
For Rothenberg , the banker in Century City , the prospect of unlimited government intervention was too much .
“ The real issue was the clause that the government could change any of the terms , ” he said .
“ It was so open - ended . ”
Advertisement
Another issue was the cost of the money .
The banks had to pay the government 5 % interest .
“ It was billed as cheap money , but it really was n’t , ” Rothenberg said .
The TARP money was paid in exchange for preferred stock and would count as bank capital , which is the cushion that banks use to assure their solvency .
One of the biggest problems with the program was trying to explain to the public how it would affect lending .
Advertisement
Banks do n’t lend their capital .
They lend out of their deposits .
But some banks found that raising deposits was not easy , even with the added capital cushion , and loan demand was weak .
In many cases , banks did n’t like the public reaction .
Iberia Bank applied for the TARP money and received $ 90 million on Dec. 5 .
But the 88 - branch bank based in Lafayette , La. , was also the first bank in the nation to say it wanted to give it back .
Advertisement
“ We notified Treasury on Feb. 26 , ” said bank spokeswoman Beth Ardoin .
“ We do n’t feel that this is the right program for us .
We do n’t need the money . ”
Only a few banks formally have told the department they would return the money early , although others have signaled they intend to follow suit , a Treasury spokesman said .
So far , the banks are waiting to hear how they are supposed to return the money .
In a question - and - answer statement issued Feb. 26 , the Treasury Department told banks they that would have to consult with the regulatory agencies that oversee the institutions for procedures on returning the money .
Each bank has one of four federal agencies as its primary regulator , depending on how the bank is chartered .
Advertisement
In one of the questions and answers , Treasury said , “ What does the consultation with my primary regulator involve ? ”
The answer : “ Treasury is working . . . to determine what factors are involved in the consultation . ”
Industry officials say they are still awaiting an explanation .

Mr Galloway 's comments on Iraq led to his expulsion from the Labour Party George Galloway , a British member of Parliament , has been banned from Canada on security grounds , the country 's immigration service has confirmed .
Mr Galloway , a Respect Party MP , said the ban was " idiotic " and he would look at legal action to try to overturn it .
British media reported the decision was due to his views on Afghanistan and the presence of Canadian troops there .
The anti-war MP was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003 because of his outspoken comments on the Iraq war .
Mr Galloway said he was not prepared to accept what he described as an " inexplicable decision " and indicated he would challenge it with all means at his disposal .
" This has further vindicated the anti-war movement 's contention that unjust wars abroad will end up consuming the very liberties that make us who we are , " he said .
" All right - thinking Canadians , whether they agree with me or not , will oppose this outrageous decision . "
' Mock trial ' A spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada confirmed the MP would not be allowed into the country on national security grounds .
He said the decision had been taken by border security officials " based on a number of factors " in accordance with the country 's immigration act .
Mr Galloway had been due to speak at a public forum , Resisting War from Gaza to Kandahar , in Toronto on 30 March .
In 2006 he was detained " on grounds of national security " at Cairo airport after heading to Egypt to attend a " mock trial " of then PM Tony Blair and then US President George Bush .
Mr Galloway became the figurehead for the anti-war Respect party after being expelled from Labour .
His expulsion followed comments on the Iraq war which Labour chairman Ian McCartney said " incited foreign forces to rise up against British troops " .
The party acted following a number of TV interviews , including one in which Mr Galloway accused Tony Blair and President Bush of acting " like wolves " in invading Iraq .
Mr Galloway said it had been a " politically motivated kangaroo court " .

RhED is a program of Star Health that provides a range of health , safety and legal information for sex workers in Victoria .
Sure , we ’ve all heard of the common phobias such as claustrophobia , the fear of closed - in places , or acrophobia , the fear of heights .
In fact , we all have fears ; some people have more fears than others and some are severe while others are mild .
Some fears are completely unjustified , but if you say you do n’t have any fears , then perhaps one thing you ’re afraid of is telling the truth !
So , we ’ve established that fears are normal ; however , there are some individuals that are afraid of some not - so - normal things .
Sure , there are some strange phobias out there , but none stranger than that of things that do n’t exist .
1. Spectrophobia : Fear of ghosts ( Boo ! )
It ’s true that some people truly believe in ghosts and some do n’t so this is certainly up to your interpretation .
However , with the help of Hollywood with movies such as the Poltergeist movie series , the perception of ghost , whether you believe in them or not , is highly magnified ; not only on the big screen , but to the public .
Movies certainly help to let our imaginations go to new heights when it comes to creepy things such as ghosts .
Most people that have spectrophobia ( the fear of ghosts ) realize that this is an irrational fear and that there ’s truly nothing to be afraid of .
These people may be afraid to be in old , empty houses , dark places , or quiet woods , especially at night ; even though the logical side of them says that nothing will happen .
2. Ambulothanatophobia : Fear of zombies
Ambulothanatophobia is fear of the walking dead , or zombies .
It ’s a long name for something so irrational , but if you break it down , it makes sense .
Ambulo is Latin for “ walking ” , thanato is Latin for “ death ” , and of course phobia means “ fear ” .
This is a genuine fear in which it can be argued that Hollywood is somewhat responsible for with movies such as the Resident Evil movies and Dawn of the Dead .
Though most people realize that zombies are n’t real , individuals with this fear let their imaginations get the best of them .
3. Demonophobia ( also called Daemonophobia ) : Fear of demons
Demons are said to be evil spiritual beings .
Now , again we might run into an issue where some people think that demons are real while others feel that it ’s nonsense .
Either is fine , but individuals with this fear take the fear to the extreme and often realize that it ’s irrational .
Like people with spectrophobia ( mentioned above ) , people suffering from demonophobia would most likely be afraid to go into an old , dark house , or be alone in the woods .
4. Pneumatiphobia : Fear of spirits
Pneumatiphobia , the fear of spirits , is very similar to spectrophobia and demonophobia .
This fear however is more broad and open to all supposed forms of spirit life .
Because some people believe that there are spirits all around us , this can be a truly dehabilitating , though the individuals who suffer from it do realize how silly it is .
5. Wiccaphobia : Fear of witches
Though there are individuals that still have a fear of witches and witchcraft , it was a lot more prominent in the days of the Salem Witch Trials .
These days , we have people who openly practice witchcraft and it ’s perfectly lawful in the United States for them to do so .
However , if you have wiccaphobia , this could be very disturbing .
6. Sanguivoriphobia : Fear of vampires
The literal translation of sanguivoriphobia is “ the fear of blood eaters ” , or quite simply put , the fear of vampires .
Again , with all of the vampire movies out , some individuals are bound to go a little overboard and take things a bit too literally .
7. Teratophobia : Fear of monsters
Though not a very common fear in people over the age of ten years old , teratophobia ( the fear of monsters ) does indeed exist .
Though for the most part , we all suffered from it as a child for at least a short amount of time .
8. Phagophobia : Fear of eating , or being eaten
Perhaps phagophobia should be a fear in farm animals or wild game animals , but it ’s definitely an unreasonable fear for a human to have .
Though there have been some gruesome real stories over the years of true cannibalism , the chances of you really getting eaten are n’t very good .
9. Spakafobia : Fear of aliens
Now , here ’s one that can truly be controversial .
Do you believe in aliens ?
Maybe , maybe not .
Do you believe that people on Earth have ever been abducted by aliens ?
If you ’re a believer in the movie Fire in the Sky ( 1993 ) , then you certainly are .
Whether you believe in aliens or alien abductions or not , most of us can agree that the chances of you getting abducted are slim to none .
However , some people suffer from this fear so badly that they may even be afraid to leave their house .
10 . Capgras Syndrome : Fear of an individual being replaced by an imposter
Capgras Syndrome is actually a condition , but the condition is a fear .
Individuals with this condition fear that a person or people normally a spouse or immediate family member , has been abducted and replaced by an imposter that looks exactly the same .
Can you imagine trying to convince someone that you really are you ?
If they truly believe that you ’re not , they will only get more paranoid and defensive against you for trying to convince them otherwise .
11 . Ornithoscelidaphobia : Fear of dinosaurs
Individuals who suffer from ornithoscelidaphobia perhaps watched the Jurassic Park movies a little too much .
As any rational person can see , the fear of dinosaurs is a truly illegitimate fear since these animals have been extinct for a long time .
It ’s quite possible that people suffering from this fear also realize that it ’s irrational , but they ca n’t help it .
12 . Automatonophobia : Fear of wax statues , ventriloquist dummies
The fear of wax statues and ventriloquist dummies , or automatonophobia , is caused by people thinking that these inanimate objects will come alive .
While it ’s true that the items these people are afraid of exist , the fear of what they believe may happen is n’t real .
Of course movies such as Child ’s Play harbor that fear in people .
Remember Chuckie ?
13 . Gnomophobia : Fear of gnomes
Gnomophobia is the fear of garden gnomes .
Of course no one is afraid of a garden gnome if they realize that it ’s an inanimate object .
However , some people are afraid that the gnome may come to life and attack them .
Perhaps this is a childhood fear that some people never grew out of .
14 . Santaphobia : Fear of Santa Clause
When you were a child , you may have suffered from Santaphobia , the fear of Santa Clause .
Why not ?
Your parents try to teach you not to talk to strangers and then they put you on some fat guy ’s lap .
The guy is covered in hair and red clothing .
What are you supposed to feel ?
Seriously , there are some children that have the fear for longer than a season or two and it can put a slight crimp in the holiday festivities .
15 . Bogyphobia : Fear of the boogieman
Seriously , this is a true phobia .
Sure , you may have feared the boogieman when you were a child , but some people do n’t outgrow it .
Some individuals have been known to have full blown anxiety attacks from fearing that the boogieman will get them .
Scientists have a hunch rising temperatures due to human activity are making fire and flood more likely
Scientists are reluctant to link ­individual weather events to global warming , because natural variability will always throw up extreme events .
However , they say that climate change loads the dice , and can make severe episodes more likely .
Some studies have started to say how much global warming contributed to severe weather .
Experts at the UK Met Office and Oxford University used computer models to say man-made climate change made the killer European heatwave in 2003 about twice as likely .
In principle , the technique could be repeated with any extreme storm , drought or flood – which could pave the way for lawsuits from those affected .
Bob Brown , a senator who leads the Australian Greens , said the bushfires showed what climate change could mean for Australia .
" Global warming is predicted to make this sort of event happen 25 % , 50 % more , " he told Sky News .
" It 's a sobering reminder of the need for this nation and the whole world to act and put at a priority our need to tackle climate change . "
Models suggest global warming could bring temperature rises as high as 6C for Australia this century , if global emissions continue unabated , with rainfall decreasing in the southern states and increasing further north .
As if to demonstrate that , Queensland , in the north , is currently experiencing widespread flooding after rainfall of historic proportions .
More than 60 % of Queensland has been declared a disaster zone in the worst floods for more than 30 years .
Some 3,000 homes have been affected , and the main highway between Cairns and Townsville has been cut off .
Roger Stone , a climate expert at the University of Southern Queensland , said : " It certainly fits the climate change models , but I have to add the proviso that it 's very difficult , even with extreme conditions like this , to always attribute it to climate change . "
The fires and floods come as politicians gear up to negotiate a new global deal to combat climate change , to replace the Kyoto protocol .
Australia plans a comprehensive carbon trading scheme , but green campaigners last year accused Kevin Rudd 's government of a " betrayal " when it pledged to reduce emissions by a modest 5 - 15 % by 2020 .
Professor Mark Adams , from the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre , said the extreme weather conditions that led to the bushfires are likely to occur more often .
" The weather and climatic conditions recently do n't augur well for the future .
Bushfires are an important and going to be ever - present part of the landscape , " he said .
Australia is in the grip of the worst drought in a century , which has stretched for more than seven years in some areas and has forced restrictions on water use in the country 's big cities .
A government - commissioned report on climate change last year warned that exceptionally hot years , which used to occur once every 22 years , would occur every one or two years , virtually making drought a permanent part of the Australian environment .

Hu Xiaoyan 's cramped dormitory rooms are also her office Hu Xiaoyan is an unassuming migrant worker and a mother of twin girls - she is also a celebrity .
Last year the 35 - year - old was the first ever migrant worker to become a member of the country 's national parliament .
Her appointment was an attempt by China 's top leaders to show its citizens that ordinary people have a part to play in national politics .
But Ms
Hu's first year has not gone well .
Fellow workers complain she is of little use , and she herself admits that she has no power .
The migrant worker is among nearly 3,000 delegates in Beijing for this year 's annual session of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) .
Delegates from across the country will hear about developments over the past year and future policies at the nine - day session , which begins on Thursday .
The NPC is supposed to be China 's highest decision - making body but , as Ms Hu revealed to the BBC , its delegates have little say in national policy .
Plucked from obscurity Ms Hu left her home in Sichuan Province more than 10 years ago in search of a job , and a better life , in booming Guangdong .
She initially failed to get a job , but then found a position in a factory making ceramic tiles .
It was back - breaking work .
" I had to move tiles eight hours a day non -stop .
My body ached at the end of the day , " she said in a promotional video for this year 's NPC session .
But she worked hard , moved to another factory and rose quickly through the ranks .
She is now a manager at the New Pearl Ceramics Group in the city of Foshan , overseeing other migrant workers .
As a parliamentary representative , I do n't have any real power
NPC delegate Hu Xiaoyan
Her political career has also advanced .
Her hard work meant she was quickly picked out to sit on the local government .
This is where she was noticed by China 's national leaders , who plucked her from obscurity to become a member of the national parliament last year .
But it has been a tough first year in the public spotlight for Ms Hu , who has not seen her 12 - year - old daughters in two years .
They are back in Sichuan .
She was initially bombarded with emails and phone calls - much of them critical - when her contact details were published on the internet .
" I cried almost every day .
I went through every emotion , " she told one Chinese newspaper interviewer .
Workers feel bitter
She now seems to have learned to cope with the pressure .
" Now I have more experience , " she told the BBC in an interview in her cramped dormitory room , which she shares with her husband .
Ms
Hu has now been well - trained to deal with the media , and gives model answers about her role as an NPC delegate .
Members of the National People 's Congress gather in Beijing " I act as a bridge , which means I help the government promote its policies to the people and relay people 's opinions back to the government , " she said .
But that is not always as easy as it sounds .
Over the past year she has often found herself caught in the middle of factory disputes .
The plant , which makes floor and wall tiles , is currently experiencing financial difficulties and work stopped for a brief period last year .
Workers at the factory are still bitter .
They say managers cut their pay , and stopped them from looking for jobs elsewhere .
They are also angry at Ms Hu , who they say failed to help them sort out their grievances with the management .
One worker said there ought to be a different system to elect parliamentary representatives .
" The whole factory should be able to vote .
Whoever wins the most votes should be elected , " said the worker , who did not want to be identified .
There were similar comments from nearby residents .
People had heard of Ms Hu , but were not impressed with what she has achieved .
' People 's democracy ' " She only represents herself .
She 's no use , " said one angry man .
This is a lot of criticism for a woman who does not get paid for her political work .
She does not even get expenses .
When asked why she is so unpopular , Ms Hu admitted that it was partly because she has no power to solve problems .
The best she can do is relay the feelings of her fellow workers to factory managers and her political masters .
" I 'm just a worker at this company , my boss 's employee .
It 's not my job to solve problems , " she said .
" As a parliamentary representative , I do n't have any real power . "
This is not something China 's leaders will want to hear .
They maintain that China has introduced far - reaching political reforms over the last 30 years .
It was a theme repeated by NPC chairman Li Zhaoxing at a press conference on Wednesday to talk about this parliamentary session .
" We will adapt to people 's increasing enthusiasm for participation in political affairs [ and ] continue to expand people 's democracy , " he said .
But Ms
Hu's frank admission about the limits of her own power suggests NPC delegates have little real opportunity to dictate government policy .

A new application has been created for the iPhone which is designed to not only get all the latest Apple apps free of charge , but to teach a commercial iPhone pirate a lesson by opening his servers to all .
Many users of jailbroken iPhones will be familiar with the Installous application .
Installous , from the people at Hackulo.us , allows the simple installation of apps previously available from the official Apple App Store – but free of charge with Appulous , of course .
This system has n’t had much serious competition but all that changed recently when a new service / app appeared .
Known as ‘ Mega ’ , this application / system currently offers direct downloads of a staggering number of App Store apps , over 4000 at last count – a full list is available here .
However , while Installous operates on a donation basis and does n’t host any copyright infringing content itself , Mega offers its services via paid subscription – $ 9.99 for 1 month , $ 23.99 for 3 months and $ 41.99 for 6 months – which at least in part probably reflects the large costs associated with Mega hosting the content themselves .
It ’s also alleged that Mega ‘ borrowed ’ some code previously developed for Installous and this along with the ‘ pay for warez ’ issue seemed to really motivate the Installous crew , and they set about ruining this money maker .
“ If you ’re forced to spend money to use a service , you should be spending it on the actual apps you get , not making some greedy pirate rich , ” said coder Kyek .
And with this Kyek created a new application known as ‘ Grabulous ’ .
Once downloaded from the Hackulo.us repo on Cydia , this software allows iPhone users to instantly download any of the 4000 + apps from Mega ’s servers – free of charge .
Grabulous was a command line app , but a GUI is now available .
The stated aim of Grabulous is to give iPhone users the Mega service for free , or alternatively crash the Mega servers through being overloaded by non-paying users .
“ Both options are cool with us , ” says Kyek .
TorrentFreak spoke with Murda , founder of iPhone hack site FSMdotCOM who explained he had no time for Mega .
“ Grabulous should be saluted and applauded by consumers AND devs .
This is common sense , it ’s not cracking , it ’s not hacking .
Paying for cracked apps is a crime against common sense . ”
“ To be honest I think Mega tried it and thought they could outsmart everyone .
But unfortunately ( for them ) the iphone / touch community proves itself to be a fantastic one once again , ” Murda told Torrent Freak .
“ Mega had a major ‘ uppercut ’ from Hackulous when they released Grabulous but everybody smelled the fish right away , and we are not shy to send a message out to the people , and warn them .
That is why we are here . ”
Of course , the release of Grabulous did n’t go unnoticed by the people over at Mega and this ignited a round of technical cat and mouse as Mega tried to block Grabulous , with at least some initial success .
Kyek promised a new version of Grabulous to get around these measures but at this point in time it looks as if Mega has taken the hint that charging subscriptions for access to warez is unacceptable to some .
In a statement , Mega has advised that they will no longer require monthly subscriptions but will instead ask for donations while supporting this revenue stream with advertising .
Due to this new system , users will be limited on the number of apps they can download each day , dependent on server load .
“ They should have done this since the very beginning , ” noted Murda .
The Appulo.us service itself has been down for a week after they outgrew their hardware – and their budget .
On the first day of taking donations Appulo.us received $ 1700 but said they would n’t return until they had received enough money to rent 3 servers ( up from 1 ) for 6 months .
The service is back in operation today .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
As President Obama warned of " catastrophe " if the government does n't spend more than $ 800 billion to recharge the failing economy , some lawmakers equated the measure to " theft . "
Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan wants more transparency in how stimulus money will be spent .
" This is more money that 's ever been contemplated in the history of our country , " said Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan .
Republican John McCain calls the bailout " generational theft , " a transfer of wealth from future generations to today 's leaders .
" We are robbing future generations of Americans of their hard - earned dollars because we are laying on them a debt of incredible proportions , " he said .
The numbers are staggering .
Obama 's package is more than $ 800 billion .
President Bush 's bailout plan was $ 700 billion .
Add to trillions promised by the government in loans and potential spending to soothe the financial crisis .
It all equals a mind - boggling sum , not including the interest on all that money .
President Obama appeared before a national audience Monday night to make the case for the roughly $ 838 billion economic stimulus plan .
" My bottom line is to make sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs , we are making sure that the financial system is working again , that homeowners are getting some relief , " he said .
" Do we know how that money is being managed ?
No , " said Dorgan who is proposing that the government institute a system to show how every penny is spent .
" That 's the real scandal here , " he said .
" There ought to be complete accountability , complete transparency . "
" Fighting a war without paying for it .
Letting the banks be run like casinos on their own account , " Dorgan continued .
" Is that theft ?
You 're damn right is is .
That fact is none of us have been here before .
And nobody in the country really understands what is the right medicine to fix what is wrong with this economy . "
But the risk of doing nothing is far greater than the current price tag , some economists contend .
" The single worse thing that can happen when the economy gets mired down is to sit on the sideline , pull back , start acting like a scared household , because that 's the recipe for a recession that lasts a decade rather than three years , " said Josh Bivans of the Economic Policy Institute .

Tens of thousands of Irish workers are facing unemployment .
But U2 frontman and self - proclaimed " humanitarian " Bono continues to weasel out of paying taxes , writes Irish socialist and journalist Eamonn McCann .
THE MOST eye - catching placard on a 120,000 - strong march in Dublin last Saturday against the Irish government 's austerity response to the tottering of the capitalist system was held aloft by a scrawny teenager , with the look of a music - lover about him , reading " Make Bono Pay Tax . "
The march , organized by the Irish Congress of Trades Unions , was protesting against measures , including a pay freeze plus a 1 percent wage levy on all public sector workers , education cutbacks that will mean , for example , the closure of special needs classes in primary schools , and much else along the same screw - the - workers , neoliberal lines .
The cutbacks and attacks on public - sector workers come against the background of a banking scandal which , proportionately , dwarfs the crimes of the bankster class in the U.S .
Rummaging through the rubble of Anglo Irish Bank , which collapsed at the end of 2008 and was nationalized in January , investigators discovered that founder and boss Sean Fitzpatrick was secretly in hock to his own bank to the tune of $ 110 million , which he had shifted into Irish Life and Permanent on the day before the annual audit and shifted back again the day afterwards .
Bush and Bono - - both against making the rich pay their fair share of taxes
Fitzpatrick - -" Seanie " to both Taoiseach ( Prime Minister ) Brian Cowan and his predecessor Bertie Ahern - - had performed this maneuver with sums of around $ 101 million every year for the past seven years .
It emerged , too , that the bank had last year given loans worth $ 571 million to 10 customers buying shares in the bank , the loans being secured on the same shares .
As well , 15 individuals owed the bank at least $ 633 million each , much of it secured on property holdings which may now be worth as little as shares in Anglo Irish ( $ 21 in mid-2007 , 12 cents at the time of nationalization ) .
The bailout burden of all this falls on the taxpayers .
Hence , the mass fury expressed on the Dublin march and the dismay of many at the nervous pusillanimity of union leaders on the platform , whose main call was not to march on another couple hundred yards to Anglo Irish headquarters and burn it down , but to " exert pressure " on the government to agree to reopen talks on a " package of measures . "
Hence , too , a new focus on tax avoiders , who live high off the hog in Dublin while basing their businesses in Euro - zone tax shelters .
Like U2 .
MORE THAN 40 years ago , the Beatles followed Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to India in search of a spiritual haven .
Three years ago , U2 followed him , in search of a tax haven .
( By the time the Maharishi faded from mortal life in February 2006 , he was living at his Dutch estate , presiding over a business empire worth more than a man who scorned money could be bothered to count .
He 'd moved to Holland in 1990 for tax purposes .
Or , rather , no - tax purposes . )
Cork - born British television super - star Graham Norton commented at the time : " People like Bono really annoy me .
He goes to hell and back to avoid paying tax .
He has a special accountant .
He works out Irish tax loopholes .
And then he 's asking me to buy a well for an African village .
Tarmac a road or pay for a school , you tightwad ! "
But Norton 's words of modest wisdom did n't resonate in the media mainstream , which endlessly celebrate Bono .
They laud his selflessness in occasionally taking time off from counting the cash he had squirreled away to berate the Irish authorities for refusing to give more of the money they had collected from tax - compliant citizens towards alleviating world hunger .
They report worshipfully on Bono 's peregrinations around the planet in the company of the liars , murderers , thieves and whores who have run the global economy into ruin .
The arrival of U2 confirmed Holland as the European Union 's number - one tax haven .
Corporations which have joined the band in establishing headquarters there to avoid paying tax in their home countries include Coca Cola , Ikea , Nike and Gucci .
The band is set to tour their new album , " No Line on the Horizon . "
So stand by for the latest swirl of jangly guitar enclosed in a fog of undefined feeling .
Expect no grit , no danger , nothing jagged or ragged to disturb tranquility , but a toxic cloud of fluffy rhetoric , a soundtrack for the terminally self - satisfied , not forgetting heartfelt homilies on how to live a moral life .
THE BEST response to one of those breathless Bono appeals for uplift came at a Glasgow gig when he hushed the audience to reverent silence before starting slowly to clap .
" Every time I clap my hands , " he whispered into the microphone , " a child in Africa dies . "
A voice responded in broad Glasgow accent : " Well , fucking stop doin ' it then . "
All of which is mere intro to lyrics ( by Bono impersonator Paul O'Toole ) sung outside the Dail ( parliament ) in Dublin on Wednesday , at a follow - up demo organized by the Debt and Development Coalition Ireland :
I want to run , my money to hide
I want build paper walls and keep it inside
I want to seek shelter from income tax pain
Where the accounts have no names
See my tax bill disappear without a trace
Where the accounts have no names
Where the accounts have no names
Where the accounts have no names
Where the accounts have no names Keeping our fortune is something we love
Something we love
And when we go there , we go without you
Revenue we do n't do Ireland is bankrupt and though it 's going bust
Our well paid accountants made sure it do n't affect us
They showed us a place to avoid all the pain
Where the accounts have no names
Where the accounts have no names
Where the accounts have no names Avoiding tax is something we love
Something we love
And when we go there , we forget about you
Revenue we do n't do Tax demands turn to rust
We 've used the law and left on the wind
Left on the wind
On the subject of tax our love turns to rust
See our dosh is in trusts
Dosh is in trusts
And when we go there , we forget about you
Revenue we do n't do
Or :
I have paid highest fees
I have moved overseas
Only to pay less tax
Only to pay less tax I have run
I have crawled
I 've done so much you'd be appalled
You'd be appalled
Only to pay less tax
But I still have n't learned about democracy
No I still have n't learned about democracy I know avoiding tax ain't fair
It 's just because I 'm a millionaire
I do n't need to pay like you
No I wo n't pay like you Cause I still have n't learned about democracy
But I still have n't learned about democracy
You paid your tax and you
Laid the blame
Carried the burden
Of my shame
Of my shame
You know I 'm still running Cause I still have n't learned about democracy
No I still have n't learned about democracy
But I still have n't learned about democracy
But I still have n't learned about .
In the day of the Beatles , it was peace and harmony to the tune of " All You Need Is Love . "
Now , it 's " Get It While You Can " to the tune of a billion dollars .
Rock and roll , where did it go wrong ?
None of this is to deny that U2 could play a part in restoring unity of purpose to the Irish people in these dangerously divisive times .
I reckon that " Make Bono Pay Tax " could prove a slogan around which the nation might gather .
And another thing .
It will be remembered that , last May in Dublin 's Merrion Hotel after a Springsteen gig , Bono undertook to take part in a public debate with Dave Marsh on the effectiveness of celebrity politics .
A couple of weeks later , U2's New York office told Marsh that they 'd schedule the discussion once the new album was finished .
Like , now .
So I e-mailed Marsh last week to find out the details .
" He backed out , without offering an explanation ( and I was too smart to ask ) , " came the prompt reply .
" We may draw our own conclusions . "
First , the extra -safe rules from the people who cover all the bases :
Raw eggs should be refrigerated at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or lower when you ’re not using them , says Elisa Maloberti , a spokesperson for the American Egg Board .
“ [ Eggs ] should not be left at room temperature for more than two hours , including the time used to prepare and serve them .
Allow no more than 30 minutes to one hour when it ’s 85 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter [ out ] . ”
“ The main safety concern with shell eggs is Salmonella enteritidis [ SE ] bacteria inside the egg , ” says Hilary Shallo Thesmar , PhD , director of the Egg Safety Center in Washington DC .
“ Occasionally , hens become infected with SE and deposit the bacteria in the egg as it is being formed in the reproductive tract .
Eggs look , taste , and smell completely normal . ”
The Egg Safety Center says that 1 egg in 20,000 may contain salmonella , which is a contamination rate of 0.005 percent .
Storing eggs below 40 degrees Fahrenheit “ keeps bacteria from growing to large enough numbers to cause illness , ” says the American Egg Board ’s Maloberti .
But if you ’re buying local eggs at a farmers ’ market , you may have more leeway .
The organic egg farmers we spoke with said it depends on the egg .
Alvin Schlangen , owner and manager of Schlangen Family Farm in Minnesota , says that he would not recommend leaving out “ just any old egg ” and that following the cold storage guideline is “ vitally important if your egg quality is lacking . ”
But he suggests relying more on common sense than federal regulations : “ Know your farmer and know how he manages his flock of hens .
If your source hens are pastured and on chemical - free feed , you ’ll have no concerns about leaving cartoned eggs out at room temperature for a few days .
If you plan to keep them longer than that , I ’d chill them . ”

Ever wonder how financial experts could lead the world over the economic cliff ?
One explanation is that so - called experts turn out to be , in many situations , a stunningly poor source of expertise .
There ’s evidence that what matters in making a sound forecast or decision is n’t so much knowledge or experience as good judgment  or , to be more precise , the way a person ’s mind works .
More on that in a moment .
First , let ’s acknowledge that even very smart people allow themselves to be buffaloed by an apparent “ expert ” on occasion .
The best example of the awe that an “ expert ” inspires is the “ Dr. Fox effect . ”
It ’s named for a pioneering series of psychology experiments in which an actor was paid to give a meaningless presentation to professional educators .
The actor was introduced as “ Dr. Myron L. Fox ” ( no such real person existed ) and was described as an eminent authority on the application of mathematics to human behavior .
He then delivered a lecture on “ mathematical game theory as applied to physician education ”  except that by design it had no point and was completely devoid of substance .
However , it was warmly delivered and full of jokes and interesting neologisms .

Do Not Let Sherri Shepherd Talk About Women ’s Issues , Let Alone Lesbian Issues
Leave it to Sherri Shepherd and Elisabeth Hasselbeck to have no understanding of how lesbian relationships between two women actually work .
Last week we talked about how some women who always considered themselves straight ended up in lesbian relationships in their adult life , often after the kids had grown up or they divorced their husbands .
Discussed at length in O , The Oprah Magazine , it was only a matter of time before the ladies of The View took their brand of headline snacking and weighed in on the matter with their dumbed down discussion .
Shepherd , a wonderful actress but a naive adult woman , is , along with the pope and Fred Phelps , not qualified to discuss this subject .
Unable to even consider why a “ formerly straight ” woman could become intimately involved with another gal , Shepherd sets women back 50 years by explaining why she could never go without men :
Because they make her feel safe when she goes out at night .
Yes , ladies , you need a big swinging wang on your arm in order to feel secure .
( Then Hasselbeck wants to know “ if it ’s a hormonal thing . ”
Related : Is our endless frustration with Hasselbeck a hormonal thing ? )
Kudos to Barbara Walters for putting the subject on the table for The View ‘s millions of readers .
It ’s too bad her cohorts are imbeciles .
LUXEMBOURG ( Reuters ) - A U.N. panel will next week recommend that the world ditch the dollar as its reserve currency in favor of a shared basket of currencies , a member of the panel said on Wednesday , adding to pressure on the dollar .
Currency specialist Avinash Persaud , a member of the panel of experts , told a Reuters Funds Summit in Luxembourg that the proposal was to create something like the old Ecu , or European currency unit , that was a hard - traded , weighted basket .
Persaud , chairman of consultants Intelligence Capital and a former currency chief at JPMorgan , said the recommendation would be one of a number delivered to the United Nations on March 25 by the U.N. Commission of Experts on International Financial Reform .
“ It is a good moment to move to a shared reserve currency , ” he said .
Central banks hold their reserves in a variety of currencies and gold , but the dollar has dominated as the most convincing store of value -- though its rate has wavered in recent years as the United States ran up huge twin budget and external deficits .
Some analysts said news of the U.N. panel ’s recommendation extended dollar losses because it fed into concerns about the future of the greenback as the main global reserve currency , raising the chances of central bank sales of dollar holdings .
“ Speculation that major central banks would begin rebalancing their FX reserves has risen since the intensification of the dollar ’s slide between 2002 and mid-2008 , ” CMC Markets said in a note .
Russia is also planning to propose the creation of a new reserve currency , to be issued by international financial institutions , at the April G20 meeting , according to the text of its proposals published on Monday .
It has significantly reduced the dollar ’s share in its own reserves in recent years .
GOOD TIME
Persaud said that the United States was concerned that holding the reserve currency made it impossible to run policy , while the rest of world was also unhappy with the generally declining dollar .
“ There is a moment that can be grasped for change , ” he said .
“ Today the Americans complain that when the world wants to save , it means a deficit .
A shared ( reserve ) would reduce the possibility of global imbalances . ”
Persaud said the panel had been looking at using something like an expanded Special Drawing Right , originally created by the International Monetary Fund in 1969 but now used mainly as an accounting unit within similar organizations .
The SDR and the old Ecu are essentially combinations of currencies , weighted to a constituent ’s economic clout , which can be valued against other currencies and indeed against those inside the basket .
Persaud said there were two main reasons why policymakers might consider such a move , one being the current desire for a change from the dollar .
The other reason , he said , was the success of the euro , which incorporated a number of currencies but roughly speaking held on to the stability of the old German deutschemark compared with , say , the Greek drachma .
Persaud has long argued that the dollar would give way to the Chinese yuan as a global reserve currency within decades .
A shared reserve currency might negate this move , he said , but he believed that China would still like to take on the role .

Learn How ... Kucinich hits ' Virtual Army Experience ' as ' deceptive ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday March 12 , 2009
Print This Email This ' Army simulation ' tour cost taxpayers $ 9.8 million in 2007 ; Kucinich wants funds pulled
In real war , a " frag " does not earn more points or a higher ranking .
It means something else entirely .
And you do n't respawn .
Ever .
That 's essentially the message carried by Congressman Dennis Kucinich in a letter to the leaders of the House Committee on Armed Services , urging them to pull funding for the Army 's " deceptive recruitment " with its traveling VR simulation .
The popular , liberal representative 's response was triggered by the latest " virtual reality " incarnation of America 's Army , a multi-player , squad - based tactical shooting video game for the PC and consoles .
When it released in 2002 , the game drew praise from reviewers , many of them ranking it among the best first - person shooters of its day , such as Unreal Tournament and Counterstrike .
It was released initially over the Internet free of charge .
" America 's Army : Operations clearly has a lot going for it , not the least of which is a level of realism that 's constantly palpable and brought to life with very high production values , " opined GameSpot writer Scott Osborne in 2002 .
" However , at this point , the game is limited by its focus on small - scale engagements between foot soldiers . "
He must have been using the word " realistic " in relative terms .
Today , the game is even more " realistic , " thanks to the elaborate technology involved in the " Virtual Army Experience " ( VAE ) .
Sporting prop Humvees in a massive VR combat scenario , a LAN ( Local Area Network ) room for multiplayer gaming and a team - based mission simulation encompassing a number of the various jobs inherent to soldiering , the VAE represents the latest generation of how America 's military appeals to the 13 - and - up demographic .
The Army even pulls scenarios from " real missions . "
That 's a bit much for Kucinich .
" Although participants score points for shooting people in uniform and lose points for firing on noncombatants , no blood or carnage is ever seen in the simulation , " writes the Ohio lawmaker and former presidential candidate .
" The VAE shields participants from the realities of killing while glorifying the taking of human life in a thinly veiled attempt to recruit new soldiers .
Making matters worse , if a child wants to take part in the simulation , the Army collects his or her contact information , as well as an assessment of the childs performance in the simulator .
" The VAE travels around the country to family oriented venues such as amusement parks , air shows and county fairs .
When the VAE came to the Cleveland Air Show in 2008 , I raised concerns and objections with the Army .
Allowing children as young as thirteen years of age to participate in a simulation endorsed by the United States Government that glorifies and sanitizes extreme violence is unacceptable . "
" I had fun during the intense but short experience , " summarized C - Net writer Will Greenwald in 2007 , when the VAE first launched .
" It felt surprisingly real , with the gun and Humvee shaking and rocking wildly as I shot at terrorists on a huge screen .
Unfortunately , it did n't really present the same level of risk most video games offer .
As far as I could tell , nobody in the simulation died or got hurt .
Sure , bullets flew and bombs exploded , but nobody lost a life ... "
Kucinich insisted that funds be pulled from the " Virtual Army Experience , " noting that in 2007 taxpayers footed a $ 9.8 million bill for the program .
Thursday morning , Kucinich 's staff isssued a memo calling on the committee to " eliminate deceptive Army recruitment . "
America 's
Army is not the only virtual recruiting tool used by the military .
During a launch party for the popular Xbox 360 game Halo 3 , underage kids were turned away from a GameStop location in New Hampshire because the game is rated " M " ( Mature ) and recommended for players ages 17 and up .
According to Game Politics , Air Force recruiters across the street welcomed the underage GameStop castoffs with their own Halo 2 tournament , including pizza , Mountain Dew and a " pimped - out military SUV " housing the consoles .
Kucinich is not the only one protesting military use of video games to pique the interest of teens .
Iraq Veterans Against the War has confronted America 's Army demos before , garnering widespread coverage across technology media .
In 2008 , an activist group staged a protest outside of the game developer 's headquarters .
In San Francisco , Ubisoft was picketed by protesters who carried a banner that read " War is not a game . "
Wired also reported the group tried to put warning stickers on copies of America 's Army for Xbox 360 .
The following video of an IVAW protest in St. Louis , MO. was uploaded to YouTube August 19 , 2007 .
Congressman Kucinich 's full letter follows .
####
Dear Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member McHugh :
I urge you to eliminate budget authority for the Virtual Army Experience ( VAE ) in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 .
The VAE is a state - of - the - art , interactive recruiting tool used by the Army to give participants as young as 13 years old a naïve and unrealistic glimpse into the world of Soldiering .
The VAE allows participants to perform missions using adapted combat training technology meant to imitate the feel of real Army equipment through the use of air - pressured guns that mimic recoil and kickback , and Humvees that shake slightly from simulated IED explosions .
Although participants score points for shooting people in uniform and lose points for firing on noncombatants , no blood or carnage is ever seen in the simulation .
The VAE shields participants from the realities of killing while glorifying the taking of human life in a thinly veiled attempt to recruit new soldiers .
Making matters worse , if a child wants to take part in the simulation , the Army collects his or her contact information , as well as an assessment of the childs performance in the simulator .
The VAE travels around the country to family oriented venues such as amusement parks , air shows and county fairs .
When the VAE came to the Cleveland Air Show in 2008 , I raised concerns and objections with the Army .
Allowing children as young as thirteen years of age to participate in a simulation endorsed by the United States Government that glorifies and sanitizes extreme violence is unacceptable .
Like many towns across the U.S. , Cleveland is trying to do the opposite because of its very real struggles with violence .
Exposing children to America s heroes is beneficial to both the children and members of the armed service .
However , this exposure must be honest and complete , rather than portraying an unrealistic or incomplete picture of what choosing future service to our country might entail .
I appreciate the difficult job the Committee faces when setting the priorities for fiscal year 2010 .
I hope you will agree that it is irresponsible to continue the touring of the VAE exhibits .
In 2007 the reported estimated cost to operate the VAE was $ 9.8 million .
This money can be better spent .
I urge you to eliminate from the budget the Virtual Army Experience in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010 .
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions .
Sincerely ,
Dennis J. Kucinich
Member of Congres

Marcy at FDL brings us this interesting tidbit that indicates you might be serving jail time for downloading music :
Last September , the Bush administration defended the unusual secrecy over an anti-counterfeiting treaty being negotiated by the U.S. government , which some liberal groups worry could criminalize some peer - to - peer file sharing that infringes copyrights .
[...]
Now President Obama's
White House has tightened the cloak of government secrecy still further , saying in a letter this week that a discussion draft of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and related materials are " classified in the interest of national security pursuant to Executive Order 12958 . "
[...]
Jamie Love , director of the nonprofit group Knowledge Ecology International , filed the Freedom of Information Act request that resulted in this week 's denial from the White House .
The denial letter ( PDF ) was sent to Love on Tuesday by Carmen Suro - Bredie , chief FOIA officer in the White House 's Office of the U.S. Trade Representative .
[...]
Love had written in his original request on January 31 - - submitted soon after Obama 's inauguration -- that the documents " are being widely circulated to corporate lobbyists in Europe , Japan , and the U.S .
There is no reason for them to be secret from the American public . "
[...]
Love 's group believes that the U.S. and Japan want the treaty to say that willful trademark and copyright infringement on a commercial scale must be subject to criminal sanctions , including infringement that has " no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain . "
Jacqui Smith : Wo n't tolerate ' dodgy ' colleges A quarter of UK colleges who want to enrol overseas students have been denied a licence by the Home Office .
Institutions have to meet UK Border Agency standards before being allowed to sponsor international students under the UK 's new points - based system .
About 460 have so far been rejected as not making the grade , out of 2,100 that accept international students .
Immigration minister Phil Woolas said " bogus " colleges were the " Achilles Heel " of Britain 's border controls .
There has been a boom in overseas students coming to the UK in recent years , with tuition fees last year totalling £ 2.5 bn .
The government says students from outside the EU " play a huge part in the UK's cultural and economic wealth " .
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
There are about 240,000 non-EU students in UK higher education International students form 14 % of the full - time student population
They make up 43 % of those at research postgraduate level Source : Higher Education Statistics Agency
But it is using its new points - based migration system to shut down " bogus colleges " that are really just a route into low skilled work .
International students will need to be accepted by genuine institutions before they can come here .
Officials estimate up to 2,000 " bogus " colleges will be forced to close because of the changes .
Bureaucracy concern Speaking on a visit to Imperial College , London , Mr Woolas said he wanted to protect genuine universities and colleges which he said were essential for the economy .
But he added : " We want to expose those who are not genuine students who are using fraudulent college offers to come here .
" In my estimation abuse of the student visa has been the biggest abuse of the system , the major loophole in Britain 's border controls .
" I believe that the new system will benefit major institutions , colleges and private universities , but the backstreet bogus college is being exposed . "
A cross party group on balanced migration called on the government to reveal how many students were in the UK under false pretences .
' Shambles '
In a joint statement , co-chairmen Tory MP Nicholas Soames and Labour 's Frank Field said : " This is a worrying but not totally astonishing revelation .
" Given there are nearly a quarter of a million non-EU students in British higher education institutions , the question this poses is ' how are many are here under false pretences ? ' "
The launch of Tier 4 of the points - based system means students will also need to prove they have enough money to live on for nine months , down from 12 months in the original proposals .
Dr Sharon Bolton , head of international student support at Imperial , said she was concerned about bureaucracy in the new system .
' Illegitimate ' colleges
The 17 - page application form for existing students to renew their visas was now 55 pages long , she said .
And she said some scholarship students found the income requirements exceeded the amount they were given by the university .
She said : " The application form for those in the UK is a massive administrative burden for the students themselves , the universities that are dealing with it , and for the Home Office workers who are processing them .
" I do n't see how that 's not going to cause delays . "
But she welcomed the effort to " weed out " colleges that are " illegitimate " .
' Play by the rules '
The Association of Colleges said none of its members , which include general further education Colleges , Sixth form colleges and specialist colleges , had been rejected during the screening process .
Robert Russell , Association of Colleges Finance Development Manager , said : " Colleges are hopeful that the new sponsor register will prevent fraudulent institutions from abusing the immigration system in Britain . "
Before reaching the UK , students need to prove they have a place at a licensed institution , that they can financially support themselves , and must provide their fingerprints to the UK Border Agency .
Colleges have to prove they are genuine education institutions and they will have to report students who are not attending their courses .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said : " These new measures make sure people who come here to study - and the people who teach them - play by the rules .
" This new tier of the points based system allows us to know exactly who is coming to the UK to study and crack down on bogus colleges . "

A man in the US state of Pennsylvania accused of a robbery at a narcotics police convention has been described as probably the state 's dumbest criminal .
Retired police chief John Comparetto was attending the meeting of 300 officers when he was allegedly held up at gunpoint in the men 's toilets .
He handed over money and a phone but then he and some colleagues gave chase as the suspect tried to flee in a taxi .
They arrested a 19 - year - old man over the incident near Harrisburg .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Comparetto was wearing an ankle holster with a gun , and when told to drop his trousers , he managed to conceal his weapon .
He described the suspect as " probably the dumbest criminal in Pennsylvania " .
The Associated Press news agency reported that when a journalist asked the suspect for comment as he was led from court , he said : " I 'm smooth . "
One of my friends whose whereabouts are usually not traceable , because he is involved in hectic travel has grounded himself for the next month or so .
He has stationed himself at home ; well not exactly at home , but like a tame pet , he goes off to the office in the morning and is safely back to home base by evening .
after hearing that piece of news , I haven been given similar instructions on the home front and my wife herself has taken leave a month ’s leave and has parked herself at home .
In both our families , a child is going through that iconic rite of passage – the board exam …..
An event talked about in awe and hushed whispers .
I do not know the number of students who sit for the Board examinations in India every year , with practically each state having its own board of secondary education apart from the grand daddy of them all , the Central Board of Secondary Education .
But whatever be the number , the ides of March bring with them the news of the examination season and the country it would seem defers to the phenomenon .
elections if due , are scheduled and rescheduled to ensure that the examination schedule is not trifled with ; the election commission , typically a law unto itself , defers to the board examinations – elections will never be scheduled in a way that they interfere with the examination time table .
But stress for exam going students and increasingly their families is becoming a major issue in the last decade and it is a matter of concern that young people are being exposed to stress at such an early stage of their lives when their coping mechanism is so weak .
Eexamination stress pushes students to various kinds of perversions , not only affecting concentration and memory but also forcing them to adopt abnormal behavior .
Stressed out children are increasingly consuming tobacco , drinking tea , coffee and taking commonly - available amphetamine drugs such as cough syrups to keep up while preparing for exams .
And then there are those who simply can’t cope and end their lives .
According to government reports , over 5000 students committed suicide in 2006 .
The unofficial figures are even higher .
It seems stress is pushing our students to the brink ; many of them just in class six .
Boys are more vulnerable to committing suicide than girls , because adolescent girls seek support from family and friends to deal with emotional stress during examination .
But as boys are less expressive , they tend to suppress their feelings of inadequacy and fear of poor performance .
This often drives them to suicide to end their frustration
What ’s pushing today ’s Indian students – a bright generation with a global reputation for their high intelligence quotient – to the brink ?
Parental and peer pressure , rising ambitions and fierce competition are brewing a deadly cocktail for these young minds .
Moreover , a nation racing towards affluence , an economy on a remarkable upward growth trajectory and skyrocketing salaries are putting unprecedented pressure on youth to succeed .
Although some note has been taken of the phenomenon , the changes are till date largely cosmetic .
helplines set up by the central board of secondary education and other NGOs that function in these months of the year certainly serve a useful purpose , educational reforms that will evaluate performance and learning by means other than examinations alone or an over haul of the syllabi have been slow in coming .
The reform of India ’s Macaulayan system of education based on rote learning and memorisation requires urgent attention .
Besides , though the UPA government has imposed a 2 percent cess on all Central taxes , decades of under - investment in education has created shocking shortages of buildings , laboratories , libraries , even drinking water and sanitation facilities in the nation ’s dilapidated education sector .
A national consensus has to be built on the premise that higher education outlays are vitally important investments in the nation ’s future and that this outlay is needed to be accompanied by revamp of the educational system so that young lives are not snuffed out under the burden of school syllabi and examinations , which currently passes for education in India .
using 10.5.7 beta ati drivers ( jsut five kexts ) and new natit , i got my 4850 working in 10.5.6 Leopard 🙂
You need to have OSX 10.5.6 or higher
What ’s working – qe / ci , resolution change
What Problems :
currently only second dvi port works for me , and only with dvi-vga adapter
also , Display is recognized as standart vga / svga display , so only 4:3 resolutions available
only usefull for VGA connections – with switchresx ( before using it , make sure u can change resolution ) help i added 1680 ×1050 mode jsut fine 🙂
EDIT3 ( for4850 ) : booted with dvi2 vga ( converter only , no monitor attached to it ) in second port , and dvi connected to first port ( closest to mobo ) , and voila ,
display on first port properly recognized .
some vertical little screen jerkness sometimes
Pkg with drivers you will find in #radeonhd room on irc.osx86.hu
and now some screenshots
User with 4870 reported he has almost no problems with 4870 , he just cant change resolution , results in black screen
Btw , 10.5.7 kernel also supports Nehalem i7 fully now .
P.S. I hope no other company than Apple / AMD will pretend they wrote drivers for 4850 / 4870 or nehalem i7
The Olympic swimming sensation Michael Phelps , who was photographed inhaling from a marijuana pipe , has lost a major sponsorship deal and has been suspended from competition for three months .
Kellogg , the food company , said Thursday that it would not renew its contract with Phelps when their deal expires at the end of February .
It would not disclose the value of its contract .
Later Thursday , USA Swimming suspended Phelps for three months .
“ Michael ’s most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg , ” Susanne Norwitz , a spokeswoman for the company , said in a statement .

USA Swimming publicly reprimanded Phelps , who won eight medals at the Beijing Games , temporarily withdrawing its financial support to him and barring him from competition through early May .
Phelps receives a monthly stipend of $ 1,750 from the organization .
The national and world championships will be held in the summer .
Signs of despair are everywhere .
Japan has one of the highest suicide rates among rich countries .
There may be as many as one million “ hikikomori , ” from teenagers to those in their 40s , who shut themselves in their rooms for years on end .
Then there are all those “ parasite singles ”  or unmarried adults living with their parents .
But by far our most serious problem is a declining and aging population .
Given present trends , total population will likely decline from around 130 million to under 90 million in 50 years or so .
By that same time , 40 percent of Japanese could be over 65 .
If we want to survive as a nation , we must shed our deeply rooted resistance to immigration .
Contrary to widespread prejudices in favor of keeping Japan “ pure , ” we desperately need to dilute our blood .
Our aging nation will need millions of university - educated middle - class immigrants with high productivity , people who will put down roots and raise families , whose pride and success will be the affirmation of new Japanese values .
Japan desperately needs change , and this will require risk .
Risk - taking is not common among the bureaucratically controlled .
You wo n’t find many signs on Japanese beaches saying , “ Swim at your own risk .
No lifeguard on duty . ”
If that sign were to appear , many Japanese would likely ask the authorities to tell them if it is safe to swim .
This same risk aversion translates into protectionism and insularity .
The ministry of agriculture , for example , wants to increase self - sufficiency in food .
There is not nearly enough critical thinking and dissent in the Japanese news media .
Still , the idea that the Japanese are afraid of risk has no basis in history , for better or for worse .
Remember Pearl Harbor ?
In fact , Japan ’s passiveness today is in large measure a calculated and reasonable reaction to its behavior during the Second World War .
But today , this emphasis on safety and security is long past its sell - by date .
We have run out of outside models to imitate .
We must start from scratch , embracing an idea of progress that is based on innovation , ambition and dynamism .
Doing so will take risk  and extraordinary leadership .
But the alternative is to continue stumbling down a path of decline .
It has been a busy month for US - Iran relations .
Iran recently launched its first satellite into orbit in what The New York Times called , " a shot across the bow of American diplomacy , " and US President Barack Obama passed along a secret letter to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in an attempt to enlist the Russians in an international effort to contain Iran 's nuclear program , all while Iranians prepare to head to the polls in June .
While numerous campaign contenders debate the success of President Ahmadinejad 's rhetoric and policies , thousands of nuclear centrifuges continue to spin .
Mr. Obama was quick to insist that the US will pursue " constructive dialogue " with Tehran , while Ahmadinejad alluded to opening talks in an " atmosphere of mutual respect . "
These are promising first steps to forging new US - Iran relations .
However , now is not the time to engage Iran directly .
The perception of American meddling during Iran 's election season will only play into the hands of hard - liners .
Postponing the offering of a grand bargain until after the elections does not mean that the US is without options in the interim .
There are ways to encourage positive relations .
The Iranian regime describes the US as " the global arrogance " more frequently today than the old epithet , " the great Satan . "
The perception that America does not respect Iran is shared among the simple shopkeepers , courageous reformists , and vitriolic clerics alike .
A change of perception among the people is key to any progress in relations .
The locus of power in Iran is Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei , who exercises near - complete control over many of the state 's levers of power .
Talking to the Iranian representatives up to and including the president is in effect simply passing a note to Ayatollah Khamenei .
The only difference is the choice of courier .
Enter California .
The state is home to a large and influential Iranian diaspora .
Although within this community a wide variety of political positions and sympathies are encountered , the Iranian diaspora could play a role in passing on an important message to their former countrymen .
The Iranian calendar offers Obama an ideal opportunity to reach out to them and challenge common misperceptions .
Nowruz , the Persian New Year , will be celebrated later this month .
Obama should take advantage of this unique moment to travel to California and hold a town - hall meeting with the Iranian diaspora .
In the context of a major speech to this community , Obama will be able to address the Iranian people and the Iranian government indirectly , without the political fallout of stalled direct negotiations .
The Iranian diaspora is passionate about their homeland , and remain in close contact with family and friends .
These indirect linkages will pass along Obama 's message , along with the vibrant blogging scene that has mostly escaped attempts at government control .
Obama 's speech should dispel popular myths about Iran and focus on the beauty of Persian culture .
Obama might acknowledge a personal fascination with Persian history and express a desire to learn more .
He could refer to stories drawn from Iran 's ancient past , such as Cyrus the Great 's liberation of Jewish slaves from bondage or the nation 's modern experiments with constitutionalism and liberal democracy .
Iran has a strong democratic tradition that can be traced back to the struggle of reformers against an absolute monarchy at the turn of the 20th century .
Obama should insist that these visions of Iran 's tolerant , cosmopolitan , inclusive prerevolutionary past serve as models for the future .
Language that evokes the towering pillars of Persepolis and the ancient gardens of Pasargadae will resonate with the young men who wear their hair long in homage to Achaemenian soldiers , or the young women wearing pendants engraved with images of Zoroastrian gods .
Such a speech should avoid specific policy prescriptions , but emphasize the desire for a " new approach . "
Iran 's constructive role in the early stages of Afghanistan 's reconstruction should also be acknowledged .
To be sure , the Iranian government may decide that its strategic interests reside in delay and obfuscation to improve their negotiating stance .
And the Obama administration must keep a watchful eye on Iran 's nuclear program .
Nonetheless , a speech that seeks to officially close the chapter on Iran as the axis of evil and appeals to the everyday Iranians can only help America 's image there .
Germans found a partner in President Kennedy when they believed they were alone and abandoned .
Russians who were desperate to experience the outside world were heartened by President Reagan 's passionate insistence that President Gorbachev " tear down this wall . "
The day may soon come when Iranians – disillusioned by the failures of their revolution , alienated by our previous president 's arrogance and pugilism – find hope in the simple , respectful words spoken by a compassionate US president .

Toshiba Demonstrates Quick - Charging Electric Bike
November 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
This past week , Toshiba exhibited a snazzy power - assisted bicycle manufactured by Cannondale Sports Group that uses a quick - charging lithium ion battery .
The SCiB battery uses lithium titanate for enhanced safety and is made up of ten battery cells connected in series .
According to Toshiba , the bike can go 20 - 30 miles before needing a new charge — perfect for short trips around town .
The bike will be launched in North American and Europe in early 2009 .
While details are n’t available yet , it is expected to be priced at a cool $ 3,000 .
Interestingly , Cannondale and Toshiba ca n’t release the bike in Japan due to the current Japanese Road Traffic Law , which states that the assisting force from the motor must be within half of the rider ’s pedaling force .
The ratio of the force generated by the rider to the motor ’s force in the Cannondale bike is 1:1 .

A former San Francisco Community College trustee has no right to sue city police for arresting him on suspicion of counterfeiting after he passed what turned out to be a genuine $ 100 bill , a federal appeals court ruled Monday .
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the officers could not be held liable for their mistake , which led them to handcuff Rodel Rodis at a Walgreens drugstore in February 2003 and take him to a station before confirming the bill 's authenticity through the Secret Service .
" Although the arrest was unfortunate , we cannot say that the officers ' belief that ( the bill ) was fake was plainly incompetent , " wrote Judge Dorothy Nelson , who was joined in the 3 - 0 opinion by Judges Consuelo Callahan and Cormac Carney .
" The arrest , therefore , was not clearly established as unlawful . "
The court cited the importance of granting limited legal immunity to public officials such as police officers , who may be held responsible for abusing their power but are also protected from lawsuits if they act reasonably .
Rodis , an attorney , served 18 years on the community college board before losing a re-election bid in November .
He is also a former president of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission , and now writes a column that appears in a dozen newspapers serving the Filipino American community .
He said Monday that he might ask the full Court of Appeals to reconsider the ruling .
" I 'm extremely disappointed , " said Rodis , 57 , who had sought damages under federal civil rights laws .
" This gives the police the unfettered license to arrest anyone for the flimsiest of reasons without using common sense . "
Deputy City Attorney Scott Wiener said his office had fought the suit after concluding the officers did nothing wrong and acted in good faith .
" Officers have to make arrest decisions with very limited time and limited information , " Wiener said .
" Even if the person ends up being innocent , the officers are not automatically liable .
The system would collapse if it were any other way . "
Wiener said the Rodis case prompted changes in the law .
Police now must have evidence that a person passing a counterfeit bill is doing so intentionally before making an arrest .
Rodis was arrested at a Walgreens on Ocean Avenue near his San Francisco home .
The $ 100 bill he gave the clerk was from 1985 and lacked anti-counterfeiting marks that appear on newer money .
The cashier thought the bill was odd and summoned the store manager , who tested the bill with a special pen that indicated it was authentic .
Still , the manager called police , who concluded the bill was a fake and arrested Rodis on suspicion of possessing counterfeit currency .
As the judges wrote , " No effort was made to investigate Rodis ' state of mind . "
After talking to the Secret Service , the police officers drove Rodis back to the drugstore .
He spent about an hour in custody .
The appeals court had ruled in August 2007 that Rodis could take his lawsuit to trial .
However , San Francisco appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit for further review in light of its ruling in another case involving immunity for police officers .

Seven children were among at least 14 people killed when a huge mudslide hit a bus stop in a remote area of Papua New Guinea .
Heavy rain in the Eastern Highlands caused a hill to give way near the rural bus stop .
An avalanche of mud slammed into the area and engulfed two buses and three houses near Watabung on the Okuk Highway .
Disaster authorities say it is unclear just how many people have been killed because recovery efforts are being hampered by local landowners .
They are demanding compensation money from the Government before allowing the search to take place .
A smaller landslip had cut the highway on Monday and buses were stopping at either side of the debris to allow people to walk across and continue to their destinations when the second landslide occurred , said National Disaster Service chairman Manasupe Zurenuoc .
" What has occurred is unfortunate .
People living along the highway must take precautions during this heavy downpour the country is experiencing , " he said .
Steven Chu Primer - Quick bio : Nobel Prize - winning physicist , current director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
Long - time laser researcher at Stanford and Bell Labs .
If the rumors are true , and I dearly hope they are , President - elect Barack Obama could not have made a better choice to head up the Department of Energy than Nobel Prize - winning physicist Steven Chu .
At his current post as the director of the DOE 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Chu's goal has been nothing short of solving the world 's energy problems .
When I interviewed him four years ago for the Contra Costa Times when he took the job as director , he told me , " Would n't it be nice if we could solve this problem ?
I think we 're poised to help in a major way . "
Since then he has been hard at work chasing this ambitious goal , and making an impressive amount of progress .
He was the driving force behind big energy projects at Berkeley Lab such as the solar energy initiative known as Helios , set to begin construction in 2010 .
He also led the way in creating the Joint BioEnergy Institute which is working toward developing biofuels and the Energy Biosciences Institute .
Chu won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1997 for work he did at Bell Labs devising a way to cool , trap and manipulate individual atoms with laser light .
After Bell Labs , he worked at Stanford University where he was a driving force behind a $ 150 million project called Bio - X designed to bring scientists from different fields together to solve problems .
In 2004 , he became the first Asian American to head a DOE lab .
The potential to make an impact by finding and developing a new source of sustainable energy for the world is what drew him to Berkeley Lab .
And now he is on the verge of being in a position to make a much bigger impact as Secretary of Energy .
If he does indeed land the job , I have no doubt that it will be a very good thing for the country .

Details of the government ’s plans to clean up the nation ’s banks ignited a blazing stock market rally on Monday , lifting Wall Street to its best one - day performance in five months and tempting some investors to imagine what they would not have dared just a few weeks ago  that the worst may finally be over .
The Dow surged nearly 500 points , and the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index rose more than 7 percent , in what amounted to a rare cheer from Wall Street for the Obama administration and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner .
“ This is what the markets wanted , ” said David Bianco , chief United States equity strategist at UBS .
In the last two weeks , glimmers of hope for a recovery in the financial industry have pushed the Dow up 19 percent and the S.& P. 500 up 21.5 percent from their bear market lows , the steepest such rally in stocks since 1938 .
Just last month , major stock markets spiraled to a 12 - year low after the administration delivered a rough outline of a public - private partnership to shore up the major banks  with little substance or detail .
Cody Lundin ’s Self - Reliant Home ... doing more with less .
Read an excerpt about Cody ’s self - reliant home from his best - selling book When All Hell Breaks Loose : Stuff You Need to Survive When Disaster Strikes !
Chapter 12 : Gimme Shelter !
“ If design , production , and construction cannot be channeled to serve survival , if we fabricate an environment — of which , after all , we seem an inseparable part — but cannot make it an organically possible extension of ourselves , then the end of the race may well appear in sight . ”
– Richard Neutra , Survival Through Design
The optimum ambient temperature in which human beings are able to maintain core body temperature without stress is 79 to 86 degrees F ( 26 to 30 degrees C ) .
Although the modern home now serves many purposes , physical and psychological , a home used to have one main priority .
It matters not if your home is a mansion or a shack for this purpose .
Both the mansion and the shack are simply shelters , and a shelter ’s main purpose in the past was to act as an extension of clothing to help thermoregulate the core body temperature of its occupants .
I do n’t care how much money you ’ve dumped into your shelter to compete with the Joneses , if it ’s too hot or cold inside , you ’ll be miserable .
This almighty god called “ room temperature ” is a phenomenon so common and taken for granted that its importance to comfort and happiness has been completely overlooked by modern urbanites .
It ’s only when the invisible switch of room temperature clicks off that people realize how dependent on the grid they have become .
According to Tony Brown , founder and director of the Ecosa Institute , Americans use more than 30 percent of the country ’s total energy budget to heat and cool their homes .
This wasteful blasphemy should hammer home the point that stabilizing the inner temperature of the home ranks high on the list of priorities for all Americans .
It ’s a blasphemy because there are many alternative building and common - sense options for builders and homeowners alike that severely reduce or all but eliminate the need for heating and cooling the home with outside resources .
The Ecosa Institute is a sustainable design school for architecture students that teaches alternative methods of design , construction , and energy efficiency .
It is part of the growing tide of people worldwide who know there are better options for building smart , efficient homes without pillaging the land .
Imagine how much freer this nation and the world would be if common - sense building alternatives to promote energy efficiency were actively promoted by the world ’s governments .
What if we eliminated even half of the above percentage of our nation ’s energy dependence by simply building or modifying current homes to make better use of free energy sources and conserve the ones they use ?
Luckily , we do n’t have to wait for status quo politicians who seem to be more interested in keeping their job than doing their job .

The Self - Reliant Freedom of Good Design
“ My precept to all who build is , that the owner should be an ornament to the house , and not the house to the owner . ” -- Cicero
In a modern outdoor survival situation the most common way to die is to succumb to hypothermia , low body temperature , or hyperthermia , high body temperature .
Knowing this , and knowing that this country has become a slave to foreign energy in order to have a comfortable living room , I wanted to design a home that would thermoregulate its own core body temperature , and I have .
While my home looks unconventional , the basic concepts that I ’ve incorporated to achieve energy freedom are orientation , thermal mass , and insulation .
These common - sense concepts can be applied to any home regardless of the materials it ’s constructed from or how it looks .
It ’s winter in the high desert as I write this , and last night the thermometer outside read 9 degrees F ( minus 13 degrees C ) , a bit colder than typical and , ironically , part of the same storm system that left 500,000 people without power in the Midwest .
Regardless of single - digit temperatures , my home remained a cozy 72 degrees F ( 22 degrees C ) , and it did so without using any conventional energy resources .
I have no heating bills of any kind and I do n’t burn wood .
My home is heated entirely by the free clean energy of the sun , a phenomenon commonly referred to as “ passive solar . ”
Along with orienting my home solar south , I have the proper square footage of windows to match the square footage of my home so that it does n’t under - or overheat .
These windows let in shortwave radiation from the sun that soaks into my stone floor during the day .
At night when outside temperatures dip , the stone floor , which is a great conductor of the sun ’s energy , re-radiates the stored sunshine , or heat , as long - wave radiation that keeps the house warm .
Insulation and thermal mass help retain the heat throughout the night .
The process starts anew the next day .
Even though my home is dependent on the sun for heat , it ’s designed to retain this comfort for several days of cloudy weather or storms .
top
In the summertime , when outside temperatures hit triple digits , I enjoy inside temps in the high 70s ( approximately 25 degrees C ) .
I have no cooling bills of any kind .
A simple roof overhang designed for my window height and latitude keeps the higher summer sun ’s rays from hitting the stone floor .
My windows and doors are situated to take advantage of the prevailing weather patterns and the cooler nighttime breezes .
In fact , the entire front of the house is a huge parabola that acts as a scoop to harness the dominant southwestern weather systems for optimal natural free ventilation when required .
Once again , thermal mass and insulation keep out hot temperatures while maintaining the cooler inside environment .
I ’ve utilized an open floor plan that allows natural light from the sun to reach all rooms of the house , even though my house is underground .
This eliminates the need for artificial lighting of any kind until it gets dark outside .
The wall paint is impregnated with mica , which is highly reflective of natural or artificial light , thereby increasing the light value .
Hundreds of pieces of shattered mirror line a vertical skylight that reflects sunlight into a back room that has no windows of its own .
What electrical lighting , appliances ( including a microwave , washing machine , and computer ) , and tools that I require are powered by a self - contained solar system .
A carport to shield vehicles from the summer sun doubles as a rain catchment surface , which funnels thousands of gallons of potable water into a holding tank that gravity feeds into the house .
My hot water comes from the sun as well , which heats up water - filled panels and the salvaged inside of a conventional water heater that ’s painted black .
Although much of the time I use a small , two - burner , propane - fueled stove for cooking , my solar oven cooks everything from lentil soup to chocolate cake for free .
Regardless of my frequent stove use , by paying attention to fuel consumption as outlined in the creative cooking chapter , I can make my barbeque grill - sized propane tank ( twenty - pound cylinder ) last more than a year and a half .
And it costs less than thirteen dollars to fill .
top
The rooms in my home are a series of parabolas , one of nature ’s strongest shapes , thus my home was built for a fraction of the cost of traditional earth homes that require massive infrastructure to hold up the weight of the earth .
The shape of my roof is , of course , arched , like the top of an igloo , so even though grass and flowers grow on the roof , it does n’t leak , as there is no flat surface for water to collect .
The precipitation that does hit the roof is directed by earthen contours and berms toward waiting fruit trees that are heavily mulched with compost , sand , and stone to conserve water .
The earth acts as thermal mass , helping to slow down fluctuations in temperature , and the grasses on the roof not only stabilize the earth from erosion , but act as insulation , especially during the hot summer months when they shade the roof from the sun .
The hot - season native gramma grasses require no water other than rain and also provide forage for the wild desert cottontail rabbits ( which I hunt for food ) that live on my roof .
In short , my off - the - grid home thermoregulates its own inner temperature in hot and cold weather extremes , self - ventilates , lights itself during daylight hours , and provides supplemental meat for the table , all for free , and all with very little activity on my part .
It does so because I researched and implemented the virtues of good building design and paid strict attention to the natural world of my particular building site .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
Even while southeastern Australia battled high heat and the most deadly fires in their history in February 2009 , much of the rest of Australia flooded .
Wet - season rains brought severe flooding to Western Australia , Queensland , and New South Wales .
The most widespread flooding was in Queensland , where more than one million square kilometers flooded , reported the AFP wire service .
This image shows flooding along the Flinders River system in northern Queensland .
The image was taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Aqua satellite on Feburary 18 , 2009 .
The lower image was taken on December 16 , 2008 , before the weeks of rain started .
In December , the various rivers that make up the Flinders River System were discernible only by the lines of green vegetation that followed their courses through the dry land .
Two months later , the flooded river system , with its myriad channels , covered more than 100 kilometers from east to west .
The water ranges in color from pale blue to black in these images , which include both infrared and visible light to increase the contrast between water and earth .
Lighter blue water is either extremely shallow ( merely moistened mud channels ) or thick with sediment .
Clearer or deeper water is black .
At least some of the pale blue water is colored with sediment because dense plumes of sediment poured into the Gulf of Carpentaria .
In addition to causing floods , the intense rain sustained plant growth .
In two months , the color of the landscape changed from tan - pink , the color of bare or sparsely vegetated ground , to green , the color of plant - covered land .
The floods shown here isolated communities in northern Australia , including Karumba and Normanton near the mouth of the river system .
Taiwan ’s Formosat - 2 satellite captured a detailed image of the floods in Normanton on February 19 , 2009 .

Introduction
Python is a nice scripting language .
It even gives you access to its own parser and compiler .
It also gives you access to different other parsers for special purposes like XML and string templates .
But sometimes you may want to have your own parser .
This is what 's pyPEG for .
And pyPEG supports Unicode .
pyPEG is a plain and simple intrinsic parser interpreter framework for Python version 2.7 and 3.x .
It is based on Parsing Expression Grammar , PEG .
With pyPEG you can parse many formal languages in a very easy way .
How does that work ?
Installation
You can install a 2.x series pyPEG release from PyPY with :
pip install pypeg2
Parsing text with pyPEG
PEG is something like Regular Expressions with recursion .
The grammars are like templates .
Let 's make an example .
Let 's say , you want to parse a function declaration in a C like language .
Such a function declaration consists of :
type declaration name parameters block with instructions
int f ( int a , long b ) { do_this ; do_that ; }
With pyPEG you 're declaring a Python class for each object type you want to parse .
This class is then instanciated for each parsed object .
This class gets an attribute grammar with a description what should be parsed in what way .
In our simple example , we are supporting two different things declared as keywords in our language : int and long .
So we 're writing a class declaration for the typing , which supports an Enum of the two possible keywords as its grammar :
class Type( Keyword ) : grammar = Enum ( K ( " int " ) , K ( " long " ) )
Common parsing tasks are included in the pyPEG framework .
In this example , we 're using the Keyword class because the result will be a keyword , and we 're using Keyword objects ( with the abbreviation K ) , because what we parse will be one of the enlisted keywords .
The total result will be a Function .
So we 're declaring a Function class :
class Function : grammar = Type , …
The next thing will be the name of the Function to parse .
Names are somewhat special in pyPEG .
But they 're easy to handle : to parse a name , there is a ready made name ( ) function you can call in your grammar to generate a .name Attribute :
class Function : grammar = Type , name ( ) , …
Now for the Parameters part .
First let 's declare a class for the parameters .
Parameters has to be a collection , because there may be many of them .
pyPEG has some ready made collections .
For the case of the Parameters , the Namespace collection will fit .
It provides indexed access by name , and Parameters have names ( in our example : a and b ) .
We write it like this :
class Parameters ( Namespace ) : grammar = …
A single Parameter has a structure itself .
It has a Type and a name ( ) .
So let 's define :
class Parameter : grammar = Type , name ( ) class Parameters ( Namespace ) : grammar = …
pyPEG will instantiate the Parameter class for each parsed parameter .
Where will the Type go to ?
The name ( ) function will generate a .name Attribute , but the Type object ?
Well , let 's move it to an Attribute , too , named . typing .
To generate an Attribute , pyPEG offers the attr ( ) function :
class Parameter : grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) class Parameters ( Namespace ) : grammar = …
By the way : name ( ) is just a shortcut for attr ( " name " , Symbol ) .
It generates a Symbol .
How can we fill our Namespace collection named Parameters ?
Well , we have to declare , how a list of Parameter objects will look like in our source text .
An easy way is offered by pyPEG with the cardinality functions .
In this case we can use maybe_some ( ) .
This function represents the asterisk cardinality , *
class Parameter : grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) class Parameters ( Namespace ) : grammar = Parameter , maybe_some ( " , " , Parameter )
This is how we express a comma separated list .
Because this task is so common , there is a shortcut generator function again , csl ( ) .
The code below will do the same as the code above :
class Parameter : grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) class Parameters ( Namespace ) : grammar = csl( Parameter )
Maybe a function has no parameters .
This is a case we have to consider .
What should happen then ?
In our example , then the Parameters Namespace should be empty .
We 're using another cardinality function for that case , optional ( ) .
It represents the question mark cardinality , ?
class Parameter : grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) class Parameters ( Namespace ) : grammar = optional ( csl ( Parameter ) )
We can continue with our Function class .
The Parameters will be in parantheses , we just put that into the grammar :
class Function : grammar = Type , name ( ) , " ( " , Parameters , " ) " , …
Now for the block of instructions .
We could declare another collection for the Instructions .
But the function itself can be seen as a list of instructions .
So let us declare it this way .
First we make the Function class itself a List :
class Function ( List ) : grammar = Type , name ( ) , " ( " , Parameters , " ) " , …
If a class is a List , pyPEG will put everything inside this list , which will be parsed and does not generate an Attribute .
So with that modification , our Parameters now will be put into that List , too .
And so will be the Type .
This is an option , but in our example , it is not what we want .
So let 's move them to an Attribute .typing and an Attribute . parms respectively :
class Function ( List ) : grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) , \ " ( " , attr ( " parms " , Parameters ) , " ) " , …
Now we can define what a block will look like , and put it just behind into the grammar of a Function .
The Instruction class we have plain and simple .
Of course , in a real world example , it can be pretty complex ;-)
Here we just have it as a word .
A word is a predefined RegEx ; it is re.compile ( r " \w + " ) .
class Instruction ( str ) : grammar = word , " ; " block = " { " , maybe_some ( Instruction ) , " } "
Now let 's put that to the tail of our Function .
grammar :
class Function ( List ) : grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) , \ " ( " , attr ( " parms " , Parameters ) , " ) " , block
Caveat : pyPEG 2.x is written for Python 3 .
You can use it with Python 2.7 with the following import ( you do n't need that for Python 3 ) :
from __future__ import unicode_literals , print_function
Well , that looks pretty good now .
Let 's try it out using the parse ( ) function :
>>> from pypeg2 import * >>> class Type( Keyword ) : ... grammar = Enum ( K ( " int " ) , K ( " long " ) ) ... >>> class Parameter : ... grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) ... >>> class Parameters ( Namespace ) : ... grammar = optional ( csl( Parameter ) ) ... >>> class Instruction ( str ) : ... grammar = word , " ; " ... >>> block = " { " , maybe_some ( Instruction ) , " } " >>> class Function ( List ) : ... grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , name ( ) , \ ... " ( " , attr ( " parms " , Parameters ) , " ) " , block ... >>> f = parse ( " int f( int a , long b ) { do_this ; do_that ; } " , ... Function ) >>> f.name Symbol ( 'f ' ) >>> f.typing Symbol ( 'int ' ) >>> f.parms [ " b " ] . typing Symbol ( ' long ' ) >>> f[ 0 ] ' do_this ' >>> f[ 1 ] ' do_that '
Composing text
pyPEG can do more .
It is not only a framework for parsing text , it can compose source code , too .
A pyPEG grammar is not only “ just like ” a template , it can actually be used as a template for composing text .
Just call the compose ( ) function :
>>> compose(f , autoblank =False ) ' intf ( inta , longb ) {do_this;do_that ;} '
As you can see , for composing first there is a lack of whitespace .
This is because we used the automated whitespace removing functionality of pyPEG while parsing ( which is enabled by default ) but we disabled the automated adding of blanks if violating syntax otherwise .
To improve on that we have to extend our grammar templates a little bit .
For that case , there are callback function objects in pyPEG .
They 're only executed by compose ( ) and ignored by parse ( ) .
And as usual , there are predefined ones for the common cases .
Let 's try that out .
First let 's add blank between things which should be separated :
class Parameter : grammar = attr (" typing " , Type ) , blank , name ( ) class Function ( List ) : grammar = attr ( " typing " , Type ) , blank , name ( ) , \ " ( " , attr ( " parms " , Parameters ) , " ) " , block
After resetting everything , this will lead to the output :
>>> compose( f , autoblank =False ) 'int f( int a , long b) {do_this;do_that;} '
The blank after the comma int a , long b was generated by the csl ( ) function ; csl( Parameter ) generates :
Parameter , maybe_some ( " , " , blank , Parameter )
Indenting text
In C like languages ( like our example ) we like to indent blocks .
Indention is something , which is relative to a current position .
If something is inside a block already , and should be indented , it has to be indented two times ( and so on ) .
For that case pyPEG has an indention system .
The indention system basically is using the generating function indent ( ) and the callback function object endl .
With indent we can mark what should be indented , sending endl means here should start the next line of the source code being output .
We can use this for our block :
class Instruction ( str ) : grammar = word , " ; " , endl block = " { " , endl , maybe_some ( indent ( Instruction ) ) , " } " , endl class Function ( List ) : grammar = attr ( " typing " , Type ) , blank , name ( ) , \ " ( " , attr ( " parms " , Parameters ) , " ) " , endl , block
This changes the output to :
>>> print( compose(f ) ) int f( int a , long b ) { do_this ; do_that ; }
User defined Callback Functions
With User defined Callback Functions pyPEG offers the needed flexibility to be useful as a general purpose template system for code generation .
In our simple example let 's say we want to have processing information in comments in the Function declaration , i.e. the indention level in a comment bevor each Instruction .
For that we can define our own Callback Function :
class Instruction ( str ) : def heading ( self , parser ) : return " /* on level " + str(parser.indention_level ) \ + " */ " , endl
Such a Callback Function is called with two arguments .
The first argument is the object to output .
The second argument is the parser object to get state information of the composing process .
Because this fits the convention for Python methods , you can write it as a method of the class where it belongs to .
The return value of such a Callback Function must be the resulting text .
In our example , a C comment shell be generated with notes .
We can put this now into the grammar .
class Instruction ( str ) : def heading ( self , parser ) : return " /* on level " + str(parser.indention_level ) \ + " */ " , endl grammar = heading , word , " ; " , endl
The result is corresponding :
>>> print( compose(f ) ) int f( int a , long b ) { /* on level 1 */ do_this ; /* on level 1 */ do_that ; }
XML output
Sometimes you want to process what you parsed with the XML toolchain , or with the YML toolchain .
Because of that , pyPEG has an XML backend .
Just call the thing2xml ( ) function to get bytes with encoded XML :
>>> from pypeg2.xmlast import thing2xml >>> print ( thing2xml( f , pretty = True ) .decode ( ) ) < Function typing = " int " name= " f " >
< Parameters > < Parameter typing = " int " name= " a " /> < Parameter typing =" long " name= " b " /> </ Parameters > < Instruction > do_this</Instruction > < Instruction > do_that</ Instruction > </ Function >

Canadian researchers have uncovered an internet spy network , based mostly in China , that has hacked into computers owned by governments and private organizations in 103 countries .
The findings released Sunday follow a 10 - month investigation by researchers from the Ottawa - based think tank SecDev Group and the Munk Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto .
The group was initially asked to look into allegations that the Chinese were hacking into computers set up by the Tibetan exile community , but their work eventually led them to a much wider network of compromised computers .
Once the hackers infiltrated the systems , they installed malware — software that sends and receives data .
By doing this , they were able to gain control of the electronic mail server computers of the Dalai Lama ’s organization , the group said .
The researchers said the spy network , dubbed GhostNet , infiltrated at least 1,295 computers , many belonging to embassies , foreign ministries and other government offices , as well as the Dalai Lama ’s Tibetan exile centres in India , Brussels , London and New York .
Embassies , foreign affairs ministries targeted
" Significantly , close to 30 per cent of the infected computers can be considered high - value and include the ministries of foreign affairs in Iran , Bangladesh , Latvia , Indonesia , Philippines , Brunei , Barbados and Bhutan , " the researchers said .
Other compromised computers were discovered at embassies of India , South Korea , Indonesia , Romania , Cyprus , Malta , Thailand , Taiwan , Portugal , Germany and Pakistan .
The list continues with the network infiltrating economic organizations in Southeast Asia , news organizations , and an unclassified computer located at NATO headquarters .
Although almost all the hackers were based in China , the researchers could not say whether they are working for the government .
A spokesman for the Chinese consulate in New York dismissed the idea that China was involved .
The spokesman , Wenqi Gao , told The New York Times these are " old stories " and " nonsense . "
A ' wakeup call ' for international community
" This is a wakeup call for the international community , " said Rafal Rohozinski of SecDev Group , who is one of the principal authors of the report .
" At the moment there is no clear legal framework for how you deal with a spy network . "
Rohozinski said three out of the four servers in the network are based in China and one is in the United States , complicating any efforts to launch a criminal investigation .
" It 's all a question of jurisdiction .
Obviously the Chinese government would have a capability — a legal jurisdiction — to investigate the servers located on their territory .
But that is ultimately up to them , " he told CBC News .
" Certainly in the States — because one of the control servers happens to be located there — we fully expect the DHS [ Department of Homeland Security ] or the FBI will be investigating , " Rohozinski said .
One of several infections that have been installed gives the hacker full control over the compromised computer , giving the culprit the ability to look at all files , including emails .
" They can surreptitiously turn on the [ computer 's ] microphone or the video camera and record you .
And moreover , because what we found is a trojan which at this moment is undetectable by exisiting firewalls or virus technologies , it can essentially do a data infinitum .
" In fact , some of the computers on this network have been lit up — meaning they have been compromised — for over 400 days , " Rohozinski said .
If George Patton had coached a girls soccer team , he probably would have run things this way ; only without so many references to red meat .
Meet Michael Kinahan , ex-coach of the Scituate , Mass .
Green Death .

Kinahan resigned as the coach of the 6 - and 7 - year - old girls team ( not pictured ) before the season even started , due to a hilarious and possibly insane email sent to parents as a way to introduce himself .
Rather than try to explain it , let 's get right to the fun .
This portion of the letter is aimed at the sideline behavior of the parents , and is possibly my favorite part :
It is imperative that we all fight the good fight , get involved now and resist the urge to become sweat - xedo - wearing yuppies who sit on the sidelines in their LL Bean chairs sipping mocha - latte - half - caf - chinos while discussing reality TV and home decorating with other feeble - minded folks .
I want to hear cheering , I want to hear encouragement , I want to get the team pumped up at each and every game and know they are playing for something .

Other excerpts ( keep in mind this team is comprised of 6 - and 7 - year - old girls ) :
OK , here 's the real deal : Team 7 will be called Green Death .
We will only acknowledge " Team 7 " for scheduling and disciplinary purposes .
Green Death has had a long and colorful history , and I fully expect every player and parent to be on board with the team .
This is not a team , but a family ( some say cult ) , that you belong to forever .
We play fair at all times , but we play tough and physical soccer .
We have some returning players who know the deal ; for the others , I only expect 110 % at every game and practice .
We do not cater to superstars , but prefer the gritty determination of journeymen who bring their lunch pail to work every week , chase every ball and dig in corners like a Michael Vick pit bull .
Unless there is an issue concerning the health of my players or inside info on the opposition , you probably do n't need to talk to me .
I believe winning is fun and losing is for losers .
Ergo , we will strive for the " W " in each game .
While we may not win every game ( excuse me , I just got a little nauseated ) I expect us to fight for every loose ball and play every shift as if it were the finals of the World Cup .
While I spent a good Saturday morning listening to the legal liability BS , which included a 30 minute dissertation on how we need to baby the kids and especially the refs , I was disgusted .
The kids will run , they will fall , get bumps , bruises and even bleed a little .
Big deal , it 's good for them ( but I do hope the other team is the one bleeding ) .
If the refs can't handle a little criticism , then they should turn in their whistle .
The sooner they figure out how to make a decision and live with the consequences the better .
My heckling of the refs is actually helping them develop as people .
The political correctness police are not welcome on my sidelines .
America 's youth is becoming fat , lazy and non-competitive because competition is viewed as " bad " .
I argue that competition is good and is important to the evolution of our species and our survival in what has become an increasingly competitive global economy and dangerous world .
Second place trophies are nothing to be proud of as they serve only as a reminder that you missed your goal ; their only useful purpose is as an inspiration to do that next set of reps .
Do you go to a job interview and not care about winning ?
Do n't animals eat what they kill ( and yes , someone actually kills the meat we eat too – it is n't grown in plastic wrap ) ?
And speaking of meat , I expect that the ladies be put on a diet of fish , undercooked red meat and lots of veggies .
No junk food .
Who 's with me ?
Go Green Death !
Hilarity did not ensue .
From Kinahan 's resignation letter :
Team ,
After careful consideration , I have decided to resign from all coaching responsibilities related to Team 7 this season .
Unfortunately , it has come to my attention that some parents and the Board of Scituate Soccer failed to see the humor in my pre-season email .
And finally , from the Quincy Patriot Ledger mailbag :
• Spectacular .... too bad these girls will have their coach replaced by some Starbucks sipping , land rover driving parent with no love and / or knowledge of the game .
But on the bright side , everyone will get a trophy and there will be oranges for all during timeouts .
I 'd let my daughter play for this man in a heartbeat .

Speaking at an investor conference in San Francisco yesterady , departing Yahoo CFO Blake Jorgensen said the company 's " class one " advertising inventory -- the stuff that goes on Yahoo.com -- has finally begun to stabilize .
“ We have seen our own class one stabilize through the fourth quarter , ” said Blake , according to Digits .
Previously , Yahoo had said " class one " inventory rates had slumped the worst during the current recession .
In other display advertising good news , though on a smaller scale , Gawker Media 's Nick Denton told staffers that company 's ad revenues are up 20 % so far in 2009 .
Yesterday , we shared some advice for publishers looking to create and sell their own premium inventory .
We learned it from Razorfish execs Terri Walter and Sarah Baehr .
Here 's that again , in case you missed it :
Quit thinking about advertising as something that belongs on the periphery of your site .
Package your unit as a " sponsorship . "
Advertisers love to convey the feeling that your brilliant content is " brought to you by " their brand clients .
" Sponsorships will always be valuable , " said Terri .
Advertisers love to convey the feeling that your brilliant content is " brought to you by " their brand clients .
" Sponsorships will always be valuable , " said Terri .
Here 's are two words Terri and Sarah love to use : " Personalization " and " depth . "
A premium ad unit needs premium content ( and a premium sales force to push it ) .
Terri :
" The publishers that are having problems are the ones that have n't invested enough in their content or their ad sales team . "
Speaking of your ad sales force , Sarah says publishers need to make sure their sales forces are armed with more than just comScore numbers .
To create a unique ad unit , an agency needs to know what 's special about how your readers / users interact with your content .
The agency will only figure that out if your sales people explain it to them .
Says Sarah : " I can't tell you why users like your site .
If you can't help me leverage your site in a unique way , I 'll find some one else . "
Prepare to hand over lots of real estate .
Terri and Sarah love what MSNBC did with its " push - down " Olympics ads last summer .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Expect plenty of fireworks when the U.S. Congress meets next week for a post-election session focused largely on the ailing U.S. economy .

With Barack Obama preparing to become the 44th U.S. president on January 20 , lawmakers will take another crack at providing fiscal relief to Americans and the U.S. auto industry , and elect leaders for the new Congress set to convene on January 6 with Obama ’s Democrats in stronger control .
Lawmakers also will move to expel Republican Ted Stevens from the Senate if a protracted ballot count shows that Alaska voters returned the 84 - year - old senator to Washington after his conviction for corruption last month .
In addition , Democrats also will decide what , if any , punishment to impose on Connecticut Sen .
Joe Lieberman , a Democrat turned independent , for actively campaigning for Republican John McCain for president ahead of the November 4 election .
Obama has privately opposed ousting Lieberman from the Senate Democratic conference , saying that would break Obama ’s vow to set aside partisanship , a party source said .
It is unclear what Lieberman would do if stripped of a committee chairmanship , as threatened .
But as one Democratic Party aide put it , “ He ’s keeping all his options open , ” including , apparently , bolting to the Republican Party .
CARMAKERS ON THE LINE
On the economic front , Democrats are working to direct $ 25 billion in loans to Detroit automakers , who say the action is needed to survive their worst - ever fiscal downturn .
Support , however , is uncertain , especially from Senate Republicans reluctant to legislate yet more money for business rescues .
They also are not convinced General Motors Corp , Chrysler LLC and Ford Motor
Co are viable with overall industry sales plunging and consumers moving away from American - made gas guzzlers .
Bailout foes suggest Congress amend a separate $ 25 billion loan program approved in September for automakers to retool factories necessary to produce electric cars and other more fuel - efficient products .
At the same time , Democrats are clamoring to inject at least tens of billions of dollars into the economy to help ease the worst fiscal crisis since The Great Depression .
But with outgoing President George W. Bush and fellow Republicans wanting to give a new $ 700 billion rescue package for the financial industry more time to kick in , Obama may have to wait until he takes office to sign any additional economic stimulus into law .
Senate leaders swapped open letters on Friday in advance of next week ’s showdown .
“ The adoption of a robust recovery package should be the top priority , ” wrote Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada , urging Republicans to reconsider apparent plans to block such a measure .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky fired back by complaining that Reid had yet to provide details .
“ Taxpayers deserve to know if this bailout would increase the national debt and raise their taxes , ” McConnell wrote .
The Senate is to reconvene on Monday , likely for about a week .
House Democrats say they will move quickly to give final approval to any relief measures that win Senate passage .
PARTY LEADERS
Lawmakers will elect party leaders for the new Senate and House of Representatives that will convene in January with their biggest Democratic majorities in years .
Democrats will also pick committee chairs .
In the November 4 election , Democrats picked up 22 seats in the 435 - member House to raise their majority to 257 with a few races yet to be decided .
Democrats gained six Senate seats , increasing their majority in the 100 - member chamber to 57 .
Three razor - close Senate races have not yet been decided .
All involve seats now held by Republicans -- Stevens in Alaska , Norm Coleman in Minnesota and Saxby Chambliss in Georgia .
A final vote count in the Stevens race may come next week .
Minnesota and Georgia are headed for a recount and runoff , respectively , next month .
If Democrats capture all three , they would have a majority big enough , 60 , to pass legislation over Republican procedural hurdles .
“ Possible but unlikely , ” said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , head of the Senate Democratic campaign committee .
If Stevens wins , senators promise to move to expel him for his conviction last month of lying on Senate disclosure forms by failing to report more than $ 250,000 in home improvements and other gifts from an oil executive .
Democrats want to move quickly but Republicans may try to wait until after a Stevens appeal .
That could take months .
But South Carolina Republican Sen. Jim DeMint wants to act now .
He is pushing for a vote to strip Stevens of committee assignments and oust him from the Senate Republican conference .
“ We should clean our own house , ” a DeMint aide said .
Note to journalists :
Please report that this research was presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society
SALT LAKE CITY , March 23 , 2009 -- Researchers are reporting compelling new scientific evidence for the existence of low - energy nuclear reactions ( LENR ) , the process once called " cold fusion " that may promise a new source of energy .
One group of scientists , for instance , describes what it terms the first clear visual evidence that LENR devices can produce neutrons , subatomic particles that scientists view as tell - tale signs that nuclear reactions are occurring .
Low - energy nuclear reactions could potentially provide 21st Century society a limitless and environmentally - clean energy source for generating electricity , researchers say .
The report , which injects new life into this controversial field , will be presented here today at the American Chemical Society 's 237th National Meeting .
It is among 30 papers on the topic that will be presented during a four - day symposium , " New Energy Technology , " March 22 - 25 , in conjunction with the 20th anniversary of the first description of cold fusion .
" Our finding is very significant , " says study co-author and analytical chemist Pamela Mosier - Boss , Ph.D. , of the U.S. Navy 's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center ( SPAWAR ) in San Diego , Calif .
" To our knowledge , this is the first scientific report of the production of highly energetic neutrons from an LENR device . "
The first report on " cold fusion , " presented in 1989 by Martin Fleishmann and Stanley Pons , was a global scientific sensation .
Fusion is the energy source of the sun and the stars .
Scientists had been striving for years to tap that power on Earth to produce electricity from an abundant fuel called deuterium that can be extracted from seawater .
Everyone thought that it would require a sophisticated new genre of nuclear reactors able to withstand temperatures of tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit .
Pons and Fleishmann , however , claimed achieving nuclear fusion at comparatively " cold " room temperatures -- in a simple tabletop laboratory device termed an electrolytic cell .
But other scientists could not reproduce their results , and the whole field of research declined .
A stalwart cadre of scientists persisted , however , seeking solid evidence that nuclear reactions can occur at low temperatures .
One of their problems involved extreme difficulty in using conventional electronic instruments to detect the small number of neutrons produced in the process , researchers say .
In the new study , Mosier - Boss and colleagues inserted an electrode composed of nickel or gold wire into a solution of palladium chloride mixed with deuterium or " heavy water " in a process called co-deposition .
A single atom of deuterium contains one neutron and one proton in its nucleus .
Researchers passed electric current through the solution , causing a reaction within seconds .
The scientists then used a special plastic , CR - 39 , to capture and track any high - energy particles that may have been emitted during reactions , including any neutrons emitted during the fusion of deuterium atoms .
At the end of the experiment , they examined the plastic with a microscope and discovered patterns of " triple tracks , " tiny - clusters of three adjacent pits that appear to split apart from a single point .
The researchers say that the track marks were made by subatomic particles released when neutrons smashed into the plastic .
Importantly , Mosier - Boss and colleagues believe that the neutrons originated in nuclear reactions , perhaps from the combining or fusing deuterium nuclei .
" People have always asked ' Where 's the neutrons ? ' "
Mosier - Boss says .
" If you have fusion going on , then you have to have neutrons .
We now have evidence that there are neutrons present in these LENR reactions . "
They cited other evidence for nuclear reactions including X - rays , tritium ( another form of hydrogen ) , and excess heat .
Meanwhile , Mosier - Boss and colleagues are continuing to explore the phenomenon to get a better understanding of exactly how LENR works , which is key to being able to control it for practical purposes .
Mosier - Boss points out that the field currently gets very little funding and , despite its promise , researchers can't predict when , or if , LENR may emerge from the lab with practical applications .
The U.S. Department of the Navy and JWK International Corporation in Annandale , Va. , funded the study .
Other highlights in the symposium include :
Overview , update on LENR by editor of New Energy Times - Steve Krivit , editor of New Energy Times and author of " The Rebirth of Cold Fusion , " will present an overview of the field of low energy nuclear reactions , formerly known as " cold fusion . "
A leading authority on the topic , Krivit will discuss the strengths , weaknesses , and implications of this controversial subject , including its brief history .

Excess heat , gamma radiation production from an unconventional LENR device -- Tadahiko Mizuno , Ph.D. , of Hokkaido University in Japan , has reported the production of excess heat generation and gamma ray emissions from an unconventional LENR device that uses phenanthrene , a type of hydrocarbon , as a reactant .
He is the author of the book " Nuclear Transmutation : The Reality of Cold Fusion . "
( ENVR 049 , Monday , March 23 , 3:35 p.m. , Hilton , Alpine Ballroom West , during the symposium , " New Energy Technology . " )
New evidence supporting production and control of low energy nuclear reactions -- Antonella De Ninno , Ph.D. , a scientist with New Technologies Energy and Environment in Italy , will describe evidence supporting the existence of low energy nuclear reactions .
She conducted lab experiments demonstrating the simultaneous production of both excess heat and helium gas , tell - tale evidence supporting the nuclear nature of LENR .
She also shows that scientists can control the phenomenon .

With Fort Myers , 15 miles to the west , developers left little room for schools , parks or even businesses .
What they sold was sun and quiet living .
“ They used to bring 20 busloads a day , ” said Bob Elliott , a former salesman for Mr. Ratner ’s company who struck out on his own in 1982 .
“ We had 300 customers , seven days a week . ”
By 2000 , the lots had been sold , but most stayed empty .
Only about 30,000 people were living in an area roughly four times the size of Manhattan .
The builders really started to arrive in 2004 , setting up model homes on Lee Boulevard next to Mr. Elliott ’s office with the faded wooden sign that said “ $ 50 lots . ”
Bill Spikowski , a city planning consultant in Fort Myers , said that because Lehigh Acres had so many parcels and few restrictions on what could be built , smaller companies battled for customers .
From 2004 to the end of 2006 , developers completed 13,183 units in Lehigh Acres — nearly doubling the total stock of 15,216 that existed in 2000 , according to Lee County figures .
Residents remember the boom for its noise , with dump trucks lining the streets and power tools heard in nearly every neighborhood .
Housing prices doubled , then tripled , and jobs were plentiful , nearly all of them tied to real estate .
Signs of trouble were ignored .
“ Sometimes houses would sell three or four times in a few months , and no one would move in , ” Mr. Elliott said .
Then in 2007 , it all went quiet .
Houses stopped selling .
Foreclosures multiplied .
The median home price in the Fort Myers area dropped to $ 215,200 in December 2007 , from a peak of $ 322,300 in December 2005 .
It had fallen to $ 106,900 two months ago .
Browsing apps in the App Store is n't quite criminal , but it 's definitely not optimal for finding fantastic apps .
Besides Giz 's own iPhone app coverage and roundups , there are four other ways to find buried goodness .
Advertisement
TheAppleBlog lays out four different sites that make it way easier to find the quality app gems that are wallowing , helplessly , in the toxic cesspool of utter crap that makes up most of the App Store .
Advertisement
First up ( and most highly recommend of the bunch ) is AppBeacon , which requires an account , and you track what apps you own , like and dislike , filtering out the crap you 're not interested in ( or that 's just crap ) and bookmarking what you might wanna check out .
Unfortunately , there 's no recommendation system built - in yet based on what you do like , but that 's the next logical step .
AppShopper is from MacRumors '
Arn Kim , and it shows you the newest and mostly recently updated apps , which you can filter by pricepoint and even price changes , so you can see when an app you want gets cheaper .
Advertisement
Apptism is similar to AppBeacon , but has deeper , more customizable filters to get really specific about what you 're looking for .
The killer feature is its Preview listings , which encourages devs to post screenshots and other info about upcoming apps they 're working on .
Advertisement
i Phonexe is apparently pretty crappy and ugly , but the value is that it lists apps for jailbroken phones too .

Update : A bunch of readers recommend the 99 - cent app AppSniper to track app prices and when they get cheaper , from your iPhone , no less .
How do you guys find new and cool iPhone apps ?

Food , Inc. is the latest in a line of cinematic polemics that includes Super Size Me , King Corn , and The Future of Food .
Yet this urgent , graphic film exposes more atrocious things about the food we eat than all of its predecessors combined .
Within five minutes of the opening credits , the screen fills with shots of assembly - line workers staple tagging the heads of chicks , close - ups of hens ’ legs buckling under the weight of their own breasts , and dying chickens packed into polluted sheds .
Then come the acres of cattle ankle deep in manure , sick cows being tortured before slaughter , and engineers proudly displaying pink slabs of ammonia - washed “ hamburger meat filler . ”
Director Robert Kenner is n’t just concerned with the suffering of animals .
He also profiles Americans caught in the snare of the food industry , like Barbara Kowalcyk , whose two - and - a - half - year - old son died after eating an E. coli-infected hamburger .
She ’s spent six years lobbying Congress to empower the usda to shut down meat plants that repeatedly fail microbial testing .
( Who knew it could n’t ? )
For the converted , the film ’s litany of horrors may feel familiar , and there is an overreliance on voice - overs by Michael Pollan ( interviewed here ) and Eric Schlosser .
Yet Food , Inc. still engenders disbelief : How does Big Food get away with this ?
Partly because we , the consumers , often reward it with our purchasing power .
An incitement to change comes , strangely enough , from a vice president of the American Corn Growers Association , who explains , “ People have got to start demanding good , wholesome food from us , and we ’ll deliver . ”
Last year I noted that there were n't anywhere near enough shovel ready public projects to even offset the expected decline in non-residential structure investment in 2009 - much less make up for the declines in residential construction employment and other areas of job losses .
In May of 2008 , I estimated the decrease in non-residential investment for malls , offices and lodging alone at about $ 60 billion .
This is far greater than the $ 18.4 billion estimate of shovel ready projects from The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials .
As the Obama team has noted , properly chosen infrastructure projects provide the best bang for the buck .
These projects provide jobs today , and they are an investment in the future .
We need more projects ...
And since Obama asked for suggestions ...
How about a demolition program ?
First , if any state and local governments have old idle buildings waiting for future plans , why not demolish them today ?
This would provide jobs for local workers , and prepare the land for future development and remove an eyesore .
The Federal Government could pay for this demolition .
Second , how about a tax credit for demolishing residential housing units ?
In many areas there are old , vacant housing units .
These are a public nuisance , but the owners have no motivation to demolish the property .
Why not provide a tax credit if the properties are demolished in 2009 ?
This could eliminate housing units from the housing stock , provide local jobs , and possibly remove a public nuisance .
A demolition plan would probably only add a few billion to the stimulus package , but it would be well targeted providing jobs in many communities and prepare the land for renewed growth in the future .
Just my 2 cents ...
State police say a turkey vulture injured a passenger when it crashed through a minivan 's windshield Friday .
The bird crashed into a red Dodge Caravan at about 8:15 a.m. on Interstate 80 in Parsippany .
It whopped 32 - year - old Vanessa Hurtado in the face , causing minor cuts .
Shards of glass got caught in her eye .
The turkey vulture landed in the middle seat behind the driver , 35 - year - old Jorge Hurtado , who was n't hurt .
He told police that the bird was alive for a brief time following the crash ; the responding officer pronounced the animal dead at the scene .
Eagle Towing ( no pun intended ) towed the vehicle away .
Vanessa Hurtado first asked that the vulture be removed from the car , lest it marinate in the heat .
Turkey vultures , which are not related to turkeys , generally soar in circles on wind currents and are often seen on highway shoulders eating road kill .
This is n't the first time a turkey vulture has left its mark on a New Jerseyan .
In June 2004 , one hit a motorcyclist in the head .
While attempting to get the live bird off of him , the man lost control and struck another car .
He died of his injuries .

Boris 's owner Louise Bell said he was a " gentle giant "
A family from Dorset thought their dog ranked along with the Great Wall of China as being visible from space when they spotted the pet on Google Earth .
Fourteen - stone bull mastiff , Boris , was snapped lounging in the garden , when his owners wanted to see if they could spot their Bournemouth home .
They assumed the picture was taken from hundreds of miles up in space .
But Google Earth said the picture was actually taken by a plane - just a few hundred feet up .
Boris 's owner Louise Bell said : " We are slightly disappointed , we thought Boris would go alongside the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids as being visible from space , but it 's still amazing .
" It all came about because my husband was seeing if we were on the map and zoomed in and there 's Boris on the front lawn .
" He is a gentle giant but the vet says he is healthy , we just call him a big boned chap . "
Microsoft has announced plans to dive into the challenging retail business with its own corporate - branded outlets to take on Apple 's growing visibility among consumers .
A report filed by Reuters said the company had no information on what products the stores would sell , how many it planned to open , or when and where those stores might open .
Those details would be determined by David Porter , a former DreamWorks Animation executive heading up worldwide product distribution who earlier acted as a manager at Wal - Mart .
Opening a new chain of stores would be a monumental task , particularly during a global recession that is literally killing retailers of all kinds .
In a press statement , Microsoft COO Kevin Turner said , " We 're working hard to transform the PC and Microsoft buying experience at retail by improving the articulation and demonstration of the Microsoft innovation and value proposition so that it 's clear , simple and straightforward for consumers everywhere . "
Tech retail stores have a particularly poor track record , with Gateway and Palm failing in their efforts to sell their own hardware in boutique stores , and the high profile failures of CompUSA and Circuit City to operate larger stores with wider PC - related product selections .
Apple 's adventures in retail
Analysts expected Apple to fail when it announced plans to begin opening stores back in 2001 .
Consultant David Goldstein of Channel Marketing Corp said at the time , " It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for them to open retail stores . "
Goldstein claimed Apple 's retail strategy was n't going to work because consumers " have n't indicated that they 're having trouble finding outlets that sell Macs , " adding , " It 's another case of Apple being Jobs driven and not consumer driven . "
Apple had earlier floated conceptual plans with Landmark Entertainment to open a series of posh cybercafes back in 1997 , an idea which went nowhere .
But in 1999 , realizing Apple needed outside expertise to enter the retailing business , Steve Jobs recruited Millard ' Mickey ' Drexler ( who had served as CEO for the Gap and later J. Crew ) to assemble a retail team .
Apple then hired Ron Johnson , a vice president of merchandising at Target , as its senior vice president of retail operations ; George Blankenship from the Gap as its vice president of real estate ; Kathie Calcidise as its vice president of retail operations ; and Sonyâs Allen Moyer as its vice president of development .
Ten years later , Apple 's 251 retail stores , 41 of which are outside the US , employ nearly 16,000 employees and contribute more than a quarter of the company 's profits .
The iconic stores give Apple a public face and serve as training centers as well as sales outlets .
At the release of the iPhone , Apple 's retail store locations helped to whip up a media frenzy with enthusiastic buyers camping out in long lines .
Microsoft 's desire for retail stores
In contrast , Microsoft was at the mercy of independent retailers when it tried to release the Zune in competition with the iPod .
It ended up embarrassed when retailers failed to promote it over the faster selling iPod , in some cases selling the iPod on top of unsold boxes of Zunes .
Microsoft similarly spent millions to get retailers to promote Windows Vista , without much success .
With its own stores like Apple's , Microsoft would have greater ability to push its products exclusively , rather than seeing its Xbox 360 sit next to the newer Sony PlayStation 3 or the cheaper Nintendo Wii , for example .
At the same time , if Microsoft plans to sell Windows PCs or Windows Mobile Phones , it might run into problems balancing the attentions of its hardware partners .
The Retail Experience Center is a private , 20,000 - square - foot mock retail store environment located at Microsoft Corp.âs headquarters .
Redmond , Wash .
Dell has attempted to open its own retail stores selling Windows PCs , and along with other PC retailers , might take offense at Microsoft muscling into its turf , just as Apple 's retail partners initially expressed concern when the Mac maker first announced plans to sell its own hardware itself .
Technologies will deliver targeted , real - time information to a shopping cart or a consumerâs mobile phone to help impact buying decisions , according to Microsoft .
Microsoft's Metreon retail experiment
Microsoft has operated at least one retail store in the past , an 8,500 square foot development at the Metreon in San Francisco called " microsoftSF , " launched during the dot com boom in 1999 .
In addition to rows of software boxes and demonstrations of Microsoft 's ill fated WebTV Network , the store also displayed art installations , such as one involving Microsoft Mice decorated by various people , and sold microsoftSF merchandise .
In a press release introducing the store , CEO Steve Baller said , " San Francisco and the Silicon Valley are home to the world 's largest and one of the most sophisticated high - tech audiences , so this was the natural place to create this site - dedicated to showing , in an interactive environment , the way technology can enhance our working , learning , living and playing . "
The location closed two and half years later and is now a Sony Playstation store .
The one time president of the Manitoba Hells Angels has been sentenced to eight - and - a - half years in prison .
Dale Donovan was convicted Wednesday morning for his role in a drug trafficking operation that was shut down by police in December 2007 .
The operation was called Project Drill .
Police paid an agent approximately $ 500,000 to make drug purchases on their behalf .
Donovan pleaded no contest in a Manitoba courtroom Wednesday morning , but once an agreed statement of facts was read before the judge , Justice Perry Schulman convicted the biker .
Donovan was charged with conspiracy to traffic marijuana , as well as other drug and property offences .
He was also convicted of trying to recruit gang members into a criminal organization .
In 2003 and 2004 , President George W. Bush announced his intention to initiate a major realignment and shrinkage of what his administration described as an economically wasteful and outdated U.S. overseas basing structure .
The plan was to close more than a third of the nation ’s Cold War-era bases in Europe , South Korea , and Japan .
Troops were to be shifted east and south , to be closer to current and predicted conflict zones from the Andes to North Africa , the Middle East , and Southeast Asia .
Over a planned six to eight years , as many as 70,000 U.S. troops and 100,000 family members and civilians would return to bases in the United States .
In place of big Cold War bases , the Pentagon would focus on creating smaller and more flexible " forward operating bases " and even more austere " lily pad " bases across the so - called " arc of instability . "
Guam and Diego Garcia were readied for major expansions , building on pre-9/11 plans .
The plan quickly faced resistance and criticism , most prominently from the Congressional Budget Office and a congressional commission on overseas bases , both of which questioned the costs associated with closing bases and moving troops .
Since that time little of the original plan has been implemented .
In Germany , the military still maintains 268 installations , including massive bases at Ramstein and Spangdahlem ; the planned removal of two army brigades is now in doubt after the commander of the army ’s forces in Europe recently called for them to stay in Germany .
In Japan , the planned move of 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam may be delayed beyond a 2014 target date .
The only notable shift has been in South Korea , where U.S. troops left the demilitarized zone and moved from Seoul to expanded bases south of the capital , aided by the South Korean government ’s violent seizure of land from villagers in Daechuri .
Rather than shrinking since the announced reorganization , the overseas base network has for the most part expanded in scope and size , as a result of the Bush administration ’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and its broader efforts to assert U.S. geopolitical dominance in the Middle East , Central Asia , and globally .
Since the invasions of 2001 and 2003 , the United States has created or expanded bases in Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Georgia , Qatar , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates , Oman , and Kuwait .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , there may be upward of 100 and 80 installations , respectively , with plans to expand the basing infrastructure in Afghanistan as part of a troop surge .
In Eastern and Central Europe , installations have been created or are in development in Bulgaria , Poland , Romania , and the Czech Republic , and are contributing to rising tensions with Russia .
In Africa , as part of the development of the new African Command , the Pentagon has created or investigated the creation of installations in Algeria , Djibouti , Gabon , Ghana , Kenya , Mali , Nigeria , São Tomé and Príncipe , Senegal , and Uganda .
In the Western Hemisphere , the United States maintains a sizable collection of bases throughout South America and the Caribbean , with the Pentagon exploring the creation of new bases in Colombia and Peru in response to its pending eviction from Manta , Ecuador .
In total , the Pentagon claims it has 865 base sites outside the 50 states and Washington , D.C. Notoriously unreliable , this tally omits bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , among other well - known and secret bases .
A better estimate is 1,000 .
While ultimately the motivation behind the Bush reorganization plan was the neoconservative dream of endless U.S. global domination , the previous administration was right to criticize the basing network as outdated , bloated , and profligate .
In the midst of an economic crisis , there has never been a more critical time to dramatically shrink the U.S. web of overseas bases .

Few phrases in science are as powerful or as widely misunderstood as " survival of the fittest . "
Virtually everyone associates it with Charles Darwin , who was born 200 years ago this week .
The phrase was actually coined by Darwin 's 19th century contemporary Herbert Spencer , and it is perfectly ambiguous .
The phrase could mean that " of all the possible creatures that one might imagine , only the fittest possible survive . "

You may recall that Psion is waging an uphill battle to try to reclaim the term " Netbook . "
It is true that Psion had a product called a " netBook " ( note the capitalization ) which was marginally popular in Europe nearly a decade ago .
But , it went away .
It 's also true that Psion still holds a trademark on the term -- though , you'd be hard pressed to show how they 're using it in commerce , considering they stopped selling netBooks years ago .
The current popularity of the term has to do with a new category of devices , and has absolutely nothing to do with building on the work of Psion .
But that has n't stopped the company from aggressively asserting its right to the name , demanding manufacturers and others stop referring to what is commonly known as netbooks as netbooks , and even getting Google to ban the use of the word " netbook " in ads .
It looks like some are fed up with this , and have begun a campaign to Save the Netbooks , noting that the name has reached a point that it 's generic , and that the success of the term has nothing to do with Psion , but is entirely separate from Psion .
The group points to a legal analysis of why Psion probably has no right to the term , and wants to drum up more support to get Psion to stop its misuse of trademark law .
No one buying a " netbook " today is confused and thinking they 're buying an old Psion product .
It 's about time that Psion back down and give up the term .
After all ... they already gave up the term a while ago .
Trying to reclaim it now is simply trying to grab the value that was built by

Twenty cleaning products made by San Francisco - based Method have earned Cradle to Cradle ( C2C ) certification , a big step towards increasing the amount of C2C products in the consumer marketplace .
Method 's achievement of C2C Silver certification for various varieties of liquid dish soap , hand wash , and foaming hand wash will put C2C products in many stores nationwide for the first time .
And Method is in the process of certifying an additional 20 products .
While there are now 200 products that carry various levels of C2C certification , ranging from insulation and carpeting to chairs and whiteboards , the vast majority of them are not aimed at consumers , and the consumer product companies that have C2C certification only have it for a few items .
The C2C certification process , administered by McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry ( MBDC ) , looks for environmentally safe materials , design for material reutilization ( recycling , composting , etc. ) , use of renewable energy , water and energy efficiency , and company social responsibility practices .
Method has been working with MBDC since 2006 , said Drummond Lawson , Method 's Green Giant ( a.k.a. environmental strategist ) , but has worked on certification for only the last year .
Previously Method was using MBDC 's services for product development , assessing materials and looking into manufacturing innovations .
Much of that research , such as finding out the best adhesives to use on packaging labels so that they do n't muck up recycling systems , helped Method 's products meet C2C standards , and the certification just confirms their status .
Since Method was founded in 2000 , they 've been selling home and personal cleaning products with a focus on non-toxic and biodegradable ingredients .
All the materials inside of their products are listed on their website , and in some cases they go beyond just listing ingredients names and explain what the ingredients do .
All the certified products are packaged in bottles made of 100 percent recycled PET .
Last year , Method switched the packaging for its surface cleaners , floor cleaners and specialty sprays to 100 percent recycled plastic , which it then rolled out to other products .
" That was one of the Cradle to Cradle - inspired ideas we were chasing for a while , " Lawson said .
The company also changed up its carbon offset program last year , taking money it typically spends on carbon offsets and instead using that money to help suppliers invest in energy efficient equipment and on - site renewable energy systems .
Method continues to purchase carbon offsets to make up for emissions from manufacturing , employee commuting and corporate travel .
Method 's own lack of on - site renewable energy is something that kept the products from receiving higher than Silver certification , but the company has a couple renewable pilot projects in the works , and is aiming to get its products to Gold or Platinum certification .

Tens of thousands of people have marched through London demanding action on poverty , climate change and jobs , ahead of next week 's G20 summit .
The Put People First alliance of 150 charities and unions walked from Embankment to Hyde Park for a rally .
Speakers called on G20 leaders to pursue a new kind of global justice .
Police estimate 35,000 marchers took part in the event .
Its organisers say people wanted the chance to air their views peacefully .
Protesters described a " carnival - like atmosphere " with brass bands , piercing whistles and stereos blasting music as the slow - paced procession weaved through the streets .
Police said one man was arrested during the march for being drunk and disorderly .
Map of the march route Unite union , general secretary Derek Simpson said : " I think it 's an important message but whether it will get through to the people meeting in London I do n't know .
Anyone who sees the numbers on this march should realise how important it is . "
Protesters came from across the UK and around the world Families with children in pushchairs were among those marching along the 4.2 - mile route under banners with slogans including ' capitalists - you are the crisis ' and ' justice for the world 's poor ' .
As protesters passed the heavily - policed gates of Downing Street , there were chants and jeers with one person shouting " enjoy the overtime " .
BBC
News reporter Mario Cacciottolo said people were clearly angry , but the atmosphere was not tense .
Milton McKenzie , 73 , from Essex , told him : " How the hell can we have a situation here in Britain where we have people out of work and the bankers just cream it off and are helped by the government . "
G20 LONDON SUMMIT
World leaders will meet next week in London to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
See our in - depth guide to the G20 summit .
The G20 countries are Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the United Kingdom , the US and the EU .
Q&A : G20 Summit Recession rallies G20 protesters G20 protesters :
What they want G20 protesters go on the march Biden appeals to protesters Soros says G20 critical Italian trade unionist Nicoli Nicolosi , who had travelled from Rome , said : " We are here to try and make a better world and protest against the G20 . "
Glen Tarman , chairman of the Put People First co-ordination team , said : " An exciting alliance has been born today .
We will keep up the pressure on world leaders and the UK government to address our demands and put people first . "
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said he wanted to see G20 leaders agree a plan of action to deal with the financial downturn .
" Where I hope we will see a consensus emerge is in the recognition that unless they act together , then the problems are only going to get worse .
" This , unlike any other recession , is a recession right across the world . "
The Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband said it was important for the G20 to make commitments on helping the environment as well as the economy .
" There are some people who will say you can either tackle the economic crisis or the climate crisis .
" But the truth is that both come together with this idea of a Green New Deal , of investing in the jobs of the future , which are going to be in the green industries of the future . "
The director of the the Adam Smith Institute , Dr Eamonn Butler , said governments have caused the economic crisis .
Many protesters were calling for social justice " The world market economy is actually a very moral system that raised a billion people out of poverty in the last 10 years , " he said .
A huge security operation is under way in the run-up to the G20 summit , at which world leaders will discuss the global financial crisis and other issues .
There have been fears that banks and other financial institutions could be the focus for violent protests .
Commander Simon O'Brien , one of the senior command team in charge of policing security , said : " It 's fair to say that this [ the march ] is one of the largest , one of the most challenging and one of the most complicated operations we have delivered .
" G20 is attracting a significant amount of interest from protest groups .
There is an almost unprecedented level of activity going on . "
Saturday 's march will be followed by a series of protests on Wednesday and Thursday by a variety of coalitions and groups campaigning on a range of subjects , from poverty , inequality and jobs to war , climate change and capitalism .
Berlin march Ahead of the summit , Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been visiting a number of countries seeking support .
On Friday , during a visit to Chile , he said people should not be " cynical " about what could be achieved at next week 's summit , saying he was optimistic about the likely outcome .
However , in an interview with Saturday 's Financial Times , German Chancellor Angela Merkel dampened expectations of a significant breakthrough .
She said one meeting would not be enough to solve the economic crisis and finish building a new structure for global markets .
In Berlin , thousands of protesters have also taken to the streets with a message to the G20 leaders : " We wo n't pay for your crisis " .
Another march took place in the city of Frankfurt .
The demonstrations attracted as many as 20,000 people .
Banners accused the Germany government of being too willing to spend billions bailing out financial institutions and too slow to protect ordinary workers , the BBC's Steve Rosenberg said from Berlin .

Whether for your new 5.1 surround sound system , your cramped media room , or when just wiring your home to fill it with music , it 's best to get speakers off the ground , furniture , and other resonant surfaces , and up to ear level .
And since non-powered speakers are actually not heavy at all , with less than $ 2.00 in materials and an hour of work , it 's surprisingly simple to create custom brackets for mounting them on walls and ceilings .
Materials ( for two speaker mounts )
Two " mountable " music speakers , such as those sold for use in ' surround sound ' packages ( they 'll have a threaded insert in the back )
A 1 1/2 " dowel rod
2x pieces of MDF or plywood , cut to about the size of your speakers
Wood glue and clamps or heavy objects
2 x 10 - 32 bolts , 2 " in length
Electric drill and assorted bits
Countersink bits ( optional )
8x # 2 drywall screws
1. Begin by cutting your MDF to the same size as the back panel of your speakers .
2. Cut , or have cut ( ask at the hardware store ) , the dowel rod about 2/5s deep along it 's length .
3 . Cut the sliced dowel to the same size as your MDF .
4 . Glue the cut dowels to your MDF rectangles , let dry , and then paint black to match your speakers , or whatever color matches your walls .
5 . After the paint dries , use a 5/32 drill bit ( or 3/16 ) to drill a hole through the dowel and the MDF at the same height as the threaded insert on your speaker .
Pick the angle at which you drill based on what angle you want to mount the speaker .
insert the bolts through this hole .
6. Drill a 1/4 " hole through the entire apparatus to accomodate your speaker wire , near wherever your input jacks are situated .
Then , drill , and countersink , if desired , pilot holes into each corner of the MDF .
7 . Finally , using drywall anchors or mollys or whatever suits your walls , mount the speaker brackets onto the wall , drawing your speaker wire through before tightening the screws entirely .
Spin on your speakers most of the way , then plug in the wire , the spin the speakers until secure .
8. Rock out !

SITTING in the back seat of his mother ’s van as she drives through Atlanta suburbs , Jonathan Krohn is about to sign off with a conservative radio talk show host in Florida .
In the 40 minutes he ’s been on the air , with the help of his mother ’s cellphone , this hyper - articulate Georgia eighth grader has attacked the stimulus bill , identified leaders he thinks will salvage the Republican Party ’s image , and assessed the legitimacy of Barack Obama ’s birth certificate .
The show ’s host chuckles and asks whether President Obama has called Jonathan “ a little fascist . ”
“ The president has n’t come after me yet , ” Jonathan says chummily , “ but we ’ve had other people come after me ! ”
“ Jonathan ! ” his mother hisses from the driver ’s seat .
The interview concluded , Jonathan wistfully handed his mother her cellphone .
His parents still wo n’t let him have one , even though he turned 14 last Sunday , right after he became an instant news media darling and the conservative movement ’s underage graybeard at last weekend ’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington .
The annual convention brings in the movement ’s grand old lions , like Rush Limbaugh , as well as cubs to rally 8,500 of the faithful , who were shaken by the election of Barack Obama .
Jonathan , a slight , home - schooled only child whose teeth are in braces , is so passionate about his beliefs that he spent his summer writing “ Define Conservatism , ” an 86 - page book outlining what he says are its core values .
In January , he contacted CPAC organizers , asking to speak there .
RAMALLAH – The critical wounding of a U.S. activist has highlighted the excessive use of force by Israeli forces .
The activist , Tristan Anderson , 38 , was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers during a protest against Israel ’s separation barrier in the Palestinian West Bank last week .
He remains in intensive care in Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv .
Anderson was one of approximately 400 international , Palestinian and Israeli protestors taking part in a demonstration in the village of Ni’ilin , near the central West Bank city Ramallah , when he was hit by a teargas canister .
Since Israel ’s devastating three - week war on Gaza , human rights organizations and activists have accused the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) of using indiscriminate violence and testing new weapons on unarmed protestors .
The teargas canister which hit Anderson is a new variety being used by the IDF , and is particularly lethal if fired directly at protestors .
The gas canister can travel over 400 meters .
It does not make a noise when fired , or emit a smoke tail , and has a propeller for mid-air acceleration .
A combination of velocity and silence increases the danger it poses .
Witnesses gave testimonies to the media and to human rights organizations that they saw Israeli soldiers aiming at Anderson before they shot the canister from a distance of about 60 meters .
It hit him directly on the forehead .
The impact of the canister caused severe damage to the right eye , and Anderson has had to undergo critical brain surgery .
Israeli soldiers continued to fire teargas canisters towards the wounded man and the people surrounding him as he lay critically injured on the ground and Palestinian medics tried to give him first aid .
Later , a Palestinian ambulance trying to rush Anderson to hospital was blocked at least five minutes by Israeli soldiers .
Only after other foreigners engaged the soldiers in heated debate did they allow the ambulance to pass .
Anderson was then delayed another 15 minutes while an Israel ambulance was called , because Palestinian ambulances are not allowed to cross into Israeli territory without special permit .
Jonathan Pollack , an Israeli activist who witnessed the event said that the soldiers had fired unnecessarily .
" There was no way that their lives were even remotely in danger or that they might have been injured , " Pollack told IPS .
" Even if the IDF ( Israeli defense forces ) argument was true that they had been the targets of stones before they shot him , no stone could travel uphill for 60 meters and threaten them , and Anderson had definitely not been involved in any violent activity . "
Pollack said the demonstration had finished and most of the demonstrators had left when the teargas was fired .
" At the time of the shooting there were no confrontations , and Anderson was standing amongst about 10 remaining protestors just milling about . "
Sarit Michaeli , spokeswoman for the Israeli rights group B’Tselem says that the IDF has at times used crowd control measures indiscriminately .
" The teargas canister is not meant to be used as a weapon or fired directly at protestors but in an arc or at an angle , " she told IPS .
" We have many credible witnesses , and I myself have seen soldiers fire at people who are nowhere near and have nothing to do with any stone - throwing .
And even when the soldiers have the right to shoot on grounds of defense , they are obliged to use the minimum of force and in a strictly proportionate way . "
B’Tselem is concerned about the even more severe crowd control methods being employed by the IDF .
An Israeli journalist was recently shot in the chest with a rubber - coated steel bullet ( marble - sized metal ball covered in 0.5 mm of rubber ) when the soldiers knew full well the target was a journalist .
Towards the end of last year the IDF began once again to use Ruger rifles , which use .22 caliber ammunition , against unarmed protestors .
" We have written a letter to the judge advocate general ( JAG ) protesting and questioning the use of Ruger rifles , " said Michaeli .
According to B’Tselem , back in 2001 then JAG Major - General Menachem Finkelstein had ordered that use of the Ruger rifle be stopped .
The decision followed the killing of several children in the Gaza Strip by Ruger rifle fire , and an order by the Central Command to cease using the rifle .
The order came after it was found that soldiers often used the rifle against demonstrators without justification .
Furthermore , Israeli soldiers are using live ammunition against protestors , contrary to IDF laws of engagement .
Although Anderson ’s case made international headlines because of his status as a foreigner , four Palestinians were killed by the IDF in the village of Ni’ilin last year .
Ahmed Mousa , 10 , was shot dead with live ammunition in July last year .
The following day Yousef Amira , 17 , was left brain - dead , and died a week later after he too had been shot in the head with rubber - coated steel bullets .
Arafat Rateb Khawaje , 22 , was shot in the back with live ammunition in December .
The same day Mohammed Khawaje , 20 , was also shot in the head with live ammunition .
He died three days later .
The villagers of Ni’ilin and their supporters have been protesting weekly against the confiscation of their land by Israeli authorities for expansion of nearby Israeli settlements , and against the separation barrier .
The separation barrier , which slices through the village , divides Palestinian farmers from their land .
It was deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice in 2004 .
California 's unemployment rate jumped to 10.1 % in January , the highest since 1983 , as employers in the nation 's most - populous state cut 79,000 jobs in the month .
Meanwhile , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday declared a state of emergency to address California 's third - straight year of drought , ordering officials to take steps to reduce urban water consumption and to expedite water transfers throughout the state .

Lizzy turned 10 yesterday !
I know it ’s cliche , but time flies .
Where is my baby ?
Who is this BIG girl who longs for skinny jeans and earrings ?
We had a home party on Friday with some Rockband , hot dogs , cake pops and candy sushi .
The candy sushi was the craft and the take home treat .
Yes , I am a cheapskate .
The sushi was inexpensive and easy , more importantly the kids had fun .
One child told me it was the best party she ’d ever been to .
I ’m not quite sure if she ’s been party deprived or an ass - kisser , but she certainly scored points with this mommy .
Here ’s how it ’s done :
I used this recipe to make up a batch of Rice Krispie squares .
I added 8 extra marshmallows to the recipe to make sure they would n’t be too crispy .
I used the microwave instructions , they worked perfectly .
Once they had cooled , I trimmed up the slabs of Rice Krispie treats into nice neat rectangles and stacked them on wax paper for the party .
I wanted to make it as easy as possible for the kids .
Georgia and I enjoyed eating all the trimmings .
In the end , I made 3 full batches of Rice Krispie Squares one after the other , to get 8 thin slabs for the party and a couple of practice slabs for Georgia and I .
It took about 20 minutes total .
I ’ve never made candy sushi before , so I thought I ’d better practice before I tried it out on the kids .
As you can imagine Georgia was extra excited .
I sat her across from me at the kitchen table and pretended she was the birthday party .
I figured if I could get a three year old on a sugar high to make candy sushi , then I could handle a gang of 10 year olds .
Add candy .
I bought colored twizzlers , gummi worms , jujube fish and fruit roll - ups .
Roll the Rice Krispie treats around the candy .
Do n’t roll it more than one full roll .
You do n’t want it to be too thick .
Trim the excess with a sharp knife .
Georgia was having a good time .
Make sure you allow snacking !
Once you ’ve trimmed the roll , wrap the fruit roll up around it ( squeeze ) .
Green fruit roll - ups would be best , but I could n’t find them .
I left the plastic wrap on my roll - up while I applied it to the candy , none of the kids bothered to do this .
It works well both ways , just make sure to remove it before cutting .
Now it ’s time to cut your candy roll into to cute California roll style sushi .
You ’ll need a sharp knife to get through the gummy worms and twizzlers in the center .
Georgia wanted to do it herself .
I let her … practice makes perfect .
For all the worry - warts out there , the cutting was accompanied by repeated safety warnings .
She survived the cutting with all of her fingers in tact .
The nice thing about not finding green fruit roll - ups is the pretty product .
I ’m loving the colors .
I made the slabs long enough for each child to make two rolls of candy sushi .
They then used any leftovers to make a Nigiri style sushi .
I also gave each of them a ‘ bento box ’ to take home their creations .
It curbed the urge to eat it all .
Georgia managed to make these with no help at all .
Here it is … candy sushi by Mommyknows and Georgia .

DVCS and Bug Tracking
In last week 's entry , I mentioned my interest in Fossil , a relatively new DVCS written by the author of SQLite .
In the comments on that entry , a guy named Benjamin Pollack picked a fight with me about why I think Fossil is interesting .
It turns out that this guy is actually one of Joel 's minions over at Fog Creek .
In fact , he joined the company as one of the interns on Project Aardvark back in 2005 .
To Benjamin , I would like to say that " interesting != good " .
Some things are interesting in spite of the fact that they are crap .
And some things are interesting BECAUSE of the fact that they 're crap .
And to D. Richard Hipp , the author of Fossil , I would like to say that I am not saying Fossil is crap .
In fact , I am currently taking no position on whether Fossil is good or bad .
For now , I just think it 's interesting , mostly because I think the issues of DVCS integration with the rest of the ALM tool suite are important .
But before I talk more about that , I can't resist offering a few remarks about Fossil itself .
Comments about Fossil
Benjamin Pollack complained that Fossil handles merge conflicts poorly .
And he 's right .
When it inserts markers around the conflicting text , it should clearly indicate what came from which file .
Why does each instance of the repo have its own list of users ?
I would have expected that this information would sync during a push / pull operation .
The ' fossil ui ' command is conceptually cool .
It runs a built - in web server and launches a browser pointing at it , providing a web - based way to interact with all the features of Fossil .
But Fossil 's web UI is n't going to win any awards for aesthetics .
It 's 2009 , and the world is getting less tolerant of ugly things in web browsers every year .
At some point , making Fossil pretty would probably be worthwhile .
Fossil is really easy to configure .
It 's just one executable file .
And setting it up as a server is simple , either using its built - in server , or running as a CGI , or running through inetd .
Very nice .
Distributed Bug - Tracking
Industry - wide , there is a trend toward more integration between version control and other stuff like project tracking , wikis , discussion forums , build tracking , etc .
Developers do n't just checkin code .
They use a whole bunch of other tools which help them collaborate with each other and with people in other functional areas .
While DVCS is one of the more interesting things happening right now , it does represent a setback in this particular area .
The benefits of a DVCS are somewhat diminished if all of the other tools a developer needs are still " centralized " .
Yes , it 's cool that I can commit my code while I 'm on a plane , but how do I update the FogBugz case to mark it fixed ?
So far , the answer is that I have to wait until the plane lands , hope the airport has Wi -Fi , login to my corporate VPN , bring up a web browser , remember the case ID , find the case , change its status , and try to remember my code changes so I can write something relevant in the comments .
As long as this is the answer , then I assert that the story for DVCS is , well , incomplete .
Other relevant projects
As far as I know , Fossil is the only tool which is a DVCS with bug tracking built - in .
But it is not the only project exploring this area of need .
Others include :
I have spent some time looking at each of these , but not enough to make detailed comments .
Let 's just say that I consider all of them interesting in the same way that I think Fossil is interesting .
Things I think I think
After looking at everything I can find in the area of distributed bug - tracking , I found myself with more questions than answers .
But I am starting to collect some things that I think are correct .
I think .
I think bugs deserve their own DAG .
I think everybody 's first thought about bug - tracking with DVCS is that the bugs should be stored in the version control tree as text files that can be merged .
Whenever the tree branches , the bugs will automatically branch as well .
A bug can be marked as fixed in the branch where it is fixed .
But the more I think about this design , the more I think it would cause a lot of regrets later .
I think bug tracking records probably need their own place , living in their own DAG .
There are just too many scenarios where the bug - tracking info is being updated without changing anything in the tree .
For example , consider the QA team .
When they update a bug to mark it as " fix verified " , you do n't really want them doing this operation as a commit to the version control tree , do you ?
In fact , you probably want the bug - tracking and version control areas to be controlled by a completely different set of access permissions .
Fossil got this right , sort of .
Tickets are separate from the tree .
But Fossil 's design is n't perfect .
Tickets are actually not managed with a DAG at all .
Rather , the algorithm for resolving conflicting changes is something like " the version with the latest timestamp wins " .
Do we credit the author for not over - designing ?
After all , this guy did SQLite , so he knows a thing or two about how to implement " just enough to be incredibly useful " .
Or is this design likely to make users really angry when it causes an unpleasant surprise ?
I think bugs deserve their own merge algorithm
Once again , the first thought here is probably not the right one .
A DVCS knows how to deal with merging changes to text files .
So if we want to store bugs , then obviously we should keep them in text files so we can re-use all that merge code , right ?
I do n't think so .
Stuff in a database is very highly structured .
We have lots of information which can be used to implement really good merging .
In theory , merging changes to a bug - tracking database should work much better than merging changes to code .
( Yes , code is very highly structured as well , but the only way to get that information is to parse the code .
I 've seen some interesting research in the area of language - specific version control tools that manage code changes with a parse tree representation , but I do n't think those things will be practical mainstream solutions anytime soon . )
Anyway , if you take a bug record and throw it in a text file and then use regular old file merge to resolve changes , it seems like you 're throwing away a lot of the information you could be using .
Admittedly , writing a special merge algorithm for this case would be a TON of work .
But the results might be worth it .
It might be the difference between a distributed bug - tracking system that constantly annoys its users and one that Just Works .
I think bugs deserve their own sync patterns .
The use cases for distributed bug tracking are different than distributed version control .
For example , it seems very likely that we want to sync our local instance of the bug - tracking database a lot more frequently than we want to sync our local instance of the version control tree .
If I 've got a live connection to the central server , then I want to be pulling down updates to the bug db all the time .
If I add a comment to a bug , I probably want that comment pushed up to the central server as soon as my network connectivity allows .
With version control , I want a private sandbox so I can work on a bunch of code changes and only push them up to the central server when I 'm done fiddling with them .
That kind of workflow strikes me as far less important for a bug - tracking application .
I think distributed version control needs distributed bug - tracking
I 've just explained several ways that distributed bug tracking needs to be different from the way a DVCS works .
But I still think that pairing a DVCS with a centralized bug - tracking solution makes very little sense .
Consider the scenario where a company is doing development in two cities and wants each of them to have their own server .
We actually get this request quite a bit from Vault customers .
Somebody calls and says they have a team in New York City and another team in Strawn .
They want each team to be doing work on their own central server .
And they want the two central servers to synchronize with each other at some regular interval .
These people are asking for a DVCS .
They do n't care about the " coding on a plane scenario " .
They do n't really care so much about private workspaces or the performance benefits of having the entire repository on every developer 's machine .
They still want a central server .
The only difference is that they want TWO central servers .
And a DVCS can do that .
And if they are using more than just version control , then what they really want is for ALL developer - related stuff to follow that same workflow .
Every four hours when the two central servers do their sync - up , a bunch of changesets get pushed in each direction .
Some of those changes are modifications to the version control tree .
Others contain changes to the work items or the wiki pages or whatever .
I think DVCS will stay small until it becomes a " whole product " .
My regular readers know that I am a fan of Geoffrey Moore 's classic book , Crossing the Chasm .
One of the ideas in that book is that new innovations do n't go mainstream until they become a " whole product " .
Right now , most of the comments about DVCS that I am hearing out in the industry are negative .
Some of them are saying that " DVCS will never be mainstream " .
More and more , I think those people are wrong .
Others are saying that " this DVCS stuff just is n't ready yet " .
Right now , those people are right .
For a large portion of the market , version control alone is not a complete solution .
They want the whole product , and they want it to work together seamlessly .
If DVCS wants to reach that part of the market , it needs to figure out what " distributed " means for bug - tracking and wiki and forums and change management and build tracking and test management and requirements .
I think Benjamin Pollack is an irritating kid who quibbles too much .
Or rather , I did until I saw his bitbucket page .
Anybody who writes a C implementation of an AVL tree FOR FUN has my complete respect . :-)
The Financial Times is reporting Alan Greenspan Hops On Board The Nationalization Express and is sitting in the bar car next to Nouriel Roubini .
The next stop is D.C .
The US government may have to nationalise some banks on a temporary basis to fix the financial system and restore the flow of credit , Alan Greenspan , the former Federal Reserve chairman has told the Financial Times .
In an interview with the FT Mr Greenspan , who for decades was regarded as the high priest of laissez - faire capitalism , said nationalisation could be the least bad option left for policymakers .
” It may be necessary to temporarily nationalise some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring , ” he said .
“ I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do . ”
Nationalize the Banks !
We 're all Swedes Now
The U.S. banking system is close to being insolvent , and unless we want to become like Japan in the 1990s -- or the United States in the 1930s -- the only way to save it is to nationalize it .
As free - market economists teaching at a business school in the heart of the world 's financial capital , we feel downright blasphemous proposing an all - out government takeover of the banking system .
But the U.S. financial system has reached such a dangerous tipping point that little choice remains .
And while Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 's recent plan to save it has many of the right elements , it 's basically too late .
Nationalization is the only option that would permit us to solve the problem of toxic assets in an orderly fashion and finally allow lending to resume .
Of course , the economy would still stink , but the death spiral we are in would end .
Nationalization -- call it " receivership " if that sounds more palatable -- wo n't be easy , but here is a set of principles for the government to go by ....
Nationalizing banks is not without precedent .
In 1992 , the Swedish government took over its insolvent banks , cleaned them up and reprivatized them .
Obviously , the Swedish system was much smaller than the U.S. system .
Moreover , some of the current U.S. financial institutions are significantly larger and more complex , making analysis difficult .
And today 's global capital markets make gaming the system easier than in 1992 .
But we believe that , if applied correctly , the Swedish solution will work here .
Sweden 's restructuring agency was not an out - of - control bureaucracy ; it delegated all the details of the cleanup to private bankers and managers hired by the government .
The process was remarkably smooth .
Basically , we 're all Swedes now .
We have used all our bullets , and the boogeyman is still coming .
Let 's pull out the bazooka and be done with it .
Bến Tre Logic
As free - market economists teaching at a business school in the heart of the world 's financial capital , we feel downright blasphemous proposing an all - out government takeover of the banking system .
One of the most famous quotes of the Vietnam War was a statement attributed to an unnamed U.S. Air Force Major by AP correspondent Peter Arnett .
Writing about the provincial capital , Ben Tre , on February 7 , 1968 , Arnett said : " ' it became necessary to destroy the town to save it , ' a U.S. major says . "
To this day , " Ben Tre logic " is a common saying for whenever a " logical " conclusion is to destroy something out of the perceived best interests of everyone involved .
Bush Abandons Free Market Principles To Save Free Market
George W. Bush ’s political epitaph
Fox 's Greta Van Susteren has been on the receiving end several exclusive Palin family interviews this past year .
Indeed , there was Sarah Palin 's first post-election sit-down , Todd Palin 's first interview during the campaign and Bristol Palin 's first interview since giving birth .
Earlier this week , the Washington Post reported that Van Susteren 's husband , Washington lawyer John Coale , is a friend of Palin's and " acknowledged that he suggested she start a leadership PAC and helped her navigate through some of the questions surrounding her family that lingered after the campaign . "
So is that how Van Susteren 's received better access from the Palins than any other television host ?
On her blog , Van Susteren responded to that suggestion , noting that her husband is not a paid adviser to Palin .
Yes , he has given Governor Palin advice and helped her .
He met her through me when I interviewed her … .
I did not meet her through him .
I have gotten interviews with her not through him but through our staff on OTR .
It is that simple .

Security expert Ben Laurie has a scorching indictment of the " Verified by Visa " program used by British banks .
This system is basically the perfect system for phishers and identity thieves , and conditions honest people to behave in foolish ways that leave them vulnerable to having their life 's saving taken off of them .
" Frame inline displays the VbV authentication page in
the merchant 's main window with the merchant 's
header .
Therefore , VbV is seen as a natural part of the
purchase process .
It is recommended that the top
frame include the merchant 's standard branding in a
short and concise manner and keep the cardholder
within the same look and feel of the checkout process . "
Or , in other words :
Please ensure that there is absolutely no way for your customer to know whether we are showing the form or you are .
In fact , please train your customer to give their " Verified by Visa " password to anyone who asks for it .
Craziness .
But it gets better – obviously not everyone is pre-enrolled in this stupid scheme , so they also allow for enrolment using the same inline scheme .
Now the phishers have the opportunity to also get information that will allow them to identify themselves to the bank as you .
Yes , Visa have provided a very nicely tailored and packaged identity theft scheme .
But , best of all , rather like Chip and PIN , they push all blame for their failures on to the customer
I occasionally ask the asylum seekers at my constituency surgeries why they made the very long journey to the United Kingdom rather than a much shorter one somewhere else .
The answer is almost always the same : it is better here .
People have more rights and greater protection .
Similarly some of my Muslim constituents will say that whatever criticisms they have of Britain , they cannot think of a better country in Europe , or for that matter the Middle East or South Asia , in which to live freely and to practise their faith in an atmosphere of tolerance and respect .
More generally , despite the claims of a systematic erosion of liberty by those organising this weekend 's Convention on Modern Liberty , my very good constituency office files show no recent correspondence relating to fears about the creation in Britain of a " police state " or a " surveillance society " .
I 'm the first to accept that Labour since 1997 has not achieved a state of grace in terms of the crucial balance between security and liberty .
But on any objective basis , this government has done more to reinforce and strengthen liberty than any since the war .
Part of the problem for those who question this is that their analysis assumes the loss of a golden age of liberty .
No such age existed .
The 60s , 70s and 80s were the decades of the informal " judges ' rules " , the absence of statutory protections for suspects , " fitting up " , egregious abuses of power , miscarriages of justice , arbitrary actions by police , security and intelligence agencies , phone tapping without any basis in statute law or any legal protection for the citizen whatsoever , gaping holes where there should have been parliamentary scrutiny .
As the director of Liberty wrote in 1989 : " The last 10 years of government have had a striking effect upon freedom in the UK .
Civil liberties have not just been eroded , they have been deliberately attacked and undermined . "
Almost 10 years later there was still no overriding and systematic protection for people 's rights and liberties .
Labour has provided that : it 's called the Human Rights Act .
So long as we are in power it wo n't be watered down .
The fundamental universal rights enshrined in the act are not contingent on behaviour , but nor do they come without responsibility .
Implicit in the act is the notion that we all owe one another obligations in the way we exercise our rights .
The forthcoming green paper on a bill of rights and responsibilities is designed to generate public debate about how we can articulate these implicit duties more explicitly .
Even the convention rights enshrined in the HRA are not absolute .
The right to liberty itself can be taken away in a variety of circumstances - not least if you are convicted of a serious crime .
This gets to the heart of the debate about modern liberty .
Can individual rights ever be restricted in the name of the common good ?
I believe there are times when it is necessary to impose restrictions on some aspects of individual liberty in the interests of wider security .
That is one of the central tasks of government .
Indeed , as James Madison said , if people were angels , there would be no need for government .
But sadly people are not all angels .
The climate in a post - 9/11 world is much harder than anyone imagined , even in the immediate aftermath of that outrage .
I do not pretend we 've got everything right .
We have n't .
Take the data - sharing measures proposed in the coroner 's and justice bill .
Their aim is good , but parliamentary scrutiny has thrown up justifiable concerns that the powers provided could be misused .
It 's not our intention but I agree , so we are acting to get a much better balance between data protection and access to services .
And while the ends can never justify the means , our motives for seeking better protection for citizens from terrorism and crime are hardly ignoble .
Those who cast myself and my colleagues as Orwellian drones engaged in some awful conspiracy planned in Whitehall basements not only overlook all this government 's achievements , they cheapen the important debate about getting the balance right so that a very important freedom , that to live without fear in an atmosphere of tolerance and respect , is nurtured and protected .
And there is of course an ultimate check on executive power - democracy .
Talk of Britain sliding into a police state is daft scaremongering , but even were it true there is a mechanism to prevent it - democratic elections .
People have the power to vote out administrations which they believe are heavyhanded .
When people come to assess the choices available at the next election , I will stand proudly on Labour 's record , from the Lawrence inquiry , which reported 10 years ago this week , progressive legislation on race and gender , to devolution , the Human Rights Act , Freedom of Information and much more , and be ready to be judged on it .
I hope that in the final reckoning even some of our harshest critics will concede that this Labour government has done more than any before it to extend liberties and to constrain government .

Federal agents raided a medical marijuana dispensary in San Francisco Wednesday , a week after U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder signaled that the Obama administration would not prosecute distributors of pot used for medicinal purposes that operate under sanction of state law .
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents raided Emmalyn's California Cannabis Clinic at 1597 Howard St. in San Francisco's South of Market district mid-afternoon .
They hauled out large plastic bins overflowing with marijuana plants and loaded several pickup trucks parked out front with grow lights and related equipment used to farm the plants indoors .
The dispensary had been operating with a temporary permit issued by the Department of Public Health .
" Based on our investigation , we believe there are not only violations of federal law , but state law as well , " DEA Special Agent in Charge Anthony Williams said in a prepared statement .
Williams , who runs the San Francisco field office that covers a territory stretching from Bakersfield to Redding , would not specify the alleged violations .
The information was under court seal .
" As of now , we are prohibited from releasing further details of the case .
Items of evidentiary value were seized and no arrests have been made , " Williams said .
A source in San Francisco city government who was informed about the raid said the DEA 's action appeared to be prompted by alleged financial improprieties related to the payment of sales taxes .
DEA Special Agent Casey McEnry , spokeswoman for the local office , would not comment on that information .
Representatives from Emmalyn's could not be reached for comment .
It was not clear whether they were on the premises when authorities arrived .
Word of the raid spread quickly in the medical marijuana advocacy community via text - message .
About a dozen people , many with cameras in hand , gathered in front of Emmalyn's as federal agents guarded the front entrance .
The scent of marijuana wafted through the crowd and several bystanders shouted epithets at the agents as they walked by .
Emmalyn's provides marijuana for free to poor people on Wednesdays .
" It 's awful that raids like this are still happening .
Public opinion favors medicinal marijuana , " said Troy Dayton , senior development officer for the Marijuana Policy Project , a national organization that advocates for the decriminalization of marijuana , particularly for medicinal purposes .
Thirteen years ago , California became the first of more than a dozen states to legalize medical marijuana , although federal law still prohibits its use .
In a marked shift from Bush administration policy , Holder said last month that dispensaries only would be prosecuted if both state and federal drug laws were thought to be violated .
( CNN ) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the country already is " seeing shovels hit the ground " on the first infrastructure repair project funded through the Transportation Department 's share of the $ 787 billion stimulus bill .
Workers mark where repairs are needed on Maryland Route 650 .
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said , " The work begins today in Montgomery County , Maryland , where a work crew is starting on a project to resurface Maryland State Highway 650 -- a very busy road that has not been fully repaired in 17 years . "
The resurfacing contract is going to a Pennsylvania - based family - owned company , American Infrastructure , LaHood said .
He said the project will support 60 jobs .
" And that 's how we 're going to get the country back on its feet , " LaHood added .
Mark Compton , director of government affairs for American Infrastructure , said his company received $ 2.1 million in federal funds , by way of the Maryland State Highway Administration .
The money will be used to repave and add safety features to a stretch of the highway .
Compton said the cash infusion is the " catalyst " to create 60 jobs , including bringing back some laid - off employees .
He said he hopes the workers can be retained beyond this six - month project .
" We 'll continue to bid , so the goal is to get more projects to keep those guys working , so they can roll off that project onto another , " Compton said .
CNNMoney : Stimulus funds hit the street
Obama and LaHood on Tuesday announced the release of $ 27 billion in funds from the stimulus package " to help states create a 21st - century infrastructure . "
The president said it is part of the " largest new investment in America 's infrastructure since President Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System . "
Obama said another 200 construction projects would be launched over the next few weeks , " fueling growth in an industry that 's been hard hit by our economic crisis . "
Two weeks ago , Obama signed into law his stimulus plan , known as the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act .
The president has said the plan will create or save up to 3.5 million jobs over the next two years .
Four - hundred thousand of those will be infrastructure jobs that include rebuilding roads , bridges and schools .
LaHood has asked the nation 's governors to certify projects and provide assurances that funds from the act will be spent for appropriate infrastructure projects .
Obama said transportation projects would be stamped with a special emblem so people can see where their tax dollars are going .
Obama said the investments in highways would create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of 2010 .
The number of jobs being created or saved in one year is more than the number of jobs the Big Three automakers have lost in manufacturing over the past three years , Obama said .
By investing in roads " that should have been rebuilt long ago , " Obama said , " we can save some 14,000 men and women who lose their lives each year due to bad roads and driving conditions . "
" Poor roads are a public hazard , and we have a responsibility to fix them , " he said .
Watch Obama explain how the roads will save lives »
Obama also announced Tuesday that the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve were launching the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative .
When fully implemented , Obama said , the initiative " will generate up to a trillion dollars in new lending for the American people , and this will help unlock our frozen credit markets , which is absolutely essential for economic recovery . "

“ There is a certain amount of comeuppance , of getting what you deserve , when you behave this way toward your own good corporate citizens , ” said Mr. Gudenius , whose home - expansion plan was rejected by the board last year .
The principal planner for the city ’s historic preservation section , Lee Webb , denied that the city was arbitrary but did say it was making more of an effort to explain upfront what kinds of property modifications would be allowed .
The controversy has clearly wearied some in Old Town .
The president of the Historic Alexandria Foundation , Morgan Delaney , said in an e-mail message that commenting “ would serve no useful purpose . ”
Beth Temple , the aide to Mayor William Euille , who has called the shop “ inappropriate ” for Old Town , said he now had nothing more to say about it .
The store ’s arrival was a coda to Mr. Zarlenga ’s failed negotiations over his expansion plans .
He opened the Trophy Room in 2001 , then bought the building in 2006 , planning to expand .
He hired architects and a lawyer who had been chairman of the Board of Architectural Review .
After working with a board staff member on plans to raise the roof of a small building attached to the back of the property , he thought he had the panel ’s support .
But in 2007 , the board denied his permit request , and the City Council rejected his appeal .
From an anonymous TPM Reader …
The real problem behind the AIG public relations mess is not the tin ears of all the President ’s men , or their tone deaf commentary , or their ham - handed approach to decision - making .
The real problem is that the AIG situation implies that they , the President ’s men , do n’t think like shareholders .
They do n’t act as if their fiduciary duty is to the taxpayers whose money they spend .
They do n’t seem to put the interests of the public first and foremost and ahead of all the interests of private fims .
Instead , they seem to think that their job is to have the non-taxpayer , private shareholders and management of various firms return to normalcy — meaning , doing commerce and making money .
This goal is not to be derided , and it is important , but it does not correctly reflect the duties of the government officials who represent the taxpayers in owning or controlling many firms , including AIG .
To see the right mirror of those duties , one needs only look to public company boards .
On public company boards , compensation committees do not include any members of management .
The members of these committees determine , as a matter of law , the compensation of management in all respects .
These committee members , composed exclusively of independent directors , owe their duties exclusively to the shareholders .
Ben Bernanke publicly talked about the duty owed by the Fed to the institutions it is helping ; when it comes to compensation decisions the duty is owed to shareholders , not to the abstract idea of a corporation .
=2 0
And when the taxpayers are the shareholders , the duty is owed to them .
The corporation , its management , its shareholders and the directors who represent them , are , of course , closely interrelated .
Indeed , the goal of compensation decisions in public companies is to align the interests of top management and shareholders .
When the executives do well , the shareholders should do well , and vice - versa .
The pursuit of this alignment involves difficult decisions , including but not limited to balancing the notion of doing well in the short - term with doing well over the long - run .
But this decision - making starts with a clear understanding of roles .
Translating the compensation decisions of public company directors to the decision - making at AIG or any of the many many other companies owned in whole or in large part , directly or indirectly , by the taxpayers , through Treasury or the Fed , at least the following questions arise :
First , who represents the taxpayers in the compensation decisions at government - controlled firms ?
For example , at AIG , how can it be that the CEO , no matter how fine a fellow he may be , operates without a compensation committee of independent directors who decide executive compensation ?
There must be such an organization , although it has been conspicuous by its absence in the recent “ debate . ”
And on it there must be individuals who represent the shareholders exclusively , even when those shareholders are the taxpayers .
There must be a reasoned process and a clear , publi c record of decision - making .
If these processes , which are routine in public companies , do n’t exist it should take less than a few days to put them in place .
This is not rocket science or even toxic asset clean - up ; it is utterly familiar territory for dozens and hundreds of experts ready and able to take the burden of such decision - making off the desk of the Treasury Secretary , the Fed governors , and certainly the folks in the White House .
Second , if the right sort of compensation committees were created , it would follow inevitably that they would decide and announce their philosophy .
For example , are they following the necessary goals of compensation : recruiting , retaining , and motivating ?
How are they putting these tenets into place ?
How do they balance the need to pay for performance with the general lack of income and liquidity in the troubled firms that the taxpayers have such large stakes in ?
These decisions are , again , both difficult and extremely familiar in public companies .
It is easy to go to the right place for expertise ; it is high time for the government ’s officials to get that expertise .
It is past time to assure America that the Treasury Secretary has delegated this sort of responsibility ; compensation needs to be done fairly , but it is not as important as various other crises for Tim Geithner to solve .
On the other hand , it is a big problem if Treasury does n’t have the inclination or capability to delegate and assign accountability for many many issues , of which c ompensation in not just AIG , but many other firms , is one . Â
As another example , it is impossible to believe that the current proposed new bail - out plan for toxic assets does not raise issues of possible wealth allocation as among private parties and taxpayers .
These issues will include compensation decisions .
Treasury cannot be indifferent , secretive , or wholly responsible for such decisions — it needs to delegate and obtain outside counsel in open , reasonable ways .
Public companies invariably use outside advice to make compensation decisions .
Much of that advice draws scepticism .
But no one would suggest that comparables and standards are irrelevant .
What comparables and standards for reward and compensation shall Treasury apply to its present bail - out plans , or indeed to any and all of the firms where it now has major or controlling stakes ?
At public companies , transparency is required ; at Treasury it ought to be part of the prevailing ethic .
At bottom , the AIG flap is about fairness : fairness of result and fairness of process .
As long as Treasury maintains a rule of secrecy , it is certain to generate more AIG flaps , whether or not the flapping is legitimate .
People , whether in the role of voter , taxpayer , citizen , or shareholder , simply want to know what ’s going on .
In its first 50 days , the Obama administration has naturally been consumed by the economic crisis , but it has nevertheless made some striking shifts in foreign policy .
Obama announced the closure of Guantanamo and the end of any official sanction for torture .
He gave his first interview as president to an Arab network and spoke of the importance of respect when dealing with the Muslim world -- a gesture that won him rave reviews from normally hostile Arab journalists and politicians .
As George W. Bush 's term ended , he had few defenders left in the world of foreign policy .
Mainstream commentators almost unanimously agreed the Bush years had been marked by arrogance and incompetence .
" Mr. Bush 's characteristic failing was to apply a black - and - white mind - set to too many gray areas of national security and foreign affairs , " The Post editorialized .
Even Richard Perle , the neoconservative guru , acknowledged recently that " Bush mostly failed to implement an effective foreign and defense policy . "
There was hope that President Obama would abandon some of his predecessor 's rigid ideological stances .
Hillary Clinton has racked up more miles in a few weeks than many of
her predecessors as secretary of state did in months , mixing symbolic
gestures of outreach with substantive talks .
The administration has
signaled a willingness to start engaging with troublesome regimes such as
Syria and Iran .
Clinton publicly affirmed that the United States would work
with China on the economic crisis and energy and environmental issues
despite differences on human rights .
She has also offered the prospect of a
more constructive relationship with Russia .
These initial steps are all explorations in the right direction --
deserving of praise , one might think .
But no , the Washington establishment
is mostly fretting , dismayed in one way or another by these moves .
The
conservative backlash has been almost comical in its fury .
Two weeks into
Obama 's term , Charles Krauthammer lumped together a bunch of Russian
declarations and actions -- many of them long in the making -- and decided
that they were all " brazen ... provocations " that Obama had failed to
counter .
Obama's " supine " diplomacy , Krauthammer thundered , was setting off
a chain of catastrophes across the globe .
The Pakistani government , for
example , had obviously sensed weakness in Washington and " capitulated to
the Taliban " in the Swat Valley .
Somehow Krauthammer missed the many deals
that Pakistan struck with the Taliban over the past three years -- during
Bush 's reign -- deals that were more hastily put together , on worse terms ,
with poorer results .
Even liberal and centrist commentators have joined in the worrying .
Leslie Gelb , the author of a smart and lively new book , " Power Rules , " says
that Clinton 's comments about China 's human rights record were correct but
should n't have been made publicly .
Peter Bergen of CNN says that " doing
deals with the Taliban today could further destabilize Afghanistan . "
Gelb
writes ruefully that it's " change for change 's sake . "
Ah , if we just kept
in place all those Bush - era policies that were working so well .
Consider the gambit with Russia .
The Washington establishment is united
in the view that Iran 's nuclear program poses the greatest challenge for
the new administration .
The only outside power that has any significant
leverage over Tehran is Russia , which is building its nuclear reactor and
supplying it with uranium .
Exploring whether Moscow might press the
Iranians would be useful , right ?
Wrong .
The Post reacted by worrying that Obama might be capitulating to
Russian power .
His sin was to point out in a letter to the Russian
president that if Moscow were to help in blunting the threat of missile
attacks from Tehran , the United States would not feel as pressed to
position missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic -- logical
since those defenses were meant to protect against Iranian missiles .
It's
also a good trade because right now the technology for an effective missile
shield against Iran is , in the words of one expert cited by the Financial
Times 's Gideon Rachman , " a system that wo n't work , against a threat that
does n't exist , paid for with money that we do n't have . "
The problem with American foreign policy goes beyond George Bush .
It
includes a Washington establishment that has gotten comfortable with the
exercise of American hegemony and treats compromise as treason and
negotiations as appeasement .
Other countries can have no legitimate
interests of their own .
The only way to deal with them is by issuing a
series of maximalist demands .
This is not foreign policy ; it 's imperial
policy .
And it is n't likely to work in today 's world .

So this is an ancient Chinese story from some time in the Zhou Dynasty which was over 2,000 years ago and lasted from the 8th century B.C.E. till the 3rd century B.C.E .
I will give you the translation provided by Paul Rozer in the book A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese .
When I first read this old Chinese story , I was rather surprised needless to say .
___
Mizi Xia was loved by the Lord of Wei .
The law of the state of Wei was that anyone who drove the lord ’s carriage unlawfully would be punished by having his feet cut off .
Mizi Xia ’s mother was ill ; someone heard of this , and at night went to inform him .
Mizi Xia drove the lord ’s carriage without authorization and went out .
The Lord heard of this and thought him worthy .
He said , “ How filial !
For the sake / reason of his mother , he committed a crime worthy of having his feet cut off ! ”
The lord was strolling in his orchard .
Mizi Xia ate a peach and found it sweet , so he did n’t finish it and offered [ the rest ] to the Lord .
The Lord said , “ He loves me and disregards it with taste ! ”
When Mizi Xia ’s look faded and [ the Lord ’s ] love slackened , he offended the Lord .
The Lord said , “ This man indeed once usurped the use of my carriage , and moreover he once fed me with the remains of a peach ! ”
Therefore , though Mizi Xia ’s conduct did not necessarily change from before , the reason why he was first considered worthy and afterward offended was because of the change that arose from love to hate .
___
This to me is really interesting , before this I had only known of a few emperors who would have affairs with eunuchs among the ancient Chinese .
In modern China , homosexuality or bisexuality would not be so accepted .
As I did my research , I realized that many rulers were bisexual and often had affairs with both women and men .
Often the scholars would not say that homosexuality was wrong in ancient China , but the king ’s or ruler ’s over grown sexual desire .
This Chinese story does show us something else as well ; sometimes doing the right thing can be difficult because sometimes , in even today ’s world ( perhaps more so ) it still seems if you do the right thing , you will be shunned for it or punished unfairly .
If one really looks at these ancient Chinese stories of any time , they can see in those classical times many interesting arguments which are still seen to this day .
Have you ever wondered how servers differ from one another ?
If so , you ’re in luck .
here are the different types of servers that exist and how they are used :
Server Platform :
The server platform is the basic software or hardware that plays the role of an engine that is essentially driving the server .
It functions very similarly or can be compared to an operating system .
Application Server :
The application server is a kind of middleware .
It consumes a significant portion of computing region in the midst of the end user and database servers .
It is frequently used to forge a connection between the two .
Audio / Video Server : Audio and video servers are in charge of providing multimedia capabilities to websites .
They also assist users with broadcasting streaming multimedia content .
Chat Server : Chat servers serve users that are exchanging data in real - time .
Fax Server :
This one is for companies that are looking to minimize incoming and outgoing telephone resource , but can not do away with fax services .
FTP Server :
This type of server utilizes one of the most antiquated Internet services which is also what its name is an acronym for : file transfer protocol .
The job of this server is to ensure that the files that are being transferred between computers are done so in a secure fashion .
Groupware Server :
This server is intended for users that are in collaboration with one another no matter where each user is located .
IRC Server :
If you are in search of real - time discussion capabilities , look no further than the IRC server .
An acronym for Internet Relay Chat , here , a variety of network servers are able to get in connection with one another through a network .
List Server :
The management of mailing lists becomes a breeze with the inception of list servers .
It is the prerogative of the user whether to make it an interactive discussion or a one - way list that simply provides information or makes announcements to subscribers .
Mail Server : Transferring and storing mail is the responsibility of this server via LANs , WANs , and throughout the internet .
News Server :
The news server is responsible for distributing and delivering information to public news groups .
Proxy Server :
The job of a proxy server is to mediate between external servers and client programs so that requests are filtered , performance is improved , connections are shared all as they should be .
Telnet Server : Telnet users ensure that users are successful as they are logging onto host computers and go about executing tasks .
Virtual Servers : A virtual server is not that different from a physical computer .
This is because each virtual server caters to a single customer .
It can also be booted individually and it is able to guard the privacy of a distinct computer .
Web Server : Providing static content to the web browser is the job of the web server .
This is done as a file is loaded from a disk and transferred through the network to the web browser of the user .
With regard to intermediation of the exchange , the server and the browser are in charge of this with the use of HTTP for communication .
I had a discussion today at lunch with one of my players about optimization of D&D characters in 4 E * .
Some of the points we raised got me thinking about things which led me to the titular conclusion .
Here are my starting assumptions :
The majority of powers in 4E are designed to reduce an opponent ’s hit points , either directly or indirectly .
Most of the remaining powers in 4E are designed to protect or restore character hit points , either directly or indirectly .
The durations of the few utility powers that are useful outside of combat are either instantaneous or about five minutes **.
A substantial protion of the rules in the PHB and the DMG are concerned , in one way or another , with combat ***.
I want to note that I do n’t think these are necessarily bad things .
One of the most complex facets of any RPG is combat , and even with a rules - light system ( which D&D is definitely NOT ) , combat takes up a disproportionate amount of game time .
It is also the most competitive portion of most game systems , and often benefits from having the most detailed rules to help adjudicate difficult situations if things turn adversarial .
What these assumptions mean , though , is that the utility of most powers , which are some of the primary identifiers of character in the game , do not extend outside of combat situations .
It means that my cunning wizard cannot turn himself invisible to accompany other characters to an audience with a crime lord and act as surprise back - up .
Hell , even with a ring of invisibility , I only get one turn of invisibility once per day .
Invisibility is only one aspect .
What about my ranger ’s ability to construct a well - concealed campsite , or my thief ’s ability to set a trap ?
Where are the glyphs of warding or guards and wards or explosive runes ?
If I want to infiltrate the tribe of gnolls , I ’ve got to put on a hyena skin , because disguise self no longer exists .
I know .
I know .
This sounds like some “ Bring Back 3rd Edition ” wonking .
It ’s not , though .
I do n’t mind that powers deal primarily with combat situations , because the designers have taken a bunch of the rest of those abilities and made them into rituals .
I love rituals .
I love the idea behind them , I love the design of them , I love the feel of them in game , I love pretty much everything about them .
One of my friends has complained that he does n’t like the idea of rituals because it means that a wizard ca n’t just wave his hand to create his phantom steed , and that makes him seem less magical .
Fair enough .
But I think the idea of wizards and clerics using big books of eldritch formula to weave the phantom steed together out of mist and shadows is a cooler image to me .
Gathering rare and valuable components to call up a mystical oracle to provide guidance just works in my mind , in a way that saying , “ I cast contact other plane , ” never did .
Yes .
Sure .
A good GM makes the rather mechanistic spells seem more magical .
The feel is more a result of play than of design .
I completely agree with that point .
In fact , I ’ve made it myself in other arguments .
But design certainly helps .
So , I like rituals .
But we need more .
And we need them to push the envelope of things .
We need to see some more of the utility spells from 3E show up as rituals .
Longer - term , multi-personÂ invisibility , for instance , could be patterned after the way they did the Overland Flight ritual .
All the missing polymorph effects would work pretty well as rituals , as would the protective spells I mentioned above .
And even though 4E deliberately stays away from buff spells , I think rituals that grant bonuses to skill checks for one scene or one endeavour would work nicely .
Not combat stats , mind you ; just buff one or more skill checks .
Goodman GamesÂ is off an running on this .
They ’ve announced an open call for their Book of Rituals , and their sample ritual shows that they ’re definitely doing a fair bit with summoning rituals .
I say the more , the merrier .
But I think things should be a little more open with rituals .
After all , in 4E , anyone who takes the Ritual Caster feat can use rituals , whether they are a spellcasting class or not .
We see some very rangerish rituals in the PHB , with the Nature skill as their focus .
Why not expand this to include fighters , rogues , and warlords ?
Okay , some of the defining identity of those three classes is that they are non-magical , but some of their powers seem pretty fantastic .
The rules describe them as using the Martial power source to fuel their exploits .
But what if , instead of a mystical rite that gave the fighter the ability to force one foe in the next battle to reroll an attack , he instead performed the Willow Dance Kata to limber himself up and focus on defense ?
And of course , he ’d need to rub his muscles with valuable salves and ointments to keep them loose , right ?
Or maybe the warlord sketches the Battle of Horn Falls out on the dirt and walks through the strategy and tactics used in the famous conflict in order to give his allies a bonus on their attempt to infiltrate the castle of the Mad Duke ?

So why have n’t I created a bunch of rituals to prove my point , and maybe sell them to Goodman Games ?
Well , two reasons .
One is that I ’m pretty lazy , and have n’t got around to doing it .

We were ready to fall in love with the Impulse NPX - 9000 as soon as we heard the words " World 's Cheapest Laptop , " but now that we 've got a review sample in our hands the bloom might be off this rose -- especially since the $ 199 wholesale price is n't even as cheap as the Dell Mini 9 on sale .
On the other hand , there 's something just delightfully janky about our Windows XP - powered unit , now labeled the TNX - 9500 -- it beeped continuously for several minutes when we first turned it on , the 1GHz no -name processor seems less willing to run Internet Explorer than Richard Stallman on a bad day , and it took us several minutes to figure out that a loud howling sound was being produced by the always - on microphone feeding back through the speakers .
Yet for some reason we were all smiles the whole time -- what can we say , we 're suckers for cheap .
Hopefully Impulse will stake a bolder claim to the title of " world 's cheapest laptop " when production ramps up , since prices are expected to fall , but this particular unit actually can't get any cheaper for you -- we 'll be giving it away soon .

A sequence of images showing how turbulent forces ( the Coriolis Effect and vertical shear ) mix up the layers of dust and gas orbiting young stars .
Images depict a 2 - D slice through Joseph Barranco 's 3 - D simulations .
Deep red indicates dust - rich gas .
Deep blue indicates pure gas .
The simulation is based on dust and gas that is the same distance away from its star as earth is from the sun .
The time interval between frames is 3.4 years .
Gas - rich planets such as Jupiter and Saturn grew from a disk of dust and gas which eventually crumpled like a piece of paper under its own gravitational instability -- or so one theory goes .
Now a computer simulation suggests that this idea falls apart under the turbulent forces within early protoplanetary systems .
The old , favored theory relies on the protoplanetary dust disk becoming denser and thinner until it reaches a tipping point , where it becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses into kilometer - sized building blocks that form the basis for gas giants .
But 3D modeling has shown for the first time that turbulence prevents the dust from settling into the dense disk necessary for gravitational instability to work
" It has been known since the '80s that there have been problems with that theory , but no one had gotten around to doing 3D simulations , " said Joseph Barranco , an astrophysicist at San Francisco State University in Calif .
Ripples on a pond
Scientists have long held that dust in a protoplanetary disk ends up sandwiched between an upper and lower layer of gas .
But Barranco modeled how the gas layers flow at different speeds over and beneath the dust layer , which creates turbulence .
" What we found is that , like wind blowing over water on a pond , you get ripples , " Barranco told SPACE.com .
His research showed that the ripples prevent the dust from ever settling into the thin , dense middle layer .
The idea bears strong resemblance to the phenomenon of vertical shear , where wind speeds change drastically at different altitudes .
This can cause dangerous turbulence for jetliners flying through Earth 's atmosphere .
Another factor which seems to keep the dust layer stirred up is the Coriolis Effect .
This occurs on Earth when a jetliner tries to fly in a straight line , but ends up in a curved path because the planet rotates beneath it .
Winds may also fall prey to this rotation effect , which feeds into the formation of hurricanes .
Previously , some researchers had hoped that radial shearing -- which occurs when the inner ring of a dust disk rotates at faster speeds than the outer rings -- would help counteract the other turbulent forces .
However , Barranco 's simulation showed that the Coriolis Effect and vertical shearing usually proved stronger .
Computing planetary evolution
Planet formation theory has itself undergone periods of turbulent change in recent years .
Early interest during the 1970s and 1980s eventually died down , only to pick up again in the 1990s when astronomers began finding planets orbiting other stars .
" Planet formation theory was formerly quiet , because we only had our own solar system , " Barranco noted .
Now scientists scramble to figure out a theory of planet formation that can account for the gas giants orbiting the many different systems observed so far .
Simulations of turbulent forces only arose in 3D during recent years with the advent of supercomputing .
Barranco used hundreds of individual computer processors working together in parallel to each tackle a small piece of the puzzle .
His study marks the first 3D modeling of such planetary formation , and appears in the latest issue of The Astrophysical Journal
As for explaining planet formation , the astrophysicist wants to reexamine his 2005 research that raised the idea of hurricane - like storms in protoplanetary disks .
The quiet eye or center of such storms could theoretically have provided a haven for dust to clump up and provide the seeds for planets , even with chaos swirling all around .
" It 's an incredibly challenging field , " Barranco said .
" We can't observe planetary formation , but we know that planets form because we 're standing on one . "

A fit and healthy teenage rugby player died 12 hours after taking treatment for acne , a coroner said today .
Recording a narrative verdict , Mary Hassell said Shaun Jones , 14 , died " as a result of complications of medical treatment " .
Shaun , who was described by his mother as " vain " about his appearance , saw his doctor about spots on his back and shoulders after learning his friends had been given medication to deal with similar problems .
The 6ft schoolboy , of Rhydyfelin , near Pontypridd in South Wales , who had previously used Clearasil to treat the spots , was diagnosed with mild acne and given a prescription , Cardiff coroner 's court heard .
When he went to his local pharmacy with his mother Clare , he was told the drug was out of stock .
Shaun and his mother were informed that the pharmacist had spoken to the doctor , and he could be given different tablets which were the same as the other medication .
Mrs Jones noticed there was no safety leaflet included in the box , but thought nothing of it at the time .
Shaun took the medication with a glass of water just before going to bed at 10.30 pm on 20 October last year .
Little more than an hour later , he complained to his parents of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest .
Mrs Jones initially contacted an out - of - hours GP service but was told no doctor was available .
When Shaun 's condition deteriorated , he was taken to the Royal Glamorgan hospital , Llantrisant , by ambulance in the early hours of the next morning .
Despite treatment there , and at the University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff , where he was transferred , Shaun died at 10.40 am the following day .
Doctors at the University Hospital of Wales believe an " idiosyncratic reaction " to the acne medication could have caused his death .
Hassell said she would write a report to the lord chancellor 's office underlining the importance that " doctors prescribe drugs and doctors make amendments and patients receive drugs with the correct information attached " .
WASHINGTON , Jan 13 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Sen .
Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday the incoming Obama administration would take no options off the table when dealing with Iran over its nuclear ambitions but a policy review was being done over how to tackle Iran .
“ No option is off the table , ” she told the confirmation hearing as top U.S. diplomat .
“ But we will pursue a new , different approach , ” she added .
“ What we have tried has not worked . ” ( Reporting by Sue Pleming )
CAMPO CARABOBO , Venezuela ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Saturday Barack Obama had the “ stench ” of his predecessor as U.S. president and was at risk of being killed if he tries to change the American “ empire . ”
Most world leaders expect a new era of U.S. foreign relations when Obama , a Democrat , is sworn in as president on Tuesday after Republican George W. Bush ’s eight years in the White House .
But Chavez said frayed ties with Washington were unlikely to improve despite the departure of Bush , who the Venezuelan leader has often called the “ devil . ”
“ I hope I am wrong , but I believe Obama brings the same stench , to not say another word , ” Chavez said at a political rally on a historic Venezuelan battlefield .
“ If Obama as president of the United States does not obey the orders of the empire , they will kill him , like they killed Kennedy , like they killed Martin Luther King , or Lincoln , who freed the blacks and paid with his life . ”
Obama , who will be the first black president in U.S. history , was given Secret Service protection on the campaign trail earlier than is customary for candidates and security for Tuesday ’s inauguration is extremely tight .
Venezuela is a leading supplier of oil to the United States and the two countries once enjoyed close ties .
Relations deteriorated after Chavez first won election in 1998 as he took on U.S. companies as part of his socialist agenda of nationalization of various industries and accused Washington of backing a brief coup against him .
Last year , he expelled the U.S. ambassador from Venezuela .
Chavez ’s foreign policy is based on countering U.S. global influence and promoting countries like Russia and China as world leaders .
He has close ties to U.S. foes Cuba and Iran .
Until recently , Chavez had said he hoped relations with Washington could improve .
But in the last few days , he has picked up on comments he attributes to Obama accusing him of obstructing progress in Latin America and exporting terrorism .

It is incredible that people respond to the recession by flocking to graduate school .
In a world where people are undertaking massive deleveraging to prepare for tough times ahead , reducing your immediate earnings while taking on tons of debt for graduate school seems exactly the wrong thing to do .
But grad school applications surge in a recession .
Many professionals decide that they 'd rather wait out the recession ensconced in a school somewhere than take a job they see as beneath them for wages they would have scoffed at during the boom .
Our system seems designed to encourage this .
Even with our credit markets in turmoil , there are still plenty of student loans to be had and the tax system rewards spending money on education .
If you are a recently laid off financial professional , or one that has seen your compensation drop precipitously , the grad school option is very tempting .
Do n't make this mistake , says Penelope Trunk .
Grad school is a terrible investment , and its even worse during a downturn .
Most business schools are n't worth the money and even the best schools should only really be considered for networking opportunities .

are built to feed people into a broken health care system that increasingly wo n't compensate graduates for the years they are expected to spend in school and training .
PhD programs are a scam with no paying exit .
Most importantly , graduate school costs too much and the years spent in school would be better spent learning a trade or starting a business .
Almost any job is better than graduate school .
Trunk 's conclusion :
In a world where people did not change careers , grad school made sense .
Today , grad school is antiquated .
You invest three to six extra years in school in order to get your dream career .
But the problem is that not only are the old dream careers deteriorating , but even if you have a dream career , it wo n’t last .
You ’ll want to change because you can .
Because that ’s normal for today ’s workplace .
People who are in their twenties today will change careers about four times in their life .
Which means that grad school is a steep investment for such a short period of time .
The grad school model needs to change to adapt to the new workplace .
Until then .
Stay away .
So what should you do ?
Your best option is to take a job doing something , anything .
If you want to build skills for the recovery but can't find a job where you expect to do that , take the job anyway and prepare for something like the CFA exam .
Credentials showing actual skills are far better than old - fashioned graduate degrees .
As time goes on , this trend is likely to continue .
Is there anything that sets Christianity apart from other religions ?
Why do Christians claim that Christianity is true and other religions are n’t ?
Just what are “ messianic prophecies ” ?
Why are they important ?
How can we know who God really is ?
Well , the God of the Bible has told us exactly how we can know that He is the one true God .
One of the primary ways that God authenticates Himself is through predictive prophecy .
In other words , only the one true God can tell us the end of the story from the beginning .
In Isaiah 46:9 - 10 , God says this :
Remember the former things , those of long ago ;
I am God , and there is no other ;
I am God , and there is none like me .
I make known the end from the beginning ,
from ancient times , what is still to come .
I say : My purpose will stand ,
and I will do all that I please .
So is there evidence in the Scriptures that God has told us the end from the beginning ?
There sure is !
When you are talking with a non-believer , have them read Isaiah chapter 53 .
Then ask them who it is talking about .
Most of the time they will say something like : “ Of course it is talking about Jesus – but should we be surprised that the Bible talks about Jesus ? ”
Then tell them that Isaiah 53 was written about 700 years BEFORE Jesus came to earth .
That will get their attention .
The truth is that Isaiah 53 contains stunning messianic prophecies of the suffering , death and resurrection of the future Messiah .
7 different times in that chapter Isaiah prophecies that the future Messiah will suffer for OUR sins …..
Isaiah 53:4
Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows
Isaiah 53:5
But he was pierced for our transgressions , he was crushed for our iniquities ; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him , and by his wounds we are healed .
Isaiah 53:6 … the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all .
Isaiah 53:8 … for the transgression of my people he was stricken .
Isaiah 53:10
Yet it was the LORD ’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer , and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering
Isaiah 53:11 …he will bear their iniquities
Isaiah 53:12
For he bore the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors .
Isaiah 53 also tells us that the Messiah will die and that He would be assigned a grave with the wicked ( Jesus was crucified with thieves ) and with the rich ( He was buried in a rich man ’s tomb ) …..
Isaiah 53:12 …he poured out his life unto death
Isaiah 53:9
He was assigned a grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death
In verse 11 , Isaiah also tells us that after His suffering , the Messiah would be resurrected …..
Isaiah 53:11
After the suffering of his soul , he will see the light of life and be satisfied
Is n’t all of this amazing ?
If you have never read Isaiah 53 , I would encourage you to read the entire chapter :
http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053&version=9
But Isaiah 53 is not alone .
The Bible is literally packed with prophecies that have been fulfilled .
But getting back to Isaiah 53 , the Bible Code researchers have found something truly extraordinary in that chapter .
They have found the name of Jesus ( Yeshua ) , Mary , the names of the 12 disciples , Messiah , Galilee , Herod , His Cross , Let Him Be Crucified and many other terms related to Jesus all in this short passage .
You can read all about it at this excellent site :
http://bibleprobe.com/jesuscode.htm
What will the skeptics have to say now ?
It is all a “ coincidence ” ?
If that is what you believe , then you have a whole lot of blind faith .
Anyway , here are some of the terms that the Bible Code researchers have discovered in Isaiah 53 and the verses where the terms were found :
Yeshua ( Jesus ) 53:10
Nazarene 53:6
Messiah 53:11
Shiloh 53:12
Passover 53:10
Galilee 53:7
Herod 53:6

The truth is out there if you are willing to look at it .
MOSCOW  Already jittery investors were alarmed on Thursday when a Norwegian cellphone company announced that a Siberian court had seized its multibillion - dollar investment in a Russian joint venture and would turn it over to a company thought to be allied with a Russian oligarch .
The decision signaled an escalation in a long - running dispute between the Norwegian company , Telenor , and the Alfa Group , an alliance of Russian businessmen that was also at the center of a separate fight with the British oil giant BP last summer .
That dispute also shook faith in the Russian market .
Russia ’s stock market fell on the news of the asset seizure .
Telenor has accused the Alfa Group , whose principal partner is Mikhail M. Fridman , of filing groundless lawsuits to gain control of Vimpelcom , the cellphone company that they own jointly .
One such lawsuit prompted the ruling Wednesday .
A judge in the Siberian city of Omsk ordered court bailiffs to seize Telenor ’s 29.9 percent share in Vimpelcom .
The judge had earlier ordered Telenor to pay a fine of $ 1.7 billion after Alfa accused Telenor of obstructing the expansion of Vimpelcom into Ukraine to protect other Telenor businesses in that country .
Telenor denied the accusation and refused to pay the fine .
The shares were seized in lieu of the payment .
If there ’s one thing that Apple is really good at , besides hardware and software , it ’s getting annoying catchy songs stuck in our heads via their commercials .
Steve Jobs , the CEO of Apple , handpicks the songs that are used in Apple commercials .
Since these ads are notorious for putting bands on the map ( or charts ) , we ’ve decided to focus our top 10 list solely on bands that were not big when the commercials first aired .
That means no U2 , Daft Punk , Mary J Blige , Eminem , Black Eyed Peas etc .
10 Cut Chemistry – The Audience is Listening Theme Song
We begin the list with Cut Chemistry ( a.k.a Lucas MacFadden ) , who has been in the music scene since the mid nineties .
He ’s known for his collaborations with artists DJ Shadow and the band Jurassic 5 .
His song , The Audience Is Listening Theme Song was featured in the second generation iPod nano commercials .
9 Chairlift – Bruises
This song is about a chick who ’s trying to do handstands for friend but keeps falling down and gets bruises .
Fear not , her friend uses his frozen strawberries to ease the pain on her knees .
Yeah -- that ’s the entire song .
We wo n’t deny that we found Chairlift 's Bruises to be obnoxiously catchy when we first heard it during the iPod nano( chromatic ) commercials .
8 The Ting Tings – Shut Up and Let Me Go
The Ting Tings are an English duo band who began to garner attention from radio play and a fairly decent showing at 2007 ’s Glastonbury festival .
Shut Up and Let Me
Go has a catchy chorus but suffers from repetition which makes it an ideal choice for a short iPod commercial .
7 Steriogram – Walkie Talkie Man
Walkie Talkie Man is a fast - talking song with very catchy rift and drum beat by Steriogram .
The song became an enormous hit after appearing in an iPod commercial in 2004 .
Since then , the song has appeared in numerous soundtracks ( including videogames ) .
It also sports a good music video .
6 Cansei de Ser Sexy – Music is My Hot , Hot Sex
Music Is My Hot , Hot Sex is a song from the Brazilian band Cansei de Ser Sexy .
This song was actually featured in a Microsoft Zune commercial prior to being featured in a more successful iPod Touch commercial .
5 The Caesars – Jerk It Out
Jerk It Out has been a great success for the garage rock band The Caesars .
The song has been licensed in movie trailers , reality shows , videogame and movie soundtracks , TV series and of course , in commercials such as the iPod shuffle one .

REUTERS / Mitch Dumke
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A top Spanish court has moved toward starting a probe of six former Bush administration officials including ex-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in connection with alleged torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , The New York Times said on Saturday .
The criminal investigation would focus on whether they violated international law by providing a legalistic justification for torture at the U.S. detention camp in Cuba , the Times said .
The paper said the National Court in Madrid had assigned the case to judge Baltasar Garzon , known for ordering the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
Garzon has accepted the case and sent it to the prosecutor ’s office for review , the newspaper said , citing an official close to the case .
The complaint , prepared by Spanish lawyers with the help of U.S. and European legal experts , also names John Yoo , the former Justice Department lawyer who wrote secret legal opinions saying the president had the authority to circumvent the Geneva Conventions , and Douglas Feith , the former undersecretary of defense for policy .
Spain can claim jurisdiction in the case because five Spanish citizens or residents who were prisoners at Guantanamo Bay say they were tortured there .
The other Americans named are William Haynes II , former general counsel for the Department of Defense ; Jay Bybee , Yoo ’s former boss at the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ; and David Addington , chief of staff and legal adviser to ex-Vice President Dick Cheney .
Yoo , already the subject of a Justice Department ethics investigation , declined to comment to the Times .
The others either could not be reached or did not immediately respond to requests for comment , the Times said .
Gonzalo Boye , a Madrid lawyer who filed the complaint , said the six Americans had well - documented roles in approving illegal interrogation techniques , redefining torture and abandoning the definition set by the 1984 Torture Convention , the newspaper said .

Shakyamuni Buddha's Life Story
Zen Story - Like a Pile of Bullsh **
" Enlightenment , for a wave in the ocean ,
is the moment the wave realises it is water . "
Thich Nhat Hanh WHAT IS A BUDDHA ?
The word Buddha means " awakened one " or " enlightened one " .
The Buddha was an " ordinary " human like you and me before he became enlightened .
Enlightenment is compared to waking up , because we suddenly experience a complete transformation of body and mind when we wake up .
A Buddha is a person who has developed all positive qualities and eliminated all negative qualities .
One could say that a Buddha represents the very peak of evolution , as he / she is omniscient or all - knowing .
With his wisdom , a Buddha really understands the truth , whereas ordinary people live like in a dream , an illusion that prevents us from understanding reality properly .
" Our teacher , Sakyamuni Buddha , is one among the thousand Buddhas of this aeon .
These Buddhas were not Buddhas from the beginning , but were once sentient beings like ourselves .
How they came to be Buddhas is this .
Of body and mind , mind is predominant , for body and speech are under the influence of the mind .
Afflictions such as desire do not contaminate the nature of the mind , for the nature of the mind is pure , uncontaminated by any taint .
Afflictions are peripheral factors of a mind , and through gradually transforming all types of defects , such as these afflictions , the adventitious taints can be completely removed .
This state of complete purification is Buddhahood ; therefore , Buddhists do not assert that there is any Buddha who has been enlightened from the beginning . "
His Holiness the Dalai Lama from ' The Buddhism of Tibet '
The historical Buddha , Shakyamuni or Gautama Buddha , lived about 2,500 years ago in India .
However , he was not the first Buddha , and will not be the last either .
He taught that during this eon ( very long time period , maybe comparable to the life - time of the universe as we know it ) , there would be 1,000 fully enlightened Buddhas who would introduce Buddhism ( after it has been totally forgotten ) .
The numbers one to three in this eon are Krakucchanda , Kanakamuni , Kashyapa , then comes Shakyamuni ( the historical Buddha some 2,500 years ago ) , and the next Buddha will be called Maitreya .

WHAT IS A BUDDHA NOT ?
A Buddha is not the creator of the universe , like " God " in the Christian - Judeo - Islamic sense .
In fact , there is no creator of the universe given in Buddhist philosophy apart from the karma ( actions ) of sentient beings ( beings with a mind like huans and animals ) .
The Buddha is not omnipotent ( all - powerful ) like the Christian - Judeo - Islamic " God " .
( The simple reason is that if he were , out of compassion , he would have long released all sentient beings from suffering . )
The state of a Buddha is not impossible to reach ( although it may take many lives and extensive effort ) .
A Buddha is not hindered by ignorance , but is omniscient ( knows everything ) .
A Buddha is not a passive being ; he will use his wisdom to help to other living beings when they are open to his advice .
SHAKYAMUNI BUDDHA'S LIFE STORY Prince Siddharta Gautama was born some 2,500 years ago as a prince in what is now called Lumbini in Nepal .
At his birth , many special signs appeared .
His father asked a sage living in his kingdom for advice on his son .
The sage predicted that Gautama would become either a great King or a great spiritual teacher .
The King wanted his son to be his successor and tried to keep him far away from all matters of life that could incline him to a spiritual life .
Gautama usually spent his life in his father 's palace , surrounded by all the possible luxuries of the time .
He proved to be a special child , being quite intelligent as well as an excellent sportsman .
He married to a beautiful woman he loved , and they had a son .
When Gautama was 29 years old , he discovered there was much suffering in the world around him .
Traditionally it is explained that he suddenly recognised the problems of sickness , old age and death when visiting the city .
Being shocked by the suffering of all living beings , he decided to search for way to end it .
He left his wife and child , the palace and even his royal clothes , and started out on a spiritual quest .
Gautama studied under various teachers and followed their practices until he mastered them all .
His first teacher was Alara Kalama who taught a form of meditation leading to an exalted form of absorption called " the state of no - thingness " , a state without moral or cognitive dimension .
Gautama saw this was not going to solve suffering , and continued his search .
The next teacher was Udraka Ramaputra who taught him meditative absorption leading to " the state of neither perception nor non-perception " .
Again , Gautama realised this was not the state he was looking for .
( Both Alara and Udraka are by some scholars considered to be Jain followers . )
Next , he tried extreme ascetic practices at Uruvilva in North India , with five other ascetics who turned into his followers .
In the end , Gautama nearly died of starvation .
After about six years of searching , he realised that just wearing down his body did not generate new insights , but rather leads to weakness and self - destruction .
When he decided to give up extreme asceticism , his five students left him .
The ' Bodhi ' tree in Bodhgaya The Sarnath stupa , location of the first teachings
He then sat down in a place now called Bodhgaya ( North India ) under a Bodhi - tree and decided not to get up anymore until he discovered the truth .
Just a short time later , he became a fully enlightened Buddha .
This means that he actualised all positive potentials of a sentient being and rid himself of all negative qualities .
With this , he realised the true nature of existence and suffering ( emptiness ) , and how suffering can be ended .
( On the right is a descendant of the original Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya . )
Seven weeks after enlightenment , the Buddha gave his first discourse in Sarnath , near Varanasi ( see image below right ) .
Here he taught the 4 Noble Truths .
The Buddha continued to teach during his life , until passing away at the age of 81 .
The Buddha once summarised his entire teachings in one sentence : " I teach about suffering and the way to end it " .
The main disciples of the Buddha are also known as the Great Arhants : Shariputra , known for his understanding of the Abidharma teachings ; Maudgalyayana , known for his psychic powers ; Mahakashyapa , the great ascetic ; and Ananda , the personal attendant of the Buddha who recalled every word the Buddha spoke .
The Buddha 's life is also sometimes summarized in the so called ' Twelve Deeds of the Buddha ' .
See the Samye website for a description of these .
People often wonder if it was not selfish from the Buddha to leave his wife and child , and the rest of his family on his spiritual quest .
Of course , on the short - term it may have caused especially his wife much sorrow , however , as is nicely recounted at the Buddha Mind website , all his family members achieved enlightenment .
One of the important annual Buddhist festival days celebrates the Buddha 's returning from the ' Heaven of the 33 ' ; he went there to teach the devas of that realm , including his mother , so that she achieved enlightenment .
So , it is easy to see that whatever suffering the Buddha caused to his family members turned into more then a blessing in the end .
ZEN ( CH'AN ) STORY - LIKE A PILE OF BULLSH **
By Ven Master Hsing Yun , from Merit Times .
" Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty went to meditate with Ch'an Master Foyin at Golden Mountain Temple .
After Su Dongpo had experienced a total relaxation of body and mind , he asked Ch'an Master Foyin , " Master , what do you think of my sitting posture ? "
" Very magnificent .
Like a Buddha ! "
Su Dongpo was very delighted to hear that .
Master Foyin then asked him , " Scholar , what do you think of my sitting posture then ? "
Su Dongpo , never giving up any chance to tease and jeer at Master Foyin , immediately replied , " Like a pile of bullsh * * . "
Master Foyin was very delighted to hear the answer and did not utter another word .
Su Dongpo thought he had beaten Master Foyin because the Master was wordless while being compared to a pile of bullsh **.
He was so proud of himself that he told everyone he met , " Today I won . "
This news soon reached Su's sister Su Xiaomei .
She asked him , " Brother , how was it that you beat Master today ? "
Su repeated the whole story vividly to his sister .
Su Xiaomei , talented and smart as she was , told Su Dongpo straight to his face , " Brother , you actually lost .
It is because Master 's mind is actually that of a Buddha that he could see you as a Buddha .
As your mind is like a pile of bullsh ** , you , of course , saw him as a pile of bullsh **. "
Su Dongpo , realizing his Chan practice was far inferior to Master Foyin's , was speechless .
Moral : Ch'an does not depend on knowledge but upon the capacity to awake .
Ch'an is not about eloquent debate but intuitive wisdom .
Do n't think all Ch'an masters handle encounters with sharp words .
Sometimes , when they are silent and do n't communicate via words and language , they can still utter the same deafening Dharma sounds . "

Groucho Marx
One day a young Buddhist on his journey home , came to the banks of a wide river .
Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him , he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier .
Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river .
The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher , " Oh wise one , can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river ? "
The teacher ponders for a moment looks up and down the river and yells back , " My son , you are on the other side " .

By Amarnath Tewary in western Bihar
The bachelor villagers are determined More than 100 unmarried villagers in India 's Bihar state are working flat out to build a 6 km ( 3.7 - mile ) road to help their efforts to get married .
The village of Barwaan Kala , in the west of Bihar , is located high in the Kaimur hills and is known locally as the " village of unmarried people " .
Some 121 villagers aged between 16 and 80 remain bachelors , they say , because of the remoteness of the village .
The last wedding in the village was reportedly 50 years ago .
" Even those who have managed to get married have done it surreptitiously by taking temporary shelter in the less remote villages of their relatives , " Ram Chand Kharwar , a 50 - year - old bachelor , told the BBC .
Apart from the inaccessibility of Barwaan Kala , outsiders are also fearful of Maoist militants who operate in the area .
Amenities are in short supply - of the six village hand water pumps none is working and a government school has no teacher .
The nearest police station and hospital are both 45 km ( 28 miles ) away .
Without development , many families refuse to agree to marry off their daughters to prospective husbands from the area .
Broken ' promise '
" The biggest problem for us and for outsiders is the difficult hilly terrain to pass through , " said 40 - year - old bachelor Ram Lal Yadav ruefully .
Social workers such as Chandrama Singh Yadav say that the reason for the high number of bachelors is not because they lack eligibility but because there is no approach road to the village .
I tried my best to highlight the issue
Ram Chandra Singh Yadav MLA ( Photo : Paras Nath )
The unmarried villagers were given hope that their access to potential partners would be eased during the last state assembly elections when , for the first time since independence , a party candidate on the campaign trail visited them .
Ram Chandra Singh Yadav assured the village of 1,500 people that he too would not get married unless he could get a road for them .
Believing his words , the villagers backed Mr Yadav in his successful campaign to win election in 2005 .
But , after winning , the new Member of the Legislative Assembly not only got married the next year but , in the villagers ' eyes , added insult to injury by making the event a gala affair .
He is now the proud father of a two - year - old daughter .
When the villagers approached him to remind him of his promise to them , they say he asked them if they really believed that he too should remain a bachelor forever .
The young newly - elected MLA sought to explain his actions .
" I tried my best to highlight the issue ; even in state assembly I raised the issue of the village six times in the last three years .
Moreover , we cannot do it on our own as the area falls under a wildlife protected zone , " Mr Yadav told the BBC .
What the villagers are doing is unlawful activity ... we will take all necessary action
Forest officer RK Ram
He also claimed to be a victim of a ploy to defame him by a rival political leader .
However , the villagers have now decided to take the law into their own hands .
Armed with shovels , chisels , hammers , spades and other tools , the bachelors of the Barwaan Kala village are getting on with the job of constructing the road by themselves .
In the past month - and - a - half , they have already laid a 3 km ( 1.8 miles ) stretch of road on the hilly terrain .
As one group of them shoves big boulders aside , another group hammers them into small stone chips to lay the road .
Work is in progress around the clock .
Legal hurdle Only 3 km more remain to be laid to connect the village to the rest of the Bhabhua district .
" We 'll make it very soon and then we can hope to get married one day like others , " said a prospective bridegroom , Sheo Kharwar , 28 .
' We will not rest until we construct the road '
That optimism is shared by Rohit Yadav , Ram Lal , Prachari Kharwar , Dev Nath , Rajgriha , Ram Ashish and other bachelors who are working on paving the new passage to the outside world .
Once the road is constructed , the current circuitous route of about 40 km ( 25 miles ) will be drastically reduced and at least 10,000 people from 10 surrounding villages in the sub - district will benefit , according to former village head Ram Dayal .
Unfortunately , there may still be a big legal hurdle in the way of the men's mission to increase the number of weddings in the village .
The area is within a wildlife protected zone , where road construction has to meet strict guidelines .
" What the villagers are doing is an unlawful activity under the Supreme Court directive .
We will take all necessary action , " said district forest officer RK Ram .
But the bachelor villagers are determined to complete their project .
" Come what may , we will not rest until we construct the entire 6 km road , " they said in unison , as they raised their construction tools up in the air .

( CNN ) --
Gas prices jumped 6 cents over the past two weeks to a national average of $ 1.92 a gallon , according to a survey published Sunday .
That price is more than a dollar less than the price at the same time last year , said Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the Lundberg Survey .
The average cost of a gallon of self - serve regular nationwide a year ago was $ 2.94 .
Prices at the pump have been creeping back up after bottoming out at $ 1.62 seven weeks ago , Lundberg said .
That low was down from record - high prices that reached more than $ 4 per gallon during the summer .
The recent increase is due in part to gasoline demand , Lundberg told CNN .
" Thanks to such low prices , demand is now within shouting distance of its year - ago level , " she said .
The latest survey tallied prices Friday at thousands of gas stations nationwide .
The lowest average price was in Cheyenne , Wyoming , where a gallon of self - serve regular cost $ 1.57 .
The highest was Anchorage , Alaska at $ 2.37
Here are the prices in some other cities :
Boston , Massachusetts - $ 1.89
Washington - $ 1.93
Atlanta , Georgia - $ 1.84
Chicago , Illinois - $ 1.99
Houston , Texas - $ 1.77
Denver , Colorado - $ 1.78
Omaha , Nebraska - $ 1.91
Las Vegas , Nevada - $ 2.09
Seattle , Washington - $ 2.11

You could also specify which phones would ring when certain people called .
( For the really annoying people in your life , you could even tell GrandCentral to answer with the classic , three - tone “ The number you have dialed is no longer in service ” message . )
Also very cool :
Any time during a call , you could press the * key to make all of your phones ring again , so that you could pick up on a different phone in midcall .
If you were heading out the door , you could switch a landline call to your cellphone .
GrandCentral also offered telemarketing spam filters , off - hour call blocking ( “ never ring my BlackBerry on weekends ” ) , and a dizzying number of other functions .
For people with complicated lives , GrandCentral was a breath of fresh air .
It felt like a secret power that nobody else had .
Then , in 2007 , Google bought GrandCentral .
It stopped accepting new members , ceased any visible work on it , and , apparently , forgot about it completely .
The early adopters , several hundred thousand of them , were able to keep using GrandCentral ’s features .
But as time went on , their hearts sank .
In January , Salon.com summed it up in an editorial called , “ Will the Last One to Leave GrandCentral Please Turn Out the Lights ? ”
As it turns out , the joke was on them .
Google was quietly working on GrandCentral all along .
Starting Thursday , existing GrandCentral members can upgrade to Google Voice .
In a few weeks , after debugging the system , Google will open the service to all .
Google Voice starts with a clean , redesigned Web site that looks like an in - box , à la Gmail .
It maintains all of those original GrandCentral features  but more important , introduces four game - changing new ones .
FREE VOICE MAIL TRANSCRIPTIONS
From now on , you do n’t have to listen to your messages in order ; you do n’t have to listen to them at all .
In seconds , these recordings are converted into typed text .
They show up as e-mail messages or text messages on your cellphone .
YouTube in the UK is to be stripped of its most popular music videos after the site failed to agree a new licensing deal with the Performing Rights Society for Music , the trade body that collects music royalties .
YouTube said today that after the expiry of its former deal , PRS had proposed new payment terms that would be financially prohibitive for the site and would require YouTube to pay out more than it makes from the ads next to each video .
YouTube says it will help find the next Arctic Monkeys .

It also said that PRS would not agree to identify which artists and songs are covered by which licence , something essential for YouTube 's content ID system to identify and reimburse rights holders for each song that is viewed .
" We value the creativity of musicians and song writers and have worked hard with rights - holders to generate significant online revenue for them and to respect copyright , " said parent company Google in a statement .
" But PRS is now asking us to pay many , many times more for our licence than before .
The costs are simply prohibitive for us - under PRS 's proposed terms we would lose significant amounts of money with every playback . "
Google said it is still negotiating with PRS but in the meantime , premium videos from artists on EMI , Universal , Warner and Sony BMG and some indie labels have started to disappear for UK viewers and will be systematically removed over the next few days .
YouTube 's has separate deals with the major labels who control the sound recording rights but PRS controls licencing for the music and lyrics , without which live or pre-recorded songs cannot be performed .
Patrick Walker , YouTube 's director of video partnerships , said he could n't give a figure for the proportion of site traffic generated by music videos , but that music videos are some of the most popular content on the site and generate a lot of activity including remixes and on music blogs .
" This is about long - term viability , " he said .
" If the next Arctic Monkeys is going to surface we need to get this to work .
It 's in the interest of the music industry - we 're not just doing this for us .
The record industry needs a new business models so it 's kind of a shame that this has happened .
But sometimes you have to step back to step forwards . "
PRS said today that Google 's announcement was made without any consultation and in the middle of negotiations , and that it is " outraged on behalf of consumers and songwriters that Google has chosen to close down access to music videos on YouTube in the UK " .
But it also appeared to contradict Google 's claim that PRS had asked much more money for the new licence , saying the tech giant wants " to pay significantly less than at present to the writers of the music on which their service relies " .
" We were shocked and disappointed to receive a call late this afternoon informing us of Google 's drastic action , " said PRS chief executive Steve Porter . " ... which we believe only punishes British consumers and the songwriters whose interests we protect and represent . "
Clearly pre-empting the fury of YouTube users , PRS emphasised that it did not ask YouTube to remove the videos and " urges them to reconsider their decision as a matter of urgency " .
But even if PRS is completely squeaky clean in this episode , it comes soon after the closing days of the Pirate Bay trial and for web - savvy consumers it will confirm the gulf between the traditional music industry and the technology they love .
It also follows some bad press for PRS over licence chasing ; PRS has allegedly been pestering small businesses demanding licences if , for example , they have more than two staff and listen to the radio .
BEIJING 
A fierce blaze started by an illegal fireworks show engulfed one of the Chinese capital ’s most architecturally celebrated modern buildings on Monday , the last day of festivities for the Lunar New Year , the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday .
The fire was not extinguished until early Tuesday morning .
Xinhua , quoting a fire official , said a fireworks company had been hired to ignite several hundred large firecrackers in an open space outside the building , the Mandarin Oriental Hotel , which was under construction .
The official described them as illegal fireworks that much more powerful and explosive than those sold at roadside stalls .
One firefighter was killed and seven people were injured , including six firefighters , according to Xinhua .
DUBLIN ( AP ) - Suspected IRA dissidents and their supporters hijacked cars Monday in working - class Catholic areas of Northern Ireland in a coordinated effort to block roads and threaten police stations , police said .
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was receiving a wave of reports of vehicles being hijacked by masked gunmen in several parts of Belfast and in the Kilwilkie district of Lurgan , a power base for Irish Republican Army dissidents southwest of Belfast .
Some vehicles were being set on fire in roads to disrupt traffic at rush hour , while others were abandoned near four Belfast police stations and on Northern Ireland ’s major motorway near Lurgan .
Police said they were treating all the abandoned vehicles as potential car bombs , although they cautioned this was unlikely .
They urged motorists to avoid Kilwilkie and parts of Catholic west Belfast entirely .
Monday ’s upheaval came at the end of a month in which IRA dissidents shot to death two soldiers and a policeman _ the first killings of British security forces since 1998 , the year of Northern Ireland ’s peace accord .
Police said at least two cars were hijacked in Lurgan ’s Kilwilkie district , the power base of suspected IRA dissident Colin Duffy .
Duffy , 41 , was charged last week with murdering the two soldiers .
One of the hijacked cars was abandoned on the M1 motorway , which connects Belfast to Dublin , 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) to the south .
Authorities shut part of the motorway as a precaution .
One abandoned vehicle _ which police said did not contain a bomb _ was left near the Stormont Parliamentary Building , the center of Northern Ireland ’s power - sharing government between the British Protestant majority and Irish Catholic minority .
The coalition ’s Protestant leader , First Minister Peter Robinson , said the rising dissident IRA threat would not spur Protestants to sever links with Sinn Fein , the IRA - linked party that represents most Catholics today .
“ The criminal terrorists responsible for the series of bomb scares and hijackings are beneath contempt and have no support whatsoever in the community , ” Robinson said .
The hijackings and security alerts also coincided with a widespread breakdown of Belfast ’s traffic lights system .
Police in a statement called that an “ unfortunate coincidence . ”

As described in Computer Book Sales as a Technology Trend Indicator , and our other posts on the State of the Computer Book Market we have an updated series of posts that show the whole market ’s final 2008 numbers .
Remember this data is from Bookscan ‘s weekly top 3,000 titles sold .
Bookscan measures actual cash register sales in bookstores .
Simply put , if you buy a book in the United States , there ’s a high probability it will get recorded in this data .
Retailers such as Borders , Barnes & Noble , and Amazon make up the lion ’s share of these sales .
Book Market Performance
Before we get to the specifics of the computer book market , let ’s get some context by looking at the whole book market for the Week ending 12/28/2008 .
Everything that is printed , bound and sold like a book , from Harry Potter and The Tales of Beedle the Bard to Breaking Dawn and Outliers is represented in the table below .
Overall Book Market – EVERYTHING - Week Ending : 2008 -12-28
Category Sales ‘ 000 ’s Share YoY Adult Non-Fiction 10,411 36 % 25 % Adult Fiction 6,185 22 % 18 % Juvenile Non-Fiction 1,422 5 % 84 % Juvenile Fiction 6,271 22 % 72 % Other 4,264 15 % 8 % Computers 151 1 % - 8 % Total 28,553 100 % 30 %
As you can see , the computer market is only 1 % of total unit sales in bookstores and online retailers .
The Computer category was the only category down [ - 8 % ] year - over - year .
Immediately below is the year - on - year trend for the entire computer book market since 2004 , when we first obtained reliable data from Bookscan .
Please remember the data is for all publishers and NOT just O’Reilly .
The slightly - thicker red line represents the 2008 data .
Click on the image to get a larger view .
As you can see , the clear seasonal pattern we ’ve pointed out before still exists .
That is , we have a strong start that declines through the summer , spikes for the Fall ‘ Back to School season ’ and finishes strong .
The trend line for each year closely mirrors the year before , with remarkably consistent weekly ups and downs .
What you wo n’t see on this chart is that the computer book market cratered in 2001 , shrinking twenty percent a year for three years until it stabilized in 2004 at about half the size that it was in 2000 .
( We only have reliable data going back to 2004 . )
We are hoping that the cratering we experienced in the second half of 2008 will not be as pronounced or long as 2001 because the current economic conditions are not squarely for computer books centered around Tech .
That being said , 2008 was the worst performing year since we ’ve been collecting the Bookscan data .
The chart immediately below shows total units by year for the Computer book category .
As you can see , 2008 was the worst year for unit sale in the computer book market .
So what was the news in 2008 ?
The year got off to healthy start , but around July the sales trended downward and for the remainder of the year never rose above the equivalent week in 2007 .
In the first half of 2008 , the Market was up 67,000 units compared to 2007 but in the second half , 417,000 fewer units were sold in 2007 — so the overall market decreased by 350,000 units .
The majority of this shortfall happened during the fourth quarter of 2008 where nearly 300,000 fewer units were sold .
Another way to look at the market is with our Treemap visualization tool .
This tool helps us pick up on trends quickly , even when looking at thousands of books .
It works like this :
The size of a square shows the market share and relative size of a category , while the color shows the rate of change in sales .
Red is down , and green is up , with the intensity of the color representing the magnitude of the change .
The following screenshot of our treemap shows gains and losses by category , comparing the fourth quarter of 2008 with the fourth quarter of 2007 .
So what are all the boxes and colors telling us ?
First remember this is comparing the last quarter of 2008 with the last quarter of 2007 .
This snapshot of the treemap looks like a blood bath — which again shows that in the fourth quarter of 2008 the computer book market took a significant beating .
There were very few brights spots [ bright green ] during the last quarter of 2008 .
In the fourth quarter of 2007 , Microsoft ’s Vista was finally getting some success in the market and topics on Web 2.0 were emerging and selling well .
Those topics have now cratered , any “ silver lining ” found 2008 is thanks to Apple .
For the whole of 2008 , Mac OS was the number one growth area for units , followed by Mobile Phone [ iPhone ] followed by Social Media , and Mac Programming .
Apple has enjoyed an amazing ride the past few years and , in my opinion , for good reasons .
Another area to watch is the RIA space , with entries from Adobe [ Flex / Flash / Air ] and Microsoft [ Silverlight ] .
Silverlight has gone from a spec on the Treemap to a fair - sized bright green box .
Its appearance and growth is reminiscent of Sharepoint a few years back .
I find it useful to organize the trends into classifications that are High Growth Categories [ Bright Green ] , Moderate Growth Categories [ Dark Green to Black ] , Categories to Watch [ all colors ] , and Down Categories [ Red to Bright Red ] .
Most of these descriptions are self - explanatory except perhaps the Categories to Watch .
This group contains titles that we ’ve found are not typically susceptible to seasonal swings , as well as areas that we have are on our editorial Radar .
If there are categories you want to get on our watch list , please let me know .
The table below highlights and explains some of the data from the chart above , although the data below is for all of 2008 .
The Share column shows the total market share of that category , and the ROC column shows the Rate of Change .
So , for example , you can see that Mac OS books represent 4.07 % of the entire computer book market , and were up 28.70 % .
High Growth Share ROC Notes Mac Programming 0.46 % 85.23 % Small catgory led by several titles centered on Cocoa and Objective C for developing iPhone Apps .

It is a simple enough question : who bought the credit - default swaps that American International Group sold during the housing bubble ?
And at this point — after Bailout No. 4 , with the government handing A.I.G. another $ 30 billion to go with the previous $ 150 billion — you would think that the taxpayers would have the right to know that information .
Is it Goldman ?
Royal Bank of Scotland ?
The Irish banks that are on the verge of collapse ?
What happened to all that transparency the new administration keeps talking about ?
In the wake of my column on Saturday , I received a number of comments here at Executive Suite along the lines of this one :
Joe , I ’m trying to find info re : what percentage of these credit - default swaps are “ owned ” by foreign investors , what percent owned by banks , what percent owned by pension funds .
( And if banks are owning them , as your column suggests , which ones ? )
Seems to me … it ’d be helpful to know as A.I.G. continues to be bailed out where exactly the $ $$ is going .
I ’m assuming much of it ( most ? all ? ) is going to cover their CDSs .
Why this is important ?
To keep the spin machines honest .
Thanks .
This strikes me as a completely legitimate question .
After all , the reason A.I.G. is being propped up is that the government fears that if the company defaulted , the counterparties would suddenly be faced with tens of billions of dollars worth of unacknowledged losses — and they would go bust .
It would make the Lehman fiasco look like a garden party .
As Nouriel Roubini put it on CNBC recently ( I ’m paraphrasing ) :
It ’s not a bailout of A.I.G. ; it ’s a bailout of the counterparties .
What ’s more , a fair amount of what A.I.G. was doing was pretty sleazy behavior , using credit - default swaps to help banks evade regulatory capital requirements .
And yet when newspapers like this one have requested the information , they have been ignored or turned down .
The answer , as I understand it , is that A.I.G. views these as “ confidential transactions , ” and the government ( as per usual ? ) is going along with that rationale .
One government official told me that if the federal government divulged the names of the counterparties it would amount to a violation of the Trade Secrets Act — unless the counterparties agreed to it , which they never will .
Pretty unsatisfying , is n’t it ?
Gobs of tax money is going to bail out unnamed companies — and yet we are n’t allowed to know who they are , and are supposed to take it all on faith .
You know those awful cases you read about every once in a while where a child dies in a troubled home — and then the state health department wo n’t divulge any information out of “ privacy concerns ” ?
This strikes me as the financial equivalent of those cases .
As excuses go , it sure is convenient .

Advertisement Thousands of people have attended a series of rallies in Northern Ireland to show their anger at the murders of two soldiers and a policeman .
Silent protests took place in Belfast , Lisburn , Newry , Downpatrick and Londonderry .
A peace vigil has also been held in Craigavon , County Armagh , near the site where Constable Stephen Paul Carroll was shot dead on Monday .
Two people are still being questioned over the murder of the 48 - year - old .
Rallies Speaking in Belfast , Eugene McGlone of the Unite union , which helped organise the rallies , described the turnout as " very heartening " .
Watch helicopter footage of Belfast protest " There was probably in excess of 10,000 people , " he said .
" There were I suppose some apprehensions on the part of some of our people as to whether or not we would get a crowd out at such short notice . "
Craigavon : City of hope and fear Troubles became rallying cry
In Londonderry , Inspector John Burrows said everyone in the police service appreciated the public 's support .
" We are massively grateful for the people of Derry who 've turned out to support the police , " he said .
" They have come to show solidarity , I believe , with the police and to send a very clear message out to the people who killed Constable Stephen Carroll and the two soldiers that they do not represent them . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has sent words of support to MPs who held a vigil outside Westminster in support of the peace rallies held in Northern Ireland .
Conservative MP
Sir Patrick Cormack , chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs committee , said the demonstration at Westminster showed " our resolve to stand with the people against violence " .
" We have been deeply moved by what has happened this week , but we were totally revolted by the appalling murders , but out of that tragedy a new strength has come , " he said .
In Dublin , Taoiseach Brian Cowen said those who carried out the attacks were a " tiny and unrepresentative group of evil people who have no mandate and no support for their actions " .
Pope Benedict XVI has added his voice to the condemnation , calling the murders " abominable acts of terrorism " .
Standing in silence for peace

A reward of £ 100,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killers of Constable Carroll and two soldiers has been offered by the Sun newspaper in conjunction with the Crimestoppers charity .
Dissident republican group , the Continuity IRA , said it shot Constable Carroll at Lismore Manor , in Craigavon , on Monday .
On Saturday , sappers Mark Quinsey , 23 , from Birmingham , and Patrick Azimkar , 21 , from London , were shot at Massereene Army base , Antrim .
The Real IRA said they killed the soldiers , who died in a hail of bullets as they accepted a pizza delivery at about 2120 GMT .
Four men were also injured in the attack .
One of them is in a critical condition and another is seriously ill .
A youth aged 17 and a 37 - year - old man remain in police custody for questioning in connection with the murder of Constable Carroll .
' Increased threat '
There were minor disturbances in Craigavon on Tuesday night , where wheeled bins were set on fire after the police raids .
Meanwhile , serving and former police officers due to give evidence to the Robert Hamill inquiry have been granted temporary anonymity .
The ruling was made following Constable Carroll 's murder and what the inquiry chairman said was the " increased security threat " to police officers in Northern Ireland .
Police chiefs from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic are to meet on Thursday to assess the security threat posed by dissident republicans .
Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde and Garda Siochána Commissoner Fachtna Murphy will meet in Belfast .
British and Irish ministers met for a security summit at Hillsborough Castle in County Down on Tuesday , where they pledged the attacks would not be allowed to derail the peace process .

* Telenor says will not block Pirate Bay
* Says sees no legal grounds for demand to block
* Says does not condone pirating or illegal file sharing
( Adds details , quotes , background , share price )
OSLO , March 2 ( Reuters ) - Norwegian telecom group Telenor TEL.OL will not block access to the Swedish file - sharing website The Pirate Bay , despite demands from representatives of the entertainment industry , Telenor said on Monday .
Telenor said that a demand from international and Norwegian music and film industry associations to block access to The Pirate Bay had no legal grounds and Internet service providers ( ISPs ) could not be held liable for actions by Internet users .
Sites like The Pirate Bay allow people to download songs , movies and computer games without paying .
“ Asking an ISP to control and assess what Internet users can and cannot download is just as wrong as asking the post office to open and read letters and decide what should and should not be delivered , ” Telenor said in a statement .
The entertainment industry is suing for damages in Sweden where four men linked to The Pirate Bay were charged last year by prosecutors for conspiracy to break copyright law .
The Pirate Bay enables Internet users to find files available for swapping , and the case in Sweden is being watched as a test of the entertainment industry ’s ability to protect copyright against file sharing by Internet users .
It pits entertainment industry giants such as Warner Bros TWX.N , MGM , Columbia Pictures 6758.T , 20th Century Fox NWSA.O , Sony BMG , Universal GE.N and EMI against a tiny group created in 2003 , which says it is not responsible for what material is exchanged .
Telenor said it saw “ no legal basis ” for the demand for ISPs to control or assess the content that users download .
“ At the same time , Telenor does not condone pirating of material and illegal file sharing , ” Telenor said in the statement .
“ We comply with all relevant laws and regulations and can see no legal basis for any ISP to act in the interests of digital intellectual property rights holders by blocking individual websites , ” Ragnar Kaarhus , head of Telenor Norway , said in the statement .
In February , a Danish court ordered Telenor ’s Denmark - based ISP Tele2 to shut its customers ’ access to Pirate Bay .
Lawyers for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , the Norwegian videogram association Norsk Videogramforening and the Norwegian Film Distributors Association have demanded Telenor block access in Norway , Telenor said .
“ The problem is not the ISPs , rather the rights holders themselves , ” Telenor said , noting that there had been successful efforts to protect downloadable content for sale , such as mobile phone ringtones and games .
Telenor shares traded down 3.56 percent at 35.20 crowns by 1516 GMT , slightly underperforming a weak Oslo bourse .OSEBX .

Con Ed Plans New York Solar Project
March 9th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
New York City utility Consolidated Edison wants to install a 12 megawatt pilot solar project in the Big Apple .
Con Ed filed its plans with the New York State Public Service Commission late last week .
the 18 - month project would generate energy for homes , businesses and Con Ed buildings .
The utility said 1 MW powers about 1,000 homes .
That ’s a tiny fraction of the 3 million customers Con Ed serves .
The project would cost as much as $ 25 million , the utility said .
Con
Ed says it will seek to use stimulus appropriations , federal and New York City tax incentives , and grants from the New York State Energy Research Development Authority ( NYSERDA ) to help offset the cost .
If approved , Con Ed says the project would break down this way :
5 MW from large installations of 200 kilowatts ( kW ) or more ;
5 MW from smaller installations , primarily for residential or small to medium commercial customers ; and
2 MW on Con Edison facilities in daytime peak - electric use neighborhoods .
While this effort is tiny compared to other programs around the country , it ’s a start .
And it ’s more evidence that solar power is n’t useful just in the sun belt or the desert .
Con
Ed hopes the 18 - month long project would help it study usage and load patterns , gauge customer interest in solar , and spur the creation of larger solar projects .
In New York , where complaints about taxes and the cost of doing business are common , it will be intriguing to see if consumers and businesses line up for the chance to make a dent in their long - term energy costs .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Majel Barrett Roddenberry wife of Gene Roddenderry gives the vulcan sign to the crowd at the end of the show as part of the " Beam Me Up Scotty ... One More Time , The James Doohan Farewell Star Trek convention & Tribute " at the convention in Hollywood August 29 , 2004 .
REUTERS / Gene Blevins
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ Star Trek ” creator Gene Roddenberry and late wife Majel Barrett Roddenberry are about to go on their final mission .
The Roddenberrys ’ ashes will be shot into space in about a year and a half , in accordance with their wishes , memorial spaceflight company Celestis Inc said on Monday .
Majel Barrett Roddenberry , an actress who had roles in nearly every “ Star Trek ” television show and movie since the original , died on December 18 at age 76 .
She had been married to Gene Roddenberry for 22 years when he died in 1991 , and she was often called “ The First Lady of Star Trek . ”
Celestis sent a portion of Gene Roddenberry ’s cremated remains into space on a rocket flight in 1997 , along with the remains of other individuals , including psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary .
That flight was sent into orbit around the Earth and eventually disintegrated upon reentering the atmosphere .
But Celestis will launch both Roddenberrys ’ remains into deep space and the spacecraft will not fall back into Earth ’s orbit , said Susan Schonfeld , a spokeswoman for the company .
The spacecraft will be loaded onto a commercial rocket and sent on a deep space trajectory once it breaches Earth ’s atmosphere , she said .
Majel Barrett Roddenberry said before her death that she wanted her remains launched into space with those of her late husband , Schonfeld said .
The launch will not happen for a year and a half because Celestis needs time to prepare .
In the meantime , fans can send a tribute message for the Roddenberrys at Celestis.com , and those messages will be put into a digital file and sent into space along with the Roddenberrys ’ remains .

A police IT forensics specialist has had some of his personal details leak via The Pirate Bay .
Jim Keyzer , who led the investigation into the popular tracker , has just discovered that his girlfriend 's email account was compromised by hackers , who obtained several passwords and other personal documents .
The torrent , titled “ Where did the money come from ? ” exposes some of the policeman ’s passwords and account details , including some documents relating to a house he recently bought .
The title hints at Keyzer ’s short employment at Warner Bros .
while he was working on the police investigation , but this implied link seems a little tenuous .
According to the release info the documents were released by the ‘ Keyzer Defender ’ and were obtained from Keyzer ’s girlfriend ’s Hotmail account .
“ These attachments are taken from mails in the Hotmail account belonging to Jim Keyzer ’s girlfriend .
Also included are login credentials and some of Jim ’s passwords , ” it reads .
Keyzer has contacted the Pirate Bay team and said that he found it unfortunate that his girlfriend was hacked because of his involvement with The Pirate Bay case .
He did not ask for the torrent to be removed , which shows that he learned at least one thing during the investigation .
Release Notes .
Keyzer became the subject of some controversy when he started working for Warner Bros. before the Pirate Bay investigation was closed .
After a short stay at the movie company Keyzer terminated his leave of absence , and returned to the IT Crime Unit in Stockholm .
The Pirate Bay crew were not amused by Keyzer ’s dual role , and filed a complaint with the police .
The police looked into the case briefly but decided not to investigate it because there was “ no reason to believe that a crime has been committed by anyone employed by the police . ”
During the Pirate Bay trial Keyzer inexplicably disappeared but now weeks later , his girlfriend appears to have been dragged into the dispute .
The Pirate Bay certainly provokes a certain passion in their fanbase , and some are clearly prepared to go to extreme lengths to show that their beloved site is not to be messed with .
The governor 's daughter also says telling her parents she was pregnant was " harder than labor "
Hoping to set an example for others with her own experience , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ’s daughter , Bristol Palin , would now like to become an advocate for preventing teen pregnancy .
“ Everyone should wait 10 years , ” the younger Palin told Greta Van Susteren on a FOX News segment that aired Monday night .
“ I hope people learn from my story It ’s so much easier if you ’re married , have a house and career .
It ’s not a situation you want to strive for . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Palin , 18 , also said in the interview – her first since the teen made headlines last summer during Sarah Palin ’s GOP vice - presidential campaign – that her mother ’s view of abstinence , especially in regard to teenagers , is “ not realistic at all . ”
Bristol further stated that although her mother is an outspoken Right to Life advocate , “ It was my choice to have the baby .
It does n’t matter what my mom ’s views are on it .
It was my decision . ”
Recounting how she first informed her parents , Todd and Sarah Palin , of her condition , Bristol said she gathered her boyfriend , Levi Johnston , and her best friend , but that getting the words out of her mouth was “ harder than labor . ”
The friend broke the news to the parents , said Bristol , who also described Johnston as a “ hands - on dad . ”
She added , “ Eventually we ’d like to get married .
As for her new situation , “ I like being a mom , ” said Bristol .
“ I love it , just seeing him smile and stuff .
It ’s awesome . ”

A Sudanese government minister has confirmed reports of an air raid in eastern Sudan earlier this year .
The minister , Mabrook Mubarak Saleem , told an Arabic news channel that many people had been killed in the strike , said to have taken place last month .
Israeli officials have not commented publicly on reports that their planes may have been involved .
Israel 's Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , did not confirm any raid but said Israel hit everywhere to stop terror .
" That was true in the north , " said Mr Olmert , " and it was true in the south ...
Those who need to know , know there is no place where Israel cannot operate . "
Giving a speech in the coastal town of Herzliya , the outgoing prime minister said : " We operate in many places near and far , and carry out strikes in a manner that strengthens our deterrence . "
The CBS television network said it had been told by American officials that a strike by Israeli planes in January had succeeded in preventing weapons from Sudan reaching Gaza .
Mr Mabrook Mubarak Saleem said those killed in the air raid had been civilians from a number of African countries .
' Nod and wink '
The BBC's Paul Wood in Jerusalem says Israel 's response is following a traditional pattern , set when it attacked a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007 , of first refusing to confirm an alleged strike and then giving a nod and a wink .
What we are getting now from Mr Olmert is clearly the nod and the wink , our correspondent says .
Much informed comment has appeared in the Israeli media , he adds , including the view of a retired general that Israel would not have had to violate anyone 's airspace to carry out the strike , if it did .
Nonetheless it was a long way to fly and the assumption is that this was a serious target , our correspondent says , and that these were weapons that could have changed the game in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants .
They could have included surface to air missiles or perhaps missiles with a 70 km ( 44 - mile ) range that would have enabled militants to hit Tel Aviv from Gaza , our correspondent adds .

In Buffalo , where officials said the problem had reached “ epidemic ” proportions in recent months , the city sued 37 banks last year , claiming they were responsible for the deterioration of at least 57 abandoned homes ; the city chose a sampling of houses to include in the lawsuit , even though the banks had walked away from many more foreclosures .
So far , five banks have settled .
In Kansas City , Rachel Foley , a lawyer who handles housing cases , said bank walkaways were “ a rare occurrence two to three years ago . ”
“ We ’re seeing them dumped more and more at the moment , ” she said .
Experts suggest the bank walkaways are most visible in states where foreclosures are processed through the courts and therefore tend to be more transparent .
Other states , like Indiana and New York , have court - mandated foreclosures , but roughly half of the states allow foreclosures to proceed without court intervention , making it difficult to accurately count the number of bank walkaways in recent months .

The soft housing market and the vandalism that often occurs when a house sits empty are the two main factors influencing the mortgage holders ’ decisions to walk away , said Larry Rothenberg , a lawyer for Weltman , Weinberg & Reis , one of the larger creditors ’ rights firms in the country .
“ Oftentimes when the foreclosure starts out , it ’s a viable property , ” Mr. Rothenberg said , “ but by the time it gets to a sheriff ’s sale , it might not have enough value to justify further expense .
We ’ve always had cases where property was vandalized or lost value , but they were rare compared to these times . ”
The problem seems most acute at the bottom of the market  houses that were inexpensive to begin with  and with investment properties , where investors and banks want speedy closure by writing off bad loans as losses .
Banks and investors typically lose 40 percent to 50 percent of their investment on every foreclosure .

Barack Obama has now spent 50 days in the White House .
Instead of waiting for the standard first 100 days evaluation , I thought I ’d get a head start and give some early thoughts .
However , when I think about it , I realize it ’s extremely difficult to say if Obama is doing a good job .
He ’s done some good things , such as erasing the federal ban on funding embryonic stem cell research , but is he making smart economic decisions ?
Not even the top economists can reach a consensus , making it nearly impossible for the average person to know for sure .
So maybe the best way to evaluate Obama is to look at the most irrational part of the populace – like the 10 % who thought he was Muslim during the campaign – and figure the opposite of their opinion is true .
Luckily , I know the perfect place to find these folks : Conservapedia !
Looking at its entry on Barack Obama , the suspicion is that he ’s still secretly a Muslim .
Here is a small selection of its evidence ( Conservapedia is user - edited , meaning the content is subject to change , though this is all accurate as of the time it was posted ) :
– Obama ’s background , education , and outlook are Muslim , and fewer than 1 % of Muslims convert to Christianity .
– Obama ’s middle name ( Hussein ) references Husayn , who was the grandson of Muhammad , which most Christians would not retain .
– Obama uses the Muslim Pakistani pronunciation for “ Pakistan ” rather than the common American one .
– Obama has chosen the Secret Service code name “ Renegade ” .
“ Renegade ” conventionally describes someone who goes against normal conventions of behavior , but its first usage was to describe someone who has turned from their religion .
It is a word derived from the Spanish renegado , meaning “ Christian turned Muslim . ”
If you ’re somehow not convinced Obama is a Muslim , well , maybe you ’re right .
According to Conservapedia ’s “ Religion of Barack Hussein Obama ” article , he might secretly be an atheist .
The proof :
– When he initially took the oath of office on Tuesday , January 20 , 2009 , Obama misspoke ( possibly due to Chief Justice Roberts not being prepared ) and out of an “ abundance of caution ” the oath was retaken the next day .
CNN.com noted , “ Though a Bible was used in Tuesday ’s oath , one was not used for Wednesday ’s . ”
– Since assuming office Obama has not attended a single church function .
I wish he were an atheist , but that evidence is laughably weak .
Obama is a Christian , and it ’s as simple as that .
And even if he were an atheist or a Muslim , it would n’t mean that he ’s an evil man who wants to destroy the American way of life .
But it Conservapedia land , non-Christian means un-American .
Moving from religion to the economic issues , Conservapedia hammers Obama on pretty much everything he has done so far .
It says his “ response to economic crisis closely parallels that of Herbert Hoover in 1930 - 31 in dealing with the Great Depression . ”
Furthermore , Obama ’s 2010 budget “ will likely lead to a decrease in charitable giving ” and “ will raise consumer energy prices . ”
And to top it off , he ’s a scandal - ridden Leftist .
Alright then , I think I can evaluate Obama ’s first 50 days after my enlightenment from Conservapedia :
He ’s doing a fantastic job .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
The Israeli military plans to investigate claims by Israeli soldiers that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel 's recent 22 - day offensive in the Gaza Strip .
Many Palestinian civilians were killed after being caught up in the 22 - day conflict in Gaza .
The claims were made by Israeli soldiers who were graduates of a premilitary course at an Israeli college .
They were first reported in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Thursday .
At a gathering at the college after the Gaza operation , the newspaper reported , soldiers gave accounts that ran counter to persistent claims by the military that " Israeli troops observed a high level of moral behavior during the operation . "
The accounts were taken down by the head of the college 's premilitary program , Danny Zamir .
He told Haaretz that he did not know what the soldiers were going to say and that what they heard " shocked us . "
According to Haaretz , Zamir passed on the soldiers ' comments to the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff , saying he " feared a serious moral failure in the IDF . "
Contacted by CNN , Zamir said he would not comment to the foreign media on the matter , but he told an Israeli television network that " what was most disturbing in this matter was the perception that they give in certain units that the normative atmosphere was [ that ] all is permissible when you are dealing with Palestinian homes , property and , in the most extreme cases , also their lives . "
He said that a full transcript of the soldiers ' comments would be appearing in the Haaretz newspaper .
Portions of the transcripts appeared in the Thursday and Friday editions of Haaretz , and more is expected in coming days .
In one account , a squad leader from a brigade serving in Gaza described an incident in which he said an elderly Palestinian woman was shot and killed at the orders of a company commander :
" One of our officers , a company commander , saw someone coming on some road -- a woman , an old woman .
She was walking along pretty far away , but close enough so you could take out someone you saw there .
If she were suspicious , not suspicious -- I do n't know .
In the end , he sent people up to the roof , to take her out with their weapons .
From the description of this story , I simply felt it was murder in cold blood . "
According to the Haaretz transcript , the squad leader protested the rules of engagement , which he said allowed soldiers to fire on Palestinian homes without giving residents a warning .
After the rules were changed , his soldiers complained that " we should kill everyone there [ in the center of Gaza ] .
Everyone there is a terrorist . "
According to Haaretz , the squad leader went on to say that , " You do not get the impression from the officers that there is any logic to it , but they wo n't say anything .
To write ' death to the Arabs ' on the walls , to take family pictures and spit on them , just because you can .
I think this is the main thing :
To understand how much the IDF has fallen in the realm of ethics , really .
It 's what I 'll remember the most . "
None of the Israeli soldiers quoted in the Haaretz articles admitted to taking part first - hand in the killing of Palestinian civilians , but the published accounts illustrate some of the soldiers ' confusion and disagreements about the rules of engagement during an operation in which enemy combatants were often indistinguishable from civilians .
Responding to the squad commander 's account of the shooting of the elderly Palestinian woman , one of his fellow soldiers replied , " [ His ] descriptions are accurate , But it 's possible to understand where this is coming from .
And that woman , you do n't know whether she 's ... she was n't supposed to be there , because there were announcements and there were bombings .
Logic says she should n't be there .
The way you describe it , as murder in cold blood , that is n't right .
It 's known that they have lookouts and that sort of thing . "
In a statement released Thursday , the Israeli military spokesman 's office said Gen. Avichai Mendelblit , the Israeli military 's advocate general , had ordered an immediate investigation that will " examine " what was said by the soldiers .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Army Radio on Thursday that " Israel has the most moral army in the world " and that the accounts will be checked carefully .
In addition , a coalition of Israeli human rights groups called on Israeli Attorney General Menachem Mazuz to reconsider his refusal to establish an independent investigative body to examine the military 's actions during the Gaza campaign , known as " Operation Cast Lead . "
The groups -- The Association for Civil Rights in Israel , Bimkom , B'tselem , Gisha , Hamoked , The Public Committee Against Torture , Yesh Din , Physicians for Human Rights , Rabbis for Human Rights , Adalah , and Itach -- Women Lawyers for Social Justice -- said accounts by Palestinians raise the possibility that acts by the military were worse than previously suspected .

Incipient sex chromosomes have been found in New Zealand 's eponymous export , the kiwifruit .
Researchers writing in the open access journal BMC Genomics have mapped the kiwifruit genome and pin-pointed the sex - determining locus .
It has previously been suggested that , among the kiwifruit plant 's small ( < 1 um ) chromosomes , lie a pair of X /Y - like chromosomes that result in its dioecism .
Now a team led by Lena Fraser and colleagues at the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research has confirmed this suggestion by mapping the genome of the golden kiwifruit .
The genome has been mapped with 644 microsatellite markers from three genetic libraries ( two from the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research and one from the University of Udine , Italy ) .
These showed 29 linkage groups , represented expression of 587 genes , and revealed that sex - linked sequence characterised amplified region ( SCAR ) markers and the flower sex phenotype were mapping to a subtelomeric region that bears the hallmarks of an early sex- determining locus .
The mapping of this sex - determining locus to a subtelomeric region fits with previous published work on chromosome pairing and also the authors own observations .
Whilst studying kiwifruit karyotypes , the research team observed that in the pollen mother cells undergoing meiosis one of the 29 pairs of chromosomes did not pair tightly in a region close to one end .
An absence of pairing means that the male - specific region on the Y is inherited as a unit , maintaining sexual dimorphism .
Based on the genetic structure they have now defined for this non-recombining sex - determining region , the authors suggest that at least two linked genes on the putative Y chromosome are responsible for dioecy : one suppressing pistil formation and one for pollen development .
Of more than 60 species of Actinidia ( kiwifruit ) , only two have been widely cultivated so far , and there is potential for breeding new varieties .
All Actinida species are dioecious , and the authors say they are likely to have similar sex- determining regions .
The authors work in producing female , male and consensus genetic linkage maps for the golden kiwifruit , A. chinensis and identifying the sex - determining region may provide the key to fully exploiting this relatively recent cultivar .
According to Fraser , ' The gene - rich map we have constructed will be a valuable resource for quantitative trait loci analyses to identify markers related to traits of importance in breeding new and novel kiwifruit for the markets of the world . '

These dusty old monetarists take a lot of winding up , but by Jingo they 're lethal assassins once the spring is released .
Whether Mervyn King 's appearance before the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday was a warning shot across Gordon Brown 's bows or a formal declaration of war , not since Geoffrey Howe launched his cricketing metaphor counterstrike against Margaret Thatcher have we seen so devastating an attack on the judgement of a serving Prime Minister .
The Bank of England Governor , another deceptively lugubrious - looking buffer blinking amiably away behind the thick specs , avoided any hint of melodrama and was all the deadlier for the deadpan delivery .
What he said , in words measured for impact with exquisite finesse , and in a tone of studied dullness , was this : " I think the fiscal position in the UK is not one where we could say ' Well , why do n't we just engage in another significant round of fiscal expansion ? "
What he meant was : " We 're already bankrupt and I 'm not sitting idly by while this deranged wastrel leaves future generations in bondage to rampant inflation and crippling debt to save his political hide . "
Or as Jeremy Thorpe almost put it of Harold MacMillan , greater love hath no man than that he lay down his country 's future for his life .

A week today , that heavily - trailed G20 conference will be held in London .
Even before Merv the Swerve bowled his inswinging yorker , the cosmetic absurdity of this pow wow was transparent .
We are asked to anticipate it as the second Breton Woods , despite the fact that the G20 leaders are meeting for one day when the first BW lasted three weeks in July 1944 .
The notion that anything more could emerge from so brief a meeting than a meaninglessly bland and abstract communiqué – written and agreed before the event as tradition dictates – was always so foolish that the meeting should strictly be brought forward a day to 1 April .
Once the French and Germans expressed their disdain for any further stimulus packages , however , it took on the pre-emptive flavour of the phantasmal second UN resolution fiasco ... a fight between the powerhouses of continental Europe and the Anglo - US alliance in which the battle lines were immovably drawn long in advance of the skirmishing .
And now ?
Now it 's so much worse for Gordon that you could fall to your knees and sob for him .
One week today , the self - appointed financial bridgehead between the EU and America – the exact role Mr Tony Blair played to such splendid effect over Iraq – will sit down for what he apparently regards as his last throw of the electoral dice , and have little choice but to argue for what his own central banker has dismissed as a long - range suicide note for the British economy .
His only option is to perform a historic U - turn and adopt the more monetarist approach propounded by the Tories and a Governor with whom Gordon , seldom a stranger to raging paranoia , must imagine Messrs Cameron and Osborne are in league .
But it 's not just the Tories and Mr King who are cuddling close on this issue .
His own Chancellor is snuggling up to the Guv as well .
In the aftermath of the Northern Rock debacle to which his response was so languid , Nos 10 and 11 were as one in briefing against Mr King .
Now the allegiances between the three fiscal superpowers have shifted , a bit like those between Eastasia , Oceania and Eurasia in 1984 .
With Darling and King united against him , Gordon faces his ultimate nightmare .
There he is in Room 101 , and the wire mesh holding the rats back is rising fast .
Small wonder he 's frantically trying to ratchet up the terror of terrorism , that classically Blairite diversionary tactic .
But it wo n't divert many of us for long .
Supplying the Newspeak tutorial , meanwhile , is the Chief Secretary to the Treasury .
In denying any rift , Yvette Cooper parsed the Governor with linguistic suppleness worthy of the Employee of the Month badge in the Ministry of Truth .
" What he [ King ] said , " she interpreted , " is we need to take a sensible approach , which we always do . "
That , bless her , is precisely what he did n't say .
What he did say , in a previous select committee appearance , is , " We entered this crisis with levels of borrowing which were too high and that made it difficult " ( his translation of Jilted John 's " Gordon is a moron " ) .
He further rued that in 1997 , soon after granting the Bank the independence Mr King so lavishly indulged on Tuesday ( oh the vicious irony that Gordon 's most celebrated masterstroke should mutate into the loudest of death knells ) , the then Chancellor stripped the Bank of its regulatory powers in creating the tremendously effective Financial Services Authority .
The Governor , then , is now on record expressly blaming Gordon for deepening and widening the slump he has thankfully ceased assuring us Britain is uniquely well placed to withstand ; and advising him – instructing him , really – on no account to sub - prime mortgage our long - term economic future for short - term electoral gain .
Much like his namesake , the in - form and imaginatively nicknamed darts star Mervyn " the King " King , the Governor found the bullseye with laconic ease , and at the very moment Gordon was flying off to lecture foreign leaders about the imperative for greater stimuli he is betting the farm on pressing at the G20 next week .
That the PM is now pulling in the diametrically opposite direction to the Bank , not to mention the implications of this tug - of - war for sterling , the forthcoming Budget and the Government 's general credibility , will take a while to filter through to an electorate that takes a wisely laissez - faire approach to charting the economic meltdown in tedious detail .
But filter through , in the usual osmotic way , it will .
If Gordon , ever - more remotely marooned on his fantasy island of vast global influence and unfettered domestic command , backs down and muffles the stimulus hunting cry next week , it will leave him looking , to borrow from the resignation of yet another embittered former Chancellor , in office but not in power .
If he does n't – if he ploughs on with the demand for even more colossal spending and debt – he will be at war with the Bank of England , and at DefCon Two with his next - door neighbour .
There is no obvious way out of this one .
He has been on his electoral death bed for ages , of course , ever since that definitive week in October 2007 when he cluck - cluck - clucked his way out of going to the country .
But this may well be seen as the week he ran out of appeals for clemency , because the only quantative easing available to him now appears to involve the child - proof lid on that bottle of Downing Street strychnine .

In a repeat performance of last year , security researcher Charlie Miller arrived at the CanSecWest conference this week with a prepared exploit to use in cracking Safari running on Mac OS X .
Unsurprisingly , Miller was able to use his exploit to immediately win the event 's " Pwn2Own " contest , generating headlines that suggested that Macs are inherently less secure , despite the fact that every browser involved in the contest failed on the first day .
This year 's contest arranged for two test computers .
According to the CanSecWest event 's official website , which is oddly littered with typos , the " Browsers and Associated Text PAltform " [ sic ] were a Sony Vaio PC running a prerelease Windows 7 beta with Internet Explorer 8 , Firefox , and Google 's new Chrome browser , and a MacBook running Safari and Firefox .
In each of the three days of the contest , the exploit rules were intended to be progressively relaxed , starting only with exploits that attacked the browser itself , then adding Flash , Java , .
Net and QuickTime to the mix on day two , and then " popular apps such as Acrobat Reader " on the third day .
Finding vulnerabilities
The Pwn2Own contest is being presented as a shootout between Mac and Windows browsers .
Last year 's contest also included Linux , but attendees with the ability to crack Linux " didnât want to put the work into developing the exploit code that would be required to win the contest , " according to a report by IDG .
That fact highlights that , in reality , the platforms and browsers involved are n't targeted by a series of equal attacks .
Instead , researchers arrive with exploits they hope to use against vulnerabilities they are aware of in specific platforms or browsers , but have not yet reported .
Were they to report the exploits in advance , they would be patched by the vendor .
There 's no money in that , so the contest provides an incentive to report vulnerabilities .
In exchange for the winning prize , Miller granted the reporting rights to the discovered flaw in Safari to TippingPointâs Zero Day Initiative , which will coordinate the handling of the disclosure and the patch release process with Apple .
When a vulnerability is reported to Apple , the company credits the discoverer with finding the problem when issuing a patch for it .
Last year , Miller 's winning attack on Safari actually targeted the open source Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library used by WebKitâs JavaScript engine , an exploit he also made headlines with for using against the iPhone .
Apple 's extensive use of open source software makes it far easier for researchers to discover exploits for at their leisure , compared to closed proprietary software .
It was n't Apple 's proprietary code in Safari that was cracked .
At the same time , proprietary , closed code is n't invulnerable due to its opaque " security through obscurity . "
Windows Vista was cracked in last year 's contest due to a flaw in the Adobe Flash plugin , which is not open source but which security experts were still able to exploit .
Patching vulnerabilities
At the same time , Apple 's use of open source also enables the company to issues more security patches and operating system updates than Microsoft does , according to a study of Windows and Mac OS X releases conducted by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology .
That group found that in the years between 2002 and 2007 , Apple released 815 patches compared to 678 by Microsoft .
In that timeframe , Apple shipped five paid reference releases of Mac OS X ( Jaguar , Panther , Tiger , Tiger for Intel , and Leopard ) and 33 free updates , including eight for Jaguar , nine for Panther , eleven for Tiger , and one for Leopard , a total of 38 significant feature and security releases , excluding Mac OS X Server , the iPhone , and standalone security patches .
In contrast , Microsoft only released a total of seven updates over that period , including Windows XP SP1 and SP2 ; Windows Server 2003 , SP1 , R2 , and SP2 ; and Windows Vista .
In the year since , Microsoft has released two service packs for Vista and one for XP .
Apple has released five additional free updates for Leopard , again not counting Mac OS X Server patches or iPhone updates .
" Simplifying security to the point of uselessness "
The oversimplification of the Pwn2 Own contest 's results by the media has resulted in criticism of how the contest is portrayed and conducted .
The Pwn2Own contest is " simplifying security to the point of uselessness , " according to comments by Jeff Jones , the director of Microsoft 's security group .
Last year , Jones addressed CanSecWest in a blog post which stated , " I do n't really care for ' hack the box ' contests .
If a machine does n't get hacked , it does not mean it is n't breakable .
If it does get hacked , it just shows us what we already know - any machine can be broken under the right circumstances .
So , do n't read too much into the PWN 2 OWN results .
I do n't . "
Last year 's contest was also distorted by the arbitrary timing of patches , with Miller 's successful exploit for Safari happening to miss Apple 's patch cycle , while other researchers armed with exploits for Windows Vista were stymied by the last minute application of the then - new Vista Service Pack 1 .
The contest is also somewhat removed from reality due to the fact that it pits the current release of Mac OS X with new versions of Windows that do not reflect what the vast majority of Windows PC users are actually running .
Last year , Vista was only in use by a small fraction of early adopters ( and even now , less than a quarter of the installed base is using it ) , and SP1 was so new and problematic that PC World was advising users not to install it until " the wrinkles are ironed out . "
This year , the use of the prerelease Windows 7 operating system , which security researchers have had limited access and time to study , combined with the fact that Microsoft expressly warns users not to use it in production environments , tends to create the impression that Pwn2 Own is more about theoretical games than real world security issues relevant to end users .
Security in the real world
The real world security problems that affect today 's Windows users relate to the fact that there are not only more discovered flaws on Windows , but that these flaws are being actively exploited to develop viruses , spyware , adware , and other malware .
Further , there are vast numbers of machines that are not promptly updated with the patches that do exist , resulting in fleets of vulnerable botnets that actively distribute new attacks to other systems .
These two problems aggravate each other to create the Windows security crisis .
While pundits like to talk about numbers of discovered vulnerabilities , often failing to correctly compare similar code on each side ( with Mac OS X inheriting the vulnerability counts in optional open source server programs , Java , and other components that are not considered on the Windows side ) , the real problem is active exploits .
Mac OS
X continues to have no real viruses , while Windows users continue to be plagued by viruses , adware , and other security problems .
At the same time however , the tech media is promoting the CanSecWest event as a " security shootout , " with at least one report noting that browsers on the Windows box were " still standing " after Miller successfully applied his exploit attack to the Mac , as if the Windows box had somehow successfully dodged Miller 's exploit rather than simply never having been aimed at by his open source attack .
IN THE SOUL - SEARCHING sparked by the financial meltdown , Americans have started to look askance at some of the habits and policies that had come to define our country .
Excessive consumption and living on credit are no longer seen as acceptable , let alone possible .
" Deregulation " is suddenly a dirty word .
Yet despite the housing crisis , one value , more deeply entrenched , remains sacrosanct : homeownership .
Irresponsible mortgages have been universally condemned , but it is still widely assumed that we all aspire to own homes - and that we all should aspire to own homes .
Homeowners are thought to be more engaged in their communities and to take better care of their houses and neighborhoods .
On a nearly subconscious level , buying a home is a central part of the American dream .
A picket fence may now be dispensable , but a house of one 's own is seen as the proper place to raise an American family - a prerequisite for stability , security , and adult life .
And for decades - but increasingly under the Clinton and Bush administrations - federal policies have encouraged citizens to achieve this goal .
But a growing chorus of economists and housing experts say that this mind - set , too , needs fundamental reform .
Owning a home is not right for everyone , they say :
In some ways it 's overrated , and it can even have harmful effects for individuals and society .
It is now glaringly clear that buying a home is a financial risk , not the surefire investment it is often perceived to be .
Widespread homeownership may also have a negative impact on the economy , because , among other reasons , displaced workers can't easily relocate to new jobs .
And some of the alleged rewards of homeownership , such as greater self - esteem , health , and civic engagement , have been called into question by research .
The government , critics argue , should focus on ensuring high - quality , affordable housing rather than promoting homeownership for its own sake .
" There 's no reason we should all be homeowners , " says Joseph Gyourko , a professor at the Wharton School of Business and coauthor of " Rethinking Federal Housing Policy . "
" Homeownership has a lot of benefits , but it has costs , too . "
According to this view , renting offers many advantages , and should be considered a viable long - term option for people of all ages and socioeconomic levels .
Renters enjoy flexibility and freedom from the responsibilities of maintenance .
Given the often overlooked costs and risks of homeownership , renting is in many cases a wise financial choice .
And the experience of a place like Switzerland - a well - functioning country with only about a 35 percent homeownership rate - suggests that rental housing per se does not unmoor society .
Some analysts propose abolishing or limiting the mortgage interest tax deduction , which provides substantial tax breaks for homeowners .
Others favor greater security for renters - such as laws making eviction more difficult - or tax deductions for renters , which a few states , such as Massachusetts , already offer .
The MacArthur Foundation has launched a major initiative to preserve affordable rental housing in 12 states , including Massachusetts .
In the recent stimulus legislation , advocates of renting successfully fought additional incentives for homeownership , and they continue to push for a " balanced " housing policy .
Certainly , homeownership still has staunch defenders .
Many stand by its psychological and social benefits , and consider a home to be a sound investment .
" It 's the single most significant source of wealth and most secure source of savings " for Americans , says Jim Carr , chief operating officer for the National Community Reinvestment Coalition .
In his view , the real problem has been the dysfunctional market , which we should not conflate with homeownership itself .
" In a well - regulated market , homeownership provides a nest egg and an important generational wealth transfer , " he says .
Nearly everyone agrees that homeownership is sometimes the right choice : for people with the means , who intend to stay put for a long time and want to customize their houses , it probably makes sense .
And the mortgage interest deduction would be difficult to eliminate for political reasons .
Yet more and more experts are saying that if we could unsentimentally see the pluses and minuses of each option - and if we had a level playing field in terms of government support - the sensible decision for many Americans would be to refrain from buying a home , perhaps for their whole lives .
Owning a house , we tend to think , is a quasi-magical boon that provides a broad array of goods for individuals and families .
There is a logic to the reasoning :
If you are financially invested in a neighborhood and expect to stay there for years , you 'll be more inclined to tend a garden , bake muffins for your neighbors , and follow developments that affect the community .
You have more control over your environment , which seems likely to yield psychological benefits .
Studies over the years have suggested that homeowners are healthier and happier , and even that their children perform better in school .
But other research has challenged these conclusions .
Some studies find no significant relationships between these desirable outcomes and homeownership .
And according to several reviews of the literature , many of the studies suffer from methodological flaws :
Most importantly , they fail to control adequately for other variables , such as income , age , marital status , and home value .
In other words , homeowners tend to do better on a range of measures , but that does n't mean that the ownership status is the cause ; homeowners tend to be older and wealthier , which could account for the differences .
And there is little research on the potential negative consequences for low - income families facing the burden of mortgage debt and the possibility ( and reality ) of foreclosure .
A recent study , which aimed to avoid the problems of previous research , suggests that homeownership confers no real benefits .
The study examined self - respect , perceived notions of control , time spent with friends and family , volunteer activities , and enjoyment of the neighborhood , among other things .
On all of these measures , after controlling for income , health status , and home value , the study found no significant advantage for homeowners .
In fact , homeowners were on average 12 pounds heavier , and they spent less time with friends .
They also reported more " pain " - the term used in the study 's survey - deriving from their homes than renters .
Grace Wong Bucchianeri , an assistant professor at the Wharton School , conducted the study in 2005 , at the top of the market .
( All of her subjects occupied single - family homes , so the only difference was ownership status .
But her study had limitations too : all of the subjects were women , and it was geographically confined to Ohio . )
" It challenges our notion of engaged , active , healthy homeowners , " says Bucchianeri .
" We 're not looking at a lot of benefit here . "
Some of the more concrete financial drawbacks of homeownership should be obvious to any homeowner .
There are high transaction costs : 7 to 10 percent of the cost of the house goes to the process of buying and selling .
Between " sprucing it up and legal fees , it 's not cheap , " says Eric Belsky , executive director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard .
Major repairs , sometimes unexpected , may be needed , and simple upkeep usually costs 2 to 4 percent of the house price per year .
These responsibilities can be a hassle as well as an expense .
Renting , by contrast , is " inherently efficient , " as Matthew Perrenod of the Housing Partnership Network argued at a housing conference at Harvard in mid-March , because the maintenance can be professionalized .
Owning also , of course , comes with the risk of losing money if you have to move during a down market , or of being tethered to a house you want to leave .
Renting is often derided , especially by real estate agents , as " throwing money away . "
But upon close examination , the best financial decision is far from clear , and it 's impossible to generalize .
Buying entails paying property taxes , as well as the cost of repairs , mortgage payments , and mortgage interest .
Some financial analysts say that in terms of dividends , individuals would often be better off renting and using the money saved to invest in stocks .
According to the National Multi-Housing Council 's 2008 annual report , a $ 100 investment in a home in 1985 would have paid off $ 210 by 2008 , but if the same amount had been invested in stocks , it would have grown to $ 710 .
( Of course , the recent drop in stock values likely narrowed the gap . )
Some of the advantages of homeownership may be double - edged .
Stability has virtues , but the flip side is inflexibility .
Especially for low - income homeowners , owning a home can become a trap , preventing them from escaping distressed neighborhoods .
For people at all income levels , owning a home may keep them from moving to where jobs are .
In the mid-1990s , Andrew Oswald , a British economist at the University of Warwick , began to notice a correlation between national rates of homeownership and unemployment .
Among industrialized nations , Spain had the highest rates of both , while Switzerland had the lowest rates of both .
Other variables , such as the generosity of the welfare state , did n't seem to matter nearly as much .
He believes a high homeownership rate undercuts the efficiency of the economy : not only does it contribute to joblessness , but workers may take jobs for which they are not ideally suited , based on location rather than skills .
" There 's been a presumption that it 's really good for a country to have a high rate of homeownership , " says Oswald .
" But that homeownership equates with inflexibility . "
If some of the readers of my last post have their way , suburbia could eventually evolve into something straight out of Cormac McCarthy ’s post - apocalyptic novel “ The Road , ” where a desolate , polluted land is dotted with abandoned homes and buildings that have been stripped of all valuable parts , and lawlessness ( and cannibalism ) rules the streets .
Others , who advocated letting the land take over , might enjoy reading Alan Weisman ’s vivid description of how that process would work in “ The World Without Us ” : “ [ P ]ipes burst but if you lived where it freezes and rain is blowing in where windows have cracked from bird collisions and the stress of sagging walls … eventually the walls lean to one side , and finally the roof falls in . ”
( There ’s a terrific video on www.worldwithoutus.com that shows “ Your House Without You ” : mold and bugs jump in immediately , wildlife moves in by year 50 , plant life takes over by about year 100 . )
Though a healthy contingent of commentators on “ What Will Save the Suburbs ? ” advocated either burning suburbia down or simply letting nature take its course , the opinions offered ran the gamut from using them to relocate displaced Palestinians to turning them into self - sustaining communities .
Other ideas ?
Here are a few :
Mind your own business , city dwellers !
Start a cult .
Move the homeless in .
Turn all those homes into schools .
Sack the planners !
( Alternatively , please do n’t vilify planners . )
Convert these homes to low - income housing ( or do n’t even think about such a crazy idea ) .
Rezone .
Give contractors the incentive to build better and greener .
Transform those homes into satellite prisons .
Let people work from home one day a week .
Watch now as the “ white flight ” begins !
Stop driving and walk more !
And one of my favorites :
Put all the McMansions into abandoned big box stores for greater energy efficiency , creating an instant community in the process .
One unanticipated discovery that became clear from the commentary was just how deep an animosity exists between urban dwellers and suburbanites .
Perhaps “ saving ” was the wrong verb to use in the title .
True , there are many fantastic suburbs ( I grew up in one ) but that does n’t negate the reality of places like Rio Vista , Calif. , where an upscale 855 - home development called Hearth and Home at Liberty ( a name so cruelly ironic it surpasses irony altogether ) was abandoned last year , leaving graded streets , a few model homes and little else .
Exploring what to do with the extreme — semi-abandoned , half - built subdivisions from Merced , Calif. , to Lake County , Fla . — was done with the broader intention of rethinking how all communities might better be designed , built and experienced .
This is not unexplored territory ; good ideas abound , but most remain just that — great theory , little practice .
Some suburbs get it right ; some cities do , too .
But too many , especially in recent years , just have n’t .
Housing starts were off 15.5 percent in December .
Whether they return to “ normal ” later this year , or next year , or the year after that , it is crucial that the industry learns from its recent mistakes , which have ranged from overbuilding to product homogeneity .
New ( and existing ) homes and communities , and the people who reside in them , whether they ’re on Lexington Avenue or Quail Ridge Lane , can benefit from any number of creative ideas , designs and efforts already underway not just from the “ housing industry ” but from your friends and neighbors , too .
Richard Register has been thinking about the imperative of ecological urban ( and suburban ) redesign for decades .
The author of “ Ecocities ” and founder of Ecocity Builders , Register advocates returning healthy biodiversity and agriculture to cities , and designing them in such a way so as to bring convenience and pleasure to walking , bicycling and transit .
He explains that we should now be thinking about strategies for removing development : “ It ’s time for an intelligently phased withdrawal from it .
This can happen by default or by design .
By default would be a catastrophe . ”
In their recent book “ Retrofitting Suburbia : Urban Design Solutions for Redesigning Suburbs , ” architects and academics Ellen Dunham - Jones and June Williamson ) would agree .
They see suburbia itself as flawed ( which die - hard suburbanites may not appreciate ) and , like Register , they recommend urban strategies to solve suburban problems .
The book ’s numerous case studies show that this strategy has its merits .
Increasing density , transit and walkability often ( though not always ) can help to revitalize struggling communities like MetroWest in Vienna , Va. , which shifted from 69 houses to 2,250 transit - oriented residences ( suburban renewal seems impossible by the way without a serious acknowledgment of the need for density ) , and Mashpee Commons in Mashpee , Mass. , once a shopping mall but now a New Urbanist - style development with varied housing and open - air retail .
While many in the development / building / construction industries continue to argue the financial impossibility of sustainable developments ( and insist that consumers are n’t really interested in sustainable homes ) , KRDB architects in Austin , TX , went ahead and proved them wrong with SOL ( solution - oriented living ) Austin .
Included in the 38 - home , net zero energy development are 16 affordable modular housing units ( for cultural and economic diversity ) , tree plantings and community parks , joint - access drives ( to reduce impervious cover ) , varied setbacks ( so , unlike most developments , one is n’t confronted with a sea of identical houses but rather a more heterogeneous array ) .
Recognizing a trend away from larger homes for both economic and environmental reasons , the architects have designed the largest property at 1,816 square feet , the smallest at 1,090 .
Free Green is a service that offers what most developers wo n’t : green home plans to home - buyers .
Free green home plans from “ Comfortable Cape ” to “ Suburban Loft . ”
And they ’ll help find builders to build them .
Consumer interest and demand in greener homes seems to be driving change in the industry — a sort of bottom up approach to innovation .
So if you ca n’t find a subdivision offering the house you want , Free Green is helping facilitate a proactive alternative .
In keeping with this apparent new era of personal responsibility , the only - slightly - tongue - in - cheek collective Wannastartacommune.com started by Stephanie Smith , Buckminster Fuller - acolyte and founder of the green design lab , Ecoshack , gives a new attitude to an old idea , urging residents of cul de sacs or condos to come together with their neighbors to share resources .
Suggestions for collaboration include a shared compost pile , weekly potlucks , neighborhood recycling programs , barter services and shared childcare .
Their pilot project , Cul - de - Sac communes , is already underway .
This tendency — let ’s call it extreme neighborliness — is so old - fashioned as to seem innovative .
Startlingly basic and wholly actionable , it ’s a bright spot in a dark time .
A sequence in the second quarter of the B.C.S. national championship game won by Florida on Thursday night said much about how viewers should judge Fox ’s Thom Brennaman and Charles Davis .
When you ca n’t tell the difference between second down and third down , or between third and fourth down , you ’re in trouble .
“ Brown on third and goal sniffing the end zone , but apparently just short , ” Brennaman said with confidence ( on what was actually second down ) .
He thought the next play was fourth down , as did Davis , who advised Oklahoma : “ Go , go , go ! ”
Fox ’s graphics stripped across the top of the screen had it right : third and goal , but the announcers evidently were not looking .
When the Sooners did not rush to the line of scrimmage , Davis seemed to believe that Coach Bob Stoops was having second thoughts about going for it on fourth down .
“ Surprised they ’re even hesitating , ” Davis said .
But it was third down .
Fox ’s scoring strip and on - field graphic said it .
“ Brown did not get there ! ” Brennaman said as Chris Brown was stopped .
“ A huge stop for the Gator defense on fourth and goal . ”
( But really , third down . )
Belatedly , Brennaman acknowledged his error , but it was too late ; from then on , every time he said third or fourth down , I checked his claim against the screen .
He and Davis , a credible analyst , had expended a lot of credibility .
Minutes later , Brennaman giddily said , “ I got so excited I thought they were going on fourth down twice . ”
He laughed , as if such a failure of the basics of sportscasting were a minor matter .
“ I should have been there for you , partner , ” Davis said .
But where was their producer to correct them ?
Considering that he 's been dead for 70 years , F. Scott Fitzgerald 's career is going pretty well .
His short story was the inspiration for Best Picture nominee The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Baz Luhrmann is currently preparing a big - budget version of his most famous work , The Great Gatsby and Keira Knightley will star as his wife Zelda in an upcoming biopic of the couple .
Throw in Martin Scorsese 's upcoming Gatsby remake starring Vincent Chase , and the movie career of this great writer has never been hotter .

Which is a problem , since there was one time when it should have been : 1937 - 1940 , when he was trying to earn a living as a Hollywood scriptwriter .
There had been a early stint in 1927 , when United Artists paid him a $ 3500 advance ( about $ 65,000,000 in 2009 money ) to write an ultimately unproduced flapper comedy , but this was when he and Zelda were still the Jazz Age darlings who made bathtub gin and sat on flagpoles with Charles Lindbergh .
A 1931 stay led to nothing but more arguments and rejected scripts .
When he returned to Hollywood in 1937 , he really needed the work .
Zelda was in the mental ward and Fitzgerald ( or " F " as we like to call him ) had suffered a series of " Crack - Ups , " highlighted in a 1936 Joaquin Phoenixesque New York Post interview that includes the line , " His face twitched .
' Successful authors ! ' he cried .
' Oh , my God , successful authors ! '
He stumbled over to the highboy and poured himself another drink . "

Had TMZ been around in 1936 , they would have been staking out his home Britney - style .
Meanwhile , his record in Hollywood reads a bit like Michael Jordan 's baseball stats .
His IMDb credits for this period include eight " Uncredited " listings , compared with one actual screen credit for a 1938 adaptation of the novel Three Comrades ( for which his dialogue was heavily rewritten ) .
Uncredited sounds okay , but in Fitzgerald 's case it 's essentially a euphemism for " His script sucked , but he sure is famous . "
The IMDb page also does n't list his piles of unproduced screenplays , or rejected dialogue for numerous movies , including Gone With the Wind .

Terrible news .
it seems that any talkshow host that is critical of the Iraq war , the war profiteering , the stealing of elections , is being targeted to be silenced and being moved off the air .
Randi Rhodes show has been cancelled .
Thom Hartman 's show is no longer produced by Air America .
In contrast , Rush Limbaugh is being treated like some kind of prophet for the Republicans and his shows are heavily publicized on Fox news and other political news shows .
PBC : we are mortified to see you go .

I am so outraged I want to implode , the way this all came down ...... the way , this transition between the radio and internet ... its the missing link , we need a new business model , we need perhaps newsletters with pod-cast links and new ways of looking at bundling out media .
I like what I see here at Democratic Underground .
Perhaps an artist could store their pod-casts here with transcripts and google advertising will save us , see the aD - sense code book , that guy makes millions just drawing readers to his fresh content on his web sites , why cant us progressives seem to get in the groove , We certainly are going to have to full throttle support Malloy and Hartmann , and Rhodes when she comes back and Amy Goodman , just to keep the species propagating , I have a feeling we will figure this out as soon as progressives value optimum business plans with dedicated sales staff , as the natural foods industry figured it out , my g-d , we have got to get it together !

Peter B ... you rock , sorry to see you go .
I have a page of links for online shows and films that I sent send out .
These small individual efforts may be nice , but we have to have something more collective than each of us sending out a link for this or that show .
A central clearing house for progressive media would be great .
I get lousy reception on AM sometimes , so I cruise the internet for progresive shows .
It would be nice to have a website that gave links to online streaming and archived shows , googling progressive radio in this city or that is really an inefficient way to find the voices that are talking our side .
Quick blurb about the show with a link would save so much time and effort .

Horrible news .
The loss of Nova M , Randi Rhodes , and Mike Malloy teetering on the edge of extinction has me crazy .
Congress must address ownership rules and return the Fairness Doctrine to insure that the new Hearst ( Murdock ) wo n't own everything and that progressive voices are heard throughout the country on stations you can actually tune into .
I live in the 14th largest city in the country and we have no progressive voices on the radio .
If we want it , we stream it from our computers .
Otherwise we get Rush Lintball , Insanity , Dr. Laura and the other right wing shills .
It 's awful .
We need information presented in a coherent , understandable way as Peter B. does so well .
Not just a quick sound bite or 5 minute segment .
We do n't need or want to be entertained .

I still have this itchy feeling that within the Telecommunications
Act was struck a deal that we intelligent people get the interactive internet and the dinosaurs get the old beta state trance induced television .
And why 10 % of the media ?
Is this like the 10 % of any class are the A students ?
Is it our plight to keep dragging along others into their best interests .
Was this an elitist rant or what - but the part about the Telecommunications
Act could be true .
At any rate , as America slowly decends to a 3 world country , perhaps the media owners realize that we are figuring it all out with the number of hours we have to work just for the basics and that we will rise up based upon this alone .
As Randy Rhodes said , these leaders are frightened of us , and I will add ...... as they should be .

Peter did not take his show out of consideration for the newly opened time slot on KKGN 960 .
KKGN did , as the station told him that his show would not be selected to replace Randi Rhodes .
That seems to be the main reason he has decided to suspend his show .
( He ca n't even get on as a regular host in his hometown !
I 'd be disheartened , too . )

KKGN ( Green 960 ) is not the only game in town in the Bay Area because KGO has been using substitute hosts to fill the old Bernie Ward show at 10:00 PM .
Maybe Peter B. should go after that slot ?
I think it sucks that John Scott , the Program Director of KKGN , thinks we need to be entertained .

I just find it so hard to believe that progressive investors and financially saavy people can't get together to form a viable syndication network .
It 's crazy that they do n't see the necessity and potential benefits .
And I mean real progressives , not old D hacks .
That said , I 'm in on a monthly dues basis as soon as we get a centralized list of pledges together .
Also , I do n't really buy the " ratings " whether they be radio or TV .
Certainly given a level playing field we compete well there too .
But when has that ever happened .
Internet " radio " is going to be more widespread in the future , but there are interests that want to purge all liberals from the airwaves before that happens in order to delay the inevitable .

" Clear Channel " , a right - wing network , owns far too many " progressive " stations , and I do n't think everybody fully comprehends what is going on .
Mark my word :
They want to silence progressives ... and they can do it .
I will not name his name here , because I detest him and I think he is a snake .
But many of you fell for his " openness " , even after he convinced you that you preferred entertainment over substance .
He is like a crack dealer , convincing you that you really do n't like to LEARN when FUN and VARIETY are available .
What you 're going to get is a watered - down version of what used to be a strong progressive voice on radio .
Ultimately , those watered - down voices will be replaced with " moderate conservatives . "
And you will be told that this is what YOU wanted .
I 'm beginning to hate radio , and more - and - more , I 'm turning it off .
It is turning into the great propaganda machine that broadcast television became years ago ( and many people STILL do n't realize that ) .

Thanks for asking , Kathy .
And for giving a damn .
I asked Peter , before Friday 's announcement , if there was something I could do , along the lines you mentioned , and he said --- at least at that time --- there really was n't .
That for long - term , sustainability , he'd have to be able to count on some $ 5000 per month .
While we could do a funddrive for him , and perhaps even raise $ 5000 or even $ 15,000 if we went full bore , could we come up with something that was sustainable beyond one or three months , so it does n't have to be done again ?
I dunno .
That 's a lot of folks , at a bad time for the economy , who would have to commit for many many months .
If it was doable , I 'd be all for it .
And maybe it is , but I do n't know .
I also have n't talked to PBC about the idea , and would n't want to spearhead anything like that , unless he supported the idea .
I suspect he 's reading comments here though , and I hope to talk to him soon about these notions to get a feeling from him .
Of course , that 's just me .
There is nothing to stop a real * listener supported * effort --- where you guys run with the ball --- if you think you'd be able to build up enough momentum out there .
Of course , I 'd be happy to let folks know about it if that happened .
If I learn anything specific from Peter , of course , I 'll let ya know .

Progressive media has a living example of how to survive in a corporate - owned environment : Pacifica .
They have been subscribing on public subscriptions since 1949 , a time ripe with hostile " anti-American " blacklisting and persecution .
There is no good reason why the Left is n't taking advantage of the internet media possibilities and asking for subscriptions .
No one will get rich this way , but progressive media can then live on in spite of corporate efforts to kill off open dialogue .

Rightwing AM radio is being funded even at a loss to take up the airwaves from progressives .
http://www.motherjones.c...republican-noise-machine
It 's in billionaires best interests to fund rightwing radio and not let progressive radio take hold .
They will pay for this , they will pay to finance this DEARLY , because in the long run it pays for them to keep progressive radio off the air .
If Tom Hartmann went up against Rush Limbaugh , Hartmann would CRUSH him .
Rightwing billionaires and corporations can't let that happen .
Rightwing radio being " successful " is a financed SHAM !
The people with the money control the airwaves .
It 's a financed SHAM to fabricate the false talking point that progressive AM radio does n't or wo n't work .

Peter has something on his home page that asks listeners to donate what they can to cover the costs of the show .
http://www.peterbcollins.com/you-can-help/
Apparently , the donations have not been enough to sustain the show .
Peter mentioned on yesterday 's show that if an angel appeared and paid 5 thousand per month , he could stay on .
One of his regular callers suggested what people have suggested here : Several listeners pledge to pony up the money .
Perhaps someone should put the call out for angels to apply .
Get something organized ...

Here is what Peter wrote on his blog about sustaining his show : You Can Help
Listener Support Helps Keep PBC on the Air !
It ’s not a secret that , like many others , we ’ve been hit hard by the Bush economy .
Over the last few months , hundreds of people have volunteered to support the show .
It means a lot to me personally , as I have subsidized the costs of producing and distributing the program since 2005 ; your support is an important affirmation that you value the work we do , and was figured in the the mid-November decision to stay on the air .
A number of listeners have volunteered to support us on a subscription basis .
They have pledged amounts from $ 10 to $ 200 per month .
If 200 or 300 people can do this each month , we can cover our costs and keep delivering great radio shows every day .
Mailing address and PayPal link below .
At the request of one of our affiliate stations , we are limiting our references to listener support on the air .
I ’d like to be able to mention each of you who supports the show , to thank you while reminding others that they can help .
When I have some time , I will post the names of supporters here on the website–so if you prefer to remain anonymous , please indicate that .
I will also post a page crediting our monthly subscribers .
Some of you live on fixed incomes , and are facing your own financial problems .
No one should ever feel pressure to donate .
There ’s an unknown listener from Portland who has sent in a one dollar bill twice , and that means as much to me as contributions from people who can afford to give more .
As a way of showing our appreciation , we ’re offing a gift with donations of $ 50 or more .
Thanks to author Michael Hemp , we ’ll send you an autographed copy of his fascinating book , The Nadjik Pheromone .
It ’s a novel that explores new methods of truth and lie detection .

The KRXA program manager continually buried the real talent , Thom and Randi , by constantly moving their time slots , dropping hours from their shows , and there there were the incessant technical glitches .
Oh , do n't forget PBC and his Pelosi shilling , hand waving over the Impeachment blockade .

I , too , am saddened by this setback to Peter .
I do n't know how quite yet , but I 'm sure a man like him will resurface with a new show elsewhere .
One way is for Obama 's FCC to reinstitute The Fairness Doctrine in a new form .
From 1949 to 1987 , it operated within the bounds of each broadcast station .
According to Wikipedia , it never required equal time for opposing views " but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented . "
Since there were only three nationwide TV stations , the statute was relatively easy to administer .
That was before cable television .
And now foreign news outlets are available .
These outlets are , of course , outside federal jurisdiction .
Wiki cites an e-mail from Obama 's 2008 Campaign Press Secretary Michael Ortiz , indicating that the then - candidate favors opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible ... That is why Sen .
Obama supports media - ownership caps , network neutrality , public broadcasting , as well as increasing minority ownership of broadcasting and print outlets .
http://www.broadcastingc...of_Fairness_Doctrine.php
Obama 's opposition to the Fairness Doctrine dooms its chance of restoration during his term .
But fairness can come in a new form if Obama 's FCC imposes a cap on right - wing claptrap .
That would lead to a new Fairness Doctrine under a different name .
As noted , the revoked version operated within the bounds of each TV and radio station .
( It did n't apply to newspapers because , unlike broadcasters , they were n't licensed .
Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo , 418 U.S. 241 ( 1974 ) )
If Obama gets his way , something like The Fairness Doctrine would operate within geographic bounds .
Cities or regions that have six right - wing stations and zero progressive stations will be subject to regulation .
Right - wing blowhards will howl that the government is violating their right to free speech .
But they are indifferent to the way their monopoly violates progressives ' right to free speech .
Nor can right - wingers argue that liberals cannot compete in the media market .
Olbermann and Maddow give
Fox a run for their money .
Mike Malloy and Randi Rhodes boast that they " crush " Rush when they compete head - to - head with The Pigman .
Just as Reagan revoked the station - bounded Fairness Doctrine in 1987 by executive order , Obama should enact a geographic - bounded Fairness Doctrine also by executive order .
He should also enforce The Sherman Antitrust Act to curtail the influence of The 1996 Telecommunications Act .
If the Democrats gain a filibuster - proof Senate majority in 2010 , they can then codify the new version into law --- if they choose to behave as Democrats .
Progressive voices like that of Peter B. Collins would then have a sustainable economic environment .

It 's all fakery and fabrication , and things people really want on AM radio are purposely cancelled and they make up crap like " it was n't successful " .
I mean seriously , everyone here knows about e-vote machines , and they say this certain guy won and trust the machines .
How can you think for a moment they are on the up and up with rightwing AM radio ?
And not democracy itself with the e-vote machines ?
They cancel something we want and is good for us , because it 's NOT good for them ... and then provide a fake excuse .
Like it was n't successful .
They need an excuse , you know , they can't just cancel a good show and not give a reason and the reason is " because this guy is wildly popular and telling the truth , so we have to cancel him " .
You think they 're going to say that for their reason ?
No , they 're going to say " He was n't successful and no one was listening to him " .

Update : Rush Limbaugh 's ' Doubled Ratings ' an Article of Faith or a Lie ?
The claim , appearing even on these pages , that Rush Limbaugh 's ratings have " nearly doubled " is under attack today .
So far , there are two camps on this : the claim is super - weak , or the claim is a lie .
Media Matters stops short of calling the claim , published by the Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz , an outright lie : http://news.aol.com/poli...ticle-of-faith-or-a-lie/

'm especially curious how the Post knows so much about Limbaugh 's ratings success because even people in the world of syndicated radio do n't know since they do n't have comprehensive rating numbers for February yet .
And in terms of truly national rating numbers ( as opposed to just the top markets ) , that information is only gathered quarterly , I believe .
Meaning , it would be impossible to tell if Limbaugh 's up nearly 100 percent nationwide since January .
An update to the piece quotes Limbaugh saying he does n't even know February 's ratings yet .
Media Matters misses out , however , on the thin sourcing that Kurtz did provide .
I did n't miss it , and have no qualms about calling it an outright lie : ( from Daily Dose )
This is a specific , measurable claim .
The word " ratings " is not some kind of pliable , esoteric concept .
It refers to a specific type of measurement .
So , what ratings was Kurtz using ?
Arbitron ?
Nielsen ?
Zagat ?
" The people who love him are a very small segment of the public , " said Michael Harrison , publisher of Talkers magazine , whose research indicates that Limbaugh 's weekly audience has spiked from 14.2 million to about 25 million since the controversy escalated .
" A lot of people still think he 's a shock jock , a hatemonger ( ed. where 'd they get an idea like that ? ) , a right - wing radical , or hold his personal baggage against him . "
Here 's how strong Harrison 's " research " is :
His own magazine would n't cite it without sourcing the quote to Kurtz 's article !
He 's the publisher of " Talkers " magazine , but they did n't publish the " research , " quoting their own publisher from another publication .

Limbaugh 's Audience Size ?
It 's Largely Up in the Air Limbaugh is widely acknowledged to be the most popular talk - radio host , as evidenced by the record $ 400 million , eight - year contract he signed with his syndicator last July .
But estimates of Limbaugh 's nationwide ( and overseas ) audience are exercises in guesswork , slippery methodology and suspect data .
Limbaugh himself has muddied the water with the claim that he reaches 20 million people a week , although there 's no independent support for that figure .
http://www.washingtonpos.../06/AR2009030603435.html
Let me repeat that : no independent support for that figure
We 're being FAKED OUT by the rightwing media and their corporate sponsors and rightwing billionaire financers .
Do some research and find out who is really financing Limbaugh 's huge contract .
Also , who writes Limbaugh 's script ?
He 's too stupid to think of anything himself , and I 'm being serious .

when the ratings numbers are collected , they 're not made public .
The only way reporters can get ratings information for syndicated talkers is if their syndication companies want to release it .
( Or via advertiser . )
In other words , the only way we'd know if Limbaugh 's ratings have " doubled " would be if Limbaugh 's company said so .

Here are the key paragraphs in Peter B Collins blog post on how to save the show :
Many people who heard the $ 5,000 monthly cost figure have emailed to pledge $ 10 a month and said , “ how do we find the other 499 ? ”
We have tried that to some extent , but I do n’t want to turn the show into a pledge - a - thon , ’ cause I listen to the radio , too , and do n’t like them .
Plus , I ’m well aware that many of my listeners can’t even spare $ 10 a month right now .
Overall , I do n’t think we can shift to a voluntary subscription plan to produce a reliable funding stream .
If you disagree , email me : fullofit@peterbcollins.com
Tell me if you ’re willing to subscribe for at least 6 months , and how much you can pay .
If enough people respond by Monday night 3/16 , I will make a final review of this decision .
Dave Berman in Eureka , Tom McAfee in SF , and Aldous Tyler in Madison have offered to coordinate this kind of effort , but I need to give them your names and emails .

It 's time for progressives to stop pouring money and resources down the black hole of talk radio and focus more on where the progressive audience is --- talk television .
Progressives are failing on talk radio because that 's NOT where the progressive audience is .
Talk radio is a predominantly AM - band medium --- and the vast majority of Americans who listen to the radio tune in to FM stations , a whopping 83 percent , according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .
To reach progressive radio listeners , you have to go on National Public Radio , Pacifica and other FM radio outlets --- especially if you want to reach young people .
Young people do NOT listen to AM radio , mainly because of its inferior signal and monaural sound .
The AM radio audience is overwhelmingly middle - aged and older , predominantly male and overwhelmingly white and conservative .
Another misperception about conservative talk radio is the size of its audience .
Many people are making the mistake that Rush Limbaugh draws 20 million listeners .
NOT TRUE .
Unlike television , radio audiences are measure by the week , rather than by the day .
Thus , Limbaugh 's 20 million WEEKLY listeners breaks down to an average DAILY listenership of only 4.2 million !
I work in radio , so I know what I 'm talking about .
With more than 90 percent of the 600 - plus stations that carry Limbaugh 's program on the AM band , Limbaugh 's daily audience is less than HALF of the all - FM NPR 's daily audience .
And that 's just NPR alone .
Throw in all the other FM stations , and Limbaugh draws less than 10 percent of the total U.S. radio audience .
And Limbaugh 's 4.2 million daily listeners do n't come even close to the six million people who watch the three all - news cable TV channels .
And when it comes to talk television , conservatives rule only Fox News .
So STOP trying to draw progressives to a medium that they wo n't listen to and concentrate instead on expanding the progressive audience on the medium that draws them the most --- TV .

Skeeter ( #38 ) writes : " It 's time for progressives to stop pouring money and resources down the black hole of talk radio and focus more on where the progressive audience is --- talk television . "
Um .
Actually , television is sort of " over " .
In my house , NBC is a four - letter word .
While your stats on the AM radio demographic are enlightening , and while I may not be the " youth demographic " you cite , most under 40's are increasingly getting all our news / information / entertainment via the internets .
TV will be obsolete , sooner than we think .
As a former television junkie / newsphile , I have been off the TV wagon now for the better part of a year and I do n't miss a damn thing .
In fact , I find I 'm better informed .
From my computer , I can track the real news AND the made - up news that only people with TV and AM / FM are exposed to .
So AM / FM --- should n't matter , as long as there is a link with a way to livestream the program from my computer , I 'm in !
And I 'd follow Peter B. Collins all over the radio dial and beyond .
( And I suspect many of us would .
Established audience / ratings , ready to go . )
That said , I 'm stymied by the ineptitude of the Air America / NOVA M standard bearers - why do they keep firing Randi Rhodes ?!
I do n't care if she 's difficult , she is the best answer we have to the ferocity on the Right !
Why do they keep screwing with the schedule so you have to seek out your favorite shows ?
And HOW THE HELL DOES SOMEONE LIKE RICHARD GREENE keep a show as shitty as CLOUT on the air during their 9:00 pm drive ?
Like Karen above , I think progressive stations with the cash backing just need to learn a new business model for internet marketing , and how not to fuck with a good thing .
The Stewart / Cramer show down proves there is a HUuuUUGE market for telling truth to power .
Saddened by this news , but encouraged to hear PBC 's talk of a potential podcast .
I have buddies who are doing this quite successfully , making good money from sponsors / reaching about 40,000 people from their basement .
Adam Corolla started his own podcast within days of being fired here in L.A. , and is doing quite well ...

AA is adding Montel Williams , who is a celebrity .

If Peter B. cannot continue on AM radio , he should redefine " staying on the air . "
We listen to PBC by podcast , and I am happy to contribute $ 15 per month for a " podcast subscription . "
Two people in our household will subscribe at $ 15 each per month .
So , " staying on the air " might mean producing a radio show which may or may not be transmitted over the public airwaves , but will be accessible by podcast to those of us who need our daily " Peter B. Collins fix . "
Peter should go the subscription route .
I see Thom Hartmann is charging $ 60 for an annual subscription to his podcasts .
Peter should do the same .
$ 60 x 1,000 listeners would give Peter his $ 60,000 minimum operating capital .

Progressive , anti-corporate , pro-people content and personalities will have only limited success in a media that is funded and managed in direct opposition to their beliefs .
Eventually , we have to move away from advertising - driven and corporate - controlled media and start buying our media directly , as Montana Mule Gal suggests .

Vint Cerf , who can fairly be described as one of the godfathers ( but not in a Tony Soprano way ) , has endorsed Barack Obama in the US presidential race , saying that his decision is swayed by Obama 's stance on net neutrality - the question of whether content providers should be charged more for different content by the " pipe " providers .
The video is above , but if you feel textual , here 's a short extract :
We believe that the Internet should remain an open environment .
It 's vital to innovation .
Companies like Google , and Yahoo , and eBay , and Amazon , and Skype and so on , got their start without having to get permission from any ISP or any broadband provider to offer services .
They simply acquired access to the internet , put their services up and then made them available to the general public .
So far , so much the usual explanation of net neutrality .
But what does Obama offer ?
We think that 's the best way for the Internet to evolve and I 'm pleased to say that in the upcoming presidential elections , the two candidates have rather different views of this particular matter .
Senator Obama in particular sees things the way I do which is that the Net should remain open , fully accessible and providing access on a non-discriminatory basis to the people who want to offer new services on the network .
We had an exclusive interview with Cerf at the start of October : he makes the case there again for the benefits of net neutrality .
There are more scientists and technologists and their endorsements on the AVoteForScience channel on YouTube ; safe to say that it's not seeing a huge amount of backing for John McCain and his creationist - backing running mate Sarah Palin - although McCain has been unusual among Republicans in accepting that climate change is real , important and urgent .
That though has not been enough for many American scientists and technologists who want a break from the Bush years when science has been overruled .
Obama did win a certain amount of opprobrium for his backing in June to the FISA bill , " a sweeping intelligence surveillance law that has been heavily denounced by the liberal activists who have fueled the financial engines of his presidential campaign " ( according to the Washington Post ) .
It does n't seem to have hurt him too much though - in the leadup to the final presidential debate on Tuesday night , he had a notional lead nationally of 4 points - plus or minus 2.9 .

Like clockwork , it 's time again for the seemingly obligatory post describing the Chinese government 's latest attempt to censor YouTube
The row this time is over a video , released by the exiled Tibetan government , depicting Chinese police officers brutally beating Tibetans after riots last year in Lhasa .
Normally , China will censor individual videos , but this time it decided to apparently block the entire YouTube website .
As I 've described before , the so - called " Great Firewall of China " works so well because it 's extremely subtle .
Rather than outright censoring websites , it simply makes specific pages take too long to load , so users wind up going to different destinations out of impatience .
From my own analysis of the Great Firewall performed while in China , I can attest to the fact that most people never even know when a site is being censored .
Contrary to American perceptions , Chinese users never receive some ominous warning that the police are coming to get them for visiting a banned site .
They just grow impatient with the loading time , and move on with their lives .
This is a recurring story that always gets lots of coverage in the blogosphere , and while it 's important for citizen journalists to act as watchdogs and report such happenings , the real story lies in whether Google ( which owns YouTube ) chooses to remove the controversial video in order to appease a Chinese government with whom it wants to conduct business , or , conversely , whether Google will leave the video in place , sticking to its stated principle to " Do No Evil " .

Indeed , when all the sums were done , it seems the annual consumption of bottled water in the U.S. in 2007 required the equivalent of between 32 and 54 million barrels of oil — roughly one - third of a percent of total U.S. primary energy consumption .
The article , “ Energy implications of bottled water ” by researchers Peter H. Gleick and Heather Cooley , is the first peer - reviewed analysis of its kind and appears in the February 2009 edition of Environmental Research Letters .
“ As bottled water use continues to expand around the world , there is growing interest in the environmental , economic , and social implications of that use , including concerns about waste generation , proper use of groundwater , hydrologic effects on local surface and groundwater , economic costs , and more .
But a key concern is how much energy is required to produce and use bottled water , ” said article co-author Peter Gleick , president of the Pacific Institute .
“ It turns out the answer is , a lot . ”
The authors note that a single estimate of the energy footprint of bottled water is not possible due to differences among water sources , bottling processes , transportation costs , and other factors .
Gleick and Cooley calculate the energy requirements for various stages in bottled water production , including the energy to manufacture the plastic bottles , process the water and the bottles , and transport and cool the final product .
Combining the energy intensities for these stages , the analysis finds that producing bottled water requires between 5.6 and 10.2 MJ per liter — as much as 2000 times the energy cost of producing tap water .
The authors further estimate that to satisfy global demands , the energy equivalent of 50 million barrels of oil per year is used just to produce the bottles , primarily made of PET plastic , almost all of which are currently made from virgin , not recycled , material .
For water transported short distances , the energy requirements of bottled water are dominated by the energy to produce these plastic bottles .
Long - distance transport , however , can lead to energy costs comparable to , or even higher than , the energy to produce the bottle .
In the article , the authors calculate the energy costs of three different scenarios for a bottle of water consumed in Southern California — a locally produced bottle and bottled water from both France and Fiji transported to the region .
“ With the U.S. consumption of bottled water exceeding 33 billion liters a year , and with intensifying efforts to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions , these data should help identify ways to reduce the energy costs of bottled water and may help consumers themselves make more environmentally sustainable choices , ” said co-author Heather Cooley , senior research associate at the Pacific Institute .
Based in Oakland , California , the Pacific Institute is a nonpartisan research institute that works to create a healthier planet and sustainable communities .
Through interdisciplinary research and partnering with stakeholders , the Institute produces solutions that advance environmental protection , economic development , and social equity — in California , nationally , and internationally .

A comedian has said he was told by Prince Harry : " You do n't sound like a black chap . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The young royal was said to have made the comment to Stephen K Amos after the Prince of Wales 's 60th birthday celebration , We Are Most Amused , last November .
Last month , Harry apologised for using the term " Paki " about a member of his platoon .
Speaking on Five 's The Wright Stuff yesterday , Amos said : " I 'll let you into a secret .
" When I finished the show , in the line - up I was saying ' Hello , hello ' .
" Prince Harry comes up to me and goes ' Oh , tell me , amusing , but you do n't sound like a black chap ' . "
Londoner Amos continued : " I wanted to say ( in a West Indian accent ) ' How am I supposed to sound ? " '
Amos said he hoped the comment was in jest and that he thought Harry might have been trying to make banter with him .
A spokeswoman for the Prince would not confirm whether or not the remarks had been made because private conversations are not commented upon .
A previous statement from St James 's Palace about the " Paki " comment said it was made three years ago as a nickname about a friend and without any malice .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also said he believed the public would give Harry the " benefit of the doubt " over the furore it caused .
The Prince 's apology last month follows one he was forced to make in 2005 for wearing a swastika armband to a party , which offended many Jewish people .
Former Commission for Racial Equality chairman Lord ( Herman ) Ouseley told the Daily Mirror : " It is very sad that Prince Harry thinks black people all talk in the same way .
" It just goes to show how ill - educated members of the upper classes can be . "
KALAMAZOO TOWNSHIP --

• Bruised , shaken woman describes assault on school bus
• Two teens honored for helping stop attack on school bus
The teen , whose name has not been released , is charged as a juvenile with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder , Kalamazoo County Assistant Prosecutor Karen Hayter said Wednesday .
The boy , who was being lodged at the Kalamazoo County Juvenile Home , is scheduled to appear April 3 in the Kalamazoo County Circuit Court Family Division for a pretrial hearing .
Meanwhile , the bus driver , a 37 - year - old Kalamazoo woman whose name also has not been released , was treated at Bronson Methodist Hospital for a broken finger and bruising , cuts and scrapes to her face and head , Kalamazoo Township Police Chief Tim Bourgeois said .
The woman was released from the hospital Tuesday night , the chief said .
Police said the incident occurred at about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday on Brook Drive near Gull Road as the bus driver was taking students from the juvenile home 's school and Kalamazoo Regional Educational Service Agency 's Valley Center School , a facility that educates students who 've shown emotional or behavioral problems .
Police allege that during the trip the teen , a student at Valley Center , began verbally threatening the driver from the back of the bus , and she pulled over .
The teen , who police said was apparently upset with how the driver was performing her duties , went to the front of the bus after it stopped and attacked the driver , punching her in the face and head as she tried to radio for help , police said .
Police said other students on the bus twice pulled the teen off the driver before he stopped the attack .
After the incident , the teen got off the bus , but officers later located him at his Kalamazoo home .
Kalamazoo Public
Schools issued a statement that the bus driver involved was " a veteran driver and one chosen specifically to take substitute routes because of her ability and training .
The driver was conducting her duties in accordance with all rules and requirements when this incident occurred . "
The statement also said : " Kalamazoo Public Schools ' transportation personnel are given professional development on an ongoing basis that includes positive - behavior - support training which incorporates training in de-escalating situations . "

The prime minister has warned against intolerance
The Malaysian Prime Minister , Abdullah Badawi , has said he will resign on Thursday , completing the transfer of power to his deputy , Najib Razak .
Mr Abdullah handed over as president of the Umno party , which has governed Malaysia since independence , last week .
Mr Najib has again rejected allegations of the murder of a Mongolian woman as " malicious baseless lies " .
Two policemen who used to be in Mr Najib 's protection team are on trial for the killing of the 28 year old .
One of Mr Najib 's senior aides admitted having an affair with the woman .
Earlier this week Mr Abdullah gave a strongly - worded warning to the party congress .
He said the United Malays National Organization party would perish unless it stopped suppressing dissent , jailing opponents and discriminating against Malaysia 's minority Chinese and Indian races .

When I play a BioWare role - playing game , my characters tend to not only lean toward the nicer side , but almost immediately start twinkling with the magical pixie dust of purity .
It 's embarrassing , but I just make the decisions I believe I 'd really make , and end up that way .
The task I set myself was to play the original Knights of the Old Republic , making the worst , cruellest , most spiteful , murderous and downright evil choices available at every choice .
I 've played the game before - in fact , it 's one of my all - time favourites - but I was the most angelic creature in the galaxy .
This was n't going to be easy .
This is the story of mysterious Republic Scoundrel , Simon Evil , and his adventures on the planet Taris .
Knights of the Old Republic ( KOTOR from now on ) was originally released in 2003 .
By this time the Star Wars franchise had already far out - stayed its welcome at LucasArts .
The twelve months around KOTOR alone churned out Star Wars : Bounty Hunter , Star Wars : Galactic Battlegrounds - Saga , Star Wars : Galaxies - An Empire Divided , Star Wars : Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy , Star Wars : Rogue Squadron III - Rebel Strike , and Star Wars : The Clone Wars .
You can see the problem .
And do n't forget this was the year between Episode II 's Attack of the Clones and Episode III 's Revenge of the Sith .
By this point , Star Wars could piss right off .
Ah , a whole city of people to rob , insult and kill .
KOTOR did something very clever .
It set itself 4,000 before Lucas 's rapidly unravelling stories , releasing itself from the hideousness that the once - so - loved universe had become , able to pick out the best parts of the mythology ( Jedis , Sith , droids , the Force , Wookiees and spaceships ) .
BioWare was given a splendid amount of freedom to create its own stories , far enough away to not mess up the canon of the ongoing films , and not necessarily as simplistic as the kid-friendly tosh of the day .
Shortly after a terrible war between the Sith and the Republic , times are still not peaceful .
The great big bad Darth Revan is gone , presumed dead , and his prodigy , Darth Malak , is determined to wipe out the remaining Jedi in the galaxy .
Together with your motley collection of Star Wars familiars , you travel to various planets , attempting to piece together an ancient Star Map that will lead you to Malak 's dastardly Star Forge , and stop his evil antics .
But before any of that happens , there 's the planet Taris to escape .
I picked a Scoundrel because that seemed the most immediately naughty choice .
I think an argument could be made for Soldier if I wanted to get all Billy Bragg about it , but Scoundrel it was .
Simon Evil , I named him , because it 's always funny when you make an RPG have characters call you something silly .
I pick the evilest - looking head on offer , bald with a goatee - a clear sign of evilness .
And I roll him to show strengths in subterfuge and manipulation , because all the best evil people use these methods .
Pointy beards and sinister remarks are the targets aimed for by the stylish baddies .
Punching quite hard and being good with weapons , oddly enough , seem far more the domain of the hero .
Oh , and he 's a man .
Because I usually play girls .
Men are always more evil .
Yes , of course by running around her in circles !
The story begins on a Republic ship , being attacked by Malak 's Sith forces , as I desperately raced to get to an escape pod by having a equipment menu tutorial .
Few opportunities for malevolence here , beyond refusing to let him explain things to me when I did n't remember how they worked .
Which was more stubborn stupidity than anything harmful to others .
However , there was soon a chance to be a dick , as the pressing importance of rescuing the Jedi Bastila was explained to me , letting me reply that I could n't care less , and I was n't risking my life for her .
Of course , KOTOR is n't going to let you get away with that .
For all the remarkable freedom of behaviour it offers you , it 's going to drag you kicking and screaming through the main plot no matter how much you petulantly protest .
Being an enthusiastic participant disguises this nicely , but rebel against the core plot and it becomes a little awkward as it tells you that you 're going to have to do it anyway , so shut up and follow me .
However , you do get the pleasure of hearing the shocked reaction of those around you that you 'd say such things .
" Sounds like Malak and Revan have the right idea , " I muttered to my horrified tutorial guide .

This post was last updated : Thursday , March 8 , 2007 at 2:23 PM , Central European Time ( CET )
From when I was still forced to attend , I remember our synagogue 's annual fundraising appeal .
It was a simple enough format , if I recall correctly .
The rabbi and the treasurer talked about the shul 's expenses and how vital this annual fundraise was , and then the synagogue 's members called out their pledges from their seats .
Straightforward , yes ?
Let me tell you about a different annual fundraising appeal .
One that I ran , in fact ; during the early years of a nonprofit organization that may not be named .
One difference was that the appeal was conducted over the Internet .
And another difference was that the audience was largely drawn from the atheist / libertarian / technophile / sf - fan/early - adopter / programmer /etc crowd .
( To point in the rough direction of an empirical cluster in personspace .
If you understood the phrase " empirical cluster in personspace " then you know who I 'm talking about . )
I crafted the fundraising appeal with care .
By my nature I 'm too proud to ask other people for help ; but I 've gotten over around 60 % of that reluctance over the years .
The nonprofit needed money and was growing too slowly , so I put some force and poetry into that year 's annual appeal .
I sent it out to several mailing lists that covered most of our potential support base .
And almost immediately , people started posting to the mailing lists about why they were n't going to donate .
Some of them raised basic questions about the nonprofit 's philosophy and mission .
Others talked about their brilliant ideas for all the other sources that the nonprofit could get funding from , instead of them .
( They did n't volunteer to contact any of those sources themselves , they just had ideas for how we could do it . )
Now you might say , " Well , maybe your mission and philosophy did have basic problems — you would n't want to censor that discussion , would you ? "
Hold on to that thought .
Because people were donating .
We started getting donations right away , via Paypal .
We even got congratulatory notes saying how the appeal had finally gotten them to start moving .
A donation of $ 111.11 was accompanied by a message saying , " I decided to give **** a little bit more .
One more hundred , one more ten , one more single , one more dime , and one more penny .
All may not be for one , but this one is trying to be for all . "
But none of those donors posted their agreement to the mailing list .
Not one .
So far as any of those donors knew , they were alone .
And when they tuned in the next day , they discovered not thanks , but arguments for why they should n't have donated .
The criticisms , the justifications for not donating — only those were displayed proudly in the open .
As though the treasurer had finished his annual appeal , and everyone not making a pledge had proudly stood up to call out justifications for refusing ; while those making pledges whispered them quietly , so that no one could hear .
I know someone with a rationalist cause who goes around plaintively asking , " How come the Raelian flying - saucer cult can get tens of thousands of members [ probably around 40,000 ] interested in complete nonsense , but we can't even get a thousand people working on this ? "
The obvious wrong way to finish this thought is to say , " Let 's do what the Raelians do !
Let 's add some nonsense to this meme ! "
For the benefit of those not immediately stopped by their ethical inhibitions , I will observe that there may be a hundred failed flying - saucer cults for every one that becomes famous .
And the Dark Side may require non-obvious skills , which you , yes you , do not have : Not everyone can be a Sith Lord .
In particular , if you talk about your planned lies on the public Internet , you fail .
I 'm no master criminal , but even I can tell certain people are not cut out to be crooks .
So it 's probably not a good idea to cultivate a sense of violated entitlement at the thought that some other group , who you think ought to be inferior to you , has more money and followers .
That path leads to — pardon the expression — the Dark Side .
But it probably does make sense to start asking ourselves some pointed questions , if supposed " rationalists " can't manage to coordinate as well as a flying - saucer cult .
How do things work on the Dark Side ?
The respected leader speaks , and there comes a chorus of pure agreement : if there are any who harbor inward doubts , they keep them to themselves .
So all the individual members of the audience see this atmosphere of pure agreement , and they feel more confident in the ideas presented — even if they , personally , harbored inward doubts , why , everyone else seems to agree with it .
( " Pluralistic ignorance " is the standard label for this . )
If anyone is still unpersuaded after that , they leave the group ( or in some places , are executed ) — and the remainder are more in agreement , and reinforce each other with less interference .
( I call that " evaporative cooling of groups " . )
The ideas themselves , not just the leader , generate unbounded enthusiasm and praise .
The halo effect is that perceptions of all positive qualities correlate — e.g. telling subjects about the benefits of a food preservative made them judge it as lower - risk , even though the quantities were logically uncorrelated .
This can create a positive feedback effect that makes an idea seem better and better and better , especially if criticism is perceived as traitorous or sinful .
( Which I term the " affective death spiral " . )
So these are all examples of strong Dark Side forces that can bind groups together .
And presumably we would not go so far as to dirty our hands with such ...
Therefore , as a group , the Light Side will always be divided and weak .
Atheists , libertarians , technophiles , nerds , science - fiction fans , scientists , or even non-fundamentalist religions , will never be capable of acting with the fanatic unity that animates radical Islam .
Technological advantage can only go so far ; your tools can be copied or stolen , and used against you .
In the end the Light Side will always lose in any group conflict , and the future inevitably belongs to the Dark .
I think that one 's reaction to this prospect says a lot about their attitude towards " rationality " .
Some " Clash of Civilizations " writers seem to accept that the Enlightenment is destined to lose out in the long run to radical Islam , and sigh , and shake their heads sadly .
I suppose they 're trying to signal their cynical sophistication or something .
For myself , I always thought — call me loony — that a true rationalist ought to be effective in the real world .
So I have a problem with the idea that the Dark Side , thanks to their pluralistic ignorance and affective death spirals , will always win because they are better coordinated than us .
You would think , perhaps , that real rationalists ought to be more coordinated ?
Surely all that unreason must have its disadvantages ?
That mode can't be optimal , can it ?
And if current " rationalist " groups cannot coordinate — if they can't support group projects so well as a single synagogue draws donations from its members — well , I leave it to you to finish that syllogism .
There 's a saying I sometimes use : " It is dangerous to be half a rationalist . "
For example , I can think of ways to sabotage someone 's intelligence by selectively teaching them certain methods of rationality .
Suppose you taught someone a long list of logical fallacies and cognitive biases , and trained them to spot those fallacies in biases in other people 's arguments .
But you are careful to pick those fallacies and biases that are easiest to accuse others of , the most general ones that can easily be misapplied .
And you do not warn them to scrutinize arguments they agree with just as hard as they scrutinize incongruent arguments for flaws .
So they have acquired a great repertoire of flaws of which to accuse only arguments and arguers who they do n't like .
This , I suspect , is one of the primary ways that smart people end up stupid .
( And note , by the way , that I have just given you another Fully General Counterargument against smart people whose arguments you do n't like . )
Similarly , if you wanted to ensure that a group of " rationalists " never accomplished any task requiring more than one person , you could teach them only techniques of individual rationality , without mentioning anything about techniques of coordinated group rationality .
I 'll write more later ( tomorrow ? ) on how I think rationalists might be able to coordinate better .
But today I want to focus on what you might call the culture of disagreement , or even , the culture of objections , which is one of the two major forces preventing the atheist / libertarian / technophile crowd from coordinating .
Imagine that you 're at a conference , and the speaker gives a 30 - minute talk .
Afterward , people line up at the microphones for questions .
The first questioner objects to the graph used in slide 14 using a logarithmic scale ; he quotes Tufte on The Visual Display of Quantitative Information .
The second questioner disputes a claim made in slide 3 .
The third questioner suggests an alternative hypothesis that seems to explain the same data ...
Perfectly normal , right ?
Now imagine that you 're at a conference , and the speaker gives a 30 - minute talk .
People line up at the microphone .
The first person says , " I agree with everything you said in your talk , and I think you 're brilliant . "
Then steps aside .
The second person says , " Slide 14 was beautiful , I learned a lot from it .
You 're awesome . "
Steps aside .
The third person —
Well , you 'll never know what the third person at the microphone had to say , because by this time , you 've fled screaming out of the room , propelled by a bone - deep terror as if Cthulhu had erupted from the podium , the fear of the impossibly unnatural phenomenon that has invaded your conference .
Yes , a group which can't tolerate disagreement is not rational .
But if you tolerate only disagreement — if you tolerate disagreement but not agreement — then you also are not rational .
You 're only willing to hear some honest thoughts , but not others .
You are a dangerous half - a- rationalist .
We are as uncomfortable together as flying - saucer cult members are uncomfortable apart .
That can't be right either .
Reversed stupidity is not intelligence .
Let 's say we have two groups of soldiers .
In group 1 , the privates are ignorant of tactics and strategy ; only the sergeants know anything about tactics and only the officers know anything about strategy .
In group 2 , everyone at all levels knows all about tactics and strategy .
Should we expect group 1 to defeat group 2 , because group 1 will follow orders , while everyone in group 2 comes up with better ideas than whatever orders they were given ?
In this case I have to question how much group 2 really understands about military theory , because it is an elementary proposition that an uncoordinated mob gets slaughtered .
Doing worse with more knowledge means you are doing something very wrong .
You should always be able to at least implement the same strategy you would use if you are ignorant , and preferably do better .
You definitely should not do worse .
If you find yourself regretting your " rationality " then you should reconsider what is rational .
On the other hand , if you are only half - a- rationalist , you can easily do worse with more knowledge .
I recall a lovely experiment which showed that politically opinionated students with more knowledge of the issues reacted less to incongruent evidence , because they had more ammunition with which to counter - argue only incongruent evidence .
We would seem to be stuck in an awful valley of partial rationality where we end up more poorly coordinated than religious fundamentalists , able to put forth less effort than flying - saucer cultists .
True , what little effort we do manage to put forth may be better - targeted at helping people rather than the reverse — but that is not an acceptable excuse .
If I were setting forth to systematically train rationalists , there would be lessons on how to disagree and lessons on how to agree , lessons intended to make the trainee more comfortable with dissent , and lessons intended to make them more comfortable with conformity .
One day everyone shows up dressed differently , another day they all show up in uniform .
You 've got to cover both sides , or you 're only half a rationalist .
Can you imagine training prospective rationalists to wear a uniform and march in lockstep , and practice sessions where they agree with each other and applaud everything a speaker on a podium says ?
It sounds like unspeakable horror , does n't it , like the whole thing has admitted outright to being an evil cult ?
But why is it not okay to practice that , while it is okay to practice disagreeing with everyone else in the crowd ?
Are you never going to have to agree with the majority ?
Our culture puts all the emphasis on heroic disagreement and heroic defiance , and none on heroic agreement or heroic group consensus .
We signal our superior intelligence and our membership in the nonconformist community by inventing clever objections to others ' arguments .
Perhaps that is why the atheist / libertarian / technophile / sf - fan / Silicon - Valley / programmer / early - adopter crowd stays marginalized , losing battles with less nonconformist factions in larger society .
No , we 're not losing because we 're so superior , we 're losing because our exclusively individualist traditions sabotage our ability to cooperate .
The other major component that I think sabotages group efforts in the atheist / libertarian / technophile / etcetera community , is being ashamed of strong feelings .
We still have the Spock archetype of rationality stuck in our heads , rationality as dispassion .
Or perhaps a related mistake , rationality as cynicism — trying to signal your superior world - weary sophistication by showing that you care less than others .
Being careful to ostentatiously , publicly look down on those so naive as to show they care strongly about anything .
Would n't it make you feel uncomfortable if the speaker at the podium said that he cared so strongly about , say , fighting aging , that he would willingly die for the cause ?
But it is nowhere written in either probability theory or decision theory that a rationalist should not care .
I 've looked over those equations and , really , it 's not in there .
The best informal definition I 've ever heard of rationality is " That which can be destroyed by the truth should be . "
We should aspire to feel the emotions that fit the facts , not aspire to feel no emotion .
If an emotion can be destroyed by truth , we should relinquish it .
But if a cause is worth striving for , then let us by all means feel fully its importance .
Some things are worth dying for .
Yes , really !
And if we can't get comfortable with admitting it and hearing others say it , then we 're going to have trouble caring enough — as well as coordinating enough — to put some effort into group projects .
You 've got to teach both sides of it , " That which can be destroyed by the truth should be , " and " That which the truth nourishes should thrive . "
I 've heard it argued that the taboo against emotional language in , say , science papers , is an important part of letting the facts fight it out without distraction .
That does n't mean the taboo should apply everywhere .
I think that there are parts of life where we should learn to applaud strong emotional language , eloquence , and poetry .
When there 's something that needs doing , poetic appeals help get it done , and , therefore , are themselves to be applauded .
We need to keep our efforts to expose counterproductive causes and unjustified appeals , from stomping on tasks that genuinely need doing .
You need both sides of it — the willingness to turn away from counterproductive causes , and the willingness to praise productive ones ; the strength to be unswayed by ungrounded appeals , and the strength to be swayed by grounded ones .
I think the synagogue at their annual appeal had it right , really .
They were n't going down row by row and putting individuals on the spot , staring at them and saying , " How much will you donate , Mr. Schwartz ? "
People simply announced their pledges — not with grand drama and pride , just simple announcements — and that encouraged others to do the same .
Those who had nothing to give , stayed silent ; those who had objections , chose some later or earlier time to voice them .
That 's probably about the way things should be in a sane human community — taking into account that people often have trouble getting as motivated as they wish they were , and can be helped by social encouragement to overcome this weakness of will .
But even if you disagree with that part , then let us say that both supporting and countersupporting opinions should have been publicly voiced .
Supporters being faced by an apparently solid wall of objections and disagreements — even if it resulted from their own uncomfortable self - censorship — is not group rationality .
It is the mere mirror image of what Dark Side groups do to keep their followers .
Reversed stupidity is not intelligence .
Here are 3 quick but sobering facts about the present world water situation :
Water insecurity could increase malnutrition in 75 - 125 million people by 2080 .
Diarrhea caused by unclean water kills five times as many children as HIV / AIDS .
In some areas , the amount of available water can fall below 1/10th the basic human requirement .
1
The good news is that there is an organization with a lot of clout behind it working to change those facts , and give people universal access to clean water and sanitation : Global Water Challenge .
Photo : mckaysavage
Global Water Challenge ( GWC ) , a coalition of 22 leading organizations from around the world , is taking the lead to create a global movement in water and sanitation issues .
The idea for GWC grew out of a series of forums held by the Global Environment & Technology Foundation ( GETF ) throughout 2005 and early 2006 .
The GWC was initially funded by the United Nations Foundation , Dow Chemical Company , Coca - Cola , Cargill , and the Wallace Genetic Foundation , and was launched in 2006 .
The very first project of the GWC was begun in 2006 in the Nyanza Province of Kenya .
The aim was to provide comprehensive coverage for water , sanitation and hygiene education in 1,500 schools , in cooperation with the Kenyan government .
Seed funding came from the Coca - Cola Foundation , and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation added an additional $ 9.5 million to that original amount .
Monitoring and evaluation of the project is handled by Emory University , and the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) is documenting both the benefits and the challenges for the communities , students , and teachers .
GWC has many other projects in the works right now , including :
Manna Energy Foundation is installing close to 500 water treatment systems , biogas generators , and high efficiency cook stoves for secondary schools in Rwanda .
Manna will fund the venture with carbon credits generated by saving fuel wood .

Naandi Foundation : Community - based Safe Drinking Water Systems – Naandi focuses on three areas : child rights , safe drinking water , and sustainable livelihoods .
Begun with a single pilot project in 2005 , Naandi now has over 150 operational water purification plants and 200 plants in various stages of construction in Andhra Pradesh and Punjab .
When all 350 water plants are completed , over 1.75 million people will benefit from them .

Water , Sanitation and Hygiene Education in Rural Schools : Puebla , Guerrero , Chiapas , and Oaxaca Mexico – These projects seek to raise the awareness of problems associated with water , sanitation , and inadequate hygiene to the school communities through diverse activities of monitoring , assessment , education , and communication and training in ecological sanitation .
These are just a few of the projects from GWC .
For a full list , see the GWC Project Page .
GWC has three main criteria for their projects :
They all must be sustainable , replicable , and scalable .
Sustainable :
All projects must have plans for long - term .
Sustainable projects maintain the local water source and build local capacity in order to maintain and operate a water system .
This requires the involvement of the local community , local government , and local businesses , For each system that does n’t have to be replaced , more resources will be available in the future for new projects .
Replicable : GWC measures impacts and benefits consistently , communicating these clearly throughout the project .
Monitoring programs and sharing information helps communities , governments , local entrepreneurs , and non-profits working in this sector .
Having access to results allows leaders in the field to replicate the program on their own .
Scaleable : GWC invests in successful models with the potential to expand beyond a particular area .
These models should be flexible enough to meet the demands of individual localities .

Obama Vows Dramatic Action Towards a Greener Economy
In a speech at George Mason University , Obama said the multi-billion dollar American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan he will advance immediately after he takes office on January 20 , represents " not just new policy , but a whole new approach to meeting our most urgent challenges . "

" To finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy , we will double the production of alternative energy in the next three years , " Obama said .
" We will modernize more than 75 percent of federal buildings and improve the energy efficiency of two million American homes , saving consumers and taxpayers billions on our energy bills . "
" In the process , we will put Americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced , " said Obama , " jobs building solar panels and wind turbines ; constructing fuel - efficient cars and buildings ; and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs , more savings , and a cleaner , safer planet in the bargain . "
The new Democrat - controlled Congress opened on Tuesday , with indications that Obama 's plan will receive support .
At a forum Wednesday held by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California , said that Congress will move quickly to implement the plan .
Said Pelosi , " We will be working in the days ahead with our President - elect so we have legislation before we observe President 's Day this year . "

At a news conference Wednesday , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada detailed the top 10 priorities for the new Congress , beginning with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help improve the economy .
" This Congress , Democrats have one explicit goal : to deliver the change Americans have demanded , " Reid said .
" We are confronting some of the most severe problems we have faced in generations .
They did n't happen overnight and they wo n't be solved in a day , but by working together in a bipartisan fashion , Democrats know we can move our country forward . "
Bipartisanship is an integral feature of the plan , Obama said today .
Pledging transparency in decisionmaking , he said , " The American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan wo n't just throw money at our problems - we 'll invest in what works .
The true test of the policies we 'll pursue wo n't be whether they 're Democratic or Republican ideas , but whether they create jobs , grow our economy , and put the American Dream within reach of the American people .
Many environmentalists support Obama 's plan .
Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder said , " America is facing profound and deeply intertwined energy and economic crises .
President - elect Obama 's speech today indicates he understands the tremendous scope and interrelated nature of these challenges - and that he is committed to leading the bold , transformative changes that will be needed to solve them . "
" With his leadership , " said Blackwelder , " we can create millions of green jobs " and revitalize our economy , while building a clean and efficient 21st Century infrastructure . "

Friends of the Earth is running a " New Roads = New Pollution " campaign to encourage smart transportation investments in the stimulus package and to block funding for new roads .
Instead , the group wants Obama to direct funding towards improving and expanding clean transportation options , including public transit and passenger rail , as well as on maintaining and repairing the roads and bridges that already exist .
" Dollar for dollar , " said Blackwelder , " investments in public transportation and road and bridge repair create more jobs than new road construction and lead to cleaner air and less pollution . "
The advocacy organization Environmental Defense today issued a transportation policy statement that urges the Obama administration and Congress to focus on " getting more value from existing infrastructure " to improve transportation , put Americans to work now , save money in the long run and reduce health - threatening air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions .
Policymakers should , " Increase support for transit in cities of all sizes and in all regions of the country , " said Environmental Defense , putting the emphasis on " innovative but proven systems , such as bus - rapid - transit , that can deliver service quickly using the country 's existing road infrastructure . "

In a letter delivered to Congress Wednesday , 159 businesses and organizations in the Sustainable Energy Network , joined by 61 individual activists , urged the lawmakers to focus on sustainable energy technologies and green jobs , but not nuclear power and fossil fuels , when they consider the economic stimulus bill this week .
The letter argues that " funding should be targeted at those energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that can be brought on line quickly , will maximize job creation , will curb greenhouse gases and energy imports , and have the least adverse social and environmental impacts . "
Obama said today that his American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan will " put people to work repairing crumbling roads , bridges , and schools by eliminating the backlog of well - planned , worthy and needed infrastructure projects . "
To " retrofit America for a global economy " he plans to update electricity transmission by building " a new smart grid that will save us money , protect our power sources from blackout or attack , and deliver clean , alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation . "
He plans to expand broadband lines across America , " so that a small business in a rural town can connect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world . "
But Obama did not minimize the difficult problems he faces as he takes the reins of power on January 20 .
" We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime - a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks , " said the president - elect .
" Nearly two million jobs have now been lost , and on Friday we are likely to learn that we lost more jobs last year than at any time since World War II . "
Obama listed America 's economic woes - manufacturing at a 28 year low , businesses that cannot borrow or make payroll , families who cannot pay their bills or their mortgages , workers watching their life savings disappear .
A new smart grid is needed to move power from new alternative energy sources such as this SunEdison photovoltaic power plant near Alamosa , Colorado .

" I do n't believe it 's too late to change course , but it will be if we do n't take dramatic action as soon as possible , " he said .
" If nothing is done , this recession could linger for years .
The unemployment rate could reach double digits .
Our economy could fall $ 1 trillion short of its full capacity , which translates into more than $ 12,000 in lost income for a family of four . "
" We could lose a generation of potential and promise , as more young Americans are forced to forgo dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future , " Obama said .
" And our nation could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and standing in the world . "
Obama placed the blame for America 's weakened economy on " an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from corporate boardrooms to the halls of power in Washington , DC , " reciting the now well - known problems - " imprudent and dangerous decisions " by Wall Street executives , banks and borrowers , and politicians who have " spent taxpayer money without wisdom or discipline . "
" The result has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our economy , our financial markets , and our government , " he said .
But sounding his perennial message of hope , Obama said opportunity and prosperity can be restored , and he promised to begin rebuilding America immediately .
" The very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it is not beyond our ability to solve , " he said .
" Our problems are rooted in past mistakes , not our capacity for future greatness . "
While the current global financial crisis has added to the grimness , the root causes lie in Japan ’s rural economic system of tiny , woefully inefficient family farms , which dates back to the end of World War II .
But while many farmers and agriculture experts agree that this system is breaking down , change has been blocked by an array of vested interests and a fear of disturbing the established ways .
The question now is whether some sort of breaking point might soon be reached .
A change could be significant because rural voters form the base of a political pyramid at whose apex stands the Liberal Democratic Party , which has governed Japan for more than half a century .
The party is expected to face a tight race with the main opposition Democratic Party in general elections that must be called by early September .
In rural regions like Yamagata , the northern rice basket prefecture where Shonai is located , the signs remain mixed .
Takashi Kudo , the owner of a construction company here , said he remained a loyal supporter of Liberal Democratic lawmakers , who helped the local economy and his company with spending on local projects .
Now , however , he said that his company ’s sales have dropped by two - thirds over the last decade , forcing him to lay off half of his 23 employees .
Times are so tough that the local Shinto shrine has stopped hiring musicians for summer festivals , he said .
Local residents feel abandoned by the party , leading to declining membership in election support groups , he said .
But residents are not embracing the opposition , which he said suffered from the same lack of direction as the governing party .
“ The reaction has been political disillusionment , not political revolt , ” said Mr. Kudo , 45 , sitting in his office below a photograph of his district ’s Liberal Democratic lawmaker , Koichi Kato .
Still , there are growing calls here to give the Democrats a try .
In January , a little - known school board member who ran as the opposition candidate unseated the incumbent Liberal Democrat to become governor of Yamagata , which had been firmly Liberal Democratic for generations .

We all have heard the term “ Crafty Veteran ” referring to a player that has all sorts of tricks up his sleeve to get an advantage on the competition .
Things like the Vlade Divac flop , the Bruce Bowen close out , the Shaquille O’Neal dislodge , the Allen Iverson passing lane play , the Paul Pierce stutter step , and the Jason Kidd ball fake .
All of which are veteran moves by veteran players to help them get an edge .
Well add a new one to that list .
Except this guy is n’t considered a veteran yet by any stretch of the imagination .
I ’m talking about Chris Paul , point guard of the New Orleans Hornets .
Sure he ’s an All - star , and MVP candidate , but certainly not a ‘ veteran ’ .
But one thing ’s for sure , he ’s “ crafty ” .
Check out the video below of Chris Paul on the break dribbling the ball to himself through Jason Terry ’s legs at high speed , then dishing the ball to Rasual Butler for the finish .
Very crafty my friend , very crafty :
A plan to save £ 263 m and create 4,500 high - tech jobs at an MoD plant to service Tornado jets was branded a disaster today as auditors found it actually cost £ 113 m and created just 45 new jobs .
A joint report by the National Audit Office and the Wales Audit Office blamed the Ministry of Defence and the Welsh government for failing to liaise over the project at St Athan in south Wales .
The venture fell apart when the MOD closed down the brand new facility with the loss of 1,900 jobs just five years after it was opened .
Plans to attract high - tech industries round the plant then collapsed – and the Welsh authorities could only get four companies , employing 45 people , to move on to the giant site .
The audit investigation found that competing strategies between the MoD and the Welsh government meant the scheme – named Red Dragon – never got off the ground properly .
Instead the MoD found it could save up to £ 1bn over 10 years if it closed down St Athan and serviced the jets instead at RAF Marham in Norfolk and RAF Cottesmore in Rutland .
The Welsh government was not told of the change of plan , which undermined its plans for developing the area .
The decision to close the fast jets and engines business of Dara , the Defence Aviation Repair Agency , provoked a huge row in 2005 .
Trade unions , MPs and the all - party Commons defence committee condemned the move .
The committee concluded it was " perverse and wasteful for the MoD to invest large amounts of public money to renovate the facilities at RAF Marham when it has at its disposal a state - of - the - art facility at St Athan " .
The committee said : " It is doubtful that the facilities at RAF Marham will ever match those at Dara St Athan . "
The ' super - hanger ' at St Athan is , according to the auditor , now largely empty .
Tim Burr , head of the National Audit Office , said today : " Both the Ministry of Defence and the Welsh authorities have invested a considerable amount of time , effort and money in creating modern aviation repair facilities in south Wales , with a super - hangar which is now sitting almost empty . "
Jeremy Colman , Wales 's auditor general , added : " The Ministry of Defence and the Welsh authorities failed to collaborate sufficiently throughout the project .
Although for much of the time both had complementary objectives , they did not establish a common purpose for the project or a common understanding of their respective assumptions about the future of the site .
The Red Dragon project highlights the danger in large and complex projects that involve multiple public bodies of insufficient openness and information sharing . "
Politicians were more critical .
Liam
Fox , the shadow defence secretary , said : " What began as a flag - waving exercise in high - tech job creation has turned into a disaster for the MoD .
The target of 4,500 jobs has produced only 45 , costing the taxpayer £ 2.5 m per job .
It 's the same old story of Labour dithering and incompetence , resulting in uncertainty and upheaval . "
Richard Bacon , a member of the Commons public accounts committee , said : " It is now clear that Red Dragon was doomed from the start .
The MoD and the Welsh authorities wanted different things from the deal , with the MoD looking to repair jets more efficiently and the Welsh authorities seeking to protect local jobs .
What 's more , when it signed Red Dragon , the MoD had apparently forgotten that it had only just commissioned a review of aircraft support , which eventually led to St Athan 's closure .
" The MoD and the Welsh authorities should have made absolutely certain they understood each other 's position on Red Dragon .
In future , deals of this nature should be based on clear and unambiguous understanding of where all parties are coming from . "
The report says the MoD and the Welsh authorities are looking at an alternative use for the site .
" There are plans by the MoD to establish a defence training academy using the super - hangar , which the MoD and Welsh authorities expect to bring significant economic benefits to south Wales .
The MoD and the Welsh authorities expect that the academy will bring over 5,500 jobs to the area although a third are likely to be filled by staff relocating from other parts of the UK .
The Welsh authorities also expect that the academy will provide an impetus for plans for an aerospace park , potentially creating around an additional 2,000 jobs . "
先 日Zope 2.12のalpha1がリリースされて、 いろいろ面白いことになっているので、 手元で遊んでみていました。 Zope 2.12自体でも 、Zope 3のオブジェクトがそのまま使えるようになったりとか（aq_parentとかをハックしている）、いくつか楽しい変更があるんですが、Python 2.5/2.6をサポートしたのはかなり大きな進展です。
残念ながら手元の環境のRPMはPython 2.5.2なので 、Zope 2.12が対応している2.5.4 or better、2.6.xという条件に当てはまりません。
面倒くさいので、手っ取り早く2.6.1をダウンロードしてきて、手元でビルドして使ったんですが、一応動いているように見えます。
Zope自体の話を書いてもいいんですが、ここではPython 2.6の話を書きます。 せっかく最近のPythonが使えるようになったんだから、この際Python界がどう発展しているのか調べてみようと思い立ちました。
詳細は 、What ’s New in Python 2.6を見てほしいのですが、その中でも PEP 3119 -- Introducing Abstract Base Classesへの対応が興味深いと感じました。
Abstract Base Classes（ABCs）というのは、手っ取り早くいうと、C++でいうところのvirtualが使われたクラスみたいなものです。
PEP 3119にたくさん書いてありますが、純粋
なDuck typingだと、 あるオブジェクトが何をしてくれるのかがよくわかりません。
例のPEPでは、Invocation とInspectionという言葉を使っていますが、 Invocationというのはオブジェクトを実際に使ってみて、それで何かが起きるってことで、Inspectionというのはオブジェクトを動かさずに何ができるか調べるってことです。
Invocation はDuck typingで普通にやってるわけですが、 Inspectionは今 のPythonの組込み機能だと型を調べるしかありません。 そうすると 、Duck typingができなくなってしまいます。 現実にはもうちょっと「合わせ技」みたいなことがやりたくなることが多々あるわけです。 つまり、「このオブジェクトはこの型だからこれができる」みたいなのじゃなくて、「このオブジェクトはこれができると言っているからこれができる」みたいな。
それで、ABCっていうのは、一種のメタクラスを使って、そういう「これはこのことができるもの」みたいなことを意味するクラスを作って、それをクラスの継承関係に混ぜ合わせようってわけ。
Pythonをまともに知っている人なら誰でも知っているように、
「 ABCsってzope.interfaceと被ってない？」と疑問に思うわけです。 zope.interfaceは、クラスの継承関係とは完全に分離してインターフェースを管理し、インターフェース・クラスには絶対にコードを書かないという方針です。
しかし最終的にできることはかなり似通っています。
実際、議論は白熱していて、 PEP 3119の最後の方に はInterface擁護者を煽っているとしか思えない記述があったり、
[ Python - 3000 ] ABC's , Roles , etcで始まるスレッドで全くかみ合ってなかったり、
PEP 3124（現在は保留状態）ではInterfaceなんか使わなくてもAdaptationはABCsで可能だと提案したり、
Explaining Why Interfaces Are GreatでTwistedの人が強力にzope.intefaceをサポートしたり。
みんなあちこちでいろんなことを言ってますが、 簡単にまとめると、ABC擁護者の言い分は
Adaptationなんて 、Zopeぐらい（滅多にない巨大なプロジェクト）でしか役に立たない。
Interfaceは、問題そのものではなくて、解決方法に重点を置きすぎる。
Adaptationよ りGeneric Functionの方がよい。（GFはどっちでもできるけれど、それならABCsの方が単純でよい。）
ABCsなら自分が必要な部分だけ実装すればいいが、Interfaceだと全部作らないといけない。
Interface擁護者の言い分は
ABCsだと、どれが実装でどれがインターフェースのことを意味しているのかがごた混ぜ。だから、Documentation（インターフェースの人間用の説明）にならないし、isinstanceとかissubclassがクラス関係のことを意味しているのか何なのかわからない。
ABCsだと、Verification（ある実装が本当にインターフェースを満たしているか確認すること）ができない。
ABCsは、クラスに頼りすぎ。そんなのOOPじゃない。zope.interfaceはどんなオブジェクトにも使える。
ABCsだって汎用的なメソッドを先に書くことになるじゃないか。overloadとか先に書くことになるじゃないか。云々。
言語屋さんの喧嘩を見ていると確かに楽しいんですけど、
実際的なプログラマである私の立場からすれば、
どっちにするにせよ、どっちかにならないと面倒くさいと感じます。
実際、他の人が作ったライブラリを使おうとして、それが自分の使っていない方法を使っていたりすると、外部からいちいち調整してあげないといけなくなってしまうからです。
これが私がときどき言っている「制限がある方が出来ることが増える」というパターンの一種で、みんながてんでばらばらなことをし始めると、
くっつけられなくなるので困るんですね。 「後付けの方が自由度が高いので出来ることが多い」なんて主張している人を見ると、どんだけナイーブなんだ、この人は、と感じてしまいます。
個人的には、分離するzope.interfaceの方が良い気がするんですけどね。 しかし、私はC++のクラス指向にうんざりしたり、zopeに洗脳されていたりするんで、バイアスのかかった意見なのかもしれません。
Newly minted US Senator and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - NY ) and New York State Senator ( and retired dairy farmer ) Darrel Aubertine wrote Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack a letter on February 26th asking that the USDA re-evaluate what is considered “ processed ” for the food in the national school Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program ( FFVP ) .
No , these two senators are not lobbying for the Corn Refiners Association — they are pushing for local food .
FFVP was created by the USDA in 2002 to allocate more fruits and vegetables , served as “ snacks ” outside the school lunch and breakfast programs , to students at lower - income schools all over the country .
Thus the kids most at risk for obesity and diabetes get access to fruits and veggies .
One complication : much of the fruits and vegetables served to students outside of the lunchroom will need minimal handling before getting into student hands , lest apples become baseballs .
But cafeterias are not prepared time - wise , skill - wise or workman ’s comp-wise for this endeavor , not to mention that cafeteria kitchens are at best giant reheating stations .
So for the time being , to get the freshest food it is best to outsource the cutting and bagging to a local value - add facility or local producer , until we build better infrastructure and train our cafeteria ladies to cook .
The FFVP was continued by the 2008 Farm Bill , which allows a “ geographic preference for the procurement of unprocessed , locally grown and raised agricultural products , ” for school lunch , breakfast and snack programs , as long as a competitive price is maintained .
But the Farm Bill also states that “ de minimis handling and preparation might be necessary to present an agricultural product to a school food authority in a useable form . ”

But as a part of Bush ’s midnight regulations in January ( when he and his cronies essentially trashed things further before heading out the door ) , his USDA Food and Nutrition Service re-defined what is considered “ processed , ” including that which is chopped , sliced or diced — effectively blocking fruits and vegetables from local sourcing , and from the hands of those who need real food the most .
Clearly Bush officials were taking liberties with the wording .
From the Farm Bill :
The Managers do not intend that the Food and Nutrition Service interpret the term “ unprocessed ” literally , but rather intend that it be logically implemented .
In specifying the term “ unprocessed , ” the Managers ’ use of the term intends to preclude the use of geographic preference for agricultural products that have significant value added components .
Of course , we ’re not talking about local Wonderbread or cheesedoodles here .
Chopped apples , carrots , broccoli and their ilk , prepared nearby , will now lose this market share to the big ag processors simply because of wording .
From Gillibrand and Aubertine ’s letter :
The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program requires these snacks be served outside of standard school meal programs .
Therefore , it is illogical to prohibit local produce as “ processed ” simply because it is in a form that can be served to students outside of the lunchroom .
Unlike most midnight regulations , this effort should n’t require a change of policy , but just a re-wording .
So if it ’s so simple , why has n’t Vilsack responded ?
Maybe he would argue he has a lot on his plate .
Time will tell if Vilsack can impress the Real Food Lobby ( that ’s you , eaters with a conscience everywhere ) with decisions that improve our food system , or whether he ’ll continue to bolster big business in food and entertainment .
Prolog Tutorial
J. A. Robinson : A program is a theory ( in some logic ) and computation is deduction from the theory .
N. Wirth : Program = data structure + algorithm
R. Kowalski : Algorithm = logic + control
Introduction
Prolog , which stands for PROgramming in LOGic , is the most widely available language in the logic programming paradigm .
Logic and therefore Prolog is based the mathematical notions of relations and logical inference .
Prolog is a declarative language meaning that rather than describing how to compute a solution , a program consists of a data base of facts and logical relationships ( rules ) which describe the relationships which hold for the given application .
Rather then running a program to obtain a solution , the user asks a question .
When asked a question , the run time system searches through the data base of facts and rules to determine ( by logical deduction ) the answer .
Among the features of Prolog are `logical variables ' meaning that they behave like mathematical variables , a powerful pattern - matching facility ( unification ) , a backtracking strategy to search for proofs , uniform data structures , and input and output are interchangeable .
Often there will be more than one way to deduce the answer or there will be more than one solution , in such cases the run time system may be asked find other solutions .
backtracking to generate alternative solutions .
Prolog is a weakly typed language with dynamic type checking and static scope rules .
Prolog is used in artificial intelligence applications such as natural language interfaces , automated reasoning systems and expert systems .
Expert systems usually consist of a data base of facts and rules and an inference engine , the run time system of Prolog provides much of the services of an inference engine .
The Structure of Prolog Programs
A Prolog program consists of a database of facts and rules , and queries ( questions ) .
Fact : ... .
Rule : ... :- ... .
Query : ?- ... .
Variables : must begin with an upper case letter .
Constants : numbers , begin with lowercase letter , or enclosed in single quotes .
Inductive definitions : base and inductive cases
Towers of Hanoi : move N disks from pin a to pin b using pin c .
hanoi( N ) :- hanoi( N , a , b , c ) . hanoi( 0 , _ , _ , _ ) .
hanoi( N , FromPin , ToPin , UsingPin ) :- M is N - 1 , hanoi( M , FromPin , UsingPin , ToPin ) , move ( FromPin , ToPin ) , hanoi( M , UsingPin , ToPin , FromPin ) .
move ( From , To ) :- write ( [ move , disk from , pin , From , to , pin , ToPin ] ) , nl. Lists : append , member
list ( [ ] ) .
list ( [ X|L ] ) :- [ list ( L ) .
Abbrev : [ X 1 |[ ...[ X n |[ ] ...] = [ X 1 , ...X n ] append ( [ ] , L, L ) .
append ( [ X|L1 ] , L2, [X|L12 ] ) :- append ( L1,L2,L12 ) . member ( X,L ) :- concat( _ , [ X|_ ] , L ) .
Ancestor
ancestor ( A,D ) :- parent ( A , B ) . ancestor ( A , D ) :- parent ( A , C ) , ancestor ( C , D ) . but not ancestor ( A , D ) :- ancestor ( A , P ) , parent ( P , D ) . since infinite recursion may result .
Depth - first search : Maze / Graph traversal
A database of arcs ( we will assume they are directed arcs ) of the form :
A database of arcs ( we will assume they are directed arcs ) of the form : a( node_i , node_j ) .
Rules for searching the graph : go ( From , To , Trail ) .
go( From , To , Trail ) :- a( From , In ) , not visited ( In , Trail ) , go ( In , To , [ In|Trail ] ) .
visited ( A , T ) :- member ( A , T ) .
I/O : terms , characters , files , lexical analyzer / scanner
read ( T ) , write ( T ) , nl .
get0 ( N ) , put ( N ) : ascii value of character
name ( Name , Ascii_list ) .
see ( F ) , seeing ( F ) , seen , tell ( F ) , telling ( F ) , told .
Natural language processing : Context - free grammars may be represented as Prolog rules .
For example , the rule sentence ::= noun_clause verb_clause can be implemented in Prolog as sentence ( S ) :- append ( NC , VC,S ) , noun_clause ( NC ) , verb_clause ( VC ) .
or in DCG as : sentence -> noun_clause , verb_clause . ?- sentence ( S , [ ] ) .
Note that two arguments appear in the query .
Both are lists and the first is the sentence to be parsed , the second the remaining elements of the list which in this case is empty .
A Prolog program consists of a data base of facts and rules .
There is no structure imposed on a Prolog program , there is no main procedure , and there is no nesting of definitions .
All facts and rules are global in scope and the scope of a variable is the fact or rule in which it appears .
The readability of a Prolog program is left up to the programmer .
A Prolog program is executed by asking a question .
The question is called a query .
Facts , rules , and queries are called clauses .
Syntax
Facts
A fact is just what it appears to be --- a fact .
A fact in everyday language is often a proposition like ``It is sunny . '' or `` It is summer . ''
In Prolog such facts could be represented as follows :
' It is sunny ' .
' It is summer ' .
Queries
A query in Prolog is the action of asking the program about information contained within its data base .
Thus , queries usually occur in the interactive mode .
After a program is loaded , you will receive the query prompt ,
?-
at which time you can ask the run time system about information in the data base .
Using the simple data base above , you can ask the program a question such as
?- ' It is sunny ' .
and it will respond with the answer
Yes ?-
A yes means that the information in the data base is consistent with the subject of the query .
Another way to express this is that the program is capable of proving the query true with the available information in the data base .
If a fact is not deducible from the data base the system replys with a no , which indicates that based on the information available ( the closed world assumption ) the fact is not deducible .
If the data base does not contain sufficient information to answer a query , then it answers the query with a no .
?- ' It is cold ' .
no ?-
Rules
Rules extend the capabilities of a logic program .
They are what give Prolog the ability to pursue its decision - making process .
The following program contains two rules for temperature .
The first rule is read as follows : `` It is hot if it is summer and it is sunny . ''
The second rule is read as follows : `` It is cold if it is winter and it is snowing . ''
' It is sunny ' .
' It is summer ' .
' It is hot ' :-
' It is summer ' , ' It is sunny ' .
' It is cold ' :-
' It is winter ' , ' It is snowing ' .
The query ,
?- ' It is hot ' .
Yes ?-
is answered in the affirmative since both ' It is summer ' and ' It is sunny ' are in the data base while a query `` ?- ' It is cold . ' '' will produce a negative response .
The previous program is an example of propositional logic .
Facts and rules may be parameterized to produce programs in predicate logic .
The parameters may be variables , atoms , numbers , or terms .
Parameterization permits the definition of more complex relationships .
The following program contains a number of predicates that describe a family 's genelogical relationships .
female ( amy ) . female ( johnette ) .
male ( anthony ) .
male ( bruce ) .
male ( ogden ) .
parentof ( amy , johnette ) .
parentof ( amy , anthony ) .
parentof ( amy , bruce ) .
parentof ( ogden , johnette ) .
parentof ( ogden , anthony ) .
parentof ( ogden , bruce ) .
The above program contains the three simple predicates : female ; male ; and parentof .
They are parameterized with what are called `atoms . '
There are other family relationships which could also be written as facts , but this is a tedious process .
Assuming traditional marriage and child - bearing practices , we could write a few rules which would relieve the tedium of identifying and listing all the possible family relations .
For example , say you wanted to know if johnette had any siblings , the first question you must ask is ``what does it mean to be a sibling ? ''
To be someone 's sibling you must have the same parent .
This last sentence can be written in Prolog as
siblingof ( X, Y ) :- parentof ( Z,X ) , parentof ( Z , Y ) .
A translation of the above Prolog rule into English would be ``X is the sibling of Y provided that Z is a parent of X , and Z is a parent of Y.'' X , Y , and Z are variables .
This rule however , also defines a child to be its own sibling .
To correct this we must add that X and Y are not the same .
The corrected version is :
siblingof ( X, Y ) :- parentof ( Z,X ) , parentof ( Z , Y ) , X Y .
The relation brotherof is similar but adds the condition that X must be a male .
brotherof ( X , Y ) :- parentof ( Z,X ) , male ( X ) , parentof ( Z , Y ) , X Y .
From these examples we see how to construct facts , rules and queries and that strings are enclosed in single quotes , variables begin with a capital letter , constants are either enclosed in single quotes or begin with a small letter .
Types
Prolog provides for numbers , atoms , lists , tuples , and patterns .
The types of objects that can be passed as arguments are defined in this section .
Simple Types
Simple types are implementation dependent in Prolog however , most implementations provide the simple types summarized in the following table .
TYPE VALUES boolean true , fail integer integers real floating point numbers variable variables atom character sequences
The boolean constants are not usually passed as parameters but are propositions .
The constant fail is useful in forcing the generation of all solutions .
Variables are character strings beginning with a capital letter .
Atoms are either quoted character strings or unquoted strings beginning with a small letter .
Composite Types
In Prolog the distinction between programs and data are blurred .
Facts and rules are used as data and data is often passed in the arguments to the predicates .
Lists are the most common data structure in Prolog .
They are much like the array in that they are a sequential list of elements , and much like the stack in that you can only access the list of elements sequentially , that is , from one end only and not in random order .
In addition to lists Prolog permits arbitrary patterns as data .
The patterns can be used to represent tuples .
Prolog does not provide an array type .
But arrays may be represented as a list and multidimensional arrays as a list ( s ) of lists .
An alternate representation is to represent an array as a set of facts in a the data base .
TYPE REPRESENTATION
list [ comma separated sequence of items ]
pattern sequence of items
A list is designated in Prolog by square brackets ( [ ] + ) .
An example of a list is
[ dog , cat , mouse ]
This says that the list contains the elements dog , {\tt cat , and mouse , in that order .
Elements in a Prolog list are ordered , even though there are no indexes .
Records or tuples are represented as patterns .
Here is an example .
book ( author ( aaby , anthony ) , title ( lab m anual ) , data( 1991 ) )
The elements of a tuple are accessed by pattern matching .
book ( Title , Author , Publisher , Date ) . author ( LastName , FirstName , MI ) . publisher ( Company , City ) .
book ( T , A, publisher ( C , rome ) , Date )
Type Predicates
Since Prolog is a weakly typed language , it is important for the user to be able to determine the type of a parameter .
The following built in predicates are used to determine the type of a parameter .
PREDICATE CHECKS IF var(V ) V is a variable nonvar ( NV ) NV is not a variable atom ( A ) A is an atom integer ( I ) I is an integer real ( R ) R is a floating point number number ( N ) N is an integer or real atomic( A )
A is an atom or a number functor ( T , F , A ) T is a term with functor F and arity A T =..L T is a term , L is a list ( see example below ) .
clause ( H , T) H :- T is a rule in the program
The last three are useful in program manipulation ( metalogical or meta- programming ) and require additional explanation .
clause ( H , T ) is used to check the contents of the data base .
functor ( T , F, A ) and T=..L are used to manipulate terms .
The predicate , functor is used as follows .
functor ( T , F , A )
T is a term , F is its functor , and A is its arity .
For example ,
?- functor ( t ( a , b , c ) , F , A ) .
F = t A = 3 yes
t is the functor of the term t( a , b , c ) , and 3 is the arity ( number of arguments ) of the term .
The predicate =.. ( univ ) is used to compose and decompose terms .
For example :
?- t( a , b, c ) =..L. L = [ t , a , b, c ] yes ?- T =..[ t , a , b, c ] .
T = t( a , b, c ) yes
Expressions
Arithmetic expressions are evaluated with the built in predicate is which is used as an infix operator in the following form .
variable is expression
For example ,
?- X is 3 * 4 . X = 12 yes
Arithmetic Operators
Prolog provides the standard arithmetic operations as summarized in the following table .
SYMBOL OPERATION + addition - subtraction * multiplication / real division // integer division mod modulus ** power
Boolean Predicates
Besides the usual boolean predicates , Prolog provides more general comparison operators which compare terms and predicates to test for unifiability and whether terms are identical .
SYMBOL OPERATION ACTION A ?= B unifiable A and B are unifiable but does not unify A and B A = B unify unifys A and B if possible A \+= B not unifiable A == B identical does not unify A and B A \+== B not identical A =:= B equal ( value ) evaluates A and B to determine if equal A =\+= B not equal ( value ) A < B less than ( numeric ) A =< B less or equal ( numeric ) A > B greater than ( numeric ) A >= B greater or equal ( numeric ) A @< B less than ( terms ) A @=< B less or equal ( terms ) A @> B greater than ( terms ) A @>= B greater or equal ( terms )
For example , the following are all true .
3 @< 4 3 @< a a @< abc6 abc6 @< t( c , d ) t( c , d ) @< t( c, d , X )
Logic programming definition of natural number .
% natural_number ( N ) <- N is a natural number . natural_number ( 0 ) . natural_number(s( N ) ) :- natural_number ( N ) .
Prolog definition of natural number .
natural_number ( N ) :- integer ( N ) , N >= 0 .
Logic programming definition of inequalities
% less_than( M,N ) <- M is less than M less_than ( 0 , s ( M ) ) :- natural_number ( M ) . less_than(s ( M ) , s( N ) ) :- less_than( M,N ) . % less_than_or_equal( M,N ) <- M is less than or equal to M less_than_or_equal ( 0,N ) :- natural_number ( N ) . less_than_or_equal(s( M ) , s( N ) ) :- less_than_or_equal ( M,N ) .
Prolog definition of inequality .
M =< N .
Logic programming definition of addition / substraction
% plus(X , Y , Z ) <- Z is X + Y plus( 0 , N,N ) :- natural_number ( N ) . plus(s ( M ) , N, s( Z ) ) :- plus( M , N , Z ) .
Prolog definition of addition
plus( M , N, Sum ) :- Sum is M+N .
This does not define substration .
Logic programming definition of multiplication / division
% times ( X , Y , Z ) <- Z is X*Y times ( 0, N,0 ) :- natural_number ( N ) . times ( s ( M ) , N , Z ) :- times ( M , N , W ) , plus ( W , N , Z ) .
Prolog definition of multiplication .
times ( M, N, Product ) :- Product is M*N .
This does not define substration .
Logic programming definition of Exponentiation
% exp( N,X , Z ) <- Z is X ** N exp (s ( M ) ,0,0 ) :- natural_number ( M ) . exp ( 0 , s( M ) , s( 0 ) ) :- natural_number ( M ) . exp ( s ( N ) , X , Z ) :- exp ( N , X , Y ) , times ( X , Y , Z ) .
Prolog definition of exponentiation is implementation dependent .
Logical Operators
Predicates are functions which return a boolean value .
Thus the logical operators are built in to the language .
The comma on the right hand side of a rule is logical conjunction .
The symbol :- is logical implication .
In addition Prolog provides negation and disjunction operators .
The logical operators are used in the definition of rules .
Thus ,
a :- b. % a if b a :- b, c. % a if b and c. a :- b;c. % a if b or c. a :- \++ b. % a if b is not provable a :- not b. % a if b fails a :- b -> c;d. % a if ( if b then c else d)
This table summarizes the logical operators .
SYMBOL OPERATION not negation \+ not provable , logical conjunction ; logical disjunction :- logical implication -> if - then - else
Unification and Pattern Matching
The arguments in a query are matched ( or unified in Prolog terminology ) to select the appropriate rule .
Here is an example which makes extensive use of pattern matching .
The rules for computing the derivatives of polynomial expressions can be written as Prolog rules .
A given polynomial expression is matched against the first argument of the rule and the corresponding derivative is returned .
% deriv( Polynomial , variable , derivative ) % dc / dx = 0 deriv( C, X,0 ) :- number ( C ) . % dx / dx} = 1 deriv( X, X,1 ) . % d( cv ) / dx = c( dv/dx ) deriv( C* U,X, C*DU ) :- number ( C ) , deriv( U, X, DU ) . % d(u v ) /dx = u( dv/dx ) + v( du / dx ) deriv( U*V,X, U*DV + V*DU ) :- deriv( U, X, DU ) , deriv( V, X , DV ) . % d(u ± v ) / dx = du/dx ± dv/dx deriv( U+V,X , DU+DV ) :- deriv( U, X, DU ) , deriv( V, X , DV ) .
deriv( U - V,X , DU - DV ) :- deriv( U, X, DU ) , deriv( V, X , DV ) . % du^n / dx = nu^{n - 1} ( du /dx ) deriv( U^+N,X,N*U^+N1*DU ) :- N1 is N - 1 , deriv( U, X, DU ) .
Prolog code is often bidirectional .
In bidirectional code , the arguments may be use either for input or output .
For example , this code may be used for both differentiation and integration with queries of the form :
?- deriv( Integral , X , Derivative ) .
where either Integral or Derivative may be instantiated to a formula .
Functions
Prolog does not provide for a function type therefore , functions must be defined as relations .
That is , both the arguments to the function and the result of the function must be parameters to the relation .
This means that composition of two functions cannot be constructed .
As an example , here is the factorial function defined as relation in Prolog .
Note that the definition requires two rules , one for the base case and one for the inductive case .
fac ( 0,1 ) . fac( N , F ) :- N > 0 , M is N - 1 , fac( M , Fm ) , F is N * Fm .
The second rule states that if N > 0 , M = N - 1 , Fm is ( N - 1 ) ! , and F = N * Fm , then F is N ! .
Notice how ` is ' is used .
In this example it resembles an assignment operator however , it may not be used to reassign a variable to a new value .
I the logical sense , the order of the clauses in the body of a rule are irrelevant however , the order may matter in a practical sense .
M must not be a variable in the recursive call otherwise an infinite loop will result .
Much of the clumsiness of this definition comes from the fact that fac is defined as a relation and thus it can not be used in an expression .
Relations are commonly defined using multiple rules and the order of the rules may determine the result .
In this case the rule order is irrelevant since , for each value of N only one rule is applicable .
Here are the Prolog equivalent of the definitions of the gcd function , Fibonacci function and ackerman 's function .
gcd( A, B, GCD ) :- A = B , GCD = A. gcd( A , B, GCD ) :- A < B , NB is B - A , gcd ( A , NB , GCD ) .
gcd( A, B, GCD ) :- A > B , NA is A - B , gcd( NA , B, GCD ) .
fib ( 0,1 ) . fib ( 1,1 ) . fib( N , F ) :- N > 1 , N1 is N - 1 , N2 is N - 2 , fib( N1, F1 ) , fib ( N2, F2 ) , F is F1 + F2 .
ack ( 0 , N, A ) :- A is N + 1 . ack ( M1,0 , A ) :- M > 0 , M is M - 1 , ack ( M, 1, A ) . ack ( M1,N1,A ) :- M1 > 0 , N1 > 0 , M is M - 1 , N is N - 1 , ack ( M1,N,A1 ) , ack ( M , A1 , A ) .
Notice that the definition of ackerman 's function is clumsier than the corresponding functional definition since the functional composition is not available .
Logic programming definition of the factorial function .

% minimum ( M , N , Min ) <-
Min is the minimum of { M , N} minimum ( M , N , M ) :- less_than_or_equal( M,N ) . minimum ( M , N,N ) :- less_than_or_equal ( N , M ) .
Prolog programming definition of the minimum .
minimum ( M, N , M ) :- M =< N. minimum ( M , N,N ) :- N =< M .
Logic programming definition of the modulus .
% mod(M, N, Mod ) <-
Mod is the remainder of the integer division of M by N. mod( X , Y , Z ) :- less_than ( Z , Y ) , times ( Y , Q , W ) , plus ( W , Z, X ) . % or mod( X , Y , X ) :- less_than ( X , Y ) . mod( X , Y , X ) :- plus( X1 , Y, X ) , mod( X1 , Y , Z ) .

Prolog definition of Ackermann 's function .
ack ( 0 , N, Val ) :- Val is N + 1 . ack ( M,0 , Val ) :- M > 0 , M1 is M - 1 , ack ( M1,1 , Val ) .
ack ( M, N, Val ) :- M > 0 , N > 0 , M1 is M - 1 , N1 is N - 1 , ack ( M , N1 , Val1 ) , ack ( M1 , Val1 , Val ) .
Logic programming definition of the Euclidian algorithm .
gcd(X,0,X ) :- X > 0. gcd ( X, Y , Gcd ) :- mod( X , Y , Z ) , gcd(Y , Z, Gcd ) .

Lists
Objective Outline Lists
Composition of Recursive Programs
Iteration
Lists are the basic data structure used in logic ( and functional ) programming .
Lists are a recursive data structure so recursion occurs naturally in the definitions of various list operations .
When defining operations on recursive data structures , the definition most often naturally follows the recursive definition of the data structure .
In the case of lists , the empty list is the base case .
So operations on lists must consider the empty list as a case .
The other cases involve a list which is composed of an element and a list .
Here is a recursive definition of the list data structure as found in Prolog .
List --> [ ]
List --> [ Element|List ]
Here are some examples of list representation , the first is the empty list .
Pair Syntax Element Syntax [ ] [ ] [ a | [ ] ] [ a ] [ a|b | [ ] ] [ a , b ] [ a |X ] [ a |X ] [ a|b|X ] [ a , b|X ]
Predicates on lists are often written using multiple rules .
One rule for the empty list ( the base case ) and a second rule for non empty lists .
For example , here is the definition of the predicate for the length of a list .
% length( List , Number ) <- Number is lenght of List length ( [ ] ,0 ) .
length ( [ H|T ] , N ) :- length ( T , M ) , N is M+1 .
Element of a list .
% member ( Element , List ) <- Element is an element of the list List member ( X , [ X|List ) .
member ( X , [Element|List ] ) :- member ( X , List ) .
Prefix of a list .
% prefix( Prefix , List ) <- Prefix is a prefix of list List prefix ( [ ] , List ) . prefix ( [ X| Prefix ] , [ X|List ] ) :- prefix ( Prefix , List ) .
Suffix of a list .
% suffix ( Suffix , List ) <- Suffix is a suffix of list List suffix ( Suffix , Suffix ) . prefix( Suffix , [ X|List ] ) :- suffix ( Suffix , List ) .
Append ( concatenate ) two lists .
% append ( List1 , List2 , List1List2 ) <- % List1 List2 is the result of concatenating List1 and List2. append ( [ ] , List , List ) .
append ([ Element| List1 ] , List2 , [Element|List1List2 ] ) :- append ( List1 , List2 , List1List2 ) .
Compare this code with the code for plus .
sublist -- define using
Suffix of a prefix
Prefix of a suffix
Recursive definition of sublist using prefix
Suffix of a prefix using append
Prefix of a suffix using append
member , prefix and suffix -- defined using append reverse , delete , select , sort , permutation , ordered , insert , quicksort .
Iteration
Iterative version of Length
% length( List , Number ) <- Number is lenght of List % Iterative version .
length ( List , LenghtofList ) :- length ( List,0 , LengthofList ) . % length ( SufixList , LengthofPrefix , LengthofList ) <- % LengthofList is LengthofPrefix + length of SufixList length ( [ ] , Lenghtof Prefix , Lengthof Prefix ) .
length ( [ Element| List ] , LengthofPrefix , LengthofList ) :- PrefixPlus1 is LengthofPrefix + 1 , length( List , PrefixPlus1 , LengthofList ) .
Iterative version of Reverse
% reverse( List , ReversedList ) <- ReversedList is List reversed . % Iterative version . reverse( List , RList ) :- reverse( List , [ ] , RList ) . % length ( SufixList , LengthofPrefix , LengthofList ) <- % LengthofList is LengthofPrefix + length of SufixList reverse ( [ ] , RL , RL ) .
reverse( [ Element| List ] , RevPrefix , RL ) :- reverse( List , [ Element|RevPrefix ] , RL ) .
Here are some simple examples of common list operations defined by pattern matching .
The first sums the elements of a list and the second forms the product of the elements of a list .
sum ( [ ] ,0 ) . sum ( [ X|L ] , Sum ) :- sum ( L,SL ) , Sum is X + SL. product ( [ ] , 1 ) . product ( [ X|L ] , Prod ) :- product ( L , PL ) , Prod is X * PL .
Another example common list operation is that of appending or the concatenation of two lists to form a third list .
Append may be described as the relation between three lists , L1 , L2 , L3 , where L1 = [ x 1 , ..., x m ] , L2 = [y 1 , ... ,y n ] and L3 = [ x 1 , ..., x m , y 1 , ... ,y n ] .
In Prolog , an inductive style definition is required .
append ( [ ] , L, L ) . append ( [ X1|L1 ] , L2 , [ X1|L3 ] ) :- append ( L1,L2,L3 ) .
The first rule is the base case .
The second rule is the inductive case .
In effect the second rule says that
if L1 = [ x 2 , ..., x m ] , L2 = [y 1 , ... ,y n ] and L3 = [ x 2 , ..., x m , y 1 , ... ,y n ] , then [ x 1 , x 2 , ..., x m , y 1 , ... ,y n ] , is the result of appending [ x 1 , x 2 , ..., x m ] and L2 .
The append relation is quite flexible .
It can be used to determine if an object is an element of a list , if a list is a prefix of a list and if a list is a suffix of a list .
member ( X,L ) :- append ( _ , [ X|_ ] , L ) . prefix ( Pre , L ) :- append ( Prefix , _, L ) . suffix ( L, Suf ) :- append( _ , Suf , L ) .
The underscore ( _+ ) in the definitions denotes an anonymous variable ( or don`t care ) whose value in immaterial to the definition .
The member relation can be used to derive other useful relations .
vowel ( X ) :- member ( X , [ a , e , i , o, u ] ) . digit ( D ) :- member ( D , [ '0 ' , '1 ' , ' 2 ' , '3 ' , '4 ' , '5 ' , '6 ' , '7 ' , '8 ' , ' 9 ' ] ) .
A predicate defining a list and its reversal can be defined using pattern matching and the append relation as follows .
reverse ( [ ] , [ ] ) . reverse ( [ X|L ] , Rev ) :- reverse ( L, RL ) , append ( RL , [ X ] , Rev ) .
Here is a more efficient ( iterative / tail recursive ) version .
reverse ( [ ] , [ ] ) . reverse( L , RL ) :- reverse( L , [ ] , RL ) . reverse ([ ] , RL , RL ) . reverse ( [ X|L ] , PRL , RL ) :- reverse( L , [ X|PRL ] , RL ) .
To conclude this section , here is a definition of insertion sort .
isort ( [ ] , [ ] ) . isort ( [ X|UnSorted ] , AllSorted ) :- isort ( UnSorted , Sorted ) , insert ( X , Sorted , AllSorted ) .
insert ( X , [ ] , [ X ] ) . insert ( X , [ Y|L ] , [X, Y|L ] ) :- X =< Y. insert ( X , [ Y|L ] , [ Y|IL ] ) :- X > Y , insert ( X , L, IL ) .
Iteration
Recursion is the only iterative method available in Prolog .
However , tail recursion can often be implemented as iteration .
The following definition of the factorial function is an `iterative ' definition because it is `tail recursive . '
It corresponds to an implementation using a while - loop in an imperative programming language .
fac ( 0,1 ) . fac( N , F ) :- N > 0 , fac( N,1 , F ) . fac ( 1 , F , F ) . fac( N , PP , F ) :- N > 1 , NPp is N*PP , M is N - 1 , fac( M , NPp , F ) .
Note that the second argument functions as an accumulator .
The accumulator is used to store the partial product much as might be done is a procedural language .
For example , in Pascal an iterative factorial function might be written as follows .
function fac( N:integer ) : integer ; var i : integer ; begin if N >= 0 then begin fac := 1 for I := 1 to N do fac := fac * I end end ;
In the Pascal solution fac acts as an accumulator to store the partial product .
The Prolog solution also illustrates the fact that Prolog permits different relations to be defined by the same name provided the number of arguments is different .
In this example the relations are fac / 2 and fac / 3 where fac is the ``functor " and the number refers to the arity of the predicate .
As an additional example of the use of accumulators , here is an iterative ( tail recursive version ) of the Fibonacci function .
fib ( 0,1 ) . fib ( 1,1 ) . fib( N , F ) :- N > 1 , fib ( N, 1,1 , F ) fib( 2, F1 , F2 , F ) :- F is F1 + F2. fib( N, F1 , F2 , F ) :- N > 2 , N1 is N - 1 , NF1 is F1 + F2 , fib( N1, NF1 , F1 , F ) .
Iterators , Generators and Backtracking
The following fact and rule can be used to generate the natural numbers .
% Natural Numbers
nat ( 0 ) . nat ( N ) :- nat ( M ) , N is M + 1 .
The successive numbers are generated by backtracking .
For example , when the following query is executed successive natural numbers are printed .
?- nat ( N ) , write ( N ) , nl , fail .
The first natural number is generated and printed , then fail forces backtracking to occur and the second rule is used to generate the successive natural numbers .
The following code generates successive prefixes of an infinite list beginning with N .
natlist ( N , [ N ] ) . natlist ( N , [ N|L ] ) :- N1 is N+1 , natlist ( N1,L ) .
As a final example , here is the code for generating successive prefixes of the list of prime numbers .
primes ( PL ) :- natlist ( 2,L2 ) , sieve ( L2 , PL ) . sieve ( [ ] , [ ] ) . sieve ( [ P|L ] , [ P|IDL ] ) :- sieveP ( P , L , PL ) , sieve ( PL , IDL ) .
sieveP ( P , [ ] , [ ] ) .
sieveP ( P , [ N|L ] , [ N|IDL ] ) :- N mod P > 0 , sieveP ( P , L, IDL ) .
sieveP ( P , [ N|L ] , IDL ) :- N mod P =:= 0 , sieveP ( P , L, IDL ) .
Occasionally , backtracking and multiple answers are annoying .
Prolog provides the cut symbol (! ) to control backtracking .
The following code defines a predicate where the third argument is the maximum of the first two .
max( A , B , M ) :- A < B , M = B. max( A , B , M ) :- A >= B , M = A .
The code may be simplified by dropping the conditions on the second rule .
max( A , B , B ) :- A < B. max ( A , B, A ) .
However , in the presence of backtracking , incorrect answers can result as is shown here .
?- max ( 3,4 , M ) . M = 4 ; M = 3
To prevent backtracking to the second rule the cut symbol is inserted into the first rule .
max( A , B , B ) :- A < B .!. max ( A , B, A ) .
Now the erroneous answer will not be generated .
A word of caution : cuts are similar to gotos in that they tend to increase the complexity of the code rather than to simplify it .
In general the use of cuts should be avoided .
Tuples ( or Records )
We illustrate the data type of tuples with the code for the abstract data type of a binary search tree .
The binary search tree is represented as either nil for the empty tree or as the tuple btree( Item , L_Tree , R_Tree ) .
Here is the Prolog code for the creation of an empty tree , insertion of an element into the tree , and an in - order traversal of the tree .
create_tree ( niltree ) . inserted_in_is( Item , niltree , btree ( Item , niltree , niltree ) ) .
inserted_in_is( Item , btree ( ItemI , L_T , R_T ) , Result_Tree ) :- Item @< ItemI , inserted_in_is( Item , L_Tree , Result_Tree ) . inserted_in_is( Item , btree ( ItemI , L_T , R_T ) , Result_Tree ) :- Item @> ItemI , inserted_in_is( Item , R_Tree , Result_Tree ) .
inorder ( niltree , [ ] ) . inorder ( btree ( Item , L_T , R_T ) , Inorder ) :- inorder ( L_T , Left ) , inorder ( R_T , Right ) , append ( Left , [ Item| Right ] , Inorder ) .
The membership relation is a trivial modification of the insert relation .
Since Prolog access to the elements of a tuple are by pattern matching , a variety of patterns can be employed to represent the tree .
Here are some alternatives .
[ Item , LeftTree , RightTree ] Item / LeftTree / RightTree ( Item , LeftTree , RightTree )
Extra-Logical Predicates
Objective Outline Input / Output
Assert / Retract
System Access
The class of predicates in Prolog that lie outside the logic programming model are called extra-logical predicates .
These predicates achieve a side effect in the course of being satisfied as a logical goal .
There are three types of extra-logical predicates , predicates for handling I/O , predicates for manipulating the program , and predicates for accessing the underlying operating system .
Most Prolog implementations provide the predicates read and write .
Both take one argument , read unifies its argument with the next term ( terminated with a period ) on the standard input and write prints its argument to the standard output .
As an illustration of input and output as well as a more extended example , here is the code for a checkbook balancing program .
The section beginning with the comment ``Prompts " handles the I/0 .
% Check Book Balancing Program . checkbook :- initialbalance ( Balance ) , newbalance ( Balance ) . % Recursively compute new balances newbalance ( OldBalance ) :- transaction ( Transaction ) , action ( OldBalance , Transaction ) . %
If transaction amount is 0 then finished .
action ( OldBalance , Transaction ) :- Transaction = 0 , finalbalance ( OldBalance ) . % %
% If transaction amount is not 0 then compute new balance .
action ( OldBalance , Transaction ) :- Transaction \+= 0 , NewBalance is OldBalance + Transaction , newbalance ( NewBalance ) . %
% Prompts initialbalance ( Balance ) :- write ( ' Enter initial balance : \' ) , read ( Balance ) . transaction ( Transaction ) :- write ( ' Enter Transaction , ' ) , write ( '- for withdrawal , 0 to terminate ) : ' ) , read ( Transaction ) . finalbalance ( Balance ) :- write ( ' Your final balance is : \' ) , write ( Balance ) , nl .
Files see( File ) Current input file is now File. seeing ( File )
File is unified with the name of the current input file .
seen Closes the current input file .
tell ( File ) Current output file is now File. telling ( File )
File is unified with the name of the current output file .
told Closes the current output file .
Term I /O read( Term )
Reads next full - stop ( period ) delimited term from the current input stream , if eof then returns the atom ' end_of_file '. write ( Term )
Writes a term to the current output stream .
print ( Term )
Writes a term to the current output stream .
Uses a user defined predicate portray / 1 to write the term , otherwise uses write . writeq ( Term )
Writes a term to the current output stream in a form aceptable as input to read .
Character I / O get (N ) N is the ASCII code of the next non-blank printable character on the current input stream .
If end of file , then a - 1 is returned .
put(N ) Puts the character corresponding to ASCII code N on the current output stream .
nl Causes the next output to be on a new line .
tab( N ) N spaces are output to the current output stream .

Long comments should precede the code they refer to while short comments should be interspersed with the code itself .
Program comments should describe what the program does , how it is used ( goal predicate and expected results ) , limitations , system dependent features , performance , and examples of using the program .
Predicate comments explain the purpose of the predicate , the meaning and relationship among the arguments , and any restrictions as to argument type .
Clause comments add to the description of the case the particular clause deals with and is usefull for documenting cuts .
Some conventions for program layout
Group clauses belonging to a relation or ADT together .
Clauses should be short .
Their body should contain no more than a few goals .
Make use of indentation to improve the readability of the body of a clause .
Mnemonic names for relations and variables should be used .
Names should indicate the meaning of relations and the role of data objects .
Clearly separate the clauses defining different relations .
The cut operator should be used with care .
The use of `red ' cuts should be limited to clearly defined mutually exclusive alternatives .
Illustration
merge ( List1 , List2 , List3 ) :- ( List1 = [ ] , ! , List3 = List2 ) ; ( List2 = [ ] , ! , List3 = List1 ) ; ( List1 = [ X|L1 ] , List2 = [ Y|L2 ) , ( ( X < Y , ! Z = X , merge ( L1 , List2 , L3 ) ) ; ( Z = Y , merge ( List1 , L2 , L3 ) ) ) , List3 = [ Z|L3 ] .
A better version
merge ( [ ] , List2 , List2 ) . merge( List1 , [ ] , List1 ) . merge( [ X|List1 ] , [ Y| List2 ] , [ X|List3 ] ) :- X < Y , ! , merge ( List1 , List2 , List3 ) . \% Red Cut merge ( List1 , [ Y| List2 ] , [ Y| List3 ] ) :- merge( List1 , List2 , List3 ) .

Definite Clause Grammars
Objective : Outline
The parsing problem : Context - free grammars ; Construct a parse tree for a sentence given the context - free grammar .
Representing the Parsing Problem in Prolog
The Grammar Rule Notation ] ( Definite Clause Grammars -- DCG )
Adding Extra Arguments
Adding Extra Tests
Prolog originated from attempts to use logic to express grammar rules and formalize the parsing process .
Prolog has special syntax rules which are called definite clause grammars ( DCG ) .
DCGs are a generalization of context free grammars .
Context Free Grammars
A context free grammar is a set of rules of the form :
->
where nonterminal is a nonterminal and body is a sequence of one or more items .
Each item is either a nonterminal symbol or a sequence of terminal symbols .
The meaning of the rule is that the body is a possible form for an object of type nonterminal .
S --> a b S --> a S b
DCG
Nonterminals are written as Prolog atoms , the items in the body are separated with commas and sequences of terminal symbols are written as lists of atoms .
For each nonterminal symbol , S , a grammar defines a language which is obtained by repeated nondeterministic application of the grammar rules , starting from S .
s --> [ a ] , [ b ] . s --> [ a ] , s , [b ] .
As an illustration of how DCG are used , the string [ a , a , b, b ] is given to the grammar to be parsed .
?- s( [ a , a , b , b ] , [ ] ) .
yes
Here is a natural language example .
% DCGrammar sentence --> noun_phrase , verb_phrase .
noun_phrase --> determiner , noun .
noun_phrase --> noun. verb_phrase --> verb . verb_phrase --> verb , noun_phrase . % Vocabulary determiner --> [ the ] .
determiner --> [ a ] . noun --> [ cat ] .
noun --> [ cats ] .
noun --> [ mouse ] .
noun --> [ mice ] .
verb --> [ scare ] .
verb --> [ scares ] .
verb --> [ hate ] .
verb --> [ hates ] .
Context free grammars cannot define the required agreement in number between the noun phrase and the verb phrase .
That information is context dependent ( sensitive ) .
However , DCG are more general Number agreement
% DCGrammar - with number agreement between noun phrase and verb phrase sentence --> noun_phrase ( Number ) , verb_phrase ( Number ) . noun_phrase ( Number ) --> determiner ( Number ) , noun( Number ) . noun_phrase ( Number ) --> noun( Number ) . verb_phrase ( Number ) --> verb( Number ) . verb_phrase ( Number ) --> verb( Number ) , noun_phrase ( Number1 ) . % Vocabulary determiner ( Number ) --> [ the ] . determiner ( singular ) --> [ a ]. noun( singular ) --> [ cat ] . noun( plural ) --> [ cats ] .
noun( singular ) --> [ mouse ] .
noun( plural ) --> [ mice ] . verb( plural ) --> [ scare ] . verb ( singular ) --> [ scares ] . verb( plural ) --> [ hate ] . verb( singular ) --> [ hates ] .
Parse Trees
% DCGrammar -- with parse tree as a result sentence ( sentence ( NP , VP ) ) --> noun_phrase ( NP ) , verb_phrase ( VP ) .
noun_phrase ( noun_phrase ( D, NP ) ) --> determiner ( D ) , noun( NP ) . noun_phrase ( NP ) --> noun( NP ) . verb_phrase ( verb_phrase ( V ) ) --> verb ( V ) . verb_phrase ( verb_phrase( V,NP ) ) --> verb ( V ) , noun_phrase ( NP ) . % Vocabulary determiner ( determiner ( the ) ) --> [ the ] . determiner ( determiner (a ) ) --> [ a ]. noun ( noun( cat ) ) --> [ cat ] .
noun ( noun( cats ) ) --> [ cats ] .
noun ( noun ( mouse ) ) --> [ mouse ] .
noun ( noun ( mice ) ) --> [ mice ] . verb ( verb ( scare ) ) --> [ scare ] . verb( verb ( scares ) ) --> [ scares ] . verb ( verb ( hate ) ) --> [ hate ] . verb ( verb ( hates ) ) --> [ hates ] .
Simple Semantics for Natural Language Sentences
Transitive and intransitive verbs
% DCGrammar -- Transitive and intransitive verbs sentence ( VP ) --> noun_phrase ( Actor ) , verb_phrase ( Actor , VP ) . noun_phrase ( Actor ) --> proper_noun ( Actor ) . verb_phrase ( Actor , VP ) --> intrans_verb( Actor , VP ) . verb_phrase ( Actor , VP ) --> transitive_verb( Actor , Something , VP ) , noun_phrase ( Something ) . % Vocabulary proper_noun ( john ) --> [ john ] . proper_noun ( annie ) --> [ annie ] . intrans_verb( Actor , paints ( Actor ) ) --> [ paints ] .
transitive_verb( Somebody , Something , likes ( Somebody , Something ) ) --> [ likes ] .
Determiners -- `a ' and `every '
:- op ( 100 , xfy , and ) . :- op ( 150 , xfy , => ) .
% DCGrammar -- Transitive and intransitive verbs sentence ( S ) --> noun_phrase ( X , Assn, S ) , verb_phrase ( X , Assn ) . noun_phrase ( X , Assn, S ) --> determiner ( X , Prop , Assn , S ) , noun( X , Prop ) .
verb_phrase ( X , Assn ) --> intrans_verb ( X , Assn ) . % Vocabulary determiner ( X , Prop , Assn , exists ( X , Prop and Assn ) ) --> [ a ] .
determiner ( X , Prop , Assn , all ( X , Prop => Assn ) ) --> [ every ] .
noun( X , man( X ) ) --> [ man ] .
noun( X , woman( X ) ) --> [ woman ] . intrans_verb ( X , paints ( X ) ) --> [ paints ] . intrans_verb ( X , dances ( X ) ) --> [ dances ] .
Relative Clauses
Interleaving syntax and semantics in DCG
% Word level sentence --> word ( W ) , rest_sent ( W ) .
rest_sent ( W ) --> { last_word ( W ) }. rest_sent(_ ) --> word ( W ) , rest_sent ( W ) . % Character level word ( W ) --> { single_char_word ( W)} , [ W ] .

Incomplete Data Structures
Objective Outline Difference Lists
Dictionaries
Queue
QuickSort
An incomplete data structure is a data structure containing a variable .
Such a data structure is said to be `partially instantiated ' or `incomplete . '
We illustrate the programming with incomplete data structures by modifying the code for a binary search tree .
The resulting code permits the relation inserted_in_is to define both the insertion and membership relations .
The empty tree is represented as a variable while a partially instantiated tree is represented as a tuple .
create_tree ( Niltree ) :- var( Niltree ) . % Note : Nil is a variable inserted_in_is( Item , btree ( Item , L_T , R_T ) ) .
inserted_in_is( Item , btree ( ItemI , L_T , R_T ) ) :- Item @< ItemI , inserted_in_is( Item , L_T ) . inserted_in_is( Item , btree ( ItemI , L_T , R_T ) ) :- Item @> ItemI , inserted_in_is( Item , R_T ) . inorder ( Niltree , [ ] ) :- var( Niltree ) .
inorder ( btree ( Item , L_T , R_T ) , Inorder ) :- inorder ( L_T , Left ) , inorder ( R_T , Right ) , append ( Left , [ Item| Right ] , Inorder ) .
Meta Level Programming
Meta -programs treat other programs as data .
They analyze , transform , and simulate other programs .
Prolog clauses may be passed as arguments , added and deleted from the Prolog data base , and may be constructed and then executed by a Prolog program .
Implementations may require that the functor and arity of the clause be previously declared to be a dynamic type .

Assert / Retract
Here is an example illustrating how clauses may be added and deleted from the Prolog data base .
The example shows how to simulate an assignment statement by using assert and retract to modify the association between a variable and a value .
:- dynamic x/1 . % this may be required in some Prologs x ( 0 ) .
%
An initial value is required in this example assign ( X , V ) :- Old =..[ X , _ ] , retract ( Old ) , New =..[ X , V ] , assert ( New ) .
Here is an example using the assign predicate .
?- x( N ) .
N = 0 yes ?- assign ( x,5 ) . yes ?- x ( N ) . N = 5
Here are three programs illustrating Prolog 's meta programming capability .
This first program is a simple interpreter for pure Prolog programs .
% Meta Interpreter for pure Prolog prove ( true ) .
prove (( A , B ) ) :- prove ( A ) , prove ( B ) . prove( A ) :- clause ( A , B ) , prove ( B ) .
Here is an execution of an append using the interpreter .
?- prove ( append ( [ a , b , c ] , [d , e ] , F ) ) .
F = [ a , b , c, d , e ]
It is no different from what we get from using the usual run time system .
The second program is a modification of the interpreter , in addition to interpreting pure Prolog programs it returns the sequence of deductions required to satisfy the query .
% Proofs for pure Prolog programs proof ( true , true ) .
proof (( A , B ) , ( ProofA , ProofB ) ) :- proof( A , ProofA ) , proof ( B , ProofB ) .
proof ( A , ( A:- Proof ) ) :- clause ( A , B ) , proof ( B , Proof ) .
Here is a proof an append .
?- proof ( append ( [ a , b , c ] , [d , e ] , F ) , Proof ) .
F = [ a , b , c , d , e ] Proof = ( append ( [ a , b , c ] , [d , e ] , [ a , b , c , d , e ] ) :- ( append ( [ b , c ] , [d , e ] , [ b , c , d , e ] ) :- ( append ( [ c ] , [d , e ] , [ c , d , e ] ) :- ( append ( [ ] , [d , e ] , [ d , e ] ) :- true ) ) ) )
The third program is also a modification of the interpreter .
In addition to interpreting pure Prolog programs , is a trace facility for pure Prolog programs .
It prints each goal twice , before and after satisfying the goal so that the programmer can see the parameters before and after the satisfaction of the goal .
% Trace facility for pure Prolog trace ( true ) .
trace ( ( A , B ) ) :- trace ( A ) , trace ( B ) . trace ( A ) :- clause ( A , B ) , downprint ( A ) , trace ( B ) , upprint ( A ) . downprint ( G ) :- write ('>' ) , write ( G ) , nl. upprint ( G ) :- write ('<' ) , write ( G ) , nl .
Here is a trace of an append .
?- trace ( append ( [ a , b , c ] , [d , e ] , F ) ) .
> append ( [ a , b , c ] , [d , e ] , [ a| 1 427104 ] ) > append ( [ b , c ] , [d , e ] , [ b| 1 429384 ] ) > append ( [c ] , [d , e ] , [c| 1 431664 ] ) > append ( [ ] , [d , e ] , [ d , e ] ) < append ( [ ] , [ d , e ] , [ d , e ] ) < append ( [ c ] , [d , e ] , [c , d , e ] ) < append ( [ b , c ] , [d , e ] , [ b , c , d , e ] ) < append ( [ a , b , c ] , [d , e ] , [ a , b , c , d , e ] ) F = [ a , b , c, d , e ]

Applications
Setof , Bagof and Findall
Other second - order predicates
has_property , map_list , filter , foldr etc
Variable predicate names p( P,X , Y ) :- P ( X , Y ) .
p( P,X , Y ) :- R =.. [ P, X , Y ] , call ( R ) .
For the following functions let S be the list [ S_1 , ... , S_n ] .
The function map where map ( f , S ) is [ f ( S_1 ) , ... , f( S_n ) ] .
The function filter where filter ( P,S ) is the list of elements of S that satisfy the predicate P .
The function foldl where foldl ( Op , In , S ) which folds up S , using the given binary operator Op and start value
In , in a left associative way , ie , foldl ( op , r , [ a , b, c ] ) = ( ( ( r op a ) op b ) op c ) .
The function foldr where foldr ( Op , In , S ) which folds up S , using the given binary operator Op and start value
In , in a right associative way , ie , foldr ( op , r , [ a , b, c ] ) = a op ( b op ( c op r ) ) .
The function map2 is similar to map , but takes a function of two arguments , and maps it along two argument lists .
The function scan where scan ( op , r , S ) applies foldl op r ) to every initial segment of a list .
For example scan (+) 0 x ) computes running sums .
The function dropwhile where dropwhile ( P,S ) which returns the suffix of S where each element of the prefex satisfies the predicate P. The function takewhile where takewhile ( P,S ) returns the list of initial element of S which satisfy P. The function until where until ( P , F , V ) returns the result of applying the function F to the value the smallest number of times necessary to satisfy the predicate .
Example until ( >1000 ) ( 2* ) 1 = 1024
The function iterate where iterate ( f , x ) returns the infinite list [ x , f x , f( f x ) , ... ]
Use the function foldr to define the functions , sum , product and reverse .
Write a generic sort program , it should take a comparison function as a parameter .
Write a generic transitive closer program , it should take a binary relation as a parameter .

Recursive Rules
Logic Programming and the Relational Database Model ( relational algebra )
Simple Databases
Basic predicates : father / 2 , mother / 2 , male / 1 , female / 1 .
father ( Father , Child ) .
mother ( Mother , Child ) . male ( Person ) . female ( Person ) .
son( Son , Parent ) .
daughter ( Daughter , Parent ) .
parent ( Parent , Child ) .
grandparent ( Grandparent , Grandchild ) .
Question :
Which should be facts and which should be rules ?
Example : if parent , male and female are facts then father and mother could be rules .
father ( Parent , Child ) :- parent ( Parent , Child ) , male ( Parent ) .
mother ( Parent , Child ) :- parent ( Parent , Child ) , female ( Parent ) .
Some other relations that could be defined are .
mother ( Woman ) :- mother ( Woman , Child ) .
parents ( Father , Mother ) :- father ( Father , Child ) , mother ( Mother , Child ) . brother ( Brother , Sibling ) :- parent ( P , Brother ) , parent ( P , Sibling ) , male ( Brother ) , Brother Sibling . uncle( Uncle , Person ) :- brother ( Uncle , Parent ) , parent ( Parent , Person ) .
sibling ( Sib1,Sib2 ) :- parent ( P, Sib1 ) , parent ( P, Sib2 ) , Sib1 =\= Sib2. cousin( Cousin1 , Cousin2 ) :- parent ( P1 , Cousin1 ) , parent ( P2 , Cousin2 ) , sibling ( P1, P2 ) .
What about : sister , niece , full_ sibling , mother_in_law , etc .
Recursive Rules
ancestor ( Ancestor , Descendent ) :- parent( Ancestor , Descendent ) . ancestor ( Ancestor , Descendent ) :- parent ( Ancestor , Person ) , ancestor ( Persion , Descendent ) .
The ancestor relation is an example of the more general relation of transitive closure .
Here is an example of the transitive closure for graphs .
Transitive closure : connected
edge ( Node1 , Node2 ) .
... connected ( Node1 , Node2 ) :- edge( Node1 , Node2 ) . connected ( Node1 , Node2 ) :- edge( Node1 , Link ) , connected ( Link , Node2 ) .
Logic programs and the relational database model
The mathematical concept underlying the relational database model is the set - theoretic relation , which is a subset of the Cartesian product of a list of domains .
A domain is a set of values .
A relation is any subset of the Cartesian product of one or more domains .
The members of a relation are called tuples .
In relational databases , a relation is viewed as a table .
The Prolog view of a relation is that of a set of named tuples .
For example , in Prolog form , here are some unexpected entries in a city - state - population relation .
city_state_population (' San Diego ' , ' Texas ' , 4490 ) . city_state_population (' Miami ' , ' Oklahoma ' , 13880 ) . city_state_population (' Pittsburg ' , ' Iowa ',509 ) .
In addition to defining relations as a set of tuples , a relational database management system ( DBMS ) permits new relations to be defined via a query language .
In Prolog form this means defining a rule .
For example , the sub-relation consisting of those entries where the population is less than 1000 can be defined as follows :
smalltown ( Town , State , Pop ) :- city_state_pop ( Town , State , Pop ) , Pop < 1000 .
One of the query languages for relational databases is the Relational Algebra .
Its operations are union , set difference , Cartesian product , projection , and selection .
They may be defined for two relations r and s as follows .
% Union of relations r/n and s/n r_union_s ( X1 , ...,Xn ) :- r( X1 , ... , Xn ) .
r_union_s ( X1 , ...,Xn ) :- s( X1 , ... , Xn ) . % Set Difference r/n $ \setminus $ s/n r_diff_s ( X1 , ...,Xn ) :- r( X1 , ... , Xn ) , not s( X1 , ... , Xn ) .
r_diff_s ( X1 , ...,Xn ) :- s( X1 , ... , Xn ) , not r( X1 , ... , Xn ) . % Cartesian product r/m , s/n r_x_s ( X1 , ... , Xm , Y1 , ... , Yn ) :- r( X1 , ... , Xm ) , s( Y1 , ... , Yn ) . % Projection r_p_i_j( Xi,Xj ) :- r( X1 , ... , Xn ) . % Selection r_c( X1 , ...,Xn ) :- r( X1 , ... , Xn ) , c( X1 , ... , Xn ) . % Meet r_m_s ( X1 , ...,Xn ) :- r( X1 , ... , Xn ) , s( X1 , ... , Xn ) . % Join r_j_s ( X ' 1 , ...,X'j , Y ' 1 , ... , Y'k ) :- r( X1 , ... , Xn ) , s( Y1 , ... , Yn ) .
The difference between Prolog and a Relational DBMS is that the in Prolog the relations are stored in main memory along with the program whereas in a Relational DBMS the relations are stored in files and the program extracts the information from the files .
Expert systems
Expert systems may be programmed in one of two ways in Prolog .
One is to construct a knowledge base using Prolog facts and rules and use the built - in inference engine to answer queries .
The other is to build a more powerful inference engine in Prolog and use it to implement an expert system .

Government Refuses To Disclose List Of Summaries , Transcripts , Reconstructions And Memoranda Relating To The Tapes
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK –
In connection with an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit seeking information on detainee abuse , the CIA today disclosed that it has a list of roughly 3,000 summaries , transcripts , reconstructions and memoranda relating to 92 interrogation videotapes that were destroyed by the agency .
The CIA refused , however , to disclose the list to the public .
The agency also refused to publicly disclose a list of witnesses who may have viewed the videotapes or retained custody of the videotapes before their destruction .
" The government is still needlessly withholding information about these tapes from the public , despite the fact that the CIA 's use of torture is well known , " said Amrit Singh , staff attorney with the ACLU .
" Full disclosure of the CIA 's illegal interrogation methods is long overdue and the agency must be held accountable for flouting the rule of law . "
In December 2007 , the ACLU filed a motion to hold the CIA in contempt for its destruction of the tapes in violation of a court order requiring the agency to produce or identify all records requested by the ACLU .
That motion is still pending .
The agency 's latest submission came in response to an August 20 , 2008 court order issued in the context of the contempt motion .
That order required the agency to produce " a list of any summaries , transcripts , or memoranda regarding the [ destroyed tapes ] and of any reconstruction of the records ' contents " as well as a list of witnesses who may have viewed the videotapes or retained custody of the videotapes before their destruction .
The CIA will provide these lists to the court for in camera review on March 26 , 2009 .
Earlier this month , the CIA acknowledged it destroyed 92 tapes of interrogations .
The tapes , some of which show CIA operatives subjecting suspects to extremely harsh interrogation methods , should have been identified and processed for the ACLU in response to its Freedom of Information Act request demanding information on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody .
The tapes were also withheld from the 9/11 Commission , appointed by former President Bush and Congress , which had formally requested that the CIA hand over transcripts and recordings documenting the interrogation of CIA prisoners .
The government 's letter to U.S. District Court Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York is available online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/39093res20090320.html
The ACLU 's contempt motion and related legal documents are available online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia
Attorneys on the case are Singh , Jameel Jaffer and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties Union ; Lawrence S. Lustberg and Jenny Brooke Condon of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons P.C. ; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
HSBC recently approved a £ 12.5 bn share sale Europe 's biggest bank , HSBC , has said up to 1,200 of its staff in the UK could face redundancy .
The bank said the individuals who could be affected by job losses were being briefed on Wednesday .
At least a third of the staff cuts will come from back office operations such as call centres , not from High Street branches , a spokesman said .
Unions are disputing the figure , saying the total number of jobs lost in the UK will be closer to 3,000 .
' Difficult decisions '
An operation centre in Leamington Spa , near Warwick , will lose 280 positions , about 150 jobs will be lost in London and and a call centre in Newport , south Wales , will be shut down , HSBC spokesman Tim Pie said .
The jobs cuts announced are in addition to the 500 jobs lost at HSBC's London head office in December .
" This is a kick in the teeth of the bank 's employees
Derek Simpson , Unite union Insurance giant to axe 650 jobs
" The operating environment for banks in the UK is extremely challenging and will remain so for some time , " HSBC UK managing director Paul Thurston said in the statement .
" There are difficult decisions that have to be made as we adapt to a new environment , " Mr Thurston said .
Commenting on the closure of the call centre in Newport , which employs 90 staff , South Wales assembly member Mike German said he was " dismayed " at the announcement , saying it was a " complete turnabout " nine months after an announcement to create 150 new jobs there .
" HSBC 's investment of £ 14 m in Newport is in danger and I will be asking the Welsh Assembly Government to pull out all the stops , save local jobs , and secure that investment that was due to be made this year and in 2010 , " he said .
The company 's chief executive in Wales , Alan Jarman , said the " very regrettable " decision was taken in a " rapidly changing economic environment " .
Job cuts A union representing some HSBC staff responded angrily .
BBC
News is tracking where jobs have been created and lost around the UK
BBC UK jobs tracker " Unite can see no justification for the efficient and dedicated staff in the UK to lose their jobs and all basic and standard current accounts to be serviced from India , " said Derek Simpson , the joint general secretary of the Unite union .
" This is a kick in the teeth of the bank 's employees . "
Unite argues that the total number of job losses will be 2,900 as roles are left unfilled when employees are moved into different areas , retire or resign .
Mr Pie said those additional job losses through attrition had been discussed with the union , but no number had been decided by the bank .
HSBC has a total staff of about 330,000 , with 58,000 of those employed in the UK .
Bankers lost Unlike other UK banks , HSBC has not received any support from taxpayers .
But last week shareholders approved a £ 12.5 bn share sale - the biggest in UK corporate history .
Financial firms have been cutting workers and trying to raise money as they struggle to cope with the worst crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s .
The Royal Bank of Scotland , which is one of several banks that have been bailed out by the UK government in exchange for stakes , has said it will cut 2,700 jobs in the UK .
In January , Barclays cut 4,200 jobs from its UK banking business , with half coming from back office operations and the other half coming from its fund management , private banking and investment banking units .
Insurers Royal Sun Alliance and Standard Life have all said they will cut jobs .
In a further sign of the difficulties facing the sector , Legal & General said it will cut 650 jobs , including the 450 announced in February .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Embattled insurer American International Group agreed to revamp its bonus structure on Saturday after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner objected to its plans to pay out substantial sums for 2008 , Obama administration officials and the company ’s chairman said .
AIG AIG.N , which has received three government bailouts totaling $ 180 billion , will sharply cut remaining salaries for 2009 for top executives of its AIG Financial Products unit and will work with Treasury to realign 2008 bonuses to reflect the company 's restructuring and repayment goals , AIG Chairman Edward Liddy said in a letter to Geithner .
AIG Financial Products was the unit that made bad bets on toxic mortgages that led to the company ’s near collapse .
Liddy said the firm was legally obligated to make already - committed 2008 employee - retention payments , the value of which were set last year before problems arose at the Financial Products unit .
“ Some of these payments are coming due on March 15 , and , quite frankly , AIG ’s hands are tied , ” Liddy said , adding that he found the arrangements “ distasteful . ”
But he said he would work with Geithner to resolve the issue .
An Obama administration official said it was unacceptable for Wall Street firms receiving government assistance to pay million - dollar bonuses , but concluded that the retention payments were legally binding .
The Treasury will continue to negotiate with AIG to bring these payments down and seek to recoup the funds through mechanism outside of these contracts .
Ooooh , wait !
Derez a much better capshun over dere ... letz go stand under that one !

HG Wells and MP
Shiel were contemporaries , entering and leaving the world within a year of each other , but Wells 's reputation as the father of science fiction has continued to grow , while Shiel has disappeared from bookshelves .
Both were socialists with an interest in future fiction and scientific romances – and there is evidence that Wells was influenced by Shiel – but Shiel was a West Indies - born author writing in the flamboyant style of the decadent movement .
Around the turn of the century he created the first future - history series in science fiction ( although , more fairly , the books offer three unconnected alternative futures ) with a trilogy that began with The Last Miracle .
This was followed by The Lord of the Sea , based on a critique of the private ownership of land , but Shiel 's reputation rests mainly on the third part of the sequence , The Purple Cloud .
It 's an apocalyptic novel that brushes off casual readers with a series of false starts , but settles down to become a truly extraordinary work of fiction .
The book was produced at a time when there was great interest in the unexplored Arctic , and tells the tale of a man named Adam Jeffson who travels there , only to return and find the earth laid waste by a vast purple cyanide cloud .
Without the constrictions of a moral society , and crushed by the burden of terrible isolation , Adam wields a power that tips him from eccentricity into megalomania .
Dressed as a sultan , he takes explosives from the Woolwich Arsenal and burns London down .
Laying waste to cities becomes a habit , a cry of rage for his imprisonment on earth , and he destroys nations before meeting another survivor , a woman in Istanbul who may have the key to his survival .
Shiel wrote 25 novels , but many are bland romances produced more for profit than the passion of language that shows in The Purple Cloud .
Shiel 's private life was , it seems , as decadent as his early writing .
He served 16 months ' hard labour in prison for molesting his 12 - year - old stepdaughter , and showed a penchant for underage girls throughout his life and his fiction .
He also reckoned himself the King of Redonda , a small inhospitable isle in the West Indies – though this may have been concocted as a joke at the expense of critics .
His trilogy was published out of sequence , having first been serialised , and The Purple Cloud is now available in a beautiful edition from the specialist publishers Tartarus Press .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. municipalities , strapped for cash as the recession decimates revenues , are stepping up sales of everything from old police cars , helicopters and bicycles to confiscated jewelry and slot machines in an effort to reduce swollen deficits .

And municipalities that previously relied on old - fashioned auctions conducted in local parking lots are getting more sophisticated , turning to the online world as they seek to maximize their sales .
As many as 46 states are struggling with deficits , according to the Washington - based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
And governments , which are required by law to close budget gaps , are being creative in seeking ways to meet the shortfall .
“ Anything that we can dispose of that generates revenue definitely helps to reduce any deficit that we have in the budget , ” said Greg Spearman , director of purchasing for Tampa , Florida .
Tampa recently raised more than $ 300,000 from the sale of a 1978 Piper police airplane .
The sale was conducted by auction on www.govdeals.com, a website founded by a former investment banker and two partners to help local governments maximize returns on unwanted assets .
Listings on the site have increased significantly in recent months and governments are looking deep into their closets for things to sell , according to Chief Executive Bill Angrick .
Agencies from Alabama , for example , sold about $ 3 million worth of goods in the first two months of 2009 , compared with $ 9 million for 2007 and 2008 combined .
Items included a batch of 27 confiscated bicycles sold by the city of Montgomery for $ 270 .
Georgia agencies have chalked up $ 1.8 million in sales in the first two months of 2009 , compared with sales of $ 9.1 million for all of 2008 .
Among the goods sold was a confiscated Yukon SL Crossbow sold by the town of Rome for $ 147 .
The Austin , Texas , police raised $ 388,100 in an auction of confiscated slot machines last week .
State and local governments are “ getting a lot of visibility and more competition ” than they would using the old - fashioned open - outcry auctions , said Angrick .
Scott Bartley , an accountant in the controller ’s office of Charleston County , South Carolina , said municipalities previously sold used equipment and other assets in annual auctions , typically held in a local parking lot .
That meant paying for storage until enough inventory had accumulated and relying on the largess of the few buyers who typically turned up .
Bartley said the county ’s revenues have roughly tripled since it stepped up efforts to generate cash , with the website helping it access a larger pool of buyers .
Since the county started using the service in 2005 , revenues from sales have climbed to between $ 800,000 to $ 1 million a year from an average $ 170,000 to $ 200,000 previously .
The county is now selling up to seven used police cars a week online and “ we ’re getting above bluebook value , ” he said .
About 1.2 million buyers have used the govdeals.com site , ranging from other states and municipalities to companies , entrepreneurs and resellers , all of whom are prescreened to ensure they can pay .
Vehicles are the most popular items sold on the site , although Angrick believes the second most popular item -- highway maintenance equipment -- could increase significantly with President Barack Obama ’s massive spending on infrastructure as part of his economic stimulus plan .
The largest ticket item auctioned in 2008 was a 1993 McDonnell Douglas MD520N helicopter sold by the Louisville - Jefferson County , Kentucky Metro Government , to a tour operator in Hawaii for $ 791,000 .
Among the more surprising offers is an Arabian horse currently on offer from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University , with a starting bid of $ 50 .
The 100 - mile endurance horse was used for exercise physiology and nutrition research at the university .
The Nashville Metro Airport Authority in Tennessee is selling a 40 - foot tall rotating beacon for an airport with bids starting at $ 200 .
Fort Oglethorpe , Georgia , is auctioning off a batch of confiscated jewelry including a 10 - carat gold necklace and various rings and watches .
And , in November of last year , the city of Baltimore , Maryland , put its 85 - foot fireboat , “ Mayor , J. Harold Grady , ” on the block after 47 years of service .
Allan Johnson , owner of a marine contracting firm in Akron , Ohio , won the bidding at $ 80,000 .
Johnson , who was hoping to pay $ 50,000 , still believes he got a good deal .
A new one could be well over $ 1 million .
Of course , online auctions have not always been successful for municipalities .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , campaigning as John McCain ’s vice presidential running mate last year , famously trumpeted her move to put a “ luxury jet ” used by the previous governor up for sale on eBay .
What she shied away from mentioning was that the jet failed to find a buyer on eBay and she ultimately hired a broker to sell it .
First came the imperial marching music and a fiery explosion .
" You 've watched snippets of them for days , or meant to after your friends sent you the link , " a voice boomed with mock gravity .
" Tonight , the week - long feud of the century comes to a head . "
It was a comically absurd drumroll for what , on the surface , was merely a squabble between TV presenters .
In one corner , Jim Cramer , the closest thing to a celebrity in American financial journalism .
In the opposite corner , Jon Stewart , the satirist and host of the fake news programme The Daily Show on Comedy Central .
But unlike many a big fight , this one more than surpassed the hype .
Nothing less than financial reporting itself was put on trial – and found severely wanting .
Cramer , who dispenses raucous advice to investors on the Mad Money show on the business channel CNBC , was eviscerated by a serious and genuinely angry Stewart .
Meek and contrite , Cramer was pummelled like a rope - a - dope over his profession 's failure to be an effective watchdog of Wall Street .
There was no cornerman to throw in the towel .
The interview was one of those classic television moments that crystallised the public mood in the credit crisis .
Stewart articulated the anger and bewilderment of millions of Americans who now feel ripped off and afraid .
He framed the question everyone wanted asked : how were the financial masters of the universe allowed to pursue their ruinous behaviour unchallenged for so long ?
It caught the attention of the White House , prompted a frenzy among bloggers and soul - searching in the media , which failed to spot the biggest story of a lifetime or warn the public until it was too late .
Indeed , CNBC and other supposedly objective journalists stood accused of complicity with big business , belonging to a cosy coterie that egged on company chief executives and fanned the flames of excess .
The interview has also burnished Stewart 's reputation as the last best hope in the media when it comes to , in the earnest phrase of news network CNN , " keeping them honest " .
It was this comedian who , like a court jester , told uncomfortable truths about the Iraq war when the mainstream media was playing cheerleader .
Now , as the financial apocalypse unfolds , it is Stewart again who is scything through the herd mentality and culture of deference .
James Moore , a former TV news correspondent and co-author of the bestseller Bush 's Brain : How Karl Rove Made George W Bush Presidential , blogged on the Huffington Post : " I am inclined to wonder if there is a line somewhere in the Book of Revelation that proclaims ' And a comic shall lead them ' .
Jon Stewart has set new standards for both comedy and journalism on television .
" Oddly , he was originally supposed to just make us laugh on Comedy Central .
He 's done that , quite proficiently , but Stewart has also figured out that some jokes are sad as well as too important not to tell .
But he 's not supposed to be doing the job of reporters . "
For years Stewart has been building a reputation as the one - man antidote to what many regard as bland and talk - heavy US news channels .
As Barack Obama , John McCain and other politicians queued up to appear on The Daily Show , a headline in the New York Times asked : " Is Jon Stewart the Most Trusted Man in America ? "
His assault on Wall Street began in earnest with a classic Daily Show technique : a series of juxtaposed clips revealing incompetence and hypocrisy .
First there was Rick Santelli , a CNBC reporter who tried to strike a populist chord by launching a sudden rant on a trading floor .
Stewart , unimpressed , forensically dissected the channel 's past mistakes , in which it made exuberantly bullish statements about the market and various investment banks shortly before they collapsed .
Stewart added : " If I only followed CNBC 's advice .
I 'd have a million dollars today – provided I 'd started with $ 100 m . "
Such is his influence , in the next days ratings for Mad Money went down 10 per cent in the 25 - to - 54 demographic .
But Cramer , a former hedge fund manager , is not one to take barbs lying down .
He declared war with the sarcastic riposte : " Oh , oh , a comedian is attacking me !
Wow !
He runs a variety show ! "
Stewart aired still more clips of Cra­mer advising his viewers to pile into Bear Stearns shares in the weeks before the bank collapsed , rendering them worthless .
As the media stoked up the row , the date was set for a " facedown " last Thursday .
Stewart showed the attack - dog interviewing instincts of a Humphrys or Paxman .
He charged that people at CNBC knew what was going on behind the scenes on Wall Street but failed to tell the public .
He accused CNBC hosts and pundits of abandoning their journalistic duties and acting like cheerleaders for the market .
Cramer proffered feeble mea culpas and acknowledged that they could do better .
But the merciless Stewart produced damning footage of a 2006 interview with TheStreet.com , in which Cra­mer described , in a positive way , certain barely legal things a hedge fund manager might do to work the market to his advantage .
Stewart pressed : " I understand you want to make finance entertaining .
But it 's not a game .
And when I watch that , I can't tell you how angry that makes me . "
He launched an eloquent assault that struck at the very foundations of American financial press and television .
" You knew what the banks were doing , yet were touting it for months and months – the entire network was , " he said .
" For now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy , once - in - a - lifetime tsunami that nobody could have seen coming is disingenuous at best , and criminal at worst . "
The interview became an online sensation that reached the White House .
Press secretary Robert Gibbs said he has spoken to President Obama about watching the Stewart - Cramer showdown .
" Despite , even as Mr Stewart said , that it may have been uncomfortable to conduct and uncomfortable to watch - I thought somebody asked a lot of tough questions , " the spokesman said .
Insiders at CNBC have acknowledged the episode was a public relations disaster .
A day after his public thrashing , Cramer declared that , " although I was clearly outside of my safety zone , I have the utmost respect for this
person and the work that they do , no matter how uncomfortable it was " .
Now the media has finally been forced into introspection .
Andrew Leckey , a former CNBC host and now president of the Donald W Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism at Arizona State University , said : " In a tremendous boom period , they covered the boom and people wanted to believe in the boom .
They did n't uncover the lies that were told to them .
Nobody did .
But they should be held to a higher responsibility . "
Britain has had its own satirical news in the shape of the The Day Today and the long - running Have I Got News for You , but nothing that has the impact of The Daily Show .
However , Robert Peston , the BBC 's business editor , denied that a British Stewart was necessary .
" Cramer has been attacked by Jon Stewart for being too optimistic after the crisis started in the summer of 2007 , " he said yesterday .
" The allegation against him and CNBC is that they were taking too rose - tinted a view of what was subsequently going on at various institutions .
That is simply not a criticism that I think can be levelled at most UK financial journalists .
" If Stewart tried to do that over here , I think he'd look like an idiot because I do n't think there 's evidence for falling down on the job in remotely the same way .
I do n't think it 's possible to do it because the evidence is n't there of a complacent , or self - satisfied , or lazy , or unduly optimistic media . "

[ Update : I ’ve wrongly been calling extensions “ plugins ” .
So this post is actually talking about extensions , not plugins . ]
Lately I ’ve been browsing with Google Chrome .
It looks and works great , and it ’s quick .
But it does n’t have plugins .
One of the few plugins I can hardly do without is the Blank Canvas Gmail Signatures add - on .
Gmail does n’t allow a signature per email address , which is a pity , but this add - on handles that nicely .
It also allows you to use HTML in your signatures .
Anyway , while cycling to work the other day I thought of an idea for a plugin system that would work in all browsers .
My idea was a web proxy running on your local machine that injects HTML or JavaScript into pages from certain URLs , Greasemonkey - style .
With some clever regex - matching and JavaScript injection you could do just about whatever you needed .
But of course – a deflated ego later – similar things have already been done . :-)
Privoxy
First , I searched for “ browser - agnostic plugin manager ” and discovered Privoxy .
It ’s geared for privacy and blocking ads , but it can do content replacement based on regexes .
For instance , there ’s a built - in filter called tiny - textforms that makes your < textarea > s bigger , a bit like this Firefox plugin .
Privoxy looks good and is pretty complete , but it ’s not really geared for plugins ( though one of the Privoxy developers mentioned you could probably do Greasemonkey - like stuff with it ) .
Also , Privoxy ’s got a pretty nerdy configuration interface that just would n’t cut it for normal plugin users .
Proxomitron , Proximodo and BFilter
Proxomitron , Proximodo and BFilter are three similar web proxy filters that might well do the job .
Again , they ’re mainly used for blocking ads , and their GUIs are n’t really set up as “ plugin managers ” , so I ’m not sure they ’d work for ordinary users .
Plugins in Chrome
Google is talking seriously about extension support in Chrome – perhaps it ’ll happen in the next few months .
Stop press !
Apparently Chromium already supports user scripts – again , Greasemonkey - style ) – but only in the latest developer builds .
Greasemetal
In the meantime , there ’s also Greasemetal , which is a Greasemonkey - compatible tool that uses Chrome ’s inter-process Automation Proxy communications channel .
So it ’s not browser - agnostic , but good work Kazuho Oku !
I ’ll probably start using this if Chrome does n’t hurry up with their extension interface .
But what about browser - agnostic ?
But back to browser - agnostic .
Imagine if all your favourite plugins or Greasemonkey scripts worked in IE , Firefox , Safari , Opera , Chrome , and Lynx .
I do n’t think it would take too much hacking to package up Privoxy as a plugin manager with a decent UI , or perhaps turn it into a browser - agnostic version of Greasemonkey .
Any takers , hackers ?
Or maybe I ’ll get around to it someday .
I ’ve got a name for my plugin manager already : Proxymoron .

Fishermen in the Philippines have rescued about 200 dolphins which became stranded in shallow waters near Manila .
Three of the dolphins were found dead and it was feared more would die unless they could be guided to deeper water .
They have been identified as melon - headed whales , which despite the name are a type of dolphin that travels in large pods of several hundred .
Beached dolphins are not uncommon in the Philippine archipelago but rarely occur in such large numbers .
Residents saw the huge pod of dolphins near the towns of Pilar and Abucay on the Bataan peninsula west of Manila .
The townspeople waded into the waters clapping and splashing to frighten the dolphins away , while the fishermen used their boats to guide the mammals out to deeper waters .
Disorientated
" This is an unusual phenomenon , " Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources director Malcolm Sarmiento told local radio , adding there were more than 200 of the stranded mammals .
He said they could be reacting to a " heat wave or disturbance at sea " such as a possible major underwater earthquake .
" If their eardrums are damaged they become disorientated and they float up to the surface , " he said .
Two of the three dead dolphins were reported to have damaged eardrums .
Dolphin beachings , in smaller numbers , are common in the Philippines , but it is rare for melon - headed whales to venture so close to shore as they prefer the deep waters of the open ocean .
OK , we already knew that Glenn Beck is an ignoramus about economics .
Last night , in a brief guest appearance on Bill O'Reilly 's show , Beck let slip that he's an ignoramus about political ideologies .
Now , we 've been saying for a long time that Beck is a right - wing populist ; lately , a number of other observers have reached the same conclusion .
So Beck has been making special note of being called a populist , and in his guest appearance on The O'Reilly Factor , he talked about it :
Beck :
The second thing is , is that -- you know , I was called -- who was it that called me today , " a populist " ?
I 'm not a populist !
I 've been saying this stuff when it was unpopular !
I 've got news for you :
It 's still pretty unpopular !
O'Reilly , who is not an ignoramus , corrected him : Populism indeed is politics built on appeals to " the people , " or more precisely , " a political strategy , in which a personalistic leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct , unmediated , uninstitutionalized support from large numbers of mostly unorganized followers . "
However , O'Reilly is quite incorrect when he says that being a populist means " you 're not an ideologue " : populists often are often highly ideological , but that ideology varies according to the precise brand of populism you 're playing .
In any event , populism has nothing to do with being " popular . "
We know that Glenn 's very popular right now , but really , that 's not what we 're talking about , big guy .
So he's an ignoramus on both economics and political ideology .
Ignorance , obviously , is no barrier for Glenn Beck when it comes to opening his yaw and emitting gaseous nostrums .
After all , this is the same guy who 's been complaining that Obama is a " socialist " and a " communist " and that we 're destroying America in the process .
Like he has any conception what those terms mean , either .
Indeed , it makes me wonder : Beck has had on his friend Jonah Goldberg several times and has openly plumped Goldberg 's Liberal Fascism as a book that everyone should read .
The major wheel of Goldberg 's thesis in that book , however , is his contention that because fascism is a species of populism , it is thus by nature inherently a left - wing creature .
He spends a great deal of time connecting fascism up with populism , particularly progressive populism .
Of course , as I 've pointed out several times , it 's a completely bogus thesis , since right - wing populism has been around almost as long as populism itself ( the most obvious pre-fascist examples being Bacon 's Rebellion , the Know - Nothings , and the Ku Klux Klan ) .
Indeed , Goldberg so completely screws up the meaning that I suppose it would be possible for someone to have read his book and still not understand what the hell a populist actually is .
Exhibit A : His buddy Beck .
The rants and raves of a mostly bored computer science engineer .
THE haul from recent ATM scams in Melbourne has reached $ 1 million and is expected to climb , police say .
The amount stolen from ANZ customers had risen to more than $ 670,000 yesterday and a bank spokeswoman predicted this would grow .
Five men faced the Melbourne Magistrates Court yesterday accused of running a scam at an ANZ automatic teller in Elizabeth Street that led the bank to cancel credit and debit cards of 2000 customers .
Nicolae Mateica , 33 , Aurelian Ion Stancu , 34 , Marian Fieraru , 24 , Dorel Musat , 23 , and Ionut Nedea , 26 , were charged with obtaining property by deception between March 15 and 25 .
They allegedly fleeced accounts by using cards cloned by skimming machines at ATMs .
Nedea is also charged with possessing a skimming device to produce fraudulent cards .
Because the newly released Killzone 2 is a high - profile PlayStation 3 exclusive , it seems that any review of the title is taken as a referendum on the PlayStation 3 platform itself — an unfair burden to place on any single title .
Killzone 2 was a long time coming , and after playing through the single player campaign — we 'll be covering the multiplayer in a later update — it 's unclear that the game is worth the sound and fury we 're seeing online .
Heavier than Resistance 2 and faster - paced than Gears of War 2 , Killzone 2 has carved its own niche in the feel department .
You 'll want to jack up the sensitivity on your controller , and I found that the default control scheme makes little to no sense .
Standard 2 is the setting of the Gods , however , and I suspect most gamers will settle there .
Your character seems to be rather stout , with a low viewpoint and a heavy gait .
He may not look dwarfish in the cut - scenes , but you'd be forgiven if you perceived a slight Gimli - like feel to his movements while playing .
So what 's the story here ?
It does n't really matter .
There are bad guys , called the Helghast , and there are good guys , and the good guys are overworked and tired , but willing to fight as long as this hellish war lasts .
They may as well be assigned numbers , there is so little actual character on display .
The bad guys are menacing , the good guys are scrappy , you encounter new weapons , there is much cursing throughout the fighting ... it 's like every war - gaming trope was dumped into a large machine and the story of the game was created like sausage .
Even the first title had a better story and more distinct characters .
A man bleeds out the mouth and then dies .
Nuclear codes become important .
The ending hints at a sequel .
You 've seen all this before .
So why am I still thinking about it after having beaten the single - player campaign ?
Why would I like nothing more than to load everything back up and play again ?
Let 's find out .
Violence is its own economy
In Killzone 2 , war is a teeth - ratting affair .
The Helghast speak in gravelly , rough voices .
Guns look and feel like heavy , nasty machinery .
Blood sprays often , in thick ropes .
You can only carry two guns at once — a heavier weapon and your pistol — and there are two types of grenade to be had .
The battles feel nasty , but stripped to their bare components .
Your enemy will try to flank you , and will react to your tactics .
You 'll understand the vocabulary of this game within seconds of picking it up .
While the shotgun feels disappointingly weak , the other guns more than make up for it .

A bolt gun that fires rounds that pin enemies to the nearest wall before exploding .
There is also an electrical weapon that feels crazily overpowered , although watching your enemies be electrocuted to death is a good time .
Because your enemies consist of Helghast in slightly different clothes 90 percent of the time , the firefights could easily get old ; but thankfully , weapon management and a well - designed environment keep things interesting .
The game does take advantage of the PS3 controller , but the motion controls are a mixed bag .
While it 's cool that the game forces you to hold the controller still when sniping to get a good bead on the enemy , the way it makes you twist your hands to put charges on the wall feels more like a gimmick than anything that aids in immersion .
The character 's actions become mechanical in these instances , making the motions feel more like waggle than actual motion control .
The accident occurred in the very heart of an unruly cloverleaf known as the MacArthur Maze , where several major arteries converge at the approach to the Bay Bridge , which connects San Francisco with the cities and suburbs that line the east side of San Francisco Bay .

The California Highway Patrol identified the driver of the tanker as James Mosqueda , 51 , from Woodland , Calif. , near Sacramento .
Officer Trent Cross , a spokesman for the highway patrol , said Mr. Mosqueda had just picked up the gasoline from a nearby refinery and was headed to a gas station near the Oakland airport when the accident occurred .
The highway patrol believes that Mr. Mosqueda was heading south on an interchange of Interstate 80 when he lost control in a curve , hit a guardrail and flipped his truck on its side .
The tanker exploded , sending flames hundreds of feet into the air , according to witnesses , and quickly buckled a three - lane section of Interstate 580 and caused it to collapse onto Interstate 880 some thirty feet below .
Michael Brown , the commissioner of the highway patrol , said the driver was able to escape the burning truck and apparently hailed a cab in order to go to the hospital .
Mr. Brown said there was “ no indication of impairment of the driver ” by drugs or alcohol , but that some legal issues are outstanding for both Mr. Mosqueda , and the truck ’s owner , Sabek Transportation , based in San Francisco .

A computer running Windows 7 stayed secure for longer than a Mac in the " PWN2OWN " hacking contest this week .
But the challenge showed that Internet Explorer 8 -- just released today -- is still vulnerable .
The contest , dubbed PWN2OWN , takes place at the annual CanSecWest security conference .
Participants have to find a way to breach security on one of several computers , each running a different browser and operating system which have been fully patched with all currently available security updates .
The winner this year took just 10 seconds to compromise a MacBook .
It 's bad news for Apple ; the prize went to Charlie Miller , the man who won the contest last year by hacking a Mac in two minutes .
Because the contest is run by a respectable organization , the winners are asked not to reveal the details of how they hacked a machine to the public -- only to the relevant software firms .
Easy - To - Use , Easy - To - Hack
Two weeks ago Miller predicted he would win by exploiting a problem with the Safari browser .
He says the way it is designed to be easy - to - use makes it more vulnerable to attacks .
( Source : computerworld.com )
It is known that participants are allowed to demonstrate their attack by asking an official to type in the address of a web page they have set up to infect the machine .
That 's a stark reminder that human behavior is often the last level of security protection .
Internet Explorer 8 Takes A Hit
Windows 7 did not escape unscathed .
It 's not yet confirmed how long the Windows 7 machine lasted but , despite running the new and more secure Internet Explorer 8 , a security researcher still managed to hack it .
Some writers have pointed out that the test is not necessarily evidence that Windows 7 is more secure than Mac - based systems .
Because Windows 7 is n't finished yet , there 's been less time for both legitimate researchers and criminal hackers to figure out problems with it .
And because so few people are running Windows 7 , there 's less incentive for hackers to target the system rather than concentrate on XP and Vista .

A vocal supporter of Fatah , Hamza was in almost daily telephone contact with his brother , a senior officer in the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah .
His fate is a chilling example of the terror inflicted on political dissenters who live under the Hamas regime that has ruled Gaza since May 2007 .
It is also a reminder of the debilitating nature of the conflict that has split communities in the Palestinian territories as political rivals Hamas and Fatah play out a deadly battle for supremacy , delaying indefinitely any hope of a peace with Israel that would give Palestinians a sovereign state .
" In 2007 , the death toll of Palestinians killed by Fatah or Hamas exceeded for the first time the number of Palestinians killed in clashes with the Israeli occupation forces , " said Hamdi Shaqqura , director of the democratic development unit at Gaza 's Palestinian Centre for Human Rights .
According to figures cited by Shaqqura , 394 Palestinians were killed in clashes with the Israeli military and security forces in 2007 but at least 500 were killed by forces aligned with either Fatah or Hamas .
Shaqqura , who has sought justice on behalf of Dalal al - Shoubaki since her husband went missing , said the case is just one of many in Gaza that follow a similar pattern .
On January 30 , Jameel Shaqqura , a 51 - year - old resident of the Khan Younis refugee camp , was summoned to a local sports club where he was told he had to testify in a case he said he knew nothing about .
At 6.30 am the next day Shaqqura 's brother received a phone call from Nasser Hospital .
Jameel had been admitted , unconscious .
He was pronounced dead on February 6 from what doctors described as a " brain clot caused by torture and severe beating to his head . "
On the same day , masked gunmen claiming to be police arrested 47 - year - old Nehad Sa'adi al - Dabbaka at his home in the al - Maghazi refugee camp .
Three days later , al - Dabbaka was dead in hospital , his body showing clear signs of torture and beating on the feet , back , hands , ears and chest .
On January 8 , midway through the conflict with Israel , masked Hamas security agents showed up at the home of At Yousef al - Buri , 39 , in the al - Shati refugee camp .
Claiming to be police , they dragged al - Buri into a jeep .
Half an hour later he was dumped near his home , severely beaten .
He died on February 7 .
" In this conflict , we are talking mostly about barbaric acts of revenge and retaliation , " Shaqqura said .
" Human rights abuses are witnessed every day here .
People have no freedom of association or right to assembly , no freedom of speech , or access to an independent justice system . "
At the time of his arrest , Hamza al - Shoubaki , 40 , a plumber , was selling fruit and vegetables to support his wife and their 13 children .
For four months after he was taken , Dalal said she could get no explanation of why he had been detained , or even where he was held .
Despite numerous personal appeals to senior Hamas figures , and appeals made on her behalf by non-government organisations , her efforts proved futile .
Then , in early December , her husband finally called home , revealing that he was being held at a prison inside an Internal Security Services compound at al - Saraya near Gaza City .
" He told me that I was allowed to come and visit him , " she said .
Hamas 's security service enjoys a savage reputation .
" No one ever asks any questions about the ISS , " said one Gaza resident who spoke to the Herald but asked not to be named .
" As soon as you do , you can expect a visit asking why you are so interested . "
From the living room in her crowded but barely furnished apartment in Gaza City , Dalal described her shock when she visited her husband .
" At first I nearly did n't recognise him .
There were many signs of torture .
He was pale and bruised and he had trouble walking . "
Hamza detailed a nightmarish tale of beatings and torture .
He was regularly punched and kicked , intermittently deprived of food and sleep , hung from the ceiling for hours on end by his feet and his arms , and on one case hung from the ceiling for several hours by one arm .
Dalal claimed her husband had also been electrocuted and repeatedly had a gun held to his head and fired in order to force a confession .
At one point , she said , he was hospitalised after passing blood in his urine .
" He said he had also been brought before the military court on several occasions but they were never able to prove anything . "
Several days after the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert launched Operation Cast Lead on December 27 - a full - scale military assault aimed at crippling Hamas 's ability to fire rockets into southern Israel - the jail where Hamza was held was hit by Israeli fire , giving inmates the opportunity to escape .
Hamza fled , but unlike 17 others who were killed , he was picked up the same day by Hamas militants and got off comparatively lightly .
They shot him through the back of both legs below the knee , then pushed him out of a car in the Sheikh Ejlin neighbourhood south - west of Gaza City .
" When he came to us , he was barely alive , " Dalal said .
" But after one month of medical treatment at home , and support from our families , he regained some of his health and was able to stand up and walk again . "
By early February , after Israel had declared a unilateral truce in its military campaign against Hamas , the ISS , intent on tracking down anyone they believed had collaborated with either Israel or the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah , launched a search for Hamza .
" On February 4 and 18 , a number of gunmen came to our house asking about my husband , but we had moved him and he was not at home , " Dalal said .
She was constantly watched and followed when she left the house and her telephone was bugged .
Hamza was hidden at the homes of various relatives .
On February 26 , Hamza al - Shoubaki decided to move again to what he thought he would be a safer location .
The ISS was watching and at 10 pm that day , masked gunmen stormed his new hideout .
" At around 8 am the next day , a relative of Hamza 's received a phone call from the Shifa Hospital to come and identify a man who was now in the morgue .
It was Hamza , " Dalal said .
Surrounded by her children , ranging in age from one to 17 , Dalal displayed no sign of fear of retribution for speaking out against Hamas .
" I want everyone to know what Hamas does here .
I am not afraid .
I want justice .
I want what happened to my husband to happen to the people who killed him . "
Loading
When the Herald approached the Hamas government 's official spokesman , Taher al - Nono , for comment , he declined .
" I have no knowledge at all of this case , " he said .
Hamdi Shaqqura believes there is little chance Hamza 's killers will ever be known .
" Hamas owns the justice system here in Gaza .
Why would they ever prosecute themselves ? "
With kawaii being Japan ’s all - conquering king — converting anything and everything to the cute and cuddly — it ’s perhaps not surprising to now see food getting the , erm , ‘ fun ’ treatment .
And , in this particular case , not only does it add a certain perkiness to the product , but it also perfectly explains what animal one will be eating .
But somewhat forced cynicism aside , as cute goes , they do , it has to be said , have a certain something .
Although there again , next week ’s supposed special of spotted dick could be a very different story altogether .
Spoiler warning :
This article contains extensive spoilers for all of Game of Thrones to date .
If you 're not caught up yet , back out until you are .
A few years ago , around the time of season 3 , I was talking to a friend about Game of Thrones .
We were throwing around theories about the next season or so ’s potential events , and somewhere along the line I found myself freewheeling right out to the show ’s eventual end - game and conclusion .
Obviously I did n’t have all the granular details ( and still do n’t ) , but suddenly the overall shape of Thrones ’ narrative arc , and the thematic reasons for it , became clear .
I knew at the time that I might be going out on a massive limb , but cut forward four seasons , and pretty much everything I predicted is coming true .
In truth , I kind of knew it would .
The specifics ?
Well first there ’s the steady erosion of the control enjoyed bythe bloody - minded , selfish , short - sighted , and deeply factional elder generation , leading to a regular offing of its numbers - more often than not resulting directly from their own petty hubris .
Tywin ?
Dead .
Walder Frey ?
Dead .
Alliser Thorne , stubborn , vindictive , traditionalist bully of the Night ’s Watch ?
Dead at the order of Jon Snow , the young revolutionary he tried to oppress ( and murder ) .
Men of his type are dying a lot .
At the same time , we ’ve seen the steady strengthening of the increasingly relevant younger generation , not through a new wave of family House factions , but a result of ( often suppressed ) lone individuals coming together agnostically , for the greater good , in contravention of the old world order and its rules .
Jon , once a lowly bastard , is now an accidental king .
Arya has become a battle - wise master assassin .
Tyrion has found power and respect at the hand of a new ( also young ) monarch .
Samwell Tarly has evolved from bumbling oaf to inspired , potentially critical scientific adviser , simply by standing against the father who kept him down .
Everywhere , we ’re looking at the drawn - out death of the old , inefficient , set - in - their - ways , isolationist tribes , and their replacement by a fresh generation without such boundaries and distinctions , whose minds are open to what can be achieved through open collaboration , new ideas , and a focus on something bigger than consolidating power and wealth .
It ’s all coming true .
The reason I initially saw this coming ?
Well in broad strokes , Game of Thrones has been playing with some tried - and - true narrative tropes for a long time .
Sins of the Father .
Inter - generational discord .
Breaking the cycle .
Escaping the past to become one ’s own person .
‘ My parents do n’t understand me ’ .
‘ The state of youth today ’ .
Parental disappointment .
Youthful rebellion .
Distrust of the ‘ radical ’ new ideas of a younger generation .
These themes have , individually , been present in popular media pretty much forever , because they ’ve been present in real - life for just as long .
But Game of Thrones has , from the start , been using so many of them , so frequently , that the shape of its ultimate story destination – and the path taken to reach it – has long been pretty clear .
A story as old as time ( almost )
Why are these themes present ?
Well for starters , a great many of them are very useful – at least in abstraction - in telling the classical ‘ Hero ’s Journey ’ narrative , the archetypal blueprint for pretty much all heroic adventures , from ancient mythology to modern action movies , formalised by narrative scholar Joseph Campbell .
The Hero ’s Journey – which you ’ll immediately recognise if you ’ve played any JRPG – starts in a state of assumed societal normality , with a widespread acceptance of the current ( often defective or troubled ) status quo , and a would - be hero in some way uncomfortable , disconnected , or unable to reconcile with it .
Want a more detailed look at how things might go down in the more immediate future ?
Look no further .
15 amazing fan theories for Game of Thrones season 7
Defined against this historical sense of normal , the protagonist is eventually called to action .
They 're forced out of ( or voluntarily leave ) the accepted world , and set about overcoming challenges which ultimately lead to growth , self - realisation and the ability to change their home for the better , by winning the means to overcome its challenges .
If you suddenly find yourself applying all of these ideas to the entire younger generation of Westeros , from Jon , to Arya , to Daenerys , to Tyrion , then you ’re doing so with good reason .
They ’re all going through their own versions of it .
The status quo in this case is the traditional , deeply hierarchical , divided , adversarial , House - dominated set - up of Westeros in season 1 , and the heroes ’ various journeys are leading them to the ‘ new world ’ of personal individuality and the ‘ prize ’ of collaboration and insurrection .
The other reason these specific themes are such a major part of Thrones ( and indeed , Game of Thrones ’ universal success ) , is that they ’re endlessly relatable , even on an unconscious level .
Everyone has a relationship with , or personal perception of , the generation that came before .
Everyone gains a growing sense of self throughout their life , a need to express that , and a desire to reshape their world in sympathy to their own needs .
Everyone struggles through adolescence .
And everyone , eventually , gets older , and sees a new generation rise up and start to do things differently for themselves .
Beyond the back - stabbings , boobs , revelations and eviscerations , the way that the show consistently plays with this stuff is a huge factor in GoT ’s narrative resonance .
Hell , these parallels to the universal human journey are almost certainly what defined the universality the Hero ’s Journey in the first place .
A huge amount of effective storytelling is in the creation of a relatable metaphor for the individual 's path through life .
That ’s why these themes are , historically , the key to decoding a staggering amount of storylines , portrayed from both sides of the generational divide .
A Nightmare on Elm Street , for instance , is about a group of teenagers achieving maturity , self - confidence , and resilience - or dying in failure - while cleaning up a mess wrought by their parents ' impulsive , primitive actions , decades previous .
The Hunger Games - and the recent boom in dystopian , young - adult fiction in general - drips with themes of oppressed , manipulated , and abused youth overthrowing the complacent cruelty of a Machiavellian , self - obsessed , outdated , older ruling class .
And every ' creepy little kid ' horror movie you 've ever watched is the product of generational anxiety on the part of the older contingent , on some level inexorably scared of being replaced , newly aware of its own mortality having now made itself the elder , and uneasy about what kind of changes its offspring will bring to the wider world .
What happens in Westeros does not stay in Westeros
So yes , the general ideas at play in Game of Thrones have been around a long time .
But what 's interesting in this case is just how many of them are explored so intensely , so explicitly , and from so many different angles .
Find me some non-abusive parents in Westeros , and I 'll point toward a couple of dead Starks and pretty much no - one else .
George RR Martin 's world might be a cold , uncaring crapsack continent at the best of times , but in terms of its citizens ' approach to child - rearing , it 's positively a cruelty theme park , where every kind of abuse and repercussion is explored in harrowing detail .
Favouritism , disinterest , bullying , abandonment , manipulation , even outright , profiteering exploitation and murder .
The older generation of Westeros has collectively - and consistently - wrought all of these things upon its children in the name of maintaining its own claim on power , and in the case of Tywin Lannister , pretty inflicted the whole lot on a daily basis .
The generational cross-over we currently find ourselves observing in the real world often seems potent with the same tensions as Thrones .
Why is this such a conspicuous theme in Game of Thrones ?
Well of course I can't speak directly to Martin 's intent , or that of the show 's producers , but things start to get very interesting when we look at popular art as a barometer for the social climate of its time .
Because popular art is always that , from Godzilla 's physical expression of Japan 's ongoing horror at Hiroshima , to Aliens ' biomechanical exploration of America 's failure in the Vietnam war .
And the reason , I think , that Game of Thrones ' key source of dramatic tension is this particular flavour of generational angst - rife , as is , with the clash between materialistic , power - hungry parents and children who simply want to live a progressive , free life - is that the particular generational crossover we currently find ourselves observing in the real world often seems potent with the same .
Every period of torch - handing has a version of this angst , of course .
There 's always a period where one side 's trust in the other 's behaviour starts to fail .
Remember when video games were called out as the source of a new generation 's moral downfall ?
Or when Rock ' n '
Roll was the poison of virtue , and Elvis an insidious , gyrating sex - devil ?
Or when short - haired , 1920s flappers turned perceptions of personal presentation and decorum on their heads ?
Well obviously you probably do n't literally remember all of those , but you see my point .
The difference this time though , is that for a long period there 's been very pronounced and very specific criticism on both sides .
Generation vexed
This time , it is n't simply a case of the older generation being freaked out by young people doing a weird new thing that 's really no more troublesome than the weird new things they themselves did at the same age .
There is that , of course , but there 's also the fact that , these days , ' Baby Boomer ' is n't far off an expletive .
It 's a generalisation , as these things always are , but there 's a very real perception that today 's older generation has , consciously or not , royally screwed over its offspring .
Between the inflated prices of the limited housing market , the lending crisis , the banking collapse , the relative lack of repercussions for those responsible , and the perceived lack of accountability of governments populated by an affluent , cronying , old - boys ' network that prioritises immediate personal comfort and self - interest over investing in the long - term future , in some circles it is Really Not Cool to be over 60 in the west right now .
All of this has led to the unfortunate – and let ’s be honest , not always accurate – assumption than any grey - haired person whom one does not already know to be lovely is probably an exclusionary , regressive , self - centred jerk .
In contrast , certain quarters of the mainstream , Boomer - focused media have spent the last few years criticising millennials as whiney and over - sensitive , usually via the medium of whining about how millennials are ruining literally everything in the world .
With so many different criticisms levelled , it ’s often hard to pick out the ultimate source of the discontent , but the general gist seems to be the idea that not liking war and preferring avocado on your toast to a hound - shredded fox cub makes you a wimp .
Oh , and there 's Brexit as well .
Because of course there 's Brexit .
A recent occurrence , granted , but one that to some felt like a crystallisation of the way things had been unfurling for a long time .
A vertical slice of many years ' frustration and growing resentment .
The notably younger - skewing Remain vote wanted unity , freedom , and progressive relationships across the European continent , while the older vote favoured isolationism , a sense of tradition , and an idealised feeling of victory through boundaried autonomy , using arguments of financial gain and political strength in order to fight for those things .
The result ?
A long - term change that largely contradicts the wishes and interests of the generation who will live through most of it , while those who voted for it might live comfortably ( assuming they can afford to ) , but for a comparatively limited period .
And with that , we 're right back in Westeros .
Because let 's look at what 's going on over there .
Where Brexit felt like the ultimate distillation and fallout from years of generational distrust , and a perceived dichotomy of long - view vs. short - view , the final struggle for control of the Iron Throne is shaping up to be exactly the same thing .
And interestingly , it increasingly seems that one 's level of interest in winning the Throne ( or at least a person 's investment in the old - world systems that support its dominance ) is inversely proportional to the amount of time they have left to live .
Because let 's think about who survives and prospers in Game of Thrones , shall we ?
And then let ’s contrast their outlooks and values against those who end up dying horribly .
Spare the rod , spoil the child .
But the child might not kill you
Jon Snow could barely be a purer antithesis to the old ways of elder , divided Westeros .
Devoid of legitimate parentage , his bloodline is so muddled that he is n't even the bastard he thinks he is .
Variously cast astray from two different , major Houses , he has since excelled on his own terms , rising to power at both the Wall and in Winterfell , precisely because he wants nothing of the sort .
The most reluctant ruler in Westeros has enjoyed the most loyal followings , becoming a good and trusted leader as a direct result of his general distaste for power or factionality .
As such he 's a walking metaphor for Game of Thrones ' values .
Arya is as anti-establishment as it gets , even before you get into that whole ' loves assassinating kings and nobles ' thing .
Daenerys was literally sold out by her big - name family in a bid for resurgent power , and since then own her rise has been ( mostly ) typified by an opposite - world version of the way things are done by the western continent ’s controlling Houses .
She grasped her first real authority by forging a close , emotional connection , then earned the love and loyalty of her people , and then used her strength not to conquer , but to shatter the systems of those who had conquered .
Arya , the girl who travelled so far from her home and her name as to actually aspire to become nobody - before discovering even the doctrine of nobodies to be too oppressive and regimented for her - is as anti-establishment as it gets , even before you get into that whole ' loves assassinating kings and nobles ' thing .
And it 's important to note that her motives for killing are consistently pure , always with the aim of simply removing a rotten individual , rather than for personal or political gain .
Bran has been wandering around the woods for years , avoiding the in-fighting and contrived concerns of the establishment , and gaining a greater understanding of the wider universe at large .
As a result he 's basically now Professor X , and gives off the air of someone who could explode your head just by thinking about it .
All this , from the pursuit of knowledge and insight rather than power .
Gendry ?
He 's stayed way the fuck out of everything , and he 's been doing just fine as a result .
On the other , mostly older , and now largely dead , side ?
Tywin was murdered on the toilet by the son he oppressed , after a lifetime spent personifying the petty , political , inward - looking profiteering of elder Westeros .
Stannis , with a pretty legitimate claim on the Throne , and a general air of smarts and decency about the way he conducted himself , was doing okay until lust for victory overtook his better judgement and caused him to murder his daughter in investment for a win .
He was dead pretty quickly after .
Walder Frey ?
Instigator of politically motivated murder , aimed out of spiteful pride at a young king , his young wife , and their unborn child ( so hitting two younger generations at the same time ) .
End result ?
Murdered after being made to eat his own children , an act that , metaphorically at least , he - like many Westerosi nobles – had been conducting for some years already .
Young heads with old hearts , and the occasional case of older * and * wiser
Stepping slightly outside of the generational roles for a moment , it 's worth noting that the same principles still apply .
Sam Tarly 's brother , Dickon , seemed a decent sort , possibly destined for great things , right up until the moment he resisted change , redoubled his allegiance to the old order , and died hand - in - hand with his bullying , old - guard asshole of a father , scorched to dust in a second .
Conversely , disowned brother Sam , valuing love , freedom , and intellect over status and warmonging , is turning into one of the story ’s most influential characters .
Still need to catch up before you hit season 7 ?
Want to watch ALL of Game of Thrones 1 - 6 recapped in 12 minutes ?
Of course you do ...
And in contrast to Dickon , there 's Ser Davos .
Humble , decent , devoid of ego or ambition , and seemingly loyal to quality rather than assumed authority , he has , despite his own frequent self - admonishments , done far better than any self - aggrandising , power - wielding , pride - slinging member of his generation .
He 's also , right now , potentially still in the running to be the fabled ' Prince that was promised ' , which would be ironic given his lack of regal ambition , but also utterly fitting and right , given the way Game of Thrones works .
In fact , all things considered , I ’d be inclined to bet on it happening .
I bloody love Ser Davos .
Ser Davos is great .
Either way , the ultimate statement seems to be ‘ Get over yourself , and get over your old squabbles .
Status and money do n’t mean anything in the long - term , and the more you focus on them , they more you hurt ( or fail to help ) everyone ’ .
All of which brings us on to Cersei .
Which is where things ultimately , I think , come to a head .
In Cersei , we have a failing leader who ’s overconfident to the point of pitiful delusion , standing unaware on terribly shaky ground , with dwindling support and attackers on all sides , and whose only option now is to pay for the back - up she needs – all of this in a story that was probably written several months before British Prime Minister Theresa May donated £ 1 billion to the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland in exchange for the voting support required to not quite lose the last general election , following the fallout from Brexit and a newly invigorated , left - wing youth vote .
It ’s quite the , er , coincidence .
Cersei ’s single - minded , self - interested , increasingly aggressive approach to rule has led to dire circumstances – as it always does in Game of Thrones – resulting in the deaths of all of her children , just to hammer the point home once again .
The White Walkers are nearly at the door ( not that she ’s paid them the slightest bit of attention in her quest for power and vengeance ) , and if it were n’t for the newly - announced pregnancy - which she ’s unlikely to carry to full term - Jaime would be close to leaving through the very same portal .
Things are grim indeed for Cersei Lannister and , like every Westerosi leader too obsessed with elevating their own little corner to see what ’s going on in The Actual World , she ’s not going to see the end coming .
No more so than her father did .
A father who the show is now explicitly stating – via the mouth of Iron Bank representative Tycho Nestoris – she has become the sequel to .
In fact there ’s now every chance that Cersei ’s downfall will come as a direct result of trying to emulate Tywin ’s methods .
Yes , she ’s cleared the Lannister debt to the Iron Bank , but that might be precisely what finishes her off , given that her shrunken family ’s newfound lack of profitability surely makes them far less important to the organisation .
In fact , I would n’t bet against it .
There would be no more fitting downfall , given Game of Thrones ’ eternal subtext of progress vs. traditionalism , if Cersei ’s end came as a direct result of observing the historical family motto : “ A Lannister always pays their debts . ”
Keep your eyes * off * the prize
Where does this leave everyone else , should the Iron Throne indeed be vacated ?
Well if they have any sense , it leaves them far from the Throne indeed .
Because at this point , I believe that chair is nothing more than a generations - old red herring .
No -one who has sat on it has had a good end .
No -one who has pursued it has done well out of the bid .
All have been corrupted , all have hurt those around them , and all , via the Throne - inflicted , inward - looking obsession with petty , short - lived power , have invested in the future ruin of Westeros by ignoring a larger threat .
That Throne is poison , make no mistake about it .
The only way you win the Game of Thrones is by not playing it .
If the show has a long - term message , that seems to be it .
So there ’s now a really interesting parallel between Cersei and Dany , which , again , the show has finally been making explicit over recent episodes .
Where Cersei seeks to emulate her father ’s conniving , brutal sense of self - preservation down to a T , Dany has long rejected her own father ’s ways , claiming to be the figurehead of a new way of life .
The tricky bit though , is that of late she ’s been having trouble making a convincing case for that .
Barely concealed , single - minded Throne - lust .
The nuking of an entire army just to make a point .
The ‘ recruitment ’ of the survivors , at the business - end of a dragon ’s snout ( hellooooo , the very same slavery that she once disavowed as archaic and cruel ) .
The closer that Dany has come to the Throne – literally and figuratively – the more blindly driven and morally ambiguous she has become .
Given how easily she eventually chose the dragon option against the Lannisters , it ’s easy to imagine that without the friends and advisers she has , she ’d now be a lot further down the Throne corruption rabbit hole .
Poison .
It ’s naught but poison with a really uncomfortable - looking seat .
So it seems , ultimately , that the final fate of the main players will be defined not by how effectively they can claim the Iron Throne , but by how willing they are to step away from it , and the old world it represents .
Because winter has come .
Petty , local power - struggles about whose small - view outlook is best are going to mean naught when the frost zombies come a -calling .
In Westeros , as in the real world , it might feel good to see yourself as top - dog in a little , isolated province , but if that blinds you from the dangers of a potential world - wide , climate - change apocalypse …
Well , no - one ’s going to give a fuck about you or what you had once you ’re dead .
Globe - trotting S.F. mayor 's security costs hit

San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom 's global gallivanting is n't sitting too well at home .
" Here we are , facing having to raise taxes , furlough workers and make even more severe cuts to public safety , and he 's traveling around with staff and a police escort , " said Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , chair of the board 's budget committee .
" It just does n't add up . "
Mirkarimi was taken aback by our report that Newsom had a police escort during his recent trips to Paris and to President Obama ' sinauguration , as well as for his gubernatorial campaign appearances outside the city .
Newsom also had a police escort and his specially modified , high - security Chevy Tahoe sent to his Montana wedding last summer .
But what really got the supervisor 's goat was the Police Department 's refusal - in the name of security - to disclose the costs of keeping the star mayor safe .
" It 's ridiculous , " Mirkarimi said .
He plans to call a special meeting - behind closed doors , if necessary - to find out how much the mayor 's travels are really costing .
Do Ron Ron : Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums got some good ink by finally naming acting City Administrator Dan Lindheim to the job full - time - but some of his other picks have City Council members scratching their heads .
First up are questions about the qualifications of Dorlista Reed , whom Dellums named as the city 's $ 125,000 - a- year public safety coordinator to oversee ex-offenders ' re-entry into society , youth violence prevention programs and community policing .
Reed 's most recent job was as a senior management analyst for the Berkeley Department of Public Works , where she coordinated the corporation yard cleanup , worked on seismic safety programs and handled transportation for senior citizens and disabled people .
" What has that got to do with public safety ? " asked Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente .
" Her name just came out of the blue . "
Next up , Theo Oliphant , whom Dellums named as his $ 125,000 - a- year director of public - private partnerships .
" I do n't know how he 's going to pay for him .
It 's not in the budget , " De La Fuente said .
Then there 's the appointment of Marianna Marysheva - Martinez as the $ 216,000 - a- year chief administrative assistant , overseeing finance .
According to one City Hall insider who has had cordial relations with Marysheva - Martinez , she will be the hammer behind the throne .
However , it remains to be seen whether Lindheim and Marysheva - Martinez - who are known to have a cool relationship - can get along .
Nobody in the mayor 's office wanted to comment - other than to emphasize that these were strictly Dellums ' hires .
Lindheim , in fact , did n't interview any of the new picks who will now be working under his direction , sources told us .
All of which has left Councilman LarryReid befuddled .
" The mayor does n't talk to us , " he said .
" We got an e-mail naming them about an hour before they had the press conference . "
Get ready to roll : Christmas could come to California before the month is out .
Congress hopes to have an $ 800 billion - plus federal stimulus plan on Obama 's desk by the Presidents Day recess - and , if everything goes according to plan , it will pack an extra $ 1 billion for transportation spending for the Bay Area this year alone .
That 's double what usually gets spent here .
Washington may also dole out hundreds of millions more to the region as part of its so - called discretionary funding of pet projects .
Among the goodies that could start rolling before the year 's out :
-- The $ 1 billion replacement of San Francisco 's Doyle Drive , including a submerged roadway through the Presidio .
-- The $ 4 billion Transbay Terminal , including $ 500 million for a " rail box " beneath the station to handle train service .
-- BART 's on - again , off - again , $ 500 million light - rail connector from the Coliseum Station to Oakland International Airport .
--
And the long - awaited , $ 420 million Caldecott Tunnel fourth bore .
Officials also plan to spend big time on major roads around the Bay Area - including improvements to 19th Avenue in San Francisco - and on bus purchases .
As for the possibility that much of that money might land overseas , where Muni and AC Transit have purchased portions of their fleets in the past ?
Not to worry , locals tell us - every dime has a " buy American " requirement .
Goal !:
It did n't get much play in the local media , but more than 46,000 people paid anywhere from $ 20 to $ 75 a head to watch the Mexico - Sweden soccer game at the Oakland Coliseum last week .
That meant A's owner Lew Wolff , the game 's promoter , grossed a cool $ 1.4 million .
" You can mark it up to the genius of Mike Crowley and David Alioto , who negotiated the deal as part of our taking over the Earthquakes , " Wolff said , referring to the San Jose soccer team he also owns .
It was the third time Wolff and company had brought the Mexican national team to Oakland - and each time the turnout has been big .
The only downside was the take from the concessions stands .
" They were good , " Crowley said , " but we did n't sell anywhere near the beer we do for a Red Sox or Yankee game .
In soccer , the fans actually sit and watch . "
Junk - it : Paris , Beijing , Rio de Janeiro - for years , former San Francisco SupervisorTomAmmiano watched his buddies up in the Legislature fly off to the world 's top tourist spots in the name of gathering information for state programs .
Well , just one month into his first term as an assemblyman , Ammiano got his first junket invite .
To New Jersey ... to visit child care centers .
" Can you believe it ? " Ammiano said .
" I spend half my life trying to get out of there , and they want to send me back .
" I told them if they want to know about New Jersey child care , they could just call my cousins , " Ammiano said .
" At least , the ones who are n't yet in the witness protection program . "

Subject : [ ANN ] hpricot 0.7
From : _why < why@ b l g r
Date : Wed , 18 Mar 2009 03:08:39 +0900
Please enjoy a succulent , new Hpricot .
A bit faster , some Ruby 1.9 support , and assorted fixes .
gem install hpricot -- source http://code.whytheluckystiff.net
It should show up at Rubyforge in a bit .
I 'm sure you 're wondering what 's the reason for Hpricot updates , in the face of heated competition from the Nokogiri and LibXML libraries .
Remember that Hpricot has no dependencies and is smaller than either of those libs .
Hpricot uses its own Ragel - based parser , so you have the freedom to hack the parser itself , the code is dwarven by comparison .
Best of all , Hpricot has run on JRuby in the past .
And I am in the process of merging some IronRuby code [ 1 ] and porting 0.7 to JRuby .
This means your code will run on a variety of Ruby platforms without alteration .
That alone makes it worthwhile , would n't you agree ?
Clearly , the benchmarks you see on Ruby Inside are skewed to favor Nokogiri .
They parse XML through Hpricot without using Hpricot. XML ( ) , which is not only wrong , but puts XML through needless HTML cleanup operations .
I am sure that Hpricot 0.7 still fares slower on large documents .
However , for instance , try testing a large amount of small documents ( a much more common scenario ) with this latest version .
You have to question a benchmark that is entirely based on two XML documents .
What about HTML fix ups ?
What about various platforms and CPUs ?
Why not treat Hpricot fairly and use it properly in the benchmarks ?
It reeks of something .

USSID 18
LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND
MINIMIZATION PROCEDURES ( U )
1.1 ( U ) The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects all U.S. persons anywhere in the world and all persons within the United States from unreasonable searches and seizures by any person or agency acting on behalf of the U.S. Government .
The Supreme Court has ruled that the interception of electronic communications is a search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment .
It is therefore mandatory that signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) operations be conducted pursuant to procedures which meet the reasonableness requirements of the Fourth Amendment .
1.2 ( U ) In determining whether United States SIGINT System ( USSS ) operations are " reasonable , " it is necessary to balance the U.S. Government 's need for foreign intelligence information and the privacy interests of persons protected by the Fourth Amendment .
Striking that balance has consumed much time and effort by all branches of the United States government .
The results of that effort are reflected in the references listed in Section 2 below .
Together , these references require the minimization of U.S. person information collected , processed , retained or disseminated by the USSS .
The purpose of this document is to implement these minimization requirements .
1.3 ( U ) Several themes run throughout this USSID .
The most important is that intelligence operations and the protection of constitutional rights are not incompatible .
It is not necessary to deny legitimate foreign intelligence collection or suppress legitimate foreign intelligence information to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. persons .
1.4 ( U ) Finally , these minimization procedures implement the constitutional principle of " reasonableness " by giving different categories of individuals and entities different levels of protection .
These levels range from the stringent protection accorded U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens in the United States to provisions relating to foreign diplomats in the U.S.
These differences reflect yet another main theme of these procedures , that is , that the focus of all foreign intelligence operations is on foreign entities and persons .
2.1 ( u ) References
a. 50 U.S.C. 1801 , et seq. , Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) of 1978 , Public Law No. 95-511. b. Executive Order 12333 , " United States Intelligence Activities , " dated 4 December 1981 .
c. DoD Directive 5240.1 , " Activities of DoD Intelligence Components that Affect U.S. Persons , " dated 25 April 1988 .
d. NSA / CSS Directive No. 10 - 30 , " Procedures Governing Activities of NSA / CSS that Affect U.S. Persons , " dated 20 September 1990 .
3.1 ( U ) The policy of the USSS is to TARGET or COLLECT only FOREIGN COMMUNICATIONS .*
The USSS will not intentionally COLLECT communications to , from or about U.S. PERSONS or persons or entities in the U.S. except as set forth in this USSID .
If the USSS inadvertently COLLECTS such communications , it will process , retain and disseminate them only in accordance with this USSID .
_______________________
* Capitalized words in Section 3 through 9 are defined terms in Section 9 .
4.1 ( S - CCO ) Communications which are known to be to , from or about U.S. PERSONS oxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx not be intentionally intercepted .
[ 1 line redacted . ]
a . With the approval of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court under the conditions outlined in Annex A of this USSID .
b.
With the approval of the Attorney General of the United States , if : ( 1 ) The COLLECTION is directed against the following : ( a ) Communications to or from U.S. PERSONS outside of the UNITED STATES , or ( b ) International communications to , from , [ 1 line redacted . ]
( c ) Communications which are not to or from but merely about U.S. PERSONS ( wherever located ) .
( 2 ) The person is an AGENT OF A FOREIGN POWER , and ( 3 ) The purpose of the COLLECTION is to acquire significant FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE information .
c. With the approval of the Director , National Security Agency / Chief , Central Security Service ( DIRNSA / CHCSS ) , so long as the COLLECTION need not be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Attorney General , and ( 1 ) The person has CONSENTED to the COLLECTION by executing one of the CONSENT forms contained in Annex H , or ( 2 ) The person is reasonably believed to be held captive by a FOREIGN POWER or group engaged in INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM , or ( 3 ) The TARGETED [ 3 lines redacted . ]

( a ) A non-U.S. PERSON located outside the UNITED STATES , or ( b ) [ 1 line redacted . ]
( 6 ) Copies of approvals granted by DIRNSA / CHCSS under these provisions will be retained in the Office of the General Counsel for review by the Attorney General .
d. Emergency Situations ( 1 ) In emergency situations , DIRNSA / CHCSS may authorize the COLLECTION of information to , from or about a U.S. PERSON who is outside the UNITED STATES when securing the prior approval of the Attorney General is not practical because : ( a) The time required to obtain such approval would result in the loss of significant FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE and would cause substantial harm to the national security .
( b ) A person 's life or physical safety is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger .
( c ) The physical security of a defense installation or government property is reasonably believed to be in immediate danger .
( 2 ) In those cases where DIRNSA / CHCSS authorizes emergency COLLECTION , except for actions taken under paragraph c.( 1 ) ( b ) above , DIRNSA / CHCSS shall find that there is probably cause that the TARGET meets one of the following criteria : ( a ) A person who , for or on behalf of a FOREIGN POWER , is engaged in clandestine intelligence activities ( including covert activities intended to affect the political or governmental process ) , sabotage , or INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM activities , or activities in preparation for INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM activities ; or who conspires with , or knowingly aids and abets a person engaging in such activities .
( b ) A person who is an officer or employee of a FOREIGN POWER . ( c ) A person unlawfully acting for , or pursuant to the direction of , a FOREIGN POWER .
The mere fact that a person 's activities may benefit or further the aims of a FOREIGN POWER is not enough to bring that person under this subsection , absent evidence that the person is taking direction from , or acting in knowing concert with , the FOREIGN POWER .
( d) A CORPORATION or other entity that is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a FOREIGN POWER . ( e ) A person in contact with , or acting in collaboration with , an intelligence or security service of a foreign power for the purpose of providing access to information or material classified by the United States to which such person has access .
( 3 ) In all cases where emergency collection is authorized , the following steps shall be taken : ( a ) The General Counsel will be notified immediately that the COLLECTION has started .
( b ) The General Counsel will initiate immediate efforts to obtain Attorney General approval to continue the collection .
If Attorney General approval is not obtained within seventy two hours , the COLLECTION will be terminated .
If the Attorney General approves the COLLECTION , it may continue for the period specified in the approval .
e. Annual reports to the Attorney General are required for COLLECTION conducted under paragraphs 4.1.c. ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .
Responsible analytic offices will provide such reports through the Deputy Director for Operations ( DDO ) and the General Counsel to the DIRNSA / CHCSS for transmittal to the Attorney General by 31 January of each year .

( 2 ) A person known to be currently outside the UNITED STATES , or whose location is not known , will not be treated as a U.S. PERSON unless such person is reasonably identified as such or the nature of the person 's communications or other indicia in the contents or circumstances of such communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a U .S. person . ( 3 ) A person known to be an alien admitted for permanent residence may be assumed to have lost status as a U.S. PERSON if the person leaves the UNITED STATES and it is known that the person is not in compliance with the administrative formalities provided by law ( 8 U.S.C. Section 1203 ) that enable such person to reenter the UNITED STATES without regard to the provisions of law that would otherwise restrict an alien 's entry into the UNITED STATES .
The failure to follow the statutory procedures provides a reasonable basis to conclude that such alien has abandoned any intention of maintaining status as a permanent resident alien .
( 4 ) An unincorporated association whose headquarters are located outside the UNITED STATES may be presumed not to be a U.S. PERSON unless the USSS has information indicating that a substantial number of members are citizens of the UNITED STATES or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence .
( 5 ) CORPORATIONS have the nationality of the nation - state in which they are incorporated .
CORPORATIONS formed under U.S. federal or state law are thus U.S. persons , even if the corporate stock is foreign - owned .
The only exception set forth above is CORPORATIONS which are openly acknowledged to be directed and controlled by foreign governments .
Conversely , CORPORATIONS incorporated in foreign countries are not U.S. PERSONS even if that CORPORATION is a subsidiary of a U.S. CORPORATION .
( 6 ) Nongovernmental ships and aircraft are legal entities and have the nationality of the country in which they are registered .
Ships and aircraft fly the flag and are subject to the law of their place of registration .

WASHINGTON , DC
STANDARDIZED MINIMIZATION
PROCEDURES FOR NSA ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES
Pursuant to Section 101(h ) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ( hereinafter " the Act " ) , the following procedures have been adopted by the Attorney General and shall be followed by the NSA in implementing this electronic surveillance : ( U )
SECTION 1 - APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE (U )
These procedures apply to the acquisition , retention , use , and dissemination of non-publicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons that is collected in the course of electronic surveillance as ordered by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court under Section 102 ( b ) or authorized by Attorney General Certification under Section 102 ( a ) of the Act .
These procedures also apply to non-United States persons where specifically indicated .
( U )
SECTION 2 - DEFINITIONS ( U )
In addition to the definitions in Section 101 of the Act , the following definitions apply to these procedures :
( a) Acquisition means the collection by NSA through electronic means of a non-public communication to which it is not an intended part .
( U )
( b) Communications concerning a United States person include all communications in which a United States person is discussed or mentioned , except where such communications reveal only publicly available information about the person .
( U )
( c) Communications of a United States person include all communications to which a United States person is a party .
( U )
(d) Consent is the agreement by a person or organization to permit the NSA to take particular actions that affect the person or organization .
To be effective , consent must be given by the affected person or organization with sufficient knowledge to understand the action that may be taken and the possible consequences of that action .
Consent by an organization shall be deemed valid if given on behalf of the organization by an official or governing body determined by the General Counsel , NSA , to have actual or apparent authority to make such an agreement .
( U )
(e) Foreign communication means a communication that has at least one communicant outside the United States , or that is entirely among :
( 1 ) foreign power ; ( 2 ) officers or employees of foreign powers ; or ( 3 ) a foreign power and officers or employees of a foreign power .
All other communications are domestic communications .
( S - CCO )
( f) Identification of a United States person means the name , unique title , address , or other personal identifier of a United States person in the context of activities conducted by that person or activities conducted by others that are related to that person .
A reference to a product by brand name , or manufacturer 's name or the use of a name in a descriptive sense , e.g. , " Monroe Doctrine , " is not an identification of a United States person .
( S - CCO )
( g ) [ 2 lines redacted . ]
(h) Publicly available information means information that a member of the public could obtain on request , by research of public sources , or by casual observation .
( U )
( i) Technical data base means information retained for cryptanalytic , traffic analytic , or signal exploitation purposes .
( j) United States person means a United States person as defined in the Act .
The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person who status is unknown is a United States person : ( U )
(1) A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United States person unless positively identified as an alien who has not been admitted for permanent residence , or unless the nature or circumstances of the person 's communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a United States person . ( U ) ( 2 ) A person known to be currently outside the United States , or whose location is unknown , will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be positively identified positively as such , or the nature or circumstances of the person 's communications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States person . ( 3 ) A person known to be an alien admitted for permanent residence loses status as a United States person if the person leaves the United States and is not in compliance with Title 8 , United States Code , Section 1203 enabling re-entry into the United States .
Failure to follow the statutory procedures provides a reasonable basis to conclude that such alien has abandoned any intention of maintaining his status as a permanent resident alien .
( 4 ) An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located outside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is information indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the United States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence .
SECTION 3 - ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING - GENERAL (U )
( a) Acquisition ( U )
The acquisition of information by electronic surveillance shall be made in accordance with the certification of the Attorney General or the court order authorizing such surveillance and conducted in a manner designed to the greatest extent reasonably feasible , to minimize the acquisition of information not relevant to the authorized purpose of the surveillance .
( S - CCO )
( b) Verification ( U )
At the initiation of the electronic surveillance , the NSA or the Federal Bureau of Investigation , if providing operational support , shall verify that the communications lines or telephone numbers being targeted are the lines or the numbers of the target authorized by court order or Attorney General certification .
Thereafter , collection personnel will monitor the acquisition of raw data at regular intervals to verify that the surveillance is not avoidably acquiring communications outside the authorized scope of the surveillance or information concerning Unite States persons not related to the purpose of the surveillance .
( S - CCO )
( c) Monitoring , Recording , and Processing

Le corset minceur et le rééquilibrage alimentaire sont deux différentes solutions bien efficaces pour perdre du poids .
Cependant , quand il s’agit d’adopter un moyen pour modifier quoi que ce soit sur son physique , il n’est vraiment pas sage d’effectuer un choix au hasard .
L’idéal est de maîtriser les options possibles afin de choisir celle qui irait mieux avec votre mode de vie et avec laquelle vous pourrez facilement vous adapter .
Vous souhaitez perdre quelques kilos et hésitez entre le port d’un corset et un rééquilibrage alimentaire ?
Cet article vous présente ces deux solutions de manière à vous orienter pour un choix judicieux .
Le corset , une lingerie toujours à la mode !
Conçu pour affiner le tour de taille , aplatir le ventre et donc réduire votre masse corporelle , le corset est un vêtement à la fois élastique et souple qui peut se présenter sous plusieurs formes dont une large ceinture ou un gilet à bretelles .
Le porter régulièrement permet d’améliorer sa posture et rendre son dos bien droit .
Il est reconnu pour son effet rapide dans la perte de poids et est utilisé par beaucoup de personnes dans ce but .
Le port du corset vous évite de consommer trop d’aliments , ce qui vous permet de maîtriser votre poids .
En effet , ce vêtement compresse votre cage thoracique de manière à réduire chez vous l’envie de manger .
Le fait de consommer très peu d’aliments augmente vos chances de maigrir surtout au niveau du ventre .
En réalité , un best waist trainer for weight loss aide à réduire le volume de votre estomac , ce qui nécessitait auparavant une opération chirurgicale .
Malgré tous ces avantages , il arrive que certaines personnes trouvent le corset trop inconfortable .
Cela relève parfois du fait qu’ils ignorent tout du mode d’utilisation du vêtement .
Par exemple , porter le corset pendant la prise du repas peut entraîner une mauvaise digestion et causer un reflux d’acide .
Le rééquilibrage alimentaire
Le rééquilibrage alimentaire est aussi un moyen efficace pour lutter contre la prise excessive de poids .
C’est un procédé qui consiste à revoir son mode de vie en prenant de nouvelles habitudes alimentaires au quotidien .
Lorsque la révision du mode de vie est faite , la nouvelle formule doit être adopté sur du très long terme .
La pratique du rééquilibrage alimentaire demande que vous ayez une parfaite connaissance de ce que vous mangez et son impact sur votre organisme .
Vos repas devront donc être soigneusement sélectionnés .
Vous devrez par la suite garder ce rythme alimentaire et y veiller avec soin .
Si vous comptez perdre du poids , le rééquilibrage alimentaire peut vous conduire à votre fin .
Le fait de contrôler minutieusement votre alimentation vous permet de garder un œil attentif sur votre masse corporelle .
Ainsi , il n’y a aucune raison pour que vous n’y parveniez pas .
Le port du corset et le rééquilibrage alimentaire sont tous efficaces pour réussir à perdre du poids .
Avoir un best waist trainer for weight loss vous permet d’obtenir un résultat immédiat si vous savez bien en faire usage .
Par contre , le rééquilibrage aliment constitue un moyen naturel qui exige un réel engagement de votre part .
Si vous êtes assez discipliné pour l’adopter , il fera de vous une personne en pleine forme et toujours bien portant .
Mais faudrait - il que vous soyez très patient .
Malware networks are typically perceived and discussed as vast , distributed structures that are capable of spanning the entire globe .
Attacking such networks often requires a significant degree of international cooperation between government agencies as well as the private sector .
Successful takedowns are difficult — but not impossible .
Despite notable successes , there 's a clear need for faster , more flexible methods of disabling malware networks .
New data from security researchers at KnujOn might just hold the answer .
According to KnujOn , a relatively small group of 10 registrars are responsible for a full 83 percent of all the spam and malware distributed over the past eight months .
Here are the top 10 offenders ; we 'll be discussing the ones in bold further down
XIN NET ( also # 1 in KnujOn 's May report ) eNom Network Solutions Register.com PLANETONLINE RegTime OnlineNIC SpotDomains Wild West Hichina Web Solutions
KnujOn is quick to point out that being on the list is not proof of ill intent on the part of the registrar .
When the researchers released their first report in May , a number of the registrars listed in the top ten took action to remove themselves .
Beijing Innovative Networks and Joker ( no. 2 and no. 4 back in May ) were told by ICANN to clean house or lose accreditation status ; KnujOn claims both companies took the warnings seriously and have since solved their problems .
Only two of the companies on the May list — eNom and Xin — are repeat offenders .
KnujOn attempted to contact both companies and requested comment ; neither responded .
Xin is currently the worst spammer in the bunch , with over three million recorded instances of spamming over just 9,000 domains .
eNom is a very distant second at 1.2 million instances of spam across 32,610 domains .
Average the two out , and Xin sent 345.4 spam messages per domain while eNom sent just 39.7 .

It 's clear that registrars can significantly reduce the amount of spam flowing across their networks by actively monitoring and shutting down illicit users — provided they are willing to do so .
In this case , that provision is significant ; comments from the registrars that participated in ICANN 's recent report on fast flux hosting indicate the companies are anything but eager to serve as Internet police .
Even if they were , it 's not clear we'd want them to .
Do n't send wolves to guard the henhouse
The ICANN fast flux working group was composed of 33 members , 12 of whom represented a total of nine registrars .
Three of the nine registrars —
eNom , Network Solutions , and Register.com — are on the list of top offenders .
Again , as KnujOn noted , this is not evidence of evil intent or bad faith on the part of any of the three registrars in question — but the included comments of these major organizations are a bit unsettling .
When we originally covered ICANN 's report we noted that it portrayed registrars as victims of these illicit malware authors and botnets .
Five of the registrars — eNom , GoDaddy , Melborne IT , Network Solutions , and Register.com — jointly submitted additional commentary on the working group 's goals and achievements .
The joint statement is defensive , to say the least .
Again , we see registrars are painted as the poor , unwitting saps in an evil malware author 's plot .
" There were suggestions that sophisticated criminal networks may create or control an ICANN - accredited registrar to facilitate illicit activities using fast flux hosting , but no data has been provided to support this claim ... also , no data has been offered to corroborate claims that some Registrars are ' involved ' in fast - flux hosting activities , " reads the statement .
According to the registrars in question , the issue of fast flux hosting is entirely outside ICANN 's purview .
The group can recommend no best practices in regards to protecting oneself from fast flux , cannot state who might benefit and who might be harmed if fast flux hosting was eliminated , and can't even separately define a victim of fast flux hosting from a beneficiary of the same .
It did , however , manage to note the need for some form of registrar liability protection in the event that a domain was falsely identified as an illicit fast fluxer and shut down .
Evidence of evil ?
No. Disquieting ?
Definitely .
One third of the registrars that participated in the working group are organizations with very real spam problems .
Given the chance to present a firm stance against malware fast flux hosting , the registrars in question emphasized their vulnerability .
If the statements in Section 2 ( quoted above ) were accurate , eNom would n't be moving up the list of malware - hosting registrars .
The registrars on KnujOn 's list are in a position to shut down a substantial amount of illegal traffic .
Malware would n't just go away , even if every registrar shut down every illict host tonight , but it'd be a tremendously positive sign of good faith to see eNom , Network Solutions , and Register.com off that list entirely six months from now .

Was Marcus Spears The Rain Man ?
Total Pro Sports -
I received a lot of email regarding the post about Pacman Jones making it rain at Marcus Spears ’ birthday party .
One tipster informed me that he was there and apparently , there was more than one rain maker .
The other person who was making it rain , was the birthday boy himself , Marcus Spears .
At first I did n’t believe him , then I reviewed the party pics and the evidence is there .
Check out exhibit A and B ( top of page ) and you can clearly see that Mr. Spears has an infatuation with fat stacks of small bills .
I know it was his birthday , but is there ever really a good time to make it rain ?
I ’m sorry that I put all the blame on Pacman yesterday , when clearly Spears was involved in the showers of money as well .
This picture is clearly shows that Spears was carrying around a backpack full of money , which he was throwing into the air .
Maybe he was trying to impress JaMarcus Russell , whatever the reason was there is still no excuse for being dressed like that in public .

New Zealand 's government today dealt a major blow to the " graduated response " bill championed by the music and movie industries by saying that it would scrap the hugely controversial plan and rewrite it from the ground up .
" Allowing section 92A to come into force in its current format would not be appropriate given the level of uncertainty around its operation , " said Commerce Minister Simon Power in a statement .
" These discussions have exposed some aspects of section 92A which require further consideration .
While the government remains intent on tackling this problem , the legislation itself needs to be re-examined and reworked to address concerns held by stakeholders and the government . "
Objections
The plan , also known as a " three strikes " rule because it would disconnect Internet users after three notices of copyright infringement , showed up in last year 's rewrite of New Zealand 's copyright law .
Vague in wording , the law required the disconnection of repeat copyright infringers but said nothing about the mechanism .
ISPs began meeting to hash out an implementation plan with rightsholders like the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand ( RIANZ ) , a key backer of the plan .
Those meetings produced no agreement by the date the law was to come into force , so the government delayed implementation from late February to March 27 .
In the weeks since , the situation has deteriorated further , with Google expressing its profound skepticism towards such a plan and one major ISP ( TelstraClear ) simply refusing to sign on to a draft document .
End-users also launched an Internet blackout and a physical protest of the new rules , which they called a " guilt by accusation " law .
The government has now accepted the reality that ISPs and users simply wo n't go along with the scheme being drafted , and it has pledged to rewrite the entire provision to produce " a more workable piece of legislation . "
Of hat - eating and suicide
Users and ISPs were most concerned that the rules would apparently disconnect even huge businesses after a few employees downloaded illicit files .
A high - profile judge raised concerns that the procedure could run afoul of contract law in New Zealand .
ISPs were n't keen on disconnecting their own customers for the benefit of one set of industries , and they could n't believe the law provided no indemnification from lawsuits ; the ISP could be sued both by users and rightsholders if they did n't like the way it was handling the three strikes program .
And users wanted some form of third - party or judicial arbitration before any Internet disconnection .
InternetNZ , which runs the .nz domain and works " to keep the Internet open and uncaptureable , " applauded the government 's move .
Executive Director Keith Davidson said , " This decision to change the law will be a relief to those who have valiantly opposed Section 92A and all that it stood for — the way it necessitated termination of Internet accounts based on mere allegations , imposed compliance costs on all sorts of businesses and organisations , and failed to protect these businesses and traditional Internet Service Providers who were caught in the middle through no fault of their own .
" Terminating an Internet account was always a disproportionate response to copyright infringement , " he added , " and to force ISPs and other organisations to be copyright judges and policemen was never an acceptable situation . "
A rewritten law will probably still lead to some sort of graduated response proposal , but the decision to back down form the current process and take all the complaints into account can't sit well with RIANZ ( which was recently arguing that the whole process should actually be tightened up a bit more ) .
As for all those worries about false positives and the quality of evidence ?
RIANZ has never taken them too seriously , since ( like the RIAA ) it insists that its detection methodology is basically foolproof .
In a recent interview posted on the RIANZ website , CEO Campbell Smith was asked if he would " eat his hat " if music industry copyright notifications turned out to contain numerous errors .
" Yes , " he said .
" I will fall on my sword and eat my hat .
Hat first . "
Fortunately for Smith , such hat - eating ( and the far more painful sword - falling - upon ) wo n't be worries for quite a while now as the legislative machinery gears back up for another bit of sausage - making .
Simeis 147 is a supernova remnant spanning over 3 degrees of the sky .
It 's estimated to lie about 3000 light years from Earth , have an approximate diameter of 165 light years across , and an expansion rate of nearly 600 miles per second .
The violent stellar explosion that created this object occurred about 30,000 years ago , leaving behind beautiful wisps of material and a pulsar designated PSR J0538+2817 .

Cashier Barbara Emme , sacked over missing bottle deposits
The sacking of a supermarket cashier suspected of pilfering has provoked wrangling in Germany about public morality and the role of big business .
Barbara Emme was fired for allegedly stealing 1.30 euros ( £ 1.16 ) worth of bottle deposits from her employer after more than 30 years of service .
Trades unions and some politicians have rallied to her defence .
They say she should not be punished so harshly while bankers who have lost billions stay in their jobs
Ms Emme worked at a Berlin branch of the Kaiser 's supermarket chain for 31 years .
It is cases like these that destroy people 's confidence in democracy
Wolfgang Thierse
Social Democratic Party ( SPD )
But earlier this week a labour court upheld Kaiser 's decision to sack her for the suspected theft of 1.30 euros worth of bottle deposits .
Veteran politician Wolfgang Thierse , the Social Democrat ( SPD ) speaker of parliament , described it an example of barbaric capitalism .
" It is cases like these that destroy people 's confidence in democracy , " he said .
" The court could have decided otherwise and taken into account that she had worked herself to the bone for 31 years for the company . "
Human rights
Horst Seehofer of the Bavarian Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , a sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel 's ruling Christian Democrats ( CDU ) , said the case exposed double standards .
" How can a cashier be fired because of 1.30 euros , while managers who lose billions of euros are allowed to keep their jobs ? " he asked .
Ms Merkel has dismissed speculation that public hostility towards big business and the bailed - out banks could influence this September 's general election .
" I think Germany is in a strong position and will emerge stronger from the crisis than when the country went into it , " she said .
Ms Emme says she will argue her case before the European Court of Human Rights if necessary .
( CNN ) -- Iran is to send a female skier to the Winter Olympics for the first time at next year 's Games in Vancouver , Canada , the head of the Islamic Republic 's ski federation told state media Monday .
Fatemeh Kiadarbandsari , competing at last month 's World Ski Championships , in France .
The chosen competitor will ski in " full Islamic dress , " Iran 's National News Agency reported .
Three women Fatemeh Kiadarbandsari , Mitra Kalhor and Marjan Kalhor are vying for the place on the national team alongside three male skiers , said Iranian Ski Federation head Isa Saveh - Shemshaki .
Trials for the team will be held in December , two months ahead of the event .
Iran has sent male athletes to every Winter Games since 1956 .
Skiing is hugely popular in Iran with some of the region 's best slopes in the Zagros Mountains just a two - hour drive from the country 's capital Tehran .
At weekends during the seven - month ski season it is common to see long queues of traffic on routes to resorts .
With a growing ski tourism industry , the price of the sport has steadily increased .
But with fewer social restrictions on the pistes than in other areas of Iranian life , the sport remains a popular pursuit for the country 's youth .
Until recently , many slopes were strictly segregated with men and women skiing on different sides of the mountain .
But while it is still illegal to travel in the same chair lift or gondola , the country 's strict religious laws are visibly more lax at 3,000 meters .
Iran took just three women among 53 athletes to last year 's Beijing Olympics but the choice of 19 - year - old female rower Homa Hosseini to carry the flag during the opening ceremony infuriated strict Islamists .
Current president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who faces an election this year , was forced to back down from an initiative ealry in his current term to encourage female participation in sport because of criticism from the country 's religious leaders .
One mullah reportedly said that women should not ski because the movement of their knees looked " more like dancing than sport . "

I was so poor growing up ...
If I was n't born a boy ...
I 'd have nothing to play with .
A girl phoned me the other day and said " Come on over , there 's nobody home . "
I went over .
Nobody was home .
During sex , my girlfriend always wants to talk to me .
Just the other night she called me from a hotel .
One day as I came home early from work ...
I saw a guy jogging naked .
I said to the guy ...
" Hey buddy , why are you doing that ? "
He said , " Because you came home early . "
Its been a rough day .
I got up this morning ... put on a shirt and a button fell off .
I picked up my briefcase , and the handle came off .
I 'm afraid to go to the bathroom .
I was such an ugly kid ...
When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up .
I could tell that my parents hated me .
My bath toys were a toaster and a radio .
I was such an ugly baby ...
My mother never breast fed me .
She told me that she only liked me as a friend .
I 'm so ugly ...
My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet .
When I was born ... the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father ...
I 'm very sorry ...
We did everything we could ...
But he pulled through .
I 'm so ugly ...
My mother had morning sickness ...
AFTER I was born .
I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father .
He said he wanted more proof .
Once when I was lost ...
I saw a policeman , and asked him to help me find my parents .
I said to him ....
" Do you think we 'll ever find them ?
" He said .
" I do n't know kid ... there are so many places they can hide . "
My wife made me join a bridge club .
I jump off next Tuesday .
I 'm so ugly ...
I worked in a pet shop , and people kept asking how big I 'd get .
I went to see my doctor .
" Doctor , every morning when I get up and look in the mirror ...
I feel like throwing up ;
What 's wrong with me ? "
He said " I do n't know but your eyesight is perfect . "
I went to the doctor because I 'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills .
My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest .

A game like Zelda was a really good choice given the lack of verbosity compared to the popularity of the game .
With the dialogue being as simple as it is , it 's not that hard for even a beginning student to follow along , compared with other more complex RPGs that require the user to notice some pretty subtle hints to progress in the game .
Dragon Warrior / Quest 1/2/3/4 are what I would like to see the most of course , given how phenomenal the plot and music always was in those games :

Just seconds before 10:50 pm
Friday night on the east coast , a Delta II rocket carried NASA 's tenth item in its " discovery " series , the Kepler Mission , into the night sky .
The Kepler Mission has a singular focus : to search for other Earths .
In pursuit of this goal , it is going to spend at least three and a half years , and possibly up to six , searching a single patch of the heavens for other planets that exist in the habitable zone of stars in the Milky Way .
In 1960 , at the Green Bank meeting in Green Bank , West Virginia , a group of astronomers , physicists , biologists , and other scientists gather and established SETI as a scientific endeavor .
At this meeting , Prof. Frank Drake put forth what is now termed the " Drake equation " :
It attempts to ascertain the average number of civilizations that we
may have the ability to contact in the Milky Way at any given time .
In
the equation , R* is the rate of star formation , f p is the fraction that
contain planets , n e is the number of habitable planets , f l is the
fraction that develops life , f i is the fraction that develops intelligent
life , f c is the number of civilizations scientifically advanced enough to
contact us , and L is the length of time that civilization lasts .
Using
Drake 's 1960 values , he calculated that there would be 10
civilizations , on average , that we may be capable of communicating with .
The equation draws a great deal of criticism from those who claim the values for some of the terms are at best arbitrary and unknowable .
Over the past 49 years , we have gotten a much better idea as to the rate of star formation in the Milky Way ( R* ) , and in the past decade we are starting to get a handle on the number of exosolar planets that exist ( f p ) .
The Kepler Mission hopes to indirectly answer what fraction of stars have rocky , earth - sized planets that exist in the habitable zone about a star ( n e ) — the region of space near a star where liquid water exist as a stable phase .
So far , 342 exosolar planets have been detected by a variety of indirect — and a few direct — measurements .
The vast majority of the exosolar planets found have been gas giants orbiting close to their stars .
Known as hot Jupiters , these are planets that have a low probability of supporting life .
The Kepler Mission will use a single piece of observational equipment — a highly advanced photometer — to look for Earth - like exosolar planets transiting their host star .
A transit is the name given to a planet passing in between us and its host star ; such an event would be observed as a slight change in the output of the star .
For an Earth - sized planet transiting a Sun-sized star , the change in the star 's output would be less than 84 parts per million , and there would be less than a one percent chance of the transit even being viewable from Earth .
Kepler 's photometer is so sensitive that it will be capable of detecting a 20 parts - per-million change in stellar output in a star that is 250 times fainter than any that can be seen with the naked eye .
To rule out false positives , an object will need to make at least three transits with a consistent period and change in brightness .
In order to maximize the chances of seeing such a rare event , the Kepler Mission will only look at a single area of the sky .
For the next three and a half years , Kepler will look towards the constellations Cygnus and Lyra and stare at the over 100,000 stars in that region .
The spacecraft 's orbit will not be about the Earth itself , rather it will be placed into an Earth - trailing heliocentric orbit , which will allow for a very stable pointing attitude .
While in this orbit , different classes of planets will be discovered within different time frames .
The first to be spotted will be the hot Jupiters , gas giants orbiting close to their host stars within a period of only a few days .
Once about a year 's worth of data is collected , Mercury - like planets — those with an orbit of a few months — will be able to be picked out .
For planets like Earth , which require a full year to orbit a star , it will take the full three years of mission time to be able to conclusively identify these objects .
As one mission scientist quipped , they are not looking for ET , but they may find ET 's home .
VISALIA , Calif . 
After nearly 90 years on the farm , Virgil Rogers has suffered through all manner of agricultural agita , from colicky cows to oscillating milk prices to drought , both past and present .
But Mr. Rogers ’s newest source of consternation , he says , is some fellow Californians .
“ Those Hollywood types do n’t have any idea what ’s going on out here on the farms , ” said Mr. Rogers , a retired dairyman from Visalia , the county seat in a Central Valley region where cows far outnumber people .
So it is that in recent weeks Mr. Rogers , whose previous political involvement amounted to little more than writing a check to a favored candidate  has suddenly become a leader in a secessionist movement bent on cleaving California in two .
But while the plan is not new  the idea of two Californias has been floated dozens of times  the motivations and geographical scissor - work are .
Frustrated by what they call uninformed urban voters dictating faulty farm policy , Mr. Rogers and the other members of the movement have proposed splitting off 13 counties on the state ’s coast , leaving the remaining 45 , mostly inland , counties as the “ real ” California .

2月は割とガンガンと開発をしてきたのだが、3月に入ってさすがにエネルギーが切れてきたので、一旦、気分転換にエントリに書いてみることにする。
ChaIMEというのは主に研究目的のかな漢字変換エンジンである。奈良先の小町さん(id:mamoruk)がメインで開発していて、自分もここしばらくはアクティブに開発している。こちらでデモを試すことができる。ChaIMEの特徴はひたすらに統計情報で変換をするところなのだが、今回はそういった話ではなく、もうちょっと一般的なかな漢字変換についての話をダラダラと書いてみようと思う。
デモを見て分かる通り、今までのChaIMEはステートレスで、ひらがな列を入力に対してそれっぽい変換候補を複数出力してさぁ選べ、という形だった。文節境界を変更したり、文節毎に候補を出すことはできない。これは単に実装コストの問題で、研究用途で実験をする際には文節境界を変更してどうたらこうたらと言うのはあまりやらないので後回しになっていた。
実験には使わないとはいえ、実用的にはやっぱり文節毎に変換候補を出したりできた方がうれしいので、最近そこら辺の機能を実装してみた。ので、今回は文節区切りとかの話しについて書く。
誤変換を訂正する際の操作には、変換候補の入れ替えと、文節区切りの変更の2種類がある。変換候補の入れ替えは2番目以降の変換候補を出せば良いだけの話であるが、もう一つの操作である文節区切りの変更というのは、実際にはどういう風にして実現すればいいのか。知ってしまえば当たり前の話なのだが、知らないと意外とわからないものかもしれないので、ちょっと考えてみるとおもしろいと思う。
あまり引っ張る話でもないのでさっさと答えを書いてしまうと、文節区切りを変更しての再解析は、「ここで文節を切れ」「ここでは文節を切るな」という2種類の制約をつけた上で変換を行えばよい。最小コスト系（最近は大体これだと思ってよい）のかな漢字変換アルゴリズムでは、ひらがな列に対応して考えうる漢字列の中でもっともコストが小さくなるものを選択してくるのだが、制約をつけるという事は、考えうる漢字列の中で、さらに制約を満たすものの中からもっともコストが小さくなるものを選ぶという話になる。具体的には、辞書引きを行う時点で、制約を満たさないかな列に対しては辞書引きを行わなければよい。
最小コストという話をちょっとしたので、さらにそちらの方も少し掘り下げてみる。最もコストが小さい漢字列を選択するという問題は、コストモデルが複雑になってしまうと、実用的な時間で解くことは難しい。そこで、計算量を落とすために、コストをノードコストとパスコストの2つのみに絞った場合を考えてみよう。前者は単語と単語の間の接続が強いほど低くなるコストであり、後者は単語の出現確率が高いほど低くなるコストである。ここまでモデルを単純化しても、ナイーブな方法では変換文字列の長さの指数乗の時間がかかってしまう。指数乗では使い物にならない。しかし、ちょっと工夫をすると、計算時間を劇的に短くする事ができるのである。ちょっとした工夫とはあるノードにたどり着くまでの最小のコストを表に記録していくというもので、これだけで変換文字列の長さに比例する計算時間で問題を解く事ができる。小さな問題の解を使って大きな問題の解を求めているわけなのでこれは動的計画法の一種であるが、Viterbi Algorithmという大仰な名前で呼ばれている。
Viterbi Algorithmで求まるのは最もコストが低い経路だけで、2番目、3番目の変換候補はビタビだけでは求めることができない。こういう、それっぽい上位N件の結果をよくN-best解と呼ぶが、N-bestを出すためにはViterbiアルゴリズムで前からコストをつけた後に、後ろからA*サーチをすれば良い。
普通はA*サーチというと最短経路を求めるためのアルゴリズムであって、N-bestを求めるためのものとしては扱われていないのだが、ゴールまでたどり着いた後にも優先度付きキューから次のノードを取り出して探索を続けることで、N-best解を好きなだけ求めることができる。
実際のところ、前向 きViterbi + 後ろ向きA*などという面倒くさいやり方ではなく、いきなり前向きA*を走らせるだけでもN-best解は求められるのだが、これは効率的な手法であるとは言えない。A*探索においては現在ノードからゴールまでの推定コストが実際のコスト以下になっている事を保証する必要があるが、これは難しい問題で、どうしても推定値が低くなりすぎてしまう。そうすると、スタートに近いノードの展開が非常に多くなってしまい、計算量が膨らんでしまうので遅くなってしまう。前向きViterbiでゴールまでのコストを正確につけておけば、後ろ向きA*の際に効率的に探索を進めることができる。
数日前までは厳密なコストがわからなければ正しいN-best解を出力できない気がしていたが、よく考えてみると、別にそんなことはなく、普通にA*の条件さえ守っていれば、N-best解は出力できる。前向きにViterbiでコストづけを行うのはあくまでも高速化のためである。
明日以降気力が持てば、実際に変換コンテキストを実装するにあたってどういう点が面倒くさかったのか、といった苦労話も書いてみるよ。
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
The Bartendaz of New York want to serve as many young people as possible -- and that 's a good thing .
One of the Bartendaz , Metaphysics , performs the flag move during a demonstration at an Atlanta - area school .
These fitness gurus are n't promoting underage drinking .
Named for the creative moves they perform on the pull - up bar , the Bartendaz are empowering youths through calisthenics .
By ditching free weights and weight machines in favor of using their own body weight on the bar and the floor , the Bartendaz have developed a series of acrobatic strength exercises that have sparked attention on YouTube and from such celebrity clients as rapper Ludacris and mixed martial arts champion Rashad Evans .
Some members also earned a stint with New York 's Apollo Circus of Soul .
But Bartendaz founder Hassan Yasin 's proudest achievement is his program 's impact on youths .
" My number one claim to fame [ is ] ... when I walk in the park and they 're not chilling on the benches , they 're at the bars , " said Yasin , 40 .
" All the guys that [ were ] hanging out there , taking up space , [ are ] now leaving because there 's too many youth coming back . "
Dozens of New York City schools have adopted Bartendaz moves into their physical education programs through grass - roots networking , Yasin said .
He believes the exercises resonate among students who have been otherwise tough to reach .
See the Bartendaz in action »
House Call Watch " House Call with Dr. Sanjay Gupta " this weekend
7:30 a.m. ET Saturday and Sunday House Call »
The Brooklyn Academy High School for at - risk students incorporated the program into its curriculum to motivate students to become more involved in physical education , said principal Elaine Lindsey .
But the kids love it so much , she said , that it became " a tool to motivate the students to actually come to school . "
The minimal equipment makes it financially and logistically accessible without the need of a gym .
And the use of body weight , instead of free weights , keeps it safe for young bodies , said Dr. Stephen Sanders , the director of the School of Physical Education and Exercise Science at the University of South Florida .
As a general rule , children should not lift heavy weights until after puberty , when their muscles are more mature , said Sanders , who is not affiliated with the Bartendaz .
The Brooklyn Academy was unable to afford the Bartendaz visits this year , which Yasin says cost about $ 400 to $ 600 per session for 25 to 30 students .
But , Lindsey said , " Once they mastered it here , they could always do it [ at ] home or anywhere . "
The Bartendaz have also found success teaching juvenile and adult inmates at Rikers Island , the New York jail facility -- an idea met with resistance about five years ago .
" ' Do n't bring fitness in there .
They 're in jail , what are you doing ? ' " Yasin said , quoting early critics .
" I said , ' It 's like stress management .
Give us an opportunity to present it . '
Once we presented it , that was it .
We started putting bars in the yard so the young men can work out . "
" They put us in the worst buildings , the most violent , and we became a breath of fresh air because there [ are ] no organizations going inside .
So for one to come inside , it gives ... the inmates the opportunity to come out and say , ' Let me listen to what they have to offer .
And now I can get out of my cell , ' " Yasin said .
Learning from someone who 's been there
This was n't Yasin 's first experience with the New York City Department of Corrections .
A native of Manhattan 's Lower East Side , he spent four years behind bars in his early 20s and did time at a juvenile facility at age 17 , both for drug - related charges .
After his release in the early 1990s , Yasin cleaned up his act and became a motivational speaker -- talking to New York youths about substance abuse awareness , conflict resolution , gang prevention and leadership -- which evolved into his nonprofit , Giant Thinking .
Meanwhile , he was honing his acrobatic skills on the pull - up bars at local parks , and eventually gained a following and partners - in - training .
Having built up respect from teachers and administrators at New York City schools , Yasin and his team were tasked with developing a program to get kids to stop cutting gym class .
" The ultimate thing was ... how can we do this in a way we do n't have to use a whole bunch of equipment ? " said Dr. G ( short for Dr. Goodbody ) , one of the Bartendaz whom Yasin consulted in developing the school initiative .
" So the concept of anytime , anywhere exercises came about . "
Today , as the Bartendaz visit schools and other facilities , they divide their time between spreading the positive messages of Giant Thinking and the fitness training of Bartendaz .
The model effectively held the attention of students at Crossroads Second Chance South .
Through a partnership with Atlanta , Georgia , nonprofit Next Century Youth , the Bartendaz recently held a series of demonstrations in the Atlanta area , including Crossroads South , an alternative high school for students who have been expelled .
After high - fiving one another for successfully naming 10 fruits that promote good health , the Crossroads South students gave a standing ovation for their classmates as they joined the Bartendaz for compound moves on the pull - up bar and on the floor for pushups .
Exercising at the pull - up bar brings a camaraderie that you do n't see among weight lifters , Yasin said .
" [ You see ] healthy competition and a lot of smiling going on , versus the aggression " involved in weight lifting , Yasin said .
There 's " nothing to talk about when you 're lifting weights .
They 're dead serious . "
Crossroads South PE teacher Rachelle Bradley said she hoped to work further with the Bartendaz to incorporate their moves into her teaching .
" It 's very practical , not something structured .
...
Our students do n't like structure , and this is more creative , " Bradley said .
Bartendaz fan Justin Kemp , 18 , found the group on YouTube about a year ago and took on its exercise techniques soon after .
Before long , he went from doing three pushups during television commercial breaks to being able to do 100 to 150 consecutively , he said .
" I feel challenged , " Kemp said .
" I love when I 'm challenged because ... it keeps me on top of my game . "

In today 's world , thousands of organizations across the globe are engaged in the business of outsourcing .
An idea that has been there since centuries gained a lot of popularity in the decade that has gone by .
In general , outsourcing refers to contracting out work of any kind to a third - party provider .
Something that started as a cost - cutting measure soon garnered momentum all over the world due to the benefits it offered to the organizations across industry verticals .
However , at present , cost reduction is not the only objective of outsourcing .
A contemporary organization looks for strategic benefits of outsourcing like increased efficiency , substantial decrease in turnaround time , access to skilled resources and above all considerable improvement in profits .
The choice of an outsourcing partner is the first step in the right direction for a company that intends to make the most out the service .
Like any other business activity , the selection of an outsourcing partner should also be preceded by research and planning .
Therefore , the primary consideration of an organization must be the evaluation of benefits .
The first thing that crosses the mind when thinking about outsourced services is the liberty toconcentrate on what works best in the interest of a company .
In the light of this situation , let us examine the most important benefits of outsourcing :
Access to specialized resources : A contemporary organization often outsources a specified business activity to a third - party when it needs services that demand specific skills or capabilities .
It is quite possible that the desired skill set might not be a part of the core competencies of the company .
Consequently , offshoring makes sense for such service providers .
Not only does it enable focus on revenue generating activities , but also allows access to the competent services of your strategic partner .
Impact on bottom line :
There is a stark difference between the labor rates of developed economies and developing countries like India .
Consequently , the companies can leverage on currency difference .
This eventually enables savings and reflects on the profits of organizations .
A company can also reduce its capital expenditure and infrastructure costs .
All this adds to revenue in the long run .
One - track business focus : Non-core business functions often add unnecessarily to the workload of an organization .
As a result , the quality of core business functions gets affected .
In this scenario , outsourcing peripheral or non-core functions to a third - party restores the focus of an organization as it is able to give its best in terms of core functions .
Unparalleled support to customers :
Your outsourcing partner helps you provide quality deliverables to your clients in lesser time .
This not only adds to the satisfaction of your customers , but also reinforces the trust they repose in your services .
X FACTOR wannabe Emma Chawner and her family are being booted out of their home after neighbours complained about wild karaoke nights , abusive arguments and noisy pets .
The Chawner family have just four weeks to find somewhere to live after a judge allowed Six Town Housing to evict them from their council house in Lancaster Avenue following a three - day hearing at Bury Magistrates ’ Court .
Hairdressing student Emma hit the headlines last year when Simon Cowell mocked her homemade dress and blasted her performance of Celine Dion ’s My Heart Will Go On , saying she sang ‘ like a baby ’ .
The 19 - year - old braved the judges again for the latest series with a change of song and a new outfit , but failed to impress once more .
In August 2007 the family admitted 17 offences of rowdiness and were given a postponed possession order allowing them to stay in their property providing no further complaints were made against them .
Since then there have been an additional 134 allegations of nuisance behaviour , including playing loud music and singing late at night , foul and threatening language directed towards their neighbours , banging on walls and a constantly barking dog .
The family insist they are innocent and that they will appeal against the decision .
Dad Philip Chawner , aged 53 , said : “ We are not happy with what is going on and I do n’t think that we have been treated fairly . ”
He claims the family did n’t know what they were doing when they previously admitted nuisance behaviour allegations .
“ We were forced into signing papers that we did n’t fully understand and now we have been told that we ’ve breached the contract , ” said Mr Chawner .
“ If we are supposed to be making all this noise then why did n’t the council install sound monitors in the house ? ”
Emma , sister Samantha , aged 20 , mum Audrey , aged 57 , and Philip have four weeks to leave their three - bedroom semi- detached house , where they have lived for nearly five years .
Since moving to the area , the family claim to have been assaulted by residents and say they have suffered verbal abuse and vandalism .
A council spokesperson said : “ At the recent hearing , the judge was satisfied that there had been substantial breaches of the tenancy agreement .
He recognised that Six Town Housing had been fair and equitable in its dealings with the family and had taken all necessary steps to prove the case .
“ The Chawner family have been in touch with the homelessness prevention team and they have been allocated a support worker from ‘ Places for People ’ and their individual needs will be now be fully assessed to determine their housing need . ”
So what ’s the job market really like then ?
When I ’m going around agencies , creatives always ask me what it ’s like ‘ out there ’ .
Lots of people are worried about their jobs and want to know how easy it will be for them to find another if they end up getting the boot .
And I have n’t been able to answer them properly .
From my own experience I ’ve found it to be shit ‘ out there ’ – but my experience is limited to my own job role and a handful of agencies .
However , it ’s an important question to answer , so I decided to ask an expert in the job market – a very lovely headhunter .
So here ’s my interview with Jan Sullivan at Canna Kendall .
I hope it answers your questions .
—
In any recession , the advertising industry is going to suffer .
From the recruitment point of view , are you noticing any changes ?
Yes , we have about a third of the briefs we are accustomed to !
Clients are slashing budgets and agencies are cutting back on hiring .
One of the first signs of fear in the industry is a hiring freeze .
Are you seeing more of that ?
A lot !
About 50 % at least .
It ’s false economy to stop hiring talent in a recession but agencies are cutting back .
A downturn is traditionally a time for agencies to get rid of dead wood .
Is that the case just now or is it beyond that now ?
Quite a few agencies are doing that as they are forced to think more smartly about the way their agencies are structured .
It ’s not just dead wood , there are some very talented creative ’s on the market at the moment , through no fault of their own .
Are you seeing a difference between marketing disciplines ?
For example , are ad agencies finding it harder than digital agencies ?
How is DM faring ?
Traditional agencies are definitely finding it harder than digital agencies .
True integration is what clients want .
DM seems to be steady too .
What about different sizes of agencies ?
Who is faring best ?
small , medium or large agencies ?
Tough to tell at the moment .
Redundancies are happening across the board .
I presume there are a lot more people in the market for jobs just now .
What advice do you have for candidates to help them stand out from the crowd ?
Have a your website / CV ready to go .
Make it clear , easy to navigate and draw on your strengths .
Do your homework on agencies and be charmingly persistent – but do n’t haunt people .
On the other side , what advice do you have for agencies trying to hire new talent ?
We are biased of course because we ’d say use us !!!
Agencies need to hire for the future .
Different skills sets are now required and agencies need to keep ahead of the game in hiring innovative people .
Is there a shift in the balance between the freelance and full - time markets ?
There is a flood of freelance talent due to the layoffs .
And there ’s a clear lack of full time jobs .
Should people who ’ve been made redundant look at freelancing just now ?
Or is it better to try to get back into a full - time position ?
Try to get back in to a full time position .
Freelance can be very famine or feast .
These things usually affect jobs in different ways .
Which roles are really suffering and which ones are doing well ?
We only handle Creative here so it ’s difficult to say .
But we ’ve noticed that the higher up the level you are , the worse it is .
You need movement at the top to start the ball rolling .
Do you have any advice for any juniors trying to get into the industry just now ?
Do as much creative and spec work as possible .
Do your homework on an agency .
Always go prepared and ask the person you ’re seeing for a brief to work on .
You never know , your brief might be the one they show to the client .
Go out and network at as many events as possible .
See things that inspire you like exhibitions , travelling , museums , music , etc. Visit NABS – they have computers you can use and mentors to help you on your way .
They also have a lonely hearts book club for single juniors looking for someone to team up with .
Do n’t sit still .
—
So , unfortunately , it does n’t look like very good news at the moment .
My advice would be to keep your portfolio updated .
And try to do something with it that will help it stand out from everyone else’s .
What ’s your experience ?
Do you disagree with this ?
Is there anything else you ’d like me to find out ?
Just drop me a line or leave a comment on this post .
Someone needs to spank Kellogg 's on its sugar - frosted hiney .
And If I bought Kellogg ’s products I would join the call to boycott them .
How does a company devoted to setting little kids on the path to Type 2 diabetes get all sanctimonious about Michael Phelps and a bong hit ?
His behavior is inconsistent with its image , the company says .
Huh ?
How can that be ?
Tony the Tiger is generally the first pusher of addictive substances in a child 's life .
That 's the American way .
Take Frosted Flakes .
The company recommends a 3 / 4 - cup serving , but come on that 's like eating a handful of sugary air .
A real bowl is about two to three times that amount .
That means kids can start the day with up to 36 grams of sugar , or about 9 teaspoons per bowl .
Multiply that morning after morning .
Then there are Crack - its , or rather , Cheez -its .
I do n't care what the serving portion is , can anyone stop at anything under half a box ?
Anyway , the larger point is this :
He 's a 23 - year - old young man who got caught doing what 23 - year - old young men do .
Phelps has apologized .
He can still be president .
And most of his other sponsors , like Speedo , seem to be sticking with him .
Why is Kellogg 's hyperventilating over this ?
Frankly , I think the company is shooting itself in its frosted foot .
It will never find a better pitch man .
The message was streamlined and simple : eat this food and you too will have to swim 17 hours a day .
Anyway , over on Huffingont Post , Lee Stranahan takes a different tack .
He argues that Kellogg 's is alienating its most devoted adult client base , the stoner crowd .
Here are snippets from his petition calling for boycott :
1 ) Kellogg's is a major manufacturer of cereal and junk food products including but not limited to Frosted Flakes , Pop Tarts , Cheez - Its , Froot Loops , Keebler 's Cookies , Rice Krispies , Eggo Frozen Waffles , Famous Amos Cookies and many other products known to be a part of the diet of many marijuana using Americans 2 ) Kellogg 's has profited for decades on the food tastes of marijuana using Americans with the munchies .
In fact , we believe that most people over the age of twelve would not eat Kellogg 's products were they not wicked high .
3 ) That Kellogg 's has decided to end their relationship with Olympic Swimmer Michael Phelps after pictures of him surfaced doing exactly what most Kellogg 's customers do right before enjoying a bowl of Rice Krispies mixed with Keebler Cookies with an Eggo on top .
The rest is pretty funny and worth a read .

Galveston , Texas …
Spring is often associated with new life , and the hurricane - recovering island is no exception .
Galveston ’s Moody Gardens is celebrating the births of a porcupine and two king penguin chicks .
Benito the prehensile - tail porcupine was born on Feb. 26 , and the two penguin chicks both hatched on Feb. 18 .
“ It ’s this kind of news that makes us realize a new and great season is here , ” said Animal Husbandry Manager Greg Whittaker .
“ We hope people will join us this spring and check out the newborns while seeing the tremendous progress Galveston has made in its recovery since Hurricane Ike . ”
The prehensile - tail porcupine baby is the second successful birth of its species at Moody Gardens .
His mother is believed to have been pregnant either during or shortly after the storm .
The baby was appropriately named Benito , which means “ lucky one . ”
The fuzzy , chocolate - brown critter is scheduled to be transferred into an exhibit for public viewing this spring break .

I love VMware ( used it since its first releases ) and I love it even more now 😄.
Yesterday I had the not so crazy idea ( and not original ) to use VMware for Mac OS X kernel debugging because newest Little Snitch version seems to have a new anti-debug trick and I do n’t have another Mac at hand .
After some trial and error I managed to get it working , so let ’s show how it ’s possible .
The first thing you need to do is read these two Apple documents , this and this .
We need two machines , one to be the target and one to be the debugger .
A VMware virtual machine can be used for target machine which is great !
Our workflow should be something like :
Install Leopard inside a VMware virtual machine .
Read this forum thread to learn how to do it .
The signiso.sh script might need small fixes and if you upgrade VMware Fusion after you installed Leopard into the virtual machine , you will need to sign again the updated VMware iso images ( else you will get an error telling it ’s not a valid machine or something like that ) .
Start Leopard inside the virtual machine and update to the same patch level as your debugger machine .
Download Kernel Debug Kit from here into the debugger machine .
You should download a version that matches your current kernel ( probably 10.5.6 if you are using Leopard up to date ) .
This debug version will allow us to breakpoint on symbols since it has symbol information .
Btw , you will need to open a developers account , it ’s free !
Download XNU kernel source code from here .
This will allow to follow the source inside GDB and even breakpoint into line numbers !
Configure the virtual machine so we can attach the debugger to it .
The Apple articles talk about changing NVRAM settings but there ’s no such thing for VMware .
There is another trick we can use !
Edit the following text file , / Library / Preferences /SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist .
You can add our needed options at Kernel Flags key .
Use the - v flag ( for verbose output ) , pmuflags=1 ( to avoid watchdog timer problems ) and debug=0x1 ( or other debug flags available , read the initial referred documents ) .
I prefer to use the debug=0x1 flag because I could n’t find a way to create NMI events inside the virtual machine .
I want to do kernel debugging while it ’s running ok , not just when it crashes 😄.
Example : Insert a static arp entry for debugger machine IP in target machine .
We are talking about VMware virtual networks .
Check the following picture , you should be able to understand it 😉. ifconfig en0 , for example ) .
This will be the IP address we are going to attach GDB from debugger machine .
At debugger machine , open kernel debug kit dmg image .
Now open GDB like the following example .
You will need to issue the GDB command target remote - kdp .
This will tell GDB to enable remote kernel debugging protocol .
$ gdb / Volumes / KernelDebugKit/mach_kernel GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 ( Apple version gdb-962 ) ( Sat Jul 26 08:14:40 UTC 2008 ) Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation , Inc. GDB is free software , covered by the GNU General Public License , and you are welcome to change it and / or distribute copies of it under certain conditions .
Type " show copying " to see the conditions .
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB .
Type " show warranty " for details .
This GDB was configured as " i386 - apple - darwin " ... gdb$ target remote - kdp
Reboot virtual machine .
You should get a verbose boot and as soon it stops or the blue screen appears , you can attach GDB .
Sometimes ( at target machine ) you will get a prompt telling it ’s waiting for the debugger to attach , other times it stops while in the verbose boot and others it stops while at the blue screen .
I ca n’t get consistent results on this , I just know I can attach the debugger at this time .
So , when it stops , attach GDB with the attach IP command .
For example my target machine IP is 192.168.246.128 .
I used the following :
gdb $ attach 192.168.246.128 Connected .
Error while running hook_stop : Invalid type combination in ordering comparison .
gdb$ c
That error should be normal if you are using . gdbinit ( because of the bug described here ) .
Type c or continue and Leopard should finish booting ( if you take much time doing this , boot might hang and you need to reboot virtual machine and start again ) .
That ’s it !
But you ca n’t use normal Control - C to break into the debugger .
This does n’t work 😦.
Since we can’t break into GDB anytime we want , we can use a little trick which is to setup a known breakpoint at step 9 , before we issue the continue command .
A good candidate is the tcp_connect kernel function .
Why ?
Because we can use the telnet command to connect to some IP and that will use tcp_connect !
So the reformulated step 9 should be :
$ gdb / Volumes / KernelDebugKit/mach_kernel GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 ( Apple version gdb-962 ) ( Sat Jul 26 08:14:40 UTC 2008 ) Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation , Inc. GDB is free software , covered by the GNU General Public License , and you are welcome to change it and / or distribute copies of it under certain conditions .
Type " show copying " to see the conditions .
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB .
Type " show warranty " for details .
This GDB was configured as " i386 - apple - darwin " ... gdb$ target remote - kdp gdb$ break tcp_connect Breakpoint 1 at 0x24d1e0 : file / SourceCache / xnu/xnu-1228.9.59/bsd/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c , line 874 . gdb$ attach 192.168.246.128 Connected .
Re-enabling shared library breakpoint 1 Error while running hook_stop : Invalid type combination in ordering comparison .
gdb$ c
Try to telnet somewhere .
As soon as you press enter the virtual machine should hang and GDB should have control .
Something like this :
Breakpoint 1 , 0x0024d1e0 in tcp_connect ( tp = 0x28c5a68 , nam = 0x1ad97ed8 , p = 0x27b904c ) at / SourceCache / xnu/xnu-1228.9.59/bsd/netinet/tcp_ usrreq.c:874 874 /SourceCache/xnu/xnu-1228.9.59/bsd/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c :
No such file or directory .
in / SourceCache / xnu/xnu-1228.9.59/bsd/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c
Error while running hook_stop : Invalid type combination in ordering comparison .
gdb $
The No such file or directory error is due to the fact I do n’t have the XNU kernel sources installed .
If you want , unpack them somewhere and create the SourceCache link at disk root or create / SourceCache and unpack there ( whatever suits you ) .
Now you are inside the kernel , you can setup other breakpoints and do whatever you want .
About the .gdbinit problem .
We can still use our beloved . gdbinit but we need an additional trick to work around it .
Create a file with the following context ( suggestion : gdbinitfix , located in your home dir ) :
set $ SHOW_CONTEXT = 1 set $ SHOW_NEST_INSN = 0 set $ CONTEXTSIZE_STACK = 6 set $ CONTEXTSIZE_DATA = 8 set $ CONTEXTSIZE_CODE = 8 set $ SHOWOBJECTIVEC = 1 set $ displayobjectivec = 0
Now at step 9 or 11 , you need to issue the “ source ” command : gdb$ source ~/gdbinitfix
This will add the missing variables and now you can fully use . gdbinit with kernel debugging 😃 .
And that ’s it !
We can now use kernel debugging with a single Mac machine !
Hurray !!!
If you have any doubt or problem feel free to leave a comment .
I think I have n’t missed any detail .
Word of caution : sometimes the virtual machine seems to hang if you do n’t use it for some time .
Not sure if this is due to debugger or not .
And the kernel debug protocol communication is not super fast , so maybe gdbinit needs some adjustments .
Just a word of caution 😄 .
As usual , have fun exploring and testing new things !
fG !
P.S. : Everytime you reboot the virtual machine you will need to kill the GDB process .
It hangs so you will need the kill - 9 friend .
And Little Snitch runs without any problem inside the virtual machine !
Update :
You should add the option - arch i386 ( or - a i386 ) to GDB because VMware only runs 32 bits kernels .
If you are running a 64 bit kernel in the host system and set breakpoints via symbols , you will have trouble since breakpoints will be set to the 64bits version .
Thanks to Rennie for the tip .
Also if you are having problems with the virtual machine locking up , try to disable the power options in the virtualized OS X .
Update 2 : Very important :
You need to have the debugger machine with the firewall turned off !
Else kernel panics will happen !
Damn 😉.
Update 3 : Snare remembered me about the int3 trick if you are developing your kernel modules ( as in userland ) .
Insert a asm ( “ int $ 3 ” ) ; where you want to drop into the kernel debugger .
In Little Snitch case it is harder to apply because the kernel driver ca n’t be unloaded .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sarah Palin has firmly remained in the media spotlight since her bid for the vice presidency ended four months ago , but the Alaska governor embraced a decidedly lower profile when she traveled to the nation 's capital this weekend .
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin speaks at the meeting of the National Governor 's Association in December .
The former Republican vice presidential candidate scheduled a busy itinerary of closed - door events and face time with congressional Democrats and Republicans .
She also announced earlier this week she 's making the 4,500 - mile trek from Alaska to Washington primarily to attend the Alfalfa Club Dinner Saturday night -- an annual closed - door roast of the nation 's political elite .
But it 's what 's missing from Palin 's schedule that is causing more than a few heads to turn .
In a city that is ground - zero for national political journalists , Palin has not scheduled a single media interview or indicated she will hold a press conference .
She also brushed past reporters without making any comments Saturday as she entered the Alfalfa Club Dinner .
" She has requested we do not schedule any interviews for her , " said Bill McAllister , Palin 's communications director .
Instead , McAllister said , Palin is traveling to Washington to lobby senators to approve certain infrastructure projects for Alaska in the economic stimulus package .
The move is an unusual one for the high - profile governor , especially one believed to have presidential ambitions , on a visit to Washington , a city where most politicians come to gain a piece of the media spotlight rather than avoid it .
The decision to avoid cameras also appears to be a marked departure from Palin 's media strategy over the nearly 90 days since the presidential campaign ended .
In that time , she granted a number of sit - down interviews with prominent television hosts , magazines and conservative journalists .
Political analysts noted that Palin appeared to adopt a largely adversarial relationship with the national media ; using her interviews to criticize what she perceived as unequal and unfair coverage over the course of the presidential campaign .
Analysts speculated that a media - bashing strategy could be an attempt to drum up support from the rank - and - file conservatives with whom she was popular during the campaign .
Palin was in the national headlines to such an extent that she faced criticism from some members of her own party , both publicly and privately , who said she was overexposing herself and potentially endangering her chances of being a credible presidential candidate in 2012 should she decide to run , analysts said .
" When she 's out in public still , at this point , she might do more damage than good , both for the GOP and for herself , " said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University .
Instead , many Republicans said , Palin should retreat from the national spotlight and work on quietly strengthening her resume as a state executive while slowly building credibility among the Republican elite behind the scenes .
" She needs to demonstrate growth as a politician , as a political leader , " Alex Castellanos , a Republican strategist and CNN contributor , said as Palin dominated the headlines .
" You can't do that if you keep staying in front of us day after day after day as the same person . "
By all outward accounts , it 's a message Palin has heard loud and clear .
Last week , Palin established a political action committee -- the traditional vehicle potential White House aspirants use to raise cash , support fellow party candidates and quietly establish groundwork for a presidential run .
The low - profile trip to Washington appears to be a continuation of efforts to gain credibility within the party for Palin , who openly acknowledged she 's more interested in getting face time with President Obama and powerful senators from both parties than talking to high - profile journalists .
Ultimately though , Palin must negotiate a treacherous path in her approach to the media , opening herself up to criticism if she appears either too confrontational toward national reporters or too reticent .
Speaking briefly to Alaska reporters earlier this week , Palin said participating in public events and media interviews outside her state is not her priority .
" I do receive , our office receives , hundreds if not thousands of requests to either speak or participate in something , " she said .
" We turn them down for the most part .
We say no , I 'm not going to leave Alaska or I 'll rarely travel outside of Alaska . "
The Alfalfa Club dinner is the ultimate venerable gathering of elite politicians , but it has become an especially big draw this year , because White House sources have confirmed Obama is slated to attend .
Palin's office also said she had plans to participate in a number of other nonpartisan functions while she 's in Washington over the weekend , including a private dinner Friday night at the residence of prominent businessman and former Republican operative Fred Malek .
A number of Republican and Democratic senators are also on the guest list for that event , including Sen. Diane Feinstein , D - California , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky .
Palin also planned to take part in a luncheon Saturday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a foreign policy think tank .
" She came into the campaign as the maverick , as the person outside the establishment , " Zelizer said .
" What she really needs to do now is build her credentials with the establishment .
Right now , the goal is not to build her support with the grassroots , it 's to build her support inside the beltway . "
All About Sarah Palin • Republican Party
Ten years ago , I represented Britain at a UN general assembly special session in New York , where political leaders reviewed progress in tackling the illegal drug market , and set out a 10 - year plan to eliminate the illicit production and use of drugs such as cannabis , heroin and cocaine .
Fast forward to this week in Vienna - where a similar gathering is tasked with reviewing progress and setting out a framework for international drug controls for the decade to come - and the lack of headway is striking .
Albert Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results .
So far in Vienna , the meeting appears to have been struck by a similar affliction .
Yes , it is every politician 's nightmare : a controversial subject that the electorate cares about and that the media write about ( some might say ) obsessively .
But evidence of the failure of policy is overwhelming .
All credible studies conclude that there has been no overall reduction in the scale of production or use , and that in many parts of the world the problem has got significantly worse .
There are at least 200 million users of controlled drugs .
The illegal market generates an estimated $ 300 bn turnover for organised crime .
Overall rates of addiction are probably rising , as is transmission of the Aids virus through shared needles .
States as diverse as Mexico , Afghanistan and Guinea - Bissau struggle to maintain control as profits from trafficking foment violence and disorder .
Thirty countries still have the death penalty for drug offences and many continue to use it despite clear advice that this breaches the UN charter .
The forced eradication of crops in countries such as Colombia condemns whole communities to poverty and ill health .
Legal clampdowns increase drug users ' marginalisation , and the social and health risks of their behaviour .
Perhaps all this " collateral damage " would be justified if the drug market was being reduced .
The inconvenient truth is , it is not .
How will the international community respond ?
Well , the head of the UN drugs agency , Antonio Maria Costa , has issued a report claiming " undeniable success " , and governments are on the verge of signing a political declaration that meekly reports : " Some progress has been made . "
The declaration is essentially a reiteration of the objectives and activities agreed in 1998 - no recognition of a decade 's evidence ; no new ideas or initiatives .
Privately , delegates are acutely aware of the weaknesses and divisions , but have no answers to offer .
Some countries have tried to push for a more honest assessment .
Britain is one - we may still be prone to rhetorical posturing and have tied ourselves in legislative knots over cannabis classification , but we do not send lots of people to prison for using drugs .
We prioritise treatment for addiction and promote harm reduction approaches to improve the life chances of drug users and to prevent the spread of blood - borne viruses .
We also accept that our law enforcement agencies cannot save the country from drugs .
This is modern , pragmatic thinking .
It will be drowned out in Vienna by a series of exhortations for tougher action in the " war on drugs " .
Tomorrow , representatives of all UN member states will adopt a declaration that commits them to another decade of the same strategy , in the hope of achieving different results .
Einstein 's definition seems to ring true .
We 're about to witness another walk up the political and diplomatic path of least resistance .
It will do nothing to help the millions whose lives are destroyed by drug markets and drug use - and , depressingly , we can all book our seats for 2019 , to go through this charade again .

If you ’ve got a bunch of old fluorescent tubes laying around that you ’re not sure what to do with , you could build your own recycled tube lamp like this one by Toronto - based design collective Castor Canadensis .
Unattractive lights that would otherwise have been thrown away are transformed into a fixture that ’s simple and modern .
Light Bulb Lamps
Everybody ’s making the switch to compact fluorescent bulbs , and while that ’s a good thing , it also means old incandescents are piling up all over the place .
Bulbs Unlimited makes it easy to recycle them into a quirky light fixture with DIY kits that save old dead bulbs from an unpleasant fate in the landfill .
Chiquita Banana Chandelier
You would n’t think that a couple dozen Chiquita banana cardboard cartons would make a chic chandelier , but somehow , designer Anneke Jacobs has achieved just that .
She created this colorful design , which casts subtle ambient lighting , while a student at the Utrecht School of Product Design .
Modern Lights from Glass Bottles
Wine bottle lamps are a popular DIY projects , but they are n’t always pretty and certainly ca n’t be called modern .
This interpretation , however , ditches the cheesy Italian restaurant vibe with a simple silhouette and blocks of color .
Each hanging Khrysalis light fixture comes with a frosted bulb that flickers slightly , much like the fluttering of a butterfly about to leave the chrysalis , thus the name .
Water Bottle Chandelier
Plastic water bottles are like a plague upon the earth .
They litter highways , meadows and bodies of water – and since people are n’t likely to give them up any time soon , some intrepid designers have taken to finding creative new ways to reuse them .
This chandelier by Stuart Haygarth is both beautiful and functional , taking hundreds of plastic bottles out of the waste stream .
Gold Toy Lamp
When you ’ve got a giant pile of unwanted toys , you could take the artistic approach and glue them all together to create a lamp base .
At least , that ’s what designer Ryan McElhinney has done with the ‘ Gold Toy Lamp ’ , in which dozens of figurines are bonded together and coated in a high - gloss gold polyurethane lacquer .
Ballpoint Pen Chandelier
The Volivik Lamp by En Pieza is constructed almost entirely of Bic ballpoint pens strung onto circular forms .
It comes in both orange and clear versions , but as you can see , the clear pens really allow the light to sparkle and shine in a way that rivals even expensive crystal chandeliers .
Vespa Lamp
When trying to decide what to do with an old out - of - commission Vespa , creating a lamp might not be the first thing that comes to mind .
However , as this design by Lamponi ’s Lamps proves , it can be a kitschy addition to your décor and certainly makes good use of the vintage moped ’s headlight .
Melted Lego Lamp
It might not win any awards for looks , but no one can deny that this melted Lego lamp is creative as all get - out .
The design , chosen as one of Craftster ’s best projects of 2007 , was created by baking the Legos in a round cake pan in the oven .
Cocktail Umbrella Lamp
The next time you attend a tropical - themed party , gather up as many of those silly little drink umbrellas so you can make your own version of this ‘ Happy Hour ’ lamp .
The hanging lamp , based on an award - winning prototype by the Rhode Island School of Design , features cocktail umbrellas sprayed in a protective lacquer and finished with a fire retardant spray .
Plastic Spoon Chandelier
As long as there are picnics , there will be plastic utensils .
Disposable tableware is a bane to the environment , but this unusual project ensures that hundreds of plastic spoons avoid the trash bin .
The 22 ” x 16 ” chandelier by Studio Verissimo of Portugal looks like an expensive Lucite fixture – you do n’t realize what you ’re looking at until you get up close .
Blender Lamp
When blenders quit working and repair is n’t an option , you could always turn it into an eye - catching table lamp .
Instructables has the step - by - step directions that help you turn a piece of junk into a conversation piece that will find a perfect home on your bar , kitchen counter or desktop .
Hanging Teacup Lamps
Teacups make the perfect hanging light – they ’re just the right size to use alone as a subtle spotlight or in a group for a dramatic chandelier .
These “ ted ” lights by Domestic Construction are made from tea cups acquired at flea markets and thrift stores all over the country , hardwired and fully prepped for immediate installation .
Traffic Light Lamp
Greenlight Concepts reincarnated old traffic lights into sleek hanging light fixtures fitted with high - efficiency LED bulbs .
The recycled traffic lamp comes , naturally , in “ Intimidating Red ” , “ Yielding Yellow ” and “ Go Green ” .
Simple , streamlined , brilliant reuse .
A picture of an armed sheriff moving through an American home after an eviction due to a mortgage foreclosure was named World Press Photo of 2008 on Friday .
Jury members said the strength of the photo by American Anthony Suau for Time magazine was in its opposites -- it looks like a classic war photograph , but is simply the eviction of people from a house .

" Now war in its classic sense is coming into people 's houses because they can't pay their mortgages , " jury chair MaryAnne Golon said .
Fellow juror Akinbode Akinbiyi said : " All over the world people will be thinking : ' This is what is happening to all of us ' . "
The news agency Agence France - Presse won the Best Spot News Photo category with an image of post-election violence in Kenya and also the People In The News Singles category with an image of tribal conflict in western Kenya .

After being on the economic equivalent of “ Mr. Toad ’s Wild Ride ” this past year , you might be coming up a little short on cash when it comes time to funding your IRA .
This is a big problem if you were counting on contributing the maximum amount and getting a tax deduction for 2008 .
As crazy as this initially sounds , you might consider funding your IRA by using a cash advance on your credit card .
This approach can be a little risky , but in the right circumstances , you might actually make a profit .
Whether this makes sense for you depends on a couple of things :
1 . The type of IRA matters
First , it depends on what type of IRA you have .
If you have a Roth IRA , you ’re funding it with after - tax dollars .
There ’s no tax deduction involved , so funding your Roth IRA with a credit card does n’t make sense .
If you ’re one of the 37.5 million households in the United States who own a traditional IRA , though , you ’re funding your account with pretax dollars .
“ Typically , this strategy works best if it ’s a traditional IRA where you can get a deduction and you ’re also in a high enough tax bracket to offset the cost of borrowing on your credit card , ” says Lee Rosenberg , a certified financial planner in Jericho , N.Y .
2 . Your tax bracket matters
For the 2008 tax year , if you ’re 49 and under , you ’re allowed to contribute $ 5,000 to your IRA ; if you ’re 50 and over , you can contribute $ 6,000 .
The tax savings really add up as your tax bracket climbs .
Here ’s how much you ’ll save if you use a credit card to temporarily fund a $ 5,000 IRA contribution :
Tax savings from funding $ 5,000 IRA with credit card Income Tax bracket Tax savings
Net tax savings
if paid in full
after two months *
Net tax savings
if paid in full
after 12 months * Less than $ 16,050 10 % $ 500 $ 251 ( $ 199 ) Between $ 15,005 & $ 65,100 15 % $ 750 $ 501 $ 51 Between $ 65,100 & $ 131,450 25 % $ 1,250 $ 1,001 $ 551 Between $ 131,450 & $ 200,300 28 % $ 1,400 $ 1,151 $ 701 * Includes $ 150 credit card fee plus minimal monthly payments of $ 125 with 12 percent interest using CreditCards.com ’s credit card calculator .
Is your cash - flow problem only temporary ?
Funding your IRA with a credit card is risky , but if you ’re expecting an influx of money — and waiting for a rich uncle to die does n’t count — then this is a viable option to consider .
Maybe you ’re waiting on a sales commission check or a bonus in the next few months .
Or you ’ve loaned money to someone and the loan is due next month .
“ If there is a short - term cash crunch and you knew the credit card would be paid off within the next three to nine months , then it could be an option , but I would be very cautious about it , ” says Robert Schmansky , a certified financial planner in Detroit .
Most financial experts warn against taking this plan too far .
Even if you still make money by spreading the cost out over 12 months , that does n’t mean you should do it .
“ It only makes sense if you pay off the debt quickly , ” says Jeff Stouffer , a certified financial planner and a chartered financial analyst in San Francisco .
“ Otherwise , I think it could contribute to a short - term attitude toward investments . ”
Look at the numbers carefully
Research by the Investment Company Institute shows that the “ typical ” IRA owner makes $ 75,000 a year .
Let ’s say you ’re 48 years old and you contribute the maximum $ 5,000 to your IRA .
In this case , you pay taxes on $ 70,000 instead of on $ 75,000 .
You ’re in a 25 percent tax bracket , so your estimated tax savings is $ 1,250 ( $ 5,000 x .25 ) .
If you get the $ 5,000 as a cash advance from your credit card , you ’ll pay around a $ 150 fee .
According to CreditCards.com , the national average for credit card interest was hovering around 12 percent in early February 2009 .
Here ’s your net tax savings if you take two months to pay off the debt :
Net tax savings if you take two months to pay off the debt
You borrow : $ 5,000 Your tax refund : $ 1,250 Less credit card fee : $ 150 Less interest : * $ 99 Net savings $ 1,001
* Based on results using the credit card calculator on CreditCards.com , you ’d pay $ 99 in interest charges if you made payments of $ 125 each month before paying back the rest of the balance in a lump sum .
You ’ve still saved a total of $ 1,001 , plus you ’ve added $ 5,000 to your IRA fund .
Even if you spread out the debt over 12 months , you come out ahead :
Net savings even if you take 12 months to pay off the debt
Tax savings : $ 1,250 Credit card fee : $ 150 Interest : $ 549 Net savings : $ 551
Another way to view this is to think about how much money you ’re actually paying back on the $ 5,000 that you borrowed .
Let ’s take a look at the numbers if you pay the $ 5,000 back in two months :
Another way to look at the numbers when paying back in two months
You borrow : $ 5,000 Less tax refund : ( $ 1,250 ) Plus interest ( $ 99 ) and fees ( $ 150 ) : $ 249 Net amount you have to pay back : * $ 3,999
* Your savings are $ 5,000 minus $ 3,999 , which equals $ 1,001
How ’s your risk tolerance ?
In this economy , putting money in your IRA is not exactly a risk - free proposition .
We ’ve all had to get a little more comfortable with the ups and downs of the stock market .
Before you take that cash advance , though , you need to be comfortable with your financial situation and be able to handle the uncertainty .
There are really two parts to this : the amount of risk you ’re comfortable with and the amount of risk you should take .
Are you going to have sleepless nights if that check you ’re expecting is delayed by four months ?
If so , then pass on this approach .
If you ’re used to the roller - coaster ride of the market and the prospect of misjudging this situation wo n’t break your budget or mess with your sanity , then consider it .
The amount of risk you should take is a little different .
“ If you ’re young and wo n’t need the funds soon , you can consider moving your IRA funds into something more long - term and stable , like a CD , ” says Schmansky .
If you ’re getting closer to retirement , though , you have less time to recover from a financial mistake .
You also may not want to tie up your money in long - term CDs .
When in debt , do n’t try it
If you currently have a balance on your credit card that you ’re paying interest on , then this option is not for you .
“ This is not a strategy for those who are n’t used to paying off credit card debt in a timely manner , ” says Rosenberg .

Doctors praised Mehul Kumar as they successfully removed the iron rod
A six - year - old Indian boy is recovering after doctors removed a two metre ( 6ft ) iron rod that speared his body when he fell from a terrace .
Mehul Kumar was rushed to hospital in the city of Ranchi in Jharkhand after the incident on Wednesday .
Doctors at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences removed the rod in a four - hour operation .
The doctors said he had lost a lot of blood and suffered liver and stomach injuries but " nothing major " .
Mehul was playing on the Indian festival of Holi when he fell on the rod in a terrace under construction at his grandparents ' home
He was given first aid at a local hospital than transferred to the Rajendra .
A surgeon there , Sandeep Aggarwal , said : " Opening the abdomen , we discovered his liver was injured , the stomach was injured , but thankfully , the spleen and pancreas were safe .
" The child was lucky that he did not suffer any major injury but yes he had substantial injuries . "
Dr Aggarwal praised Mehul for his strong willpower .
RIMS director NN Agarwal said : " Mehul will recover fast and properly because he is a child and most of his vital organs are in the process of development . ''
Amazingly this is not an isolated incident in India .
Last year , doctors in Delhi removed a 5 ft iron rod from the chest of a 22 - year - old man after a road accident .
And a 21 - year - old construction worker in the western city of Pune had a 6ft rod removed that pierced him from shoulder to thigh via his abdomen .
I am a huge fan of SASS ( Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets ) for styling Rails applications .
I have been using it on all of my projects for quite a while now and have developed some great techniques that make it much easier to organize , write , and read stylesheets in an application .
Unlike HAML , SASS retains most of the same “ feel ” when writing the code as vanilla CSS .
It simply adds more power and better organizational tools , making it an easy choice as a go - to replacement .
You can teach someone the basics of SASS in about 30 seconds : use two spaces to indent everything , put the colon before the declaration and no semicolon afterwards .
In fact , I ’ve even written regular expressions to convert CSS to SASS mechanically in some cases .
It ’s easy to pick up and once you do you will start reaping real benefits .
The 20 - Second “ Get Up And Running ”
To use SASS , you must have the HAML gem installed on your Rails app .
Add it to your environment.rb :
config.gem ' haml ' , :version => '>= 2.0.6 ' 1 config . gem ' haml ' , : version =& gt ; '>= 2.0.6 '
Now you can create SASS stylesheets simply by making . sass files in a public / stylesheets / sass directory .
Basic Example : Building a Menu the SASS Way
The best way to start explaining the power of SASS may be through one of the more common styling tasks one encounters : styling a menu .
Here we ’ll assume a menu structure like this :
< ul id=' menu ' > < li > < a href= '/'>
Home</a></li> < li >< a href= '/ about '> About </a></li> < li >< a href= '/ services '>
Services </a></li> < li >< a href= '/ contact '> Contact</a></li> </ul > 1 & lt ; ul id = ' menu ' & gt ; & lt ; li & gt ; & lt ; a href = '/' & gt ; Home & lt ; / a & gt ; & lt ; / li & gt ; & lt ; li & gt ; & lt ; a href = ' / about ' & gt ; About & lt ; / a & gt ; & lt ; / li & gt ; & lt ; li & gt ; & lt ; a href = ' / services ' & gt ; Services & lt ; / a & gt ; & lt ; / li & gt ; & lt ; li & gt ; & lt ; a href = ' / contact ' & gt ; Contact & lt ; / a & gt ; & lt ; / li & gt ; & lt ; / ul & gt ;
To style this menu in CSS , we might do something like this :
# menu { margin : 0 ; list - style : none ; } #menu li { float : left ; } #menu li a { display : block ; float : left ; padding : 4px 8 px ; text - decoration : none ; background : # 2277aa ; color : white ; } 1 # menu { margin : 0 ; list - style : none ; } #menu li { float : left ; } #menu li a { display : block ; float : left ; padding : 4px 8 px ; text - decoration : none ; background : # 2277aa ; color : white ; }
SASS allows you to use indentation to indicate hierarchy , saving much repetition and space .
The same code in SASS looks like this :
! menu_bg = # 2277 aa # menu : margin 0 : list - style none li : float left a : display block : float left : padding 4px 8 px : text - decoration none : color white : background = ! menu_bg 1 ! menu_bg = # 2277 aa # menu : margin 0 : list - style none li : float left a : display block : float left : padding 4px 8 px : text - decoration none : color white : background = ! menu_bg
Hierarchical selectors mean that if you indent something , the selector it falls under will automatically be prepended to it , so the two examples above generate the same output .
You ’ll also notice ! menu_bg in the SASS code .
SASS allows you to declare constants that can be reused throughout the code , a very useful feature when dealing with colors .
Now we have our basic setup for the menu , but let ’s handle some better cases .
I want the color to change when I hover over the menu options and I want to highlight the current menu option ( we ’ll assume that the < li > encapsulating the current menu item will have class ‘ current ’ when it is selected ) .
Let ’s add these features first using CSS , then SASS .
With CSS :
# menu { margin : 0 ; list - style : none ; } #menu li { float : left ; } #menu li a { display : block ; float : left ; padding : 4px 8 px ; text - decoration : none ; background : # 2277aa ; color : white ; } #menu li a :hover { background : # 116699 ; } /*
Make sure the color does n't change when the current option is hovered .
*/ # menu li.current a , #menu li.current a : hover { background : white ; color : black ; } 1 # menu { margin : 0 ; list - style : none ; } #menu li { float : left ; } #menu li a { display : block ; float : left ; padding : 4px 8 px ; text - decoration : none ; background : # 2277aa ; color : white ; } #menu li a :hover { background : # 116699 ; } /*
Make sure the color does n't change when the current option is hovered .
*/ # menu li.current a , #menu li.current a : hover { background : white ; color : black ; }
This is n’t too bad , but our selectors keep getting longer and longer .
Let ’s look at the same thing in SASS .
# menu : margin 0 : list - style none li : float left a : display block : float left : padding 4px 8 px : text - decoration none : color white : background = ! menu_bg &:hover : background = ! menu_bg - # 111111 &.current a , a:hover : background white : color black 1 # menu : margin 0 : list - style none li : float left a : display block : float left : padding 4px 8 px : text - decoration none : color white : background = ! menu_bg &:hover : background = ! menu_bg - # 111111 &.current a , a:hover : background white : color black
The ampersand ( & ) in SASS is a shortcut to insert the entire parent selector at that point .
By using &.current I am saying “ the parent selector with a class of current . ” &: hover means “ the parent selector when hovered . ”
This makes it easy to write complex selectors in a compact , easy - to - read manner .
Another great thing about SASS is it has built in CSS color math .
Note where I declared : background = ! menu_bg - # 111111 .
That is equivalent to subtracting 1 from each of the values of the constant ’s color , which in this case yields # 116699 .
This is great , because now I can change the color of the menu and the hover state will automatically change without me having to manually find it and recalculate it for a new color .
Note that whenever you are using constants or performing calculations you need to add the equals sign to your declaration .
Getting organized with a master .
sass
Another way you can use SASS is to organize all of your CSS into a single file without having to worry about it in your view .
I have recently started using this approach for a number of reasons :
It allows me to control stylesheet inclusion from within the stylesheets themselves , making the structure more readable .
I can define global colors that can then be used in any of the child stylesheets .
It ’s really easy !
In a new project , I always create a master .
sass that will look something like this :
// Define app-specific colors first ! green = # 191 ! gray = # 555 // Now define globally applicable , general styles body : font - family Arial , sans - serif a : color = ! green : text - decoration none : font - weight bold //
Now import all of your other SASS files , they will be // automatically included in the same generated CSS file // at compile time .
@import menu.sass @import content.sass @import admin.sass @import users.sass 1 // Define app-specific colors first ! green = # 191 ! gray = # 555 // Now define globally applicable , general styles body : font - family Arial , sans - serif a : color = ! green : text - decoration none : font - weight bold //
Now import all of your other SASS files , they will be // automatically included in the same generated CSS file // at compile time .
@import menu.sass @import content.sass @import admin.sass @import users.sass
Using this structure I have a modular , easily expandable collection of stylesheets with global color constants and basic styles .
In addition , I can add this to my Rails application with the simplest of calls :
<%= stylesheet_link_tag ' master ' %> 1 & lt ; %= stylesheet_link _ tag ' master ' % & gt ;
Wrapping Up
Hopefully this gives you a taste of the easy awesomeness that is possible with SASS .
The greatest thing about the library is you do n’t lose touch with writing CSS because SASS is CSS , just with a few extras and shortcuts to make power - styling easier .

Got some cartoons in the works , more on that later .
Viagra .
Levitra .
Hydrogen sulfide ?
The compound responsible for the smell of rotten eggs could be a new way to treat erectile dysfunction , based on an early study in rats by a team featuring the UCLA Nobel laureate pharmacologist , Louis Ignarro .
Ignarro's team injected the penile smooth - muscle of rats with hydrogen sulfide , which relaxed them , allowing more blood to flow in — just like Viagra .
" In the future , that could help humans have an erection , " said Jim Cummings , a urologist at St. Louis University and expert in erectile dysfunction , who was not involved in the new research .
Though it smells extremely bad , hydrogen sulfide is a bizarre chemical that has some strange and unexpected effects on living things .
In mice , it 's been shown to induce a state like " suspended animation " while other scientists say that 2 H 2 S was responsible for a mass extinction on Earth several hundred million years ago .
It could eventually help soldiers survive blood loss resulting from war injuries .
And now , just maybe , it could help impotent men for whom Viagra and similar drugs have n't helped .
Pfizer has reported that half the men taking Viagra do n't refill their prescriptions , suggesting that it does n't work for everyone .
A meta -review of the drug 's clinical trials found that even when it works generally , it does n't work during every sexual attempt .
Viagra works by stimulating the production of nitric oxide , which usually relaxes the penile tissue .
The physical result of the hydrogen sulfide treatment appears to be the same — relaxing the smooth - muscle in the penile tissue known as the corpus cavernosum , but it exploits a different chain of molecular tools .
" This is a completely different pathway , " Cummings said .
" If it were to work out in humans , it would be a way to help out people that are n't responding to Viagra and drugs like it . "
To turn this animal research into a human therapy will likely take years , if not decades .
The goal would probably be to develop a formulation that could be taken as a pill , just like Viagra , Cummings said .
" What I would foresee is not that we'd inject the gas into our own penises , we 'd look for a drug that would make you generate more of this compound in your own tissues , " he said .
The early results published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggest that this could be possible , although no one knows what the side effects might be .
Their data " strongly support the case " for a role for hydrogen sulfide as a key component in the human erection process .
The team secured human penile tissue from men having male - to - female sex - change operations .
They found that the human penis tissue expressed measurable amounts of hydrogen sulfide , which raises the hope that some drug could be found to cause more H 2 S production .
" These observations may help to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of human penile erection and may lead to the development of therapeutic approaches in the treatment of ED and sexual arousal disorders , " the authors wrote in PNAS .
Author 's Note , 9:16 pm :
This post has been updated to correct the description of the corpus cavernosum in the 7th paragraph .

I 've noticed that some of the messages I leave on reddit 's comment boards do not appear when I 'm logged out .
They only appear when I 'm logged in under my username .
To everyone else , they simply are n't visible .
For instance , try opening up two browers , say Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox .
In the first browser , log in as usual .
In the second browser , make sure you 're logged out .
Then leave a message on a comment board that is sure to get their moderators ' attention .
After a few minutes , view the same comment board in the second browser .
If you got censored , your message will still show up in the first browser , but will have disappeared in the second .
It 's a covert method of censorship , probably adopted by the guys who run reddit to generate as little controversy as possible , because the people who get censored are none the wiser .
They think everyone can still read their posts , but in reality , the outside world does n't even know they 're there .
There would be a massive outcry if its userbase knew how routinely they were being censored without their knowledge .
I looked through all my previous comments and discovered that even the most innocuous messages get censored .
This has nothing to do with the number of downvotes that you get either .
Comments that get downvoted beyond the viewing threshold still appear as a single - line " collapsed comment " that you can open up by pressing the " [+ ] " button .
Anyone notice reddit doing this to their comments or submitted stories too ?
Strings ' N ' Things
Ketamine
Citation : Psilo707 .
" Strings ' N ' Things : An Experience with Ketamine ( exp58931 ) " .
Erowid.org .
Jan 21 , 2007 .
erowid.org/exp/58931
DOSE :
500 mg insufflated Ketamine ( powder / crystals )
BODY WEIGHT : 180 lb
Part One : Escape From the Motherland
Part Two : Through the Spiraling Wormhole
Part Three : The Other Super String Theory
Part Four : Anti-Ascension
Setting : Bedroom , 6:00 A.M.I have only been using Ketamine on an occasional ( sometimes often ) basis for a little over a year now as of this writing .
I have always enjoyed it , but did not get a true taste of a strong K - Hole experience until recently .
Its dark and foreboding side is alluring to me and I view it as the rebel drug of the psychedelic world  the outcast , too strange even for the other chemicals to hang around it .
My favorite time to slip into a k - hole is after a long night of activity on MDMA , preferably while still coming down , though not necessary , I feel it brings a deeper side to the drug and enhances my trip quite a bit .
This report is about one of those times , my most recent one , and it was so powerful that I think it would be interesting to write it in a form which might emulate the way I was thinking while under the influence , and also in present tense .
Ive been waiting a couple weeks , collecting my thoughts on what exactly happened during this 2 - 3 hour K - Hole , but I think I have it figured out as much as possible , which is not very much at all .
A warm sun is rising over the eastern horizon through my translucent blinds and I m receiving the perfect temperature and light within the room .
Im physically tired from the night before , but my brain is ready for more action .
I dig 300 mg worth of Ketamine out of my bag ( weighed up ) onto a tiny metal spoon and take it in consecutive bumps in a swift manner .
ZooooooOOOOP !
Ahhh !
Theres that taste , I m so used to the slight sting of the drug that it doesnt bother me much at all anymore .
If you have never tasted Ketamine before  it tastes exactly how Id think it should .
A slight chemical wave  runs through my nose and down my mouth , sending signals to the rest of my body in a fashion that is clearly communicating ,  Here we go again . 
I lay back on my bed in a perfect symmetrical position as I always do , and begin to ascend .
The feelings seem to be coming on strong and I await the peak with open arms .
Green walls and a tilted ceiling fan are visible .
My physical body must still be too aware of my bedroom , I need to concentrate on my departure .
Cosmic particles are running up through my spine , bypassing my neck , and colliding with my brain at a quickened rate .
Each successive particle is pushing me slowly and slowly upward in an erratic fashion .
I am in an elevator riding to the summit of the universe , yet its stopping at every floor on the way up .
Not surprisingly , only my mind and my sense of breath are being elevated , and I have left the rest of my body from the chest down back at the home base .
Oh well , I dont need any of that stuff anyway .
If we were all simply flying brains in a 4 - Dimensional universe , as I seem to have just become , there would be much less problems in the world anyway .
I am now free .
My first clue is the fact that I feel my eyes halfway open , yet I am no longer in that small cubed room within another small cube .
I see a landscape of pure white .
Checkered patterns slowly make their way across the mental world in my head ( my imagery  ) and I am attempting to chase them down to find out where they are going .
I am successful in chasing these flying entities , but a problem arises when I realize with every one I catch , another infinite - number of them spawn .
Involuntarily I seem to be analyzing how long it will take to catch an infinite number of these , and before I come up with an answer , I am hit with a split second of thoughts that have been blasted to me in a capsule from the reality 
I had come from .
For that brief moment I was back in my body , I calmed my breathing down and reminded myself that Ketamine is one of the safest substances there is .
Assured , I was immediately blown back into the cosmos , to a level never having been reached in this way .
I have just flown past our dimension of time and space .
I am flying forward in an erratic yet peaceful spiral direction , not only in my mind but my body as well .
The speed is picking up , and I feel my mind communicating with my hands ( who have remained in the first dimension with the rest of humanity ) , telling them to clench the bed and hold on for life .
I have just flown through the second dimension , into the third , into the fourth .
My speed has maxed out , far beyond the standards of terminal velocity , and I continue in the form of a particle through each successive dimension .
While I am still aware of the amount of planes of time / space I am passing through , the travel becomes smooth and I am passing through each dimension at a constant rate  everything is flowing and allowing my specific particle to pass as I reach levels deeper into the cosmos .
I am in Dimension Ten , and I feel my speed slowing at a rapid pace .
The swirls have become stagnant and are inspecting me as I pass peacefully through the only territory they have ever known .
I pass through the last gate  the end of the line .
I am in Dimension 11 and this seems to have been my destination all along .
I come to realization that only a few entities are ever allowed this deep , and I must not take my presence here for granted .
I am floating in void , many shapes and scenes unfolding in front of me  all of them alien , none realistic in regards to the physics and chemical make - up of the known universe .
I float around for what seems to be quite some time , I am soaking everything in and am not forcing my own control within this void at all .
Then , something happens .
The 11th Dimension has imploded onto itself .
I watch every other entity within this realm begin to connect to one another , to become one .
They are acting in this manner at a very fast rate , and I know my time to connect with them draws near .
I wait until an appropriate time to join them arises , and then I open my arms and succumb to the growing web of matter .
With no delay or transition , I become one .
I am the singularity .
All of us entities have finished connecting with each other and begin to contract into a single point in reality [ or , non-reality ] .
We surpass the form of a point and become a( Note :
This is absolutely the most intense and unreal mind state I have ever achieved , with the exception of 5 - MeO - DMT , which is only slightly ahead . )
As this Singularity , I am in the center of everything that is known .
I am connected to every part of every universe and dimension that I have just traversed .
Through a set of invisible strings , which connect every piece of matter ever conceived to one another , I can focus on any area of the cosmos that I wish .
I can see the place that I originated  the beautiful and naturally  flawless body in space that I came from ( Earth ) .
I see its inhabitants living their lives , I see the powerful energy that is attempting to sustain these inhabitants , and I see the people who are truly important to me as alive and happy .
I connect my thoughts through these various strings whose endpoints are residing in the alternate multiple dimensions I had briefly visited , and I am struck with a sense of awe at how unique and different each one is from the next .
Each has their own physical properties and types of beings that live their existence within them .
The strings have now hidden themselves from me , and I am thankful for them having been revealed , as it has given me more awareness of the fact that everything in the universe might  truly be connected to one another .
I have descended in my mind state , but only slightly .
I am slowly gaining awareness of my self being placed back into my physical body .
It s a strange feeling , and my eyes are half - open , yet I still do not fully understand my location .
My mind is spiraling back from the alternate realities I had faced , and slowly , memory of what the real world  is slowly comes back to me .
A blast of introspection hits me like a train , and I see myself and everything that I believe in , compressed into one small space that is my mind .
My entire memory and persona is re-assembling itself , and the love for what I have in this world feels stronger and more vibrant within me .
As I slowly open my eyes , I look at the corners of my ceiling , which seems to stretch for miles away .
There also seems to be a thin layer of darkened  matter spread throughout the room , which seemed to make my surroundings darker than I believed them to be in reality .
I noted this was nothing new , and Ketamine usually did , in fact , make my vision seem darker in an indoor environment .
I dismiss my surroundings once again and , closing my eyes , hope to squeeze every last feeling out of the mind state that I had achieved .
My internal vision is one of a vast expanse of empty space , with a few thoughts that I can access if I choose to ( who were visibly floating within ) .
I decide to focus on reaching a clear , meditative mind state , and do not think in detail about any sort of idea .
My mind feels open and relaxed , and I concentrate on disregarding my ego as much as possible , attempting to study my situation from an overall perspective .
Without relating any of my own experiences to them , I begin thinking about the aspects of life that are most important to ones existence .
I think of family , of friends , of choosing a career with which I can use my skills and traits successfully , and I think of attempting to remain as morally good of a person as I can be during this lifetime .
I feel the effects of the Ketamine gradually fade into the recesses of my mind .
Im in a very positive mood , having felt cleansed of all the stress I had accumulated during the last few weeks , and I do not feel tired or lazy at all .
Im ready to get up and go do something productive , while contemplating the perspectives of myself that the substance had just allowed me to see .
I smile in contentment , and without hesitation , pull myself off of my bed , put on some warmer clothes , and head out of the house .
We can produce a lot of electric power from alternative sources of energy .
On of these sources can be found in the waves !
Portugal realized that and built Agucadoura , the world 's first wave farm off its coast .
There are three Wave Energy Converters generating a total of 2.25 MW .
The elongated metal contraptions bob up and down with the waves , while internal pistons , attached to the sea floor , remain stationary and pump hydraulic fluid .
All this mechanic arsenal drives electric generators .
The electric power is brought ashore by underwater electrical cables .
The wave farm is now tapping into enough constant , renewable energy to power 1500 homes .
Who knew there was so much power in the ocean waves ?
Imagine what we can do with many of these farms all over the oceans .
But it seems there is no interest in this at this time .
I hope in the near future generators such these will be one of the clean alternative for an energy - starved planet .
I like to cook .
I hate washing dishes .
Sometimes I let dishes pile up in my sink and on my countertop .
When I stagger downstairs for breakfast , sometimes I have no clean dishes , and I have to rearrange the dirty dishes in the sink to find dishes to wash and to make room to wash them .
Sometimes I 'm good , and I put my dirty dishes in the dishwasher immediately .
My sink 's always empty , so I can use it if necessary , and my cupboards are full of clean dishes and pots and pans and other cooking utensils .
I do n't have to set aside extra time to get my kitchen in shape before I can cook .
A few of my friends run marathons .
They train every day for several months , though usually not the full twenty - six - and - a - half miles on every run .
They do n't show up on race day having run not at all in the past year , expecting to finish .
They put in a little bit of work every day to prepare .
I write novels as a hobby .
My goal is to write a thousand words every day .
That takes somewhere between half an hour and an hour and a half every day .
In a year , I can write two novels at this pace .
It 's possible to write a novel in a month , but that 's some three thousand words every day .
A professional writer with a great outline , a good sense of character , and the discipline that comes from months or years of writing every day could make that work , but not so anyone else .
When I write code , I run my tests every time I make a change to the code I 'm testing .
Sometimes that 's every few seconds .
I could run my tests only when preparing to release a new version , but every time I 've done that , I 've spent hours debugging problems that would have taken me seconds to fix if I could trace them down to the single line of code I changed since my last successful test run .
In all of these endeavors , one step at a time adds up to big progress over time .
Writing one word is n't difficult .
Washing one dish is easy .
Fixing one failing test is trivial .
Running one mile is much less daunting than running twenty six .
This is n't a new thought .
It 's barely an interesting thought .
I wonder , though -- what is so different about upgrading to a new release of software every month that 's so difficult the only way to do it is in a long - delayed , long - planned , big thud upgrade every two or three or five or ten years ?
It 's not as if I wash any fewer dishes one at a time than all at once , or run any fewer steps one mile at a time than twenty six at a time , or write any fewer words a thousand at a time than a hundred thousand at a time , or write any less code two and three lines at a time than two or three hundred at a time .
The amount of work accomplished tends to scale linearly .
Maybe upgrades seem daunting and weird and difficult because big bang all at once once in a blue moon upgrades are simply too big to be anything other than difficult .
Maybe small , frequent upgrades can be so boring and dull that they 're as easy as putting your spoon in the dishwasher after you finish eating .
Certainly with Parrot we 've discovered that releasing a new stable version every month is much easier than releasing a new stable version only once or twice a year .
It 's documented .
It 's automated .
It 's repeatable .
It takes some time , but it 's fairly boring how uncomplicated it is .
What makes the other side of the process -- users upgrading -- any more difficult ?
Blender , a music and entertainment magazine , will cease publication with its April issue , but will continue to publish on its Web site , blender.com , its owner , the Alpha Media Group , announced on Thursday .
“ We went as far as we could in a difficult environment , ” said an Alpha Media spokeswoman , Nora Haynes .
About 30 people will leave the company as a result of the magazine ’s closing , she said .
Alpha also is combining its magazine Maxim with Maxim.com , which means a few staff changes and , potentially , more layoffs .
Joe Levy , the editor in chief of Blender , will become editor in chief of the combined Maxim and Maxim.com ; Jay Woodruff , formerly editor in chief of Maxim Digital , will become chief content officer of the operation .
Blender has been publishing since 2001 , featuring music reviews , recurring features like “ greatest songs ever , ” and articles on Ludacris and Radiohead .
It is aimed at young men and its covers have tended to feature female singers , like Fergie and Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls , in come - hither poses .
It 's Sunshine Week , a nonpartisan celebration of ( and request for ) government transparency .
Most of transparency concerns are n't technical in nature — open meetings and open records law are two of the biggies — but the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's contribution to Sunshine Week looks to be a boon to tech journalists and advocacy groups .
The EFF has put its entire archive of government documents online .
These have been " pried loose from secretive government agencies " through Freedom of Information
Act requests and lawsuits over the years , but EFF has scanned and indexed all of them , then created a custom search engine to make browsing or digging much easier .
While the documents have been used by EFF 's own attorneys already , the new central repository makes it much easier for third parties to see the same material without having to file another FOIA request of their own .
For instance , if you 're interested in seeing all documents related to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , the search engine makes that simple .
In seconds , you can be viewing exciting documents like the Tentative Agenda for ACTA meeting in Tokyo ( which is unbelievably vague ; " Lunch , " " Continue Negotiation , " " Coffee Break , " and " Conclude Discussion " basically sums it up ) .
The EFF 's documents include material on National Security Letters ( NSLs ) , the government 's Automated Targeting System ( ATS ) , and various telecom lobbying records .
" Until recently , documents obtained under FOIA often gathered dust in filing cabinets , " said David Sobel , EFF Senior Counsel and director of the organization 's FOIA Litigation for Accountable Government ( FLAG ) Project .
" We believe that government information should be widely available and easy to research , and our new search engine makes that a reality . "
Courtesy McClatchy - Tribune Direct
The document cache is a nice place to start , though a central FOIA database that combined scanned documents from many such organizations would probably be more useful .
The project is more than just a way to publish material that would otherwise sit in a room at EFF headquarters ; it 's also a way to crowdsource the information - gathering process a bit .
FOIA responses can return thousands of pages of documents , and while EFF 's own lawyers can't simply let anonymous Internet readers do all the work , they 're happy to have the help .
EFF asks that anyone who digs up an interesting tidbit in the documents pass it along for further analysis .
The project is a reminder that transparency is n't just good practice ; in many cases , it 's also good for the bottom line .
A graphic produced by McClatchy - Tribune Direct for use during Sunshine Week shows that exposing corruption can help the government save money .
In 1989 , federal whistleblowers brought both increased transparency and $ 15 million in recovered cash to the government .
In 2007 , the government recovered more than $ 2 billion in taxpayer money thanks to whistleblowers .
Sunshine
Week also promotes a host of other transparency strategies , including a new website and a project that hopes to make even the text of Congressional bills more transparent .
" In February 2009 , Congress passed the largest piece of spending legislation in history and no one read the bill , " says ReadTheBill.org .
The site 's mission , as you can guess from its name , is to push for enough time between a bill 's final text and its final vote to enable legislators to actually examine the completed text in full .
The recent stimulus package in question only had 13 hours from final text to vote .
The Japanese government filed a protest with the Netherlands after an anti-whaling group crashed into a Japanese whaling ship on Friday morning in the Antarctic , media reports said .
Japan summoned Dutch Ambassador Philip de Heer to the Foreign Ministry to demand the Netherlands take appropriate measures against a Dutch - flagged vessel for violently harassing and obstructing Japan 's research whaling , Kyodo News Agency quoted Japanese officials as saying .
The Steve Irwin , the flagship vessel of anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd Conservation crashed into the stern of the Japanese whaler Yushin Maru No 2 early Friday as the group tried to interrupt the transfer of a dead whale up the slipway of the Japanese ship .
Reports said that the US - based Sea Shepherd tried to entangle Japanese propellers and activists threw rancid butter at the whaling fleet .
Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson was quoted as saying that the emergence of a second Japanese ship made the collision inevitable , and said the Japanese whalers were acting " increasingly aggressive " , threatening the lives of his crew .
Minoro Morimoto , the head of Japan 's whale research institute ICR said the repeated obstruction by the activists was " criminal " and urged the International Whaling Commission to deplore their actions .
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Nobuhide Minorikawa called the group 's action " extremely regrettable " .
Minorikawa and de Heer agreed that Japan and the Netherlands would continue cooperating to prevent a recurrence of dangerous behaviour at sea .
Shigeki Takaya , a Fisheries Agency spokesman for whaling in Japan , called the incident " appalling and unforgivable " .
" We will ask concerning countries , including Australia , to immediately stop them from carrying out such horrendous acts , " Takaya said .
One crew member on the Steve Irwin required five stitches after being hurt while disorientated by Japanese long - range acoustic devices , according to the Sea Shepherd .
The activists accused the whalers of using high - pressure water cannons and acoustic weapons against them .
The Japanese whaling fleet , undaunted by international protests , plans this year to catch about 1,000 whales for " scientific purposes " in the Antarctic ocean .
Critics regard Japan 's scientific whaling a cover for commercial whaling , while Japan argues that it was necessary catch a number of whales to gain information on whale population figures and data on their migration routes .

How can light get to us from stars which are millions of light - years away in a universe which the Bible claims is only thousands of years old ?
Some stars are millions of light - years away .
Since a light - year is the distance traveled by light in one year , does this mean that the universe is very old ?
Despite all the biblical and scientific evidence for a young Earth / universe , this has long been a problem .
However , any scientific understanding of origins will always have opportunities for research — problems that need to be solved .
We can never have complete knowledge and so there will always be things to learn .
One explanation used in the past was rather complex , involving light traveling along Riemannian surfaces ( an abstract mathematical form of space ) .
Apart from being hard to understand , it appears that such an explanation is not valid , since it would mean that we should see duplicates of everything .
Created light ?
Perhaps the most commonly used explanation is that God created light “ on its way , ” so that Adam could see the stars immediately without having to wait years for the light from even the closest ones to reach the Earth .
While we should not limit the power of God , this has some rather immense difficulties .
It would mean that whenever we look at the behavior of a very distant object , what we see happening never happened at all .
For instance , say we see an object a million light - years away which appears to be rotating ; that is , the light we receive in our telescopes carries this information “ recording ” this behavior .
However , according to this explanation , the light we are now receiving did not come from the star , but was created “ en route , ” so to speak .
This would mean that for a 10,000 - year - old universe , that anything we see happening beyond about 10,000 light - years away is actually part of a gigantic picture show of things that have not actually happened , showing us objects which may not even exist .
To explain this problem further , consider an exploding star ( supernova ) at , say , an accurately measured 100,000 light - years away .
Remember we are using this explanation in a 10,000 - year - old universe .
As the astronomer on Earth watches this exploding star , he is not just receiving a beam of light .
If that were all , then it would be no problem at all to say that God could have created a whole chain of photons ( light particles / waves ) already on their way .
However , what the astronomer receives is also a particular , very specific pattern of variation within the light , showing him / her the changes that one would expect to accompany such an explosion — a predictable sequence of events involving neutrinos , visible light , X - rays and gamma-rays .
The light carries information recording an apparently real event .
The astronomer is perfectly justified in interpreting this “ message ” as representing an actual reality — that there really was such an object , which exploded according to the laws of physics , brightened , emitted X - rays , dimmed , and so on , all in accord with those same physical laws .
Everything he sees is consistent with this , including the spectral patterns in the light from the star giving us a “ chemical signature ” of the elements contained in it .
Yet the “ light created en route ” explanation means that this recorded message of events , transmitted through space , had to be contained within the light beam from the moment of its creation , or planted into the light beam at a later date , without ever having originated from that distant point .
( If it had started from the star — assuming that there really was such a star — it would still be 90,000 light years away from Earth . )
To create such a detailed series of signals in light beams reaching Earth , signals which seem to have come from a series of real events but in fact did not , has no conceivable purpose .
Worse , it is like saying that God created fossils in rocks to fool us , or even test our faith , and that they do n’t represent anything real ( a real animal or plant that lived and died in the past ) .
This would be a strange deception .
Did light always travel at the same speed ?
An obvious solution would be a higher speed of light in the past , allowing the light to cover the same distance more quickly .
This seemed at first glance a too - convenient ad hoc explanation .
Then some years ago , Australian Barry Setterfield raised the possibility to a high profile by showing that there seemed to be a decreasing trend in the historical observations of the speed of light ( c ) over the past 300 years or so .
Setterfield ( and his later co-author Trevor Norman ) produced much evidence in favor of this theory .
[ 1 ]
They believed that it would have affected radiometric dating results , and even have caused the red- shifting of light from distant galaxies , although this idea was later overturned , and other modifications were also made .
Much debate has raged to and fro among equally capable people within creationist circles about whether the statistical evidence really supports c decay ( “ cdk ” ) or not .
The biggest difficulty , however , is with certain physical consequences of the theory .
If c has declined the way Setterfield proposed , these consequences should still be discernible in the light from distant galaxies but they are apparently not .
In short , none of the theory ’s defenders have been able to answer all the questions raised .
A new Creationist cosmology
Nevertheless , the c - decay theory stimulated much thinking about the issues .
Creationist physicist Dr. Russell Humphreys says that he spent a year on and off trying to get the declining c theory to work , but without success .
However , in the process , he was inspired to develop a new creationist cosmology which appears to solve the problem of the apparent conflict with the Bible ’s clear , authoritative teaching of a recent creation .
This new cosmology is proposed as a creationist alternative to the “ big bang ” theory .
It passed peer review , by qualifying reviewers , for the 1994 Pittsburgh International Conference on creationism . [ 2 ]
Young - Earth creationists have been cautious about the model , [ 3 ] which is not surprising with such an apparently radical departure from orthodoxy , but Humphreys has addressed the problems raised .
[ 4 ]
Believers in an old universe and the “ big bang ” have vigorously opposed the new cosmology and claim to have found flaws in it .
[ 5 ]
However , Humphreys has been able to defend his model , as well as develop it further . [ 6 ]
The debate will no doubt continue .
This sort of development , in which one creationist theory , c-decay , is overtaken by another , is a healthy aspect of science .
The basic biblical framework is non-negotiable , as opposed to the changing views and models of fallible people seeking to understand the data within that framework ( evolutionists also often change their ideas on exactly how things have made themselves , but never whether they did ) .
A clue
Let us briefly give a hint as to how the new cosmology seems to solve the starlight problem before explaining some preliminary items in a little more detail .
Consider that the time taken for something to travel a given distance is the distance divided by the speed it is traveling .
That is :
Time = Distance ( divided by ) Speed
When this is applied to light from distant stars , the time calculates out to be millions of years .
Some have sought to challenge the distances , but this is a very unlikely answer . [ 7 ]
Astronomers use many different methods to measure the distances , and no informed creationist astronomer would claim that any errors would be so vast that billions of light - years could be reduced to thousands , for example .
There is good evidence that our own Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light years across !
If the speed of light ( c ) has not changed , the only thing left untouched in the equation is time itself .
In fact , Einstein ’s relativity theories have been telling the world for decades that time is not a constant .
Two things are believed ( with experimental support ) to distort time in relativity theory — one is speed and the other is gravity .
Einstein ’s general theory of relativity , the best theory of gravity we have at present , indicates that gravity distorts time .
This effect has been measured experimentally , many times .
Clocks at the top of tall buildings , where gravity is slightly less , run faster than those at the bottom , just as predicted by the equations of general relativity ( GR ) . [ 8 ]
When a concentration of matter is very large ( dense enough ) , the gravitational distortion can also be so immense that any light rays trying to escape the enormous pull of gravity bend back on themselves .
This lack of escaping light rays forms an invisible boundary called the “ event horizon ” around the matter .
At the event horizon , time literally stands still .
Using different assumptions …
Dr. Humphreys ’ new creationist cosmology literally “ falls out ” of the equations of GR , so long as one assumes that the universe has a boundary .
In other words , that it has a center and an edge — that if you were to travel off into space , you would eventually come to a place beyond which there was no more matter .
In this cosmology , the Earth is near the center .
This might sound like common sense , as indeed it is , but all modern secular ( “ big bang ” ) cosmologies deny this .
That is , they make arbitrary assumption ( without any scientific necessity ) that the universe has no boundaries — no edge and no center .
In this assumed universe , every galaxy would be surrounded by galaxies spread evenly in all directions ( on a large enough scale ) , and so , therefore , all the net gravitational forces cancel out .
However , if the universe has boundaries , then there is a net gravitational effect toward the center .
Clocks at the edge would be running at different rates to clocks on the Earth .
In other words , it is no longer enough to say God made the universe in six days .
He certainly did , but six days by which clock ?
( If we say “ God ’s time ” we miss the point that He is outside of time , seeing the end from the beginning . ) [ 10 ]
There appears to be observational evidence that the universe has expanded in the past , supported by the many phrases
God uses in the Bible to tell us that at creation he “ stretched out ” [ 11 ] ( other verses say “ spread out ” ) the heavens .
If the universe is not much bigger than we can observe , and if it was only 50 times smaller in the past than it is now , then scientific deduction based on GR means it has to have expanded out of a previous state in which it was surrounded by an event horizon ( a condition known technically as a “ white hole ” — a black hole running in reverse , something permitted by the equations of GR ) .
As matter passed out of this event horizon , the horizon itself had to shrink — eventually to nothing .
Therefore , at one point this Earth ( relative to a point far away from it ) would have been virtually frozen in time .
An observer on Earth would not in any way “ feel different . ” “ Billions of years ” would be available ( in the frame of reference within which it is traveling in deep space ) for light to reach the Earth , for stars to age , etc. — while less than one ordinary day is passing on Earth .
This massive gravitational time dilation would seem to be a scientific inevitability if a bounded universe expanded significantly .
In one sense , if observers on Earth at that particular time could have looked out and “ seen ” the speed with which light was moving toward them out in space , it would have appeared as if it were traveling many times faster than c. ( Galaxies would also appear to be rotating faster . )
However , if an observer in deep space was out there measuring the speed of light , to him it would still only be traveling at c .
There is more detail of this new cosmology , at layman ’s level , in the book by Dr. Humphreys , Starlight and Time , which also includes reprints of his technical papers showing the equations . [ 12 ]
It is fortunate that creationists did not invent such concepts such as gravitational time dilation , black and white holes , event horizons and so on , or we would likely be accused of manipulating the data to solve the problem .
The interesting thing about this cosmology is that it is based upon mathematics and physics totally accepted by all cosmologists ( general relativity ) , and it accepts ( along with virtually all physicists ) that there has been expansion in the past ( though not from some imaginary tiny point ) .
It requires no “ massaging ” — the results “ fall out ” so long as one abandons the arbitrary starting point which the big bangers use ( the unbounded cosmos idea , which could be called “ what the experts do n’t tell you about the ‘ big bang ’ ” ) .
This new cosmology seems to explain in one swoop all of the observations used to support the “ big bang , ” including progressive red- shift and the cosmic microwave background radiation , without compromising the data or the biblical record of a young Earth .
Caution
While this is exciting news , all theories of fallible men , no matter how well they seem to fit the data , are subject to revision or abandonment in the light of future discoveries .
What we can say is that at this point a plausible mechanism has been demonstrated , with considerable observational and theoretical support .
What if no one had ever thought of the possibility of gravitational time dilation ?
Many might have felt forced to agree with those scientists ( including some Christians ) that there was no possible solution — the vast ages are fact , and the Bible must be “ reinterpreted ” ( massaged ) or increasingly rejected .
Many have in fact been urging Christians to abandon the Bible ’s clear teaching of a recent creation because of these “ undeniable facts . ”
This reinterpretation also means having to accept that there were billions of years of death , disease , and bloodshed before Adam , thus eroding the creation / Fall / restoration framework within which the gospel is presented in the Bible .
However , even without this new idea , such an approach would still have been wrong - headed .
The authority of the Bible should never be compromised as mankind ’s “ scientific ” proposals .
One little previously unknown fact , or one change in a starting assumption , can drastically alter the whole picture so that what was “ fact ” is no longer so .
This is worth remembering when dealing with those other areas of difficulty which , despite the substantial evidence for Genesis creation , still remain .
Only God possesses infinite knowledge .
By basing our scientific research on the assumption that His Word is true ( instead of the assumption that it is wrong or irrelevant ) our scientific theories are much more likely , in the long run , to come to accurately represent reality .

MOMBASA , KENYA – Nearly seventy years ago , German U - boat submarines sank millions of tons of
Allied shipping , killing tens of thousands of sailors and threatening Great Britain with ruin .
The key to defeating U - boats was cooperation : cargo ships and warships would clump together for mutual protection .
The resulting convoys turned the tide against the German underwater menace and helped win the war for the Allies .
Today convoys are making a comeback , as a tactic for deterring pirates operating along the Somali coast .
Several times a month , chartered cargo vessels link up with warships for the dangerous dash into the
Somali ports of Mogadishu and Merka .
During World War II , convoys sailing from the U.S. to Great Britain carried everything from weapons to food to fuel .
But today 's convoys are hauling just one thing : donated food , enough to feed half a nation .
Here in Mombasa , in southern Kenya , the U.N. World Food
Program runs one of the world 's biggest humanitarian campaigns , sending up to
50,000 tons of food per month into Somalia to feed 40 percent of the country 's
8 million people , according to WFP spokesman Peter Smerdon .
Food aid for
Somalia is n't new : the country 's been on the dole since the ruinous civil war of the early 1990s .
But demand for aid has steadily increased , jumping some 75
percent this year .
Due to the threat of bandits on Somalia 's remote , dusty roads , most of the food comes by sea .
But it did n't take long for Somalis to figure out that you can stake out a sea lane just like you can a road .
In the '90s , pirates began seizing food ships .
At first , the pirates claimed they were just trying to make sure the food got distributed fairly : warlords on land had been grabbing entire food shipments straight out of the U.N. 's hands .
" Pirates said , ' We shall seize the vessels so everyone gets the food , ' " recalls Frederick Wahutu , a longtime sea captain who now directs the Kenya Ships Agents Association in
Mombasa .
Whether legit or not , this supposed altruism backfired , when crews refused to sail into Somali ports as long as ships remained vulnerable to pirates .
Suddenly nobody was getting any food .
The U.N. issued a desperate plea for warships to escort food convoys through pirate waters , and the whole world responded .
In recent years , several navies have unilaterally donated warships , including the Dutch and Canadians .
This fall , a NATO force led by a Greek frigate took over the escort mission .
And this week , the European Union relieved NATO with ships from the U.K. , France and Germany .
It 's the first - ever E.U. naval deployment , coming hot on the heels of the E.U. 's first overseas land deployment to Chad , this spring .
This weekend the first E.U. - escorted convoy will sail from
Mombasa , with a French or British frigate providing the heavy firepower .
" With escorts , we 're getting more food in , " Smerdon said .
But do n't expect the same tactic to work for commercial ships plying the Gulf of Aden .
According to Wahutu , most commercial ships sail on strict schedules .
" If you have to wait for a convoy to form up , you lose time . "
And time means money .
So while the world 's biggest food campaign piggybacks on
World War II - style convoys , for - profit shipping is still going it alone , despite the risks .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In comments that were broadcast over the weekend , Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele called Rush Limbaugh 's rhetoric " incendiary " and " ugly " and insisted that he is in charge of the GOP .
" Rush will say what Rush has to say ; we 'll do what we have to do , " RNC Chairman Michael Steele has said .
On Monday , however , after a blistering response from the conservative talk - radio kingpin , Steele told the online journal Politico that he " was maybe a little bit inarticulate . "
" There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership , " Steele said .
He added , " There are those out there who want to look at what he 's saying as incendiary and divisive and ugly .
That 's what I was trying to say .
It did n't come out that way . "
Steele 's original remarks came from an interview on CNN's " D.L. Hughley Breaks the News . "
The interview was recorded Thursday .
It aired Saturday .
The comments came as Democrats , including White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , have tried to paint Limbaugh -- who has said he wants to see the Obama administration " fail " -- as the effective head of the opposition party .
Steele rejected the idea , insisting " I 'm the de facto leader of the Republican Party . "
" Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer .
Rush Limbaugh 's whole thing is entertainment , " Steele told CNN .
" Yes , it is incendiary .
Yes , it is ugly . "
iReport.com : Limbaugh and Steele show divisions in GOP
Limbaugh fired back on his radio show Monday , saying the Republican chairman appears to be supporting President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
He said Steele appears " obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds . "
" I frankly am stunned that the chairman of the Republican National Committee endorses such an agenda , " Limbaugh said .
" I have to conclude that he does , because he attacks me for wanting it to fail . "
But Monday night Steele told Politico he did n't intend to go after Limbaugh .
" My intent was not to go after Rush -- I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh , " Steele told Politico in a telephone interview .
" I was maybe a little bit inarticulate ...
There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership . "

Steele told Politico he tried to call Limbaugh after the show on Monday and said he hoped he would be able to talk to the radio host soon .
" I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said were n't what I was thinking , " Steele told Politico .
" I 'm not going to engage these guys and sit back and provide them the popcorn for a fight between me and Rush Limbaugh . "
And in a written statement issued to CNN , Steele said , " To the extent that my remarks helped the Democrats in Washington to take the focus , even for one minute , off of their irresponsible expansion of government , I truly apologize . "
" I respect Rush Limbaugh , he is a national conservative leader , and in no way do I want to diminish his voice , " Steele said .
" I 'm sure that he and I will agree most of the time , but will probably disagree some as well , which is fine . "
Steele 's Democratic counterpart , Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , said he was " briefly encouraged " by Steele 's " courageous " remarks .
" However , Chairman Steele 's reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party , its politics and its obstruction of President Obama 's agenda in Washington , " Kaine said in a written statement .
Watch Steele , Hughley talk politics »
Limbaugh brought a cheering crowd to its feet several times as he called on fellow conservatives to take back the country .
He used his self - described " first national address , " which ran more than an hour longer than his allotted 20 minutes , to accuse President Obama of inspiring fear in Americans in order to push a liberal agenda of " big government . "
Limbaugh also addressed comments he made earlier this year in which he said he hoped Obama failed .
" What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and re-form this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation ? " he said .
But a top Republican in Congress disagreed .
" I do n't think anyone wants anything to fail right now , " House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said on ABC's " This Week . "
" We have such challenges .
What we need to do is we need to put forth solutions to the problems that real families are facing today . "
RNC spokesman Alex Conant on Monday did not directly address Steele 's comments about Limbaugh but pointed out the back - and - forth between the White House and the conservative radio host .
" Rahm Emanuel and the Democrats know they lose an argument with the Republican Party on substance , so they are building straw men to attack and distract , " he said .
" The feud between radio host Rush and Rahm makes great political theater , but it is a sideshow to the important work going on in Washington .
" RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections .
The Democrats ' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [ House Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi , " Conant said .
All About Michael S. Steele • Rush Limbaugh • Republican National Committee
Would that we had an articulate defender of freedom in Congress as Daniel Hannan , Minister of the European Parliament for South East England .
Here is a video of him confronting the Prime Minister of England .
The truth , Prime Minister , is that you have run out of our money .
The country as a whole is now in negative equity .
Every British child is born owing around £ 20,000 .
Servicing the interest on that debt is oing to cost more than educating the child .
Now once again today you tried to spread the blame around ; you spoke about an international recession , an international crisis .
Well , it is true that we are all sailing together into the squalls , but not every vessel in the convoy is in the same dilapitated condition .
Other ships used the good years to caulk their hulls and to clear their rigging – in other words to pay off debt .
But you used the good years to raise borrowing yet further .
As a consequence , under your captaincy , our hull is pressed deep into the waterline under the accumulated weight of your debt .
… Now it ’s not that you ’re not apologizing .
Like everyone else here , I ’ve long accepted that you are pathologically incapable of accepting responsibility for these things .
It ’s that you are carrying on willfully worsening our situation wantonly spending what little we have left .
…
Prime Minister , you cannot carry on forever squeezing the productive bit of the economy in order to fund the unprecedented engorgement of the unproductive bit .
You cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way out of debt .
Watch the whole thing .
Much of it applies to all the Democrat and Republican politicians in government today .

The flames are going out all over Italy .
Tomorrow , the flame which for more than 60 years has been the symbol of neo -Fascist continuity with Mussolini , will disappear from mainstream politics .
The National Alliance , the last important home of that inheritance , is " fusing " with Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party to give the governing bloc a single identity and a single unchallenged leader .
The change has been a long time coming – 15 years and more .
Mr Berlusconi broke the great taboo of Italian post - war politics after he won his first general election victory in 1994 and incorporating four members of the National Alliance into his coalition .
Embracing the Fascists and neo-Fascists was taboo for good reason .
For one thing , their return after they had led the nation to ruin in the war was banned by the new Constitution , whose Article 139 states , " the re-organisation , under whatever form , of the dissolved Fascist party , is forbidden . "

That veto had been honoured in the breach rather than the observance since 1946 , when Giorgio Almirante , the leader of the Italian Social Movement , picked up the baton of Mussolini where he had left it at his death and led the new party into parliament .
But the neo -Fascists remained in parliamentary limbo , far from power .
Berlusconi blew that inhibition away .
Under the wily leadership of Gianfranco Fini the " post - Fascists " have been gaining ground since .
Tall , bespectacled , buttoned up , the opposite of Berlusconi in every way , the Alliance 's leader impressed the Eurocrats with his democratic credentials when he was brought in to lend a hand at drafting the EU 's new Constitution .
He leaned over backwards to break his party 's connection to anti-Semitism , paying repeated official visits to Israel where he was photographed in a skull cap at the Wailing Wall .
On one visit , in 2003 , he went so far as to condemn Mussolini and the race laws passed in 1938 which barred Jews from school and resulted in thousands being deported to the death camps .
" I 've certainly changed my ideas about Mussolini , " he said at the time .
" And to condemn [ the race laws ] means to take responsibility for them . "
Statesmanlike : the word stuck to him like lint .
Party hardliners such as Alessandra Mussolini , the glamorous granddaughter of Il Duce , were furious and split away to form fascist micro-parties of their own .
But Mr Fini 's strategy prevailed .
Under Mr Berlusconi's patronage , he became foreign minister then deputy prime minister and now speaker of the lower house , a more prestigious job than its British equivalent .
As Berlusconi 's unquestioned number two in the new " fused " party , he is also his heir - apparent .
The puri e duri , the hardcore fascist elements , have been gritting their teeth and screaming defiance .
One group wanted to stage a ceremony to mark the extinguishing of the flame at the " Altar of the Nation " , the wedding cake - like symbol of Italy that towers over Piazza Venezia in Rome .
The city 's mayor , ironically himself a lifelong " post - Fascist " , banned it .
But the puri e duri will not give up .
" The National Alliance dies , the Right lives ! " declares a flyer scattered about by one of the hard - right parties , whose symbol sports an oversized flame .
" Today , with the betrayal of our ideas , of our story and our identity , " roars one of their leaders , Teodoro Buontempo , the national president of The Right party , " we have the duty to make clearer than ever that our party was born to assure the continuity of our ideals ... [ Join us ] to scream your indignation against a ruling class of trimmers and nobodies . "

Black Bands , an investigative book into the hard right by Paolo Berizzi published in Italy this week , claims " at least 150,000 young Italians under 30 live within the cults of Fascism and neo -Fascism .
And not all but many in the myth of Hitler . "
Five tiny registered parties account for 1.8 per cent of the national vote , between 450,000 and 480,000 voters .
These are significant numbers , yet even combined they are not nearly enough to reach the 4 per cent threshold to break into parliament .
By this reading , the Fascist element in Italy is no more significant than the BNP in Britain : an embarrassing irritant that can make noise and win insignificant victories , but nothing more .
Despite the claims of the loony right to the contrary , the going out of the Fascist flame does not mean Fascist ideas have disappeared from the Italian political scene .
Quite the reverse .
Fifteen years after Mr Berlusconi brought the neo-Fascists in from the cold , their impact on politics has never been more striking , never more disturbing .
According to Christopher Duggan , the British author of Force of Destiny , an acclaimed history of modern Italy , the fusion of the two parties does not mark the disappearance of Fascist ideas and practices but rather their triumphant insinuation .
" This is an alarming situation in many , many ways , " he says .
" The fusion of the parties signifies the absorption of the ideas of the post - Fascists into Berlusconi 's party ... the tendency to see no moral and ultimately no political distinction between those who supported the Fascist regime and those who supported the Resistance .
So the fact that Fascism was belligerent , racist and illiberal gets forgotten ; there is a quiet chorus of public opinion saying that Fascism was not so bad . "
One example of the way things are changing is the treatment of the veterans of the Republic of Salo , the puppet Fascist state ruled by Mussolini on the shores of Lake Garda in the last phase of the war .
Under the thumb of Hitler and responsible for dispatching Jews to the death camps , Salo was seen by Italians after the war as the darkest chapter in the nation 's modern history .
But steadily and quietly it has been rehabilitated in the Italian memory .
The latest step , before parliament , is the creation of a new military order , the Cavaliere di Tricolore , which can be awarded to people who fought for at least six months during the war – either with the Partisans against the " Nazi- Fascists " , with the forces of the Republic of Salo on behalf of the Nazis and against the Partisans , or with the forces in the south under General Badoglio .
In this way , says Duggan , the idea of moral interchangeability is smuggled into the national discourse , treating the soldiers fighting for the puppet Nazi statelet " on an equal footing morally and politically with the Partisans " .
Duggan contrasts the post - war process in Italy with that in Germany , where the Nuremberg trials and the purge of public life supervised by the Allies produced a new political landscape .
Nothing of the sort happened in Italy .
" There was never a clear public watershed between the experience of Fascism and what happened afterwards .
It 's partly the fault of the Allies , who after the war were much more concerned with preventing the Communists from coming to power .
" As a result very senior figures in the army , the police and the judiciary remained unpurged .
Take the figure of Gaetano Azzariti , one of the first presidents , post - war , of Italy 's Constitutional Court , yet under Mussolini he had been the president of the court which had the job of enforcing the the race laws .
The failure of the Allies to put pressure on Italy also reflects a perception that still exists : that the Fascist revival is not to be taken seriously because Italy is ' lightweight ' .
Whereas if the same thing happened in Germany or Austria , you 'd get really worried . "
The widespread defiance of the anti-Fascist Constitution can be seen in the profusion of parties deriving inspiration from Mussolini ; in the thousands who pour into Predapio , Mussolini 's birthplace , to celebrate his march on Rome on 20 October every year ; in shops and on market stalls doing a lively trade in busts of Il Duce and other Fascist mementoes of every sort .
Far more alarming , Duggan says , is what is happening out of the spotlight to the national temper , where the steady erosion and discrediting of state institutions is playing into the hands of a dictatorial elite , just as it did in the 1920s .
" What is so disturbing is not just the systematic rehabilitation of Fascism but the erosion of every aspect of the state , for example justice , with the result that people have the urge to throw themselves into the arms of the one man who they believe can sort things out .
" You create very personalised relations with the leader , so that in Mussolini 's case , he received 2,000 letters a day from people pleading with him to help .
If the state does n't work , you trust in one man to pick up the phone and sort things out .
This is how liberalism disappeared in the 1920s , with the steady discrediting of parliament so that in the end there was no need for Mussolini to abolish it , he merely ignored it .
Something very similar is happening in Italy today . "
UPDATE : As I originally mentioned at the end of this post , I thought we should “ give the benefit of the doubt ” to GISS as there may be a perfectly rational explanation .
Steve McIntyre indicates that he has done an analysis also and doubts the other analyses :
I disagree with both Luboš and David and do n’t see anything remarkable in the distribution of digits .
I tend to trust Steve ’s intuition and analysis skills , as his track record has been excellent .
So at this point we do n’t know what is the root cause or even if there is any human touch to the data .
But as Lubos said on CA “ there ’s still an unexplained effect in the game ” .
I ’m sure it will get much attention as the results shake out .
UPDATE2 : David Stockwell writes in comments here :
Hi ,
I am gratified with the interest in this , very preliminary analysis .
There ’s a few points from the comments above .
1 . False positives are possible , for a number of reasons .
2 . Even though data are subjected to arithmetric operations , distortions in digit frequency at an earlier stage can still be observed .
3 . The web site is still in development .
4 . One of the deviant periods in GISS seems to be around 1940 , the same as the ‘ warmest year in the century ’ and the ‘ SST bucket collection ’ issues .
5 . Even if in the worst case there was manipulation , it would n’t affect AGW science much .
The effect would be small .
Its about something else .
Take the Madoff fund .
Even though investors knew the results were managed , they still invested because the payouts were real ( for a while ) .
6 . To my knowledge , noone has succeeded in exactly replicating the GISS data .
7 . I picked that file as it is the most used – global land and ocean .
I have n’t done an extensive search of files as I am still testing the site .
8. Lubos relicated this study more carefully , using only the monthly series and got the same result .
9 . Benfords law ( on the first digit ) has a logarithmic distribution , and really only applies to data across many orders of magnitude .
Measurement data that often has a constant first digit does n’t work , although the second digit seems to .
I do n’t see why last digit would n’t work , and should approach a uniform distribution according to the Benford ’s postulate .
That ’s all for the moment .
Thanks again .
This morning I received an email outlining some work that David Stockwell has done in some checking of the GISS global Land - Ocean temperature dataset :
Detecting ‘ massaging ’ of data by human hands is an area of statistical analysis I have been working on for some time , and devoted one chapter of my book , Niche Modeling , to its application to environmental data sets .
The WikiChecks web site now incorporates a script for doing a Benford ’s analysis of digit frequency , sometimes used in numerical analysis of tax and other financial data .
The WikiChecks Site Says :
‘ Managing ’ or ‘ massaging ’ financial or other results can be a very serious deception .
It ranges from rounding numbers up or down , to total fabrication .
This system will detect the non-random frequency of digits associated with human intervention in natural number frequency .
Stockwell runs a test on GISS and writes :
One of the main sources of global warming information , the GISS data set from NASA showed significant management , particularly a deficiency of zeros and ones .
Interestingly the moving window mode of the algorithm identified two years , 1940 and 1968 ( see here ) .
You can actually run this test yourself , visit the WikiChecks web site , and paste the URL for the GISS dataset
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt
into it and press submit .
Here is what you get as output from WikiChecks :
GISS Frequency of each final digit : observed vs. expected
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Totals Observed 298 292 276 266 239 265 257 228 249 239 2609 Expected 260 260 260 260 260 260 260 260 260 260 2609 Variance 5.13 3.59 0.82 0.08 1.76 0.05 0.04 4.02 0.50 1.76 17.75 Significant * . *
Statistic DF Obtained Prob Critical Chi Square 9 17.75 <0.05 16.92
Significant management detected .
RESULT : Significant variation in digit 0 : ( Pr < 0.05 ) indicates rounding up or down .
Significant variation in digit 1 : ( Pr < 0.1 ) indicates management .
Significant variation in digit 7 : ( Pr < 0.05 ) indicates management .
Stockwell writes of the results :
The chi-square test is prone to produce false positives for small samples .
Also , there are a number of innocent reasons that digit frequency may diverge from expected .
However , the tests are very sensitive .
Even if arithmetic operations are performed on data after the manipulations , the ‘ fingerprint ’ of human intervention can remain .
I also ran it on the UAH data and RSS data and it flagged similar issues , though with different deviation scores .
Stockwell did the same and writes :
The results , listed from lowest deviation to highest are listed below .
RSS – Pr < 1 GISS – Pr<0.05 CRU – Pr<0.01 UAH – Pr<0.001
Numbers such as missing values in the UAH data ( - 99.990 ) may have caused its high deviation .
I do n’t know about the others .
Not being familiar with this mathematical technique , there was little I could do to confirm or refute the findings , so I let it pass until I could get word of replication from some other source .
It did n’t take long .
About two hours later , Lubos Motl , of the Reference Frame posted his results obtained independently via another method when he ran some checks of his own :
David Stockwell has analyzed the frequency of the final digits in the temperature data by NASA ’s GISS led by James Hansen , and he claims that the unequal distribution of the individual digits strongly suggests that the data have been modified by a human hand .
With Mathematica 7 , such hypotheses take a few minutes to be tested .
And remarkably enough , I must confirm Stockwell ’s bold assertion .
But that ’s not all , Lubos goes on to say :
Using the IPCC terminology for probabilities , it is virtually certain ( more than 99.5 % ) that Hansen ’s data have been tempered with .
To be fair , Lubos runs his test on UAH data as well :
It might be a good idea to audit our friends at UAH MSU where Stockwell seems to see an even stronger signal .
… In plain English , I do n’t see any evidence of man-made interventions into the climate in the UAH MSU data .
Unlike Hansen , Christy and Spencer do n’t seem to cheat , at least not in a visible way , while the GISS data , at least their final digits , seem to be of anthropogenic origin .
Steve McIntyre offered an explanation in the way rounding occurs when converting from Fahrenheit to Centigrade , but Lubos ca n’t seem to replicate the same results he gets from the GISS data :
Steve McIntyre has immediately offered an alternative explanation of the non-uniformity of the GISS final digits : rounding of figures calculated from other units of temperature .
Indeed , I confirmed that this is an issue that can also generate a non-uniformity , up to 2:1 in the frequency of various digits , and you may have already downloaded an updated GISS notebook that discusses this issue . …
I ca n’t get 4,7 underrepresented but there may exist a combination of two roundings that generates this effect .
If this explanation is correct , it is a result of much less unethical approach of GISS than the explanation above .
Nevertheless , it is still evidence of improper rounding .
Pretty strong stuff , but given the divergence of the GISS signal with other datasets , unsurprising .
I wonder if it is n’t some artifact of the GISS Homogenization process for surface temperature data , which I view as flawed in its application .
But let ’s give the benefit of the doubt here .
I want to see what GISS has to say about it , there may be a perfectly rational explanation that can be applied that will demonstrate that these statistical accusations are without merit .
I ’m sure they will post something on RC soon .
Stay tuned .

CHICAGO —
The very first near - full human face transplant was detailed Friday by the surgeon who performed the procedure .
In December , plastic surgeon Maria Siemionow , after years of extensive research on mice and cadavers , transplanted almost 83 square inches of skin , with the muscles , bone , upper lip and nose still attached from an anonymous donor onto a young woman who the doctor said " did not have a midface " after she sustained traumatic injury .
After two months , the patient , whose name and likeness remain private , has experienced return of basic functions , like the sense of smell and the ability to drink from a cup .
She has been discharged from the hospital and appears to be recovering .
" She did n't have a nose , " Siemionow told a room full of her colleagues here at the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences annual meeting .
" Now , she can eat a hamburger and smell it and taste it . "
Heart , liver , kidney and even lung transplants have become common surgical procedures , but transplants of pieces of the body that contain many types of cells — skin , muscle and bone , for example — are much more difficult .
The first hand transplant occurred in 1999 .
French scientists carried out the first partial face transplant in 2005 .
The new procedure , however , is far more involved : Siemionow transplanted 80 percent of the woman 's face from the donor .
The surgeon and her research team had spent years laying the groundwork for the procedure with time - consuming operations in animal models .
A full facial transplant in a mouse takes a team of surgeons more than six hours .
Over the last decade , the Cleveland Clinic team has completed more than 1,000 facial transplants of different types in mice to learn about the body 's parameters for rejecting the foreign cells .
White mice usually receive brown - furred facial transplants or vice versa , so the mice often look as if they are wearing leather helmets or * Phantom of the Opera - * style masks after the operations .
In preparation for the human transplant , Siemionow and her colleagues did similar procedures with cadavers .
No one in the audience reacted to the graphic nature of the images of the procedure , including the images of the faces which had been harvested from the cadavers , the skin splayed out like masks .
Siemionow emphasized that the full facial transplant is a last resort for a " very specific " type of patient .
Patients who need an entirely new face have limited options .
They can have skin grafted onto their faces from their own bodies , but the skin from the thighs , arms , abdomen and other common sources look slightly different , producing the unsightly quilt - like effect that is familiar from burn - victim photographs .
To avoid that problem , Siemionow looked into using one contiguous piece of skin from some other area on the body , but their research showed that no area of the patient 's own body contains the necessary 100 square inches of skin necessary to cover the whole face .
For a full facial skin transplant , there 's no alternative to using a donor , Siemionow argues .
Ethical questions have been raised about the procedures .
While the transplant appears to have improved the first patient 's quality of life , the immunosuppressants that the patients have to take for the rest of their lives could be unsafe .
" One case is merely an anecdote .
It does n't create a scientific basis to say it 's safe for a patient to do this , " Carson Strong , a professor of human values and ethics at the University of Tennessee
College of Medicine , told the Washington Post in December .
But Siemionow , even though she was not directly challenged on ethical grounds , headed her critics off with a logical speech about the rigor of their bioethical procedures and an emotional appeal to help victims like a young woman whose entire face had been burned off in Afghanistan .
" Why would we transplant the face ? " Maria Siemionow asked her colleagues .
" Because it 's very difficult to go around life having no face . "

Barack Obama is n't president yet .
He does n't want to appear to be trying to usurp President Bush 's authority .
But he 's still going to speak his mind – politely – about some things he thinks the government should do to jump - start the ailing US economy .
That was the overall impression President - elect Obama appeared to be trying to give in his first public remarks following his election as the nation 's 44th occupant of the Oval Office .
In particular , Obama said that he believes that Congress should pass , and the current president should sign , some sort of broad government spending package as an attempt at economic stimulus .
" I want to see a stimulus package sooner rather than later .
If it does not get done in a lame - duck session , it will be the first thing I do as president of the United States , " said Obama during a press conference held at Chicago 's Hilton Hotel .
Obama also urged the current administration to accelerate the provision of $ 25 billion in Energy Department loans for the auto industry .
This money , already approved by both Congress and the White House , is intended to provide cash for hard - pressed US automakers to design and engineer new fuel - efficient vehicles .
Assistance for state and local governments struggling from declining tax revenues will also be high on Obama 's agenda in his initial days in office .
" We are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime and we 're going to have to move swiftly to resolve it , " he said .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D ) of California has already called for a two - part economic stimulus package that would consist of a $ 100 billion package passed by a lame - duck session , followed by some sort of permanent tax cut after Obama 's inauguration .
The first stimulus installment would include some kind of government - funded public - works effort as well as an extension of unemployment benefits .
Mr. Bush has said he is open to working with Congress on a stimulus package .
But in the past he has opposed big US spending on new infrastructure , among other things .
" We 've long said that the package that [ House Democrats ] have put forward so far was not something that we thought that we could support , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said on Nov. 6 .
The stagecraft of the initial press conference of the Obama executive era was clearly intended to send the message that dealing with the economy will be his administration 's No. 1 job .
Members of his economic transition advisory board filed out first , forming a large semicircle behind the podium from which the president - elect spoke .
" Immediately after I become president I am going to confront this economic crisis head on , " said Obama .
Obama faces two conflicting imperatives regarding the nation 's problems , according to presidential transition experts .
On the one hand , he 's being pressured to jump right in and begin to formulate policy .
On the other , he does not want to become saddled with responsibility for policies that he does not yet have the power to design and implement as he sees fit .
" He 's taking office at a time of our most challenging transition since the Great Depression , " said Darrell West , vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution , at a Nov. 7 post - election seminar .
Perhaps Obama 's biggest problem right now is unrealistic expectations , said Mr. West .
To avoid a backlash of disappointment among voters , Obama may need to push at the beginning of his term for measures that can gain some bipartisan support and thus pass Congress relatively quickly .
" He can do that with a stimulus package , " said West .
Obama is making the right move by assembling his White House team before moving on the cabinet , said Leon Panetta , who served in the White House as chief of staff under President Clinton .
In his first personnel move , Obama named Illinois Rep. Rahm Emanuel his chief of staff .
But his next step should be assembling his economic team , in particular , naming his secretary of the Treasury .
" That 's what America is looking for right now , " said Mr. Panetta .
Obama , for his part , declined at his press conference to be drawn into speculation about possible Treasury picks .
He will make cabinet appointments in due time , he said .
" I want to move with all deliberate haste .
And I want to emphasize ' deliberate , ' as well as ' haste‚ ' " he said .
Obama said that he had spoken with all living ex-presidents as well as the current president since Election Day .
" They have all been very gracious , " he said .
The president - elect was cautious in discussing his response to a lengthy congratulatory letter from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
" Iran 's development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable ....
I will be reviewing the letter and I will respond appropriately , " said Obama .
And the president - elect noted that the choice of a White House dog is a " major issue " in the Obama household .
While he promised his daughters they could have a dog if he won , one of them is diagnosed as allergic to dogs , so the new pet must be a breed that is " hypoallergenic , " Obama said .
They would also like to get a shelter dog , but that may not be possible , given that most shelter dogs are " mutts like me , " said Obama .
Nuclear power is safe , affordable , and the waste problems
are much more manageable than the public realizes .
That was the take - home message
from this year 's American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago , where a group of experts from the US
and EU participated in a session called " Keeping the Lights On : The
Revival of Nuclear Energy for Our Future . "
As you might have gathered from some of our prior AAAS coverage , climate change was a pretty central theme in many of the sessions and , although nuclear power wo n't be able to fulfill all our energy demands in a post - carbon world , it 's hard to avoid thinking that the world will need to make full use of nuclear energy .
We 'll tackle the last part of the take - home message first , since it 's rather topical .
President Obama dealt the highly - troubled proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain another blow last week .
That did n't surprise many , given that , during his campaign , he made statements opposing the site , while top Senate Democat Harry Reid ( NV ) has all but stated that Yucca Mountain would not open on his watch .
Despite the lack of a secure , long - term , high - level waste storage site , great strides are being made towards methods of solving the waste problem .
Reprocessing , vitrification , and even dry cask storage tech are now at the point where we can deal with interim storage for the next 50 - 100 years , which is what it will probably take to build the political discipline needed for a longer - term solution .
Meanwhile , smart people in labs are working on being able to partition and transmute the long - lived actinides , something that should excite any physics nerd .
As for that long - term solution , several test sites are progressing nicely in Europe : Onkalo in Finland , the charmingly - named HADES project in Belgium , and Grimsel in Switzerland .
Environmental critics of nuclear power frequently claim that nuclear power is n't cost - effective once the decommissioning costs and waste storage is accounted for .
That is n't true , claims Dr. Roland Schenkel , Director General of the European Commission 's Joint Research Center .
Using Finland as an example ( since they 're in the process of building a new reactor , one of the only nations currently doing so ) , he put the total lifetime cost of a nuclear plant at about ? 3 billion over 100 years .
Of this figure , dismantling and waste management only amounts to ?10 million , and repository closure and sealing another ?230 million — that 's less than five percent of the total electricity production costs .
Nuclear is also safe ( Chernobyl notwithstanding ) , and the newer generation III plants under construction should make it even safer .
A lot of effort is going into simplifying the designs to use more passive systems , fewer components , and more standardized features , helping both safety and the economics of new plant construction .
Currently , the US lags behind Europe when it comes to new nuclear plants .
There are several plants under construction across the Atlantic but , despite plans for 34 new light water reactors in the US , ground has yet to be broken on any of them .
I 'm not a betting man , but I 'd be surprised if that remained the case a decade from now .
he does n't even deny that
very
Conservative Keynesian Greg Mankiw draws the wrath of left - liberal Keynesians Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman for being pessimistic about future growth , with Krugman this time being the one to engage in name - calling and refers to Mankiw as " evil " for doubting Obama 's projections of high growth .
The DeLong - Krugman argument rests on historical experience that shows that growth tends to be rapid after deep slumps , as there are a lot of unemployed workers that can be employed quickly and so produce high growth .
What is noteworthy in this context is that if you look at Mankiw 's original post , and says explicitly " when recovery comes , it will probably be a robust one . " .
Yet DeLong and Krugman pretends in their posts that Mankiw denies this .
But Mankiw 's point is that we do n't know when the slump will end and so we can't say that growth from now until a certain year , say 2011 or 2012 to be high .
Even though that is the main argument discussed in his post , DeLong and Krugman fails to mention or discuss that argument .
Mankiw is BTW right about this .
To illustrate this point , assume that someone in late 1930 had concluded that because GDP had fallen 8.6 % that year , there must be robust growth , say 8 % per year in the coming 3 years ( 1931 to 1933 ) .
That person would have been dead wrong , as GDP fell another 6.4 % in 1931 , 13 % in 1932 and 1.3 % in 1933 .
To illustrate the point further , let 's assume that he had projected 8 % per year growth in the coming 6 years instead .
That would include 3 years ( 1934 - 36 ) where output expanded .
How would that proto-Krugman - DeLong forecaster have performed ?
Not so good .
While there was indeed arobust recovery during the 3 years of growth , with output in 1936 being 36.3 % higher than in 1933 , that followed 3 years of contraction of 19.6 %
( And that does n't even include the 1930 contraction ) .
GDP in 1936 was therefore only 9.5 % higher than in 1930 ( and it was unchanged compared to 1929 ) , which is an annual average growth of only about 1.5 % .
Thus , even assuming that the recovery will be robust once it starts this time as well , that does n't mean that we can say that average growth will be high from this point in time to a specified future year because we do n't know how long this slump will persist ( and right now , the slump seems to be accelerating in pace ) and also , we do not know if there could be future slumps .
Japan during the 1990s had some brief periods of high growth , but they were fairly quickly cut short by new slumps ( And during the 1930s , there was a new slump in 1937 - 38 ) .
The reason why there tends to be persistent damage to long - term economic growth is that so much of all investments go lost as they are revealed to be malinvestments , meaning that available capital declines , something which reduces not just short - term but also long - term output .
Furthermore , the fact that politicians like Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama tends to respond to slumps with political actions that damage long - term growth , such as higher marginal tax rates and higher spending , compounds this effect .
Narwhal Ivory is for U.S. SALES ONLY !!!
To comply with state laws we no longer ship any ivory to New Jersey addresses and no mammoth ivory ( narwhal , hippo and walrus ivory are ok ) to New York addresses .
Narwhal Items Added Regularly !
Narwhals , the mysterious unicorns of the sea , live in the Arctic Ocean and grow to about 18 ' ( not including the tusk ) .
The males grow an elongated tooth that spirals out clockwise to form a tusk reaching 9 ' in length .
This ivory tusk has been attributed with the creation of the unicorn legends .
The tusks have a small hollow that runs nearly the full length , the ivory has no grain or core like elephant , mammoth or walrus but looks more like sperm whale ivory with a pencil sized hollow .
Narwhals have been a protected species since 1972 and importation is prohibited .
We have a selection of old tusks for sale that were imported in the mid-1900s and are legal to sell anywhere in the U.S. ( with the exception of New Jersey ) .
These are extremely rare if you can find one .
Now is your opportunity to own the rarest , most mysterious , unique and beautiful of the ivories and at a reasonable price .
We can make a wood base of beautiful maple burl or you can stand it in a corner without a base or hang it on the wall .

Not all economists are Keynesians
Many economists , including Nobel laureates , disagree with the Obama administration 's economic recovery strategy
By LEON HADAR
WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT
PRESIDENT
Barack Obama has insisted that the majority of mainstream American economists support the general premises underlying his economic policy and , in particular , the notion that the federal government should have a central role in stimulating the economy and helping end the recession .
' There is not disagreement that we need action by our government , a recovery plan that will help to jumpstart the economy , ' Mr Obama said on the eve of his inauguration in January .
Indeed , the conventional wisdom these days is that , frightened by the recession and the credit crunch that produced it , ' most economists ' are now embracing public spending to repair the damage , including many of those economists who have long resisted a significant government role in a market system ; and that the only real debate that is taking place revolves around what type of spending would produce the best results , or what mix of spending and tax cuts .
As the cliche du jour puts it : ' We 're all Keynesians now . '
But in fact , while famous economists , including Nobel Prize winners , have backed the Obama administration 's Keynesian strategy aimed at resolving the economic crisis , many famous economists , including other Nobel Prize winners , are on the opposite side of the debate about the stimulus package and what should be done about the recession .
Hence , the Cato Institute , a free - market - oriented think tank in Washington , took out a full - page ad in several national newspapers in January , which was signed by more than 200 economists , including several Nobel laureates , telling President Obama that he was wrong on the economic stimulus package and that it was not true that most economists were calling for increased government spending .
' Notwithstanding reports that all economists are now Keynesians and that we all support a big increase in the burden of government , we the undersigned do not believe that more government spending is a way to improve economic performance , ' the ad said .
' More government spending by Hoover and Roosevelt did not pull the United States economy out of the Great Depression in the 1930s , ' it noted , adding that ' more government spending did not solve Japan 's ' lost decade ' in the 1990s . '
The economists , including Nobel laureates James Buchanan , Edward Prescott and Vernon Smith , suggested that 'it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the US today ' .
And they proposed that in order to improve the economy , ' policymakers should focus on reforms that remove impediments to work , saving , investment and production , by embracing such fiscal policy tools as lowering tax rates and reducing the burden of government ' .
Hence , the notion that the opposition to Mr Obama 's ambitious economic plans comes mainly from exasperated Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill and a few fringe right - wing economists is very misleading .
Economists who belong to the Chicago and Austrian schools continue to adhere to the free - market principles espoused by Milton Friedman , Friedrich Hayek , and Ludwig von Mises , and are not about to be won over by Keynesian economic philosophy anytime soon .
Indeed , in the same way that the Iraq War served as a testing ground for two schools of foreign policy thought - Neoconservatism vs Realism ( the Realists had won ) - the current economic crisis is going to test two schools of economic thought : Keynesianism vs Friedmanism / Hayek - ism .
While it is true that most economists do agree that the current American ( and global ) economic downturn was caused by the bursting of the housing bubble , there are clearly major disagreements about ' what do we do now ? ' between the Keynesians and the members of the Austrian and Chicago schools and Keynesians who are the driving force behind Obamanomics .
Noting that during a recession , spending and investment is below the requirement for full employment , Keynesians assert that the government needs to restore the flow of credit into the economy through spending in order to make up for the underperformance on the part of consumers and businesses , and to help employ unused labour and capital .
But free marketers from the Austrian and Chicago schools put an emphasis on the role played by the central bank in helping produce the recession through excessive credit creation , and they suggest that it needs to stop doing that .
This would allow the price of the overvalued housing market to fall to equilibrium , creating the conditions for renewed economic growth .
The role the government should play in the recovery should be minimal , mostly by lowering some taxes in order to create incentives for new investments .
At the same time , warn conservative and libertarian economists , the rise in government spending coupled with continuing credit creation by the central bank as part of an effort to revive the financial system could prove to be a prescription for rising inflation and an ensuing decline in the value of the US dollar - not to mention the need in the aftermath of the recovery to pay for the government spending through an increase in taxes on businesses and consumers .
' The central tenets of Obamanomics appear to be that access to credit will enable people to borrow money to buy stuff , the spending will spur production and employment , and thus the economy will grow , ' according to libertarian economist and investor Peter Schiff .
But consumption is made possible by production and credit is made possible by savings , Mr Schiff insists .
' The sad truth is that the productive capacity of the American economy is now largely in tatters , ' he argues , adding that ' introducing freer - flowing credit and more printed money into such a system will do nothing except spark inflation . '
From that perspective , the worst - case scenario could be a failure by Washington to contain the economic downturn combined with rising inflation , which could threaten the economy with stagflation .
But the economists advising President Obama are operating under the assumption that Washington needs to ' do something ' and seem to be confident that the government spending they propose will help increase employment and spending , and that ensuing economic growth will produce more tax revenues that will end up paying for expanded deficit .
Their ideological adversaries among ' Austrians ' and the Chicago school remain sceptical about the ability of government to fine - tune the economy through fiscal policy .
In particular , they warn of inevitable bureaucratic and political pressures that will make it likely that taxpayer money could be diverted to wasteful projects .
They are concerned that government spending will crowd out investment by the private sector .
But Obamanomics , which is the most current version of Keynesianism , is clearly going to guide the policies of this administration in the next four years .
If these policies succeed in rolling back the economic recession while stabilising the financial system and opening the road towards economic recovery and growth , the Keynesians are going to emerge as the winners - and the Austrian / Chicago schools will be seen as the losers - in this latest war of economic ideas .
But if President Obama fails in managing the economic crisis , in the same way that George W Bush failed in managing the Iraq War and American policy in the Middle East , will the free marketers be back in fashion ?
Or perhaps the economic thesis and its antithesis will merge in a new synthesis ?
Who knows ?
Perhaps a new economic school of thought will come to the forefront .

THE GEORGICS
BOOK FIRST
WHAT makes the cornfields glad ; beneath what star it befits to upturn the ground , Maecenas , and clasp the vine to her elm ; the tending of oxen and the charge of the keeper of a flock ; and all the skill of thrifty bees ; of this will I begin to sing .
You , O bright splendours of the world , who lead on the rolling year through heaven ; Liber and gracious Ceres , if by your gift Earth exchanged Chaonian acorns for the swelling ear , and tempered her draughts of Achelous with the discovered grape ; and you , O Fauns , guardian presences of the country , trip it together , Fauns and Dryad girls ; of your gifts I sing .
And thou , Neptune , at whose mighty trident - stroke Earth first bore the neighing steed ; and thou , O forester , whose three hundred snow - white bullocks crop the rich Cean brakes ; even thou , leaving thy native woodland and thy Lycean lawns , Pan of Tegea , shepherd of the flock , so thou love thy Maenalus , be gracious and come ; and Minerva inventress of the olive , and thou , boy teacher of the crooked plough , and Silvanus carrying thy slim cypress uprooted ; gods and goddesses all who keep the fields in your care , or who feed the fresh plants from no sown seed , or who send down on the crops plentiful rain from heaven ; and thou , whatsoever place thou art soon to hold in the gods ' consistory , whether thou wilt look on cities and have earth in keeping , and the vast world receive thee as fosterer of harvests and sovereign of seasons , and wreathe thy brows with thy mother 's myrtle ; or whether thou come as god of the infinite sea , and thy deity only be adored of sailors , to thee utmost Thule be tributary , thy hand Tethys purchase for her daughter with dower of all her waves ; or whether thou set thyself as a new sign among the lingering months , where space opens between Erigone
{p. 296}
and the following Claws , while before thee the blazing Scorpion draws in his arms , and retreats from more than the allotted space of heaven ; whatso thou wilt be -- for neither does hell hope thy reign , nor may so dread a desire of reigning ever be thine , though Greece be enrapt in her Elysian plains , and Proserpine care not to follow the mother who calls her back : grant a fair passage , and favour my bold endeavour , and with me pitying the country folk who know not of the way , advance , and even now learn to be called on in prayer .
In early spring , when chilly moisture trickles from the hoar hills and the crumbling clod thaws in the west wind , even then would I have the bull begin to groan over the deep - driven plough and the share glitter with polish of the furrow .
That field at last replies to the greedy farmer 's prayers , which has twice felt the sun , twice the frost ; that bursts his granaries with overflowing harvests .
And ere yet our iron cleaves the unknown plain , be our care first to learn the winds , and the sky 's shifting mood , and the ground 's native nurture and dress , and what each quarter will bear and what each will reject .
Here corn , there grapes come more prosperously ; yonder the tree drops her seedlings , and unbidden grasses kindle into green .
Seest thou not how Tmolus sends scent of saffron , India ivory , the soft Sabaeans their spice ; but the naked Chalybes steel , and Pontus the castor drug , Epirus mares for Elean palms ?
From of old Nature laid such laws upon certain regions , an everlasting covenant , what time Deucalion of old cast on the unpeopled globe those stones whence the hard race of man was born .
Come therefore , from the first months of the year straightway let the strong bulls upturn the rich floor of earth , and the full strength of summer suns bake the flat clods to dust .
But if the land be not fertile , it will serve to ridge it by shallow furrows hard on Arcturus ' rising ; there , lest weeds choke the corn 's luxuriance ; here , lest scant moisture leave a barren waste of sand .
In turn likewise shalt thou let the stubbles lie fallow , and the idle field crust over unstirred ; or else there under changed
{p. 291}
skies sow golden spelt , where before thou hadst reaped the pea with wealth of rattling pods , or the tiny vetch crop , or the brittle stalks and rustling underwood of the bitter lupin .
For the field is drained by flax - harvest and wheat - harvest , drained by the slumber - steeped poppy of Lethe , but yet rotation lightens the labour ; only scorn not to soak the dry soil with fattening dung , nor to scatter grimy ashes over the exhausted lands .
Thus too the fields find rest in change of crop ; nor meanwhile are thanks lost on unploughed land .
Often likewise it is well to burn barren fields and consume the light stubble in crackling flame : whether that earth thence conceives secret strength and sustenance , or all her evil is melted away and her useless moisture sweats out in the fire ; or that the heat opens more of these ducts and blind pores that carry her juices to the fresh herbage ; or rather hardens and binds her gaping veins against fine rain or the fierce sun 's mastery or the frostbite of the searching North .
Great service withal he does the fields who breaks their dull clods with the mattock and drags osier hurdles over them , nor from high Olympus does golden Ceres regard him in vain ; or he who , raising ridges along the furrowed plain , again turns his plough to break them across , and labours earth incessantly and makes the fields own his sway .
Pray for dripping midsummers and clear winters , O husbandmen ; from winter dust the spelt grows strongest , and the field is glad ; never does Mysia triumph in such pride of tillage , or Gargarus himself wonder at his harvests .
Why tell of him , who , when the seed is cast , follows close over the field and breaks down the lumps of sticky soil ?
then guides over the crops chasing runlets from the river ; and when the blade is dying on the scorched and feverous field , look !
on the brow of the slope he lures the wave from her channel ; the falling wave wakens a hoarse chatter among the smooth pebbles , and gushes cool over the parched fields .
Why of him , who , lest the stalk sink prone under the heavy car , grazes down the rankness of the cornfield in the tender blade , when the crop first levels the furrow ?
or who gathers and drains away the moisture
{p. 298}
of the marsh with porous gravel , above all if in the doubtful months the floods go out on the river , covering all the broad flats with mud , and leave pools steaming with warm moisture in the hollows .
Nor yet , though labours of men and oxen have so wrought in turning the soil , are the villain goose and Strymonian crane and the bitter - fibred succory unavailing to injure , or the shade to harm .
Our Lord himself willed the way of tillage to be hard , and long ago set art to stir the fields , sharpening the wits of man with care , nor suffered his realm to slumber in heavy torpor .
Before Jove no tillers made the fields subject ; not even might the plain be parted by landmark or boundary line ; men gathered to a common store , and unaided and unasked earth bore all things in a fuller plenty .
He it was who gave the black snake his venom , and bade wolves ravin and the sea be tossed , who shook the honey from the leaves and took fire away , and stopped the brooks that ran wandering with wine : that so practice and pondering might slowly forge out many an art , might seek the corn - blade in the furrow and strike hidden fire from the veins of flint .
Then first rivers felt the hollowed alder , then the sailor gave the stars their number and name , Pleiads and Hyades and the bright Lycaonian Bear .
Then was invented the snare to catch game and the treacherous lime - twig , and the ring of dogs round the wide forest - lawn ; and even now one whips the wide stream and searches the pool with his casting - net , and another draws his lines dripping from the sea .
Then rigid iron and the blade of the shrill saw came -- for they of old split wood in clefts with wedges -- then arts many in sort ; nothing but yielded to unrelenting toil and the hard pressure of poverty .
Ceres first instructed mortals to upturn earth with iron , when now acorns and arbute - berries were failing from the sacred forest , and Dodona denied them sustenance .
Soon the labour of the cornfield too increased ; vile mildew must devour the stalk and the thistle lift over the field his lazy spears : the crop dwindles , a rough forest of clivers and burs advances , and fruitless darnel and barren wild - oats reign over the shining
{p. 299}
tilth .
Nay , except thou wilt harass the weeds with ceaseless mattock , and frighten off the birds with clamour , and thy pruning - hook lop the darkening rustic shades and thy prayers call down the rain , ah ! all in vain wilt thou eye the garner pile of another , and allay thine own hunger from the shaken oak in the woodland .
Likewise must be told what are the weapons of the hardy countryfolk , without which can be neither sowing nor springing of harvests : the share first , and the heavy strength of the curved plough , and the slow rolling wagons of our Lady of Eleusis , sledges and harrows and the weary weight of the mattock ; withal the slight wicker ware of Celeus , arbutus hurdles , and Iacchus ' mystical winnowing - fan .
All these thou wilt heedfully provide and lay up long in store , if the divine country keeps her due honour in thine eyes .
Early the forest elm is bowed by main force to bend into a share - beam , and takes the shape of the curving plough ; to the stock of it are fitted the long eight - foot pole , the two mould - boards , and the double back of the share - head ; and the light lime is cut to season for the yoke , and the tall beech for the plough - tail that is to turn the carriage from above and behind , and oak battens are hung over the fire for the smoke to search them through .
I can repeat to thee many a counsel of them of old , if thou shrink not back nor weary to learn of lowly cares .
Above all must the threshing - floor be levelled with the ponderous roller , and wrought by hand and cemented with clinging potter 's clay , that it may not gather weeds nor crack in the reign of dust , and be playground withal for manifold destroyers .
Often the tiny mouse builds his house and makes his granaries underground , or the eyeless mole scoops his cell ; and in chinks is found the toad , and all the swarming vermin that are bred in earth ; and the weevil , and the ant that fears a destitute old age , plunder the great pile of spelt .
Look thou likewise , when the walnut in the woodland attires herself in wealth of blossom , and bends with scented boughs ; if her fruit exceed , the corn will keep pace with it , and abundant threshing come with abundant beat ; but if her
{p. 300}
shade overflow in luxuriance of leaf , vainly will the chaff - laden straw be beaten on the winnowing - floor .
In truth I have seen many a sower steep his seeds and wash them beforehand in black olive - lees , that the fruit in the treacherous pod might be larger and soften quickly even over a little fire : I have seen them , though long chosen and toilsomely approved , still fall off unless the strong hand of man picked the largest year by year : so it is fated that all things run to the worse and fall dropping backwards ; even as one who with strain of oarage urges a skiff up stream , if once he slacken his arms , the prone river current sweeps him headlong down .
Likewise must we no less regard the star of Arcturus and the days of the Kids and the gleaming Serpent , than they who sailing homeward over windswept seas adventure the Pontic and the straits by Abydus ' oyster - beds .
When the Scales make daylight and sleep equal in hours and just halve the globe between light and shadow , set your bulls at work , O men !
sow the barley - fields , right into the showery skirts of frost - bound mid-winter : no less is it time to cover in earth the flax - plant and the corn-poppy , and to urge on the belated ploughs while the dry soil allows it , while the clouds hang aloft .
In spring beans are sown ; then the crumbling furrows receive thee likewise , clover of Media , and the yearly care of the millet crop approaches ; when the milk - white Bull with gilded horns opens the year , and the setting Dogstar retires backwards .
But if for wheaten harvest or strong spelt thou wilt work thy ground , and the corn-ear alone is thy desire , first let the Atlantides be at their morning setting and the blazing star of the Cretan Crown sink away , ere thou yield their debt of seed to the furrows , or ere thou hasten to intrust the year 's hope to an unwilling earth .
Many begin before the setting of Maia ; but a harvest of empty stalks mocks their expectation .
If indeed thou wilt sow the vetch or the common kidney - bean , nor despite the care of the Pelusiac lentil , the setting Bear - warden will send thee no uncertain sign ; begin , and carry thy sowing on to the mid-frost .
{p. 301}
To this end the golden sun rules an orbit measured out in certain divisions through the twelvefold star - girdle of the world .
Five zones are placed in heaven ; whereof one ever reddens in the blazing sun and ever is parched by his fire ; and round it right and left sweep the utmost two , bleak , stiff in ice and dark with showers ; two between these and the central zone are granted by grace of the gods to weary mortals , and through both a path is drawn where the slant procession of the signs may turn .
The world , rising steeply towards Scythia and the Rhipean fortresses , sinks sloping to Libya and the south .
This pole of ours is ever uplifted ; but the other black Styx and the deep world of ghosts see underneath their feet .
Here the enormous Serpent glides forth , wreathing his coils in fashion of a river around and between the two Bears , the Bears that dare not dip under the Ocean floor : there , one saith , either dead night is soundless , and the gloom thickens in night 's perpetual pall , or dawn returns from us and leads back the day ; and when dayspring touches us with his panting horses ' breath , there crimson Hesperus kindles his lamp at evenfall .
Hence can we foreknow the changeful sky 's seasons , hence the day of harvest and the time of sowing , and when it befits to drive our oars through the treacherous sparkling sea , when to launch armed fleets , or in due season lay low the woodland pine .
Neither in vain do we mark the signs in their dawning and decease , and the four seasons that make equal division of the year .
Whensoever chilly rain keeps the husbandman indoors , many a thing , which must else be hurried through in clear weather afterward , may be done at leisure ; the ploughman beats out the stubborn point of his blunted share ; one hollows troughs out of the tree ; one marks the stamp on the flock or the numbers on the grain - sacks ; others sharpen stakes and forked poles , and sort Amerian bands for the trailing vine .
Now let the basket be lightly woven of briar - rods , now parch corn over the fire and pound it in the stone .
Nay , and even on holydays some works are right and lawful ; no scruple forbids to guide forth the rivulet , to fence off the cornfield , to
{p. 302}
set snares for birds , to burn brambles , and to plunge the bleating flock in the healthful stream : often the driver loads his slow - paced donkey 's sides with oil or cheap apples , and returning , carries a dressed mill - stone or a lump of black pitch back with him from the town .
The moon 's self ordains the days in their several order to be diverse in luck of labour .
Shun the fifth , birthday of pale Orcus and the Eumenides ; on it earth bore that accursed brood , Coeus and Iapetus and fell Typhoeus , and the brothers that leagued to pluck down heaven .
Thrice they essayed to plant Ossa on Pelion , ay , and roll up leafy Olympus upon Ossa : thrice our Lord smote asunder the piled mountains with his thunderbolt .
The seventeenth is lucky for setting the vine , for catching and breaking oxen , for stringing loops in the loom : the ninth favours runaways , but thwarts the thief .
Many a thing even makes better way in the chill of night , or when at sundawn earth is dewy under the orient star .
By night the light stubbles , by night the parched meadows are better mown ; clinging moisture fails not through the night .
And one I know keeps awake late by the winter firelight , and points torchwood with sharp steel : meanwhile , lightening her long toil with song , the wife runs her ringing comb through the web , or boils down the sweet liquid must over the fire and skims with leaves the wave of the bubbling copper .
But ruddy corn is cut in noon - day heat , and in noon - day heat the parched grain is trodden on the threshing - floor .
Strip to plough , strip to sow ; winter is the farmer 's holiday , and the husbandmen feast on their stores all through the frozen time , and spread the banquet among themselves in mirthful round .
Merry winter bids the guest and lightens the heart ; even as when laden keels at last touch their haven , and the rejoicing mariners hang garlands on the stern .
But then nevertheless is the season to strip acorns from the oak and berries of the laurel , the olive and the blood - red myrtle : then to set snares for the crane and nets for the stag , and to hunt the long - eared hare ; then to strike down the fallow - deer with
{p. 303}
the whirling stroke of the hempen Balearic sling , while snow lies deep , while ice blocks the rivers .
Why tell of autumnal storms and stars , and when now the day is briefer and the summer softer , what watches men must keep ?
or when showerful spring pours down , when the spiky harvest even now ripples on the plains , and when the green blade swells with her milky grain ?
Often have I seen , when the husbandman was marching in his reapers to the golden fields and just cutting the slim - stalked barley , how all the winds , clashing in battle , would tear right from the roots and fling high whole breadths of heavy corn ; in so black a gust would the storm sweep light blade and flying straw away .
Often likewise the waters of heaven descend in infinite armies , and clouds charged from the deep thicken into foul weather black with thundershowers : the sky pours sheer down and washes away the glad crops and labours of the oxen with flooding rain ; ditches fill , and river channels swell roaring , and the narrow seas seethe and smoke .
Our Lord himself in the midnight of the storm - clouds wields the flashing bolts in his right hand : at their shock ancient Earth trembles , wild beasts slink away , and mortal hearts throughout the nations bow low in terror : he hurls down his flaming shaft on Athos or Rhodope or the Ceraunian heights ; the south winds blow fiercer and the rain streams drenching down , and the rushing wind wails over forest and shore .
Fearing this , regard thou heaven in his months and seasons , whither the chill star of Saturn withdraws , to what circles in the sky the Cyllenian wanderer turns his fire .
Above all , worship thou the gods , and bring great Ceres her yearly offerings , doing sacrifice on the springing grass close on the verge of dying winter , when now spring skies are clear .
Then lambs are fat , and then wines mellowest , then sleep is sweet where the shade thickens on the hill .
To Ceres let all thy rustic folk do service ; to her wash thou the honeycomb with milk and soft wine , and for luck let the victim thrice encircle the springing crops and all the band of thy fellows keep it joyful company , and loudly call Ceres into the homestead : neither
{p. 304}
let any lay sickle to the ripe ears till in Ceres ' praise , his brows wreathed with twisted oak , he move in rude dances and chant her hymn .
And these things that we might avail to learn by sure tokens , the heats and the rains and the winds that bring cold weather , our Lord himself hath ordained what the moon in her month should foreshadow , at what sign the south wind should drop , what husbandmen should often mark and keep their cattle nearer the farmyard .
Straightway when gales are gathering , either the seaways begin to shudder and heave , and a dry roaring to be heard on the mountain heights , or the far - echoing beaches to stir , and a rustling swell through the woodland .
Even in that hour the rude surge spares not the curving bull , when gulls fly swiftly back from mid ocean and press screaming shoreward , or when sea -coot play on dry land , and the heron leaves his home in the marshes and soars high above the mist .
Often likewise when a gale is toward wilt thou see shooting stars glide down the sky , and through the darkness of night long trails of flame glimmer in their track : often light chaff and fallen leaves flutter in air , or floating feathers dance on the water 's surface .
But when it lightens from the fierce northern regions , and when Eurus and Zephyrus thunder through their hall , the whole countryside is afloat with brimming ditches , and every mariner at sea furls his soaking sails .
Never is rain on us unwarned : either as it gathers in the valley bottoms the crane soars high in flight before it ; or the heifer gazing up into the sky snuffs the breeze with wide - opened nostril , or the shrill swallow darts circling about the pond , and the frogs in the mire intone their old complaint .
Often likewise the ant carries forth her eggs from her secret chambers along her narrow trodden path , and a vast rainbow drinks , and leaving their feeding - ground in long column armies of rooks crowd with flapping wings .
Then seafowl many in sort , and birds that search the fresh pools round the Asian meadows of Cayster , eagerly splash showers of spray over their shoulders , and thou mayest see them now ducking in the channels , now running up into the waves , and wantoning
{p. 305}
in their bath with vain desire .
Then the villain raven calls full - voiced for rain , and stalks along the dry sand in solitary state .
Nor even to girls who ply their spinning nightlong is the storm unknown , while they see the oil sputter , and spongy mould gather on the blazing lamp .
And even thus sunlight after rain and cloudless clearness mayest thou foresee and know by sure tokens .
For then neither is the keen edge of the starlight dulled to view , nor does the moon rise flushed by her brother 's rays , nor are thin woolly fleeces borne across the sky ; neither do kingfishers beloved of Thetis spread their plumage to the sun 's warmth upon the shore , nor unclean swine remember to shake out their litter and toss it with their snout .
But the mists gather lower down and settle on the flats , and , constant to sunset , the night - owl from the roof - top keeps vainly calling through the dark .
Aloft in the liquid sky Nisus is in sight and Scylla pays the debt of that purple hair : wheresoever her pinions cleave the thin air in flight , lo , hostile , fierce , loud - swooping down the wind , Nisus is upon her ; where Nisus mounts into the wind , her hurrying pinions cleave the thin air in flight .
There , withal rooks repeat three or four times a clear thin - throated cry , and often where they sit aloft , happy in some strange unwonted delight , chatter together among the leaves , glad when rains are over to look to their little brood and darling nests once again ; not , to my thinking , that their instinct is divine or their dower of fate a larger foresight into nature : but when the weather veers about and the saturated air shifts , and under dripping skies of the south what was rare but now condenses and what was dense expands , their temper changes its fashion , and other motions stir within their breasts than stirred while the clouds drove on before the wind ; hence the birds make such chorus in the fields , and the cattle are glad , and the rooks caw in exultation .
If indeed thou wilt regard the hastening sun and the moon 's ordered sequences , never will an hour of the morrow deceive thee , nor wilt thou be taken in the wiles of a cloudless night .
When the moon first gathers her returning fires , if she clasp
{p. 306}
a dark mist in her dim crescent , drenching rain will be in store for husbandman and seafarer ; but if a maiden flush suffuse her face , wind is coming : wind always flushes the gold of the moon : while if at her fourth rising ( for that is surest of warrant ) she travel through the sky with clear sharp - cut horns , both that whole day and those that shall dawn after it till the month be done will be rainless and windless , and sailors preserved will pay their vows on the shore to Glaucus and Panope and Melicertes son of Ino .
The sun likewise , both in his arising and when he sinks into the waves , will issue signs ; most sure are the signs that attend the sun , yielded with morning or at the ascending of the stars .
When at dayspring he is dappled with spots and sunk in a mist , and his orbed centre retires , mistrust thou of showers ; for a gale is bearing hard from seaward , ill - ominous for trees and crops and herds .
Either when towards daybreak spreading shafts struggle out between thick clouds , or when Dawn springs pale from Tithonus ' saffron bed , alas !
weak defence will the vine - tendril be then to the mellow cluster , so heavily the rough hail dances rattling on the roofs .
This likewise , when he has run his race and is now sinking from the sky , will be of yet more service to remember ; for often we see shifting colours fluctuate on his face ; green presages rain , flame - colour east winds ; but if spots begin to mingle with fiery red , then wilt thou see all a single riot of wind and storm - clouds ; not on such a night at any persuasion would I voyage through the deep or part moorings from land .
But if his circle be bright alike when he brings the day and buries the day he brought , vain will be thy terror of rain - clouds , and thou shalt discern the forests weaving in a clear wind from the north .
Lastly , what burden evenfall carries , whence the wind chases clear the clouds , what the dripping South broods over , the sun will signify to thee ; who shall dare to call the sun untrue ?
He likewise often warns of the imminence of dim alarms , of treachery and the gathering of hidden wars ; he likewise had pity on Rome at Caesar 's decease , when he veiled his shining face in dim rusty red , and an evil age dreaded eternal

night .
Yet at that season earth too and the plains of sea , and unclean dogs and ominous birds gave presage .
How often did we see Etna flooding the Cyclopean fields with the torrent bursting from her furnaces , and rolling forth balls of flame and molten rocks !
Germany heard the clash of armour fill the sky ; the Alps quaked with unwonted shocks .
Moreover a voice was heard of many among silent groves , crying aloud , and phantoms pallid in wonderful wise were seen when night was dim ; and cattle spoke , a monstrous thing : rivers stop and earth yawns ; and ivory sheds tears of mourning and bronzes sweat in the temples .
Eridanus , king of rivers , whirled whole forests away in the wash of his raging eddies , and swept herds and stalls together all across the plains .
Neither at that same time did boding filaments ever cease to show themselves in disastrous victims , or blood to ooze from wells , and high cities to echo night - long with howling of wolves .
Never elsewhere did more lightnings fall from clear skies , or ghastly comets so often blaze .
Therefore a second time Philippi saw Roman lines meet in shock of equal arms , and our lords forbade not that Emathia and the broad plains of Haemus should twice be fattened with our blood .
Surely a time too shall come when in those borders the husbandman , as his crooked plough labours the soil , will find spears eaten away with scaling rust , or strike on empty helms with his heavy mattock , and marvel at mighty bones dug up from their tombs .
Gods of our fathers , of our country , and thou Romulus , and Vesta , mother who keepest Tuscan Tiber and the Roman Palatine , forbid not at least that this our prince may succour a ruined world !
Long enough already has our life - blood recompensed Laomedon 's perjury at Troy ; long already the heavenly palace , O Caesar , grudges thee to us , and murmurs that thou shouldst care for human triumphs , where right and wrong are confounded , where all these wars cover the world , where wickedness is so manifold and the plough 's meed of honour is gone ; the fields thicken with weeds , for the tillers are marched away , and bent sickles are forged into the stiff swordblade : here the Euphrates , there Germany heaves with war ; neighbouring cities rush into arms
{p. 308}
one against another over broken laws : the merciless War - God rages through all the world : even as when chariots bursting from their barriers swerve out on the course , and , vainly tugging at the curb , the driver is swept on by his horses , and the car hearkens not to the rein .
