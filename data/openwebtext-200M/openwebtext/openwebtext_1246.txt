In recent history , very few counterinsurgency wars have ended in success .
Guerrillas are often outgunned by a wealthier invading power , but they do have two powerful advantages .
One is that they are fighting on their home turf , which they usually know much better than the invader .
Guerrilla warfare at the strategic level is defensive , even though at the tactical level , raiding insurgents are many times on the offense .
As a result of being on the strategic defense , the second advantage is that the attacking power will find it difficult to overcome the " foreign invader " label among the population of the invaded country .
Thus , because winning the support of the local population is the most important – and difficult – objective in any counterinsurgency war , most such campaigns end in failure .
But there have been a few notable exceptions .
At the turn of the 20th century , the United States refused independence to the Philippines after the Spanish - American War and then outfought Filipino guerrillas to make U.S. colonial rule stick ; a U.S. - supported Greek government beat back communist insurgents in the late 1940s ; and the British beat back Marxist guerrillas in Malaya in the late 1940s to the early 1960s .
Although it might be tempting to assume that the only way to beat guerrillas is to use ruthlessly brutal tactics , this predominated in only the first of the three episodes .
The United States used concentration camps , torture , and a scorched - earth policy in taming Filipino guerrillas .
But even here , such drastic and unacceptable methods may not have been what tipped the outcome to a counterinsurgency success .
The common thread in these three success stories seems to be that either the guerrilla movement was divided or did not win the overwhelming support of the local populace .
In the case of the Filipino insurgency , Emilio Aguinaldo , the guerrilla leader , never really had the support of most of the Filipino population .
Similarly , in Malaya , the rebellion occurred only in a minority of the minority Chinese population , thus allowing the British to eventually stamp it out .
In Greece in the late 1940s , the opposition movement was divided , allowing the U.S. - backed Greek government to prevail .
How do these conclusions apply to current counterinsurgency wars ?
In both the rugged terrain of Afghanistan and the urban landscape of Iraq , guerrilla groups have taken advantage of familiar environments to effectively harass the U.S. superpower .
In addition , the United States , in some sense , has been more restrained than the Taliban and Iraqi insurgents toward the local populations .
The Taliban is known for its harsh methods of justice and killing , and some of the Iraqi guerrillas have slaughtered civilians with suicide bombs .
In contrast , in both nations , the United States has built infrastructure projects and handed out candy to children .
Yet the United States has failed to win the hearts and minds of either population , because of excessive collateral killings from air and ground attacks .
At the end of the day , even a foreign invader who tries to be more sharing and caring is still regarded as a foreign invader .
In Somalia , the militant Islamist Shaabab movement had little public support until the United States , as part of its global " war on terror , " began funding unpopular and corrupt Somali warlords to promote " stability " – turning the local population toward the movement and away from the perceived meddling superpower and its Somali government lackey .
Then , making things worse , a U.S. - backed Ethiopian invasion provided only some temporary stability as long as Ethiopian troops were willing to occupy the country .
The cross - border invasion by Ethiopia – long regarded by Somalis as their archenemy – to quash the militant Islamists only enhanced the radicals ’ standing in Somalia once Ethiopian forces withdrew .
In short , history shows that the presence or influence of foreigners only feeds the flames of any insurgency , which can then be portrayed as a defense of the nation against outside aggression .
But is n’t there hope for Iraq and Afghanistan because opposition forces are divided and often unpopular ?
Not really .
In Iraq , the United States was able to take advantage of al - Qaeda - in - Iraq ’s brutal killing of civilians to divide the Sunni guerrilla movement and bribe the Awakening Councils to battle the group .
The problem in Iraq is that as U.S. forces draw down , the now reduced guerrilla war could turn into a civil war among the Sunni , Shi’ite , and Kurdish ethno - sectarian groups .
In Afghanistan , the Taliban is unquestionably brutal , but Afghans do regard the United States as a foreign occupier , are suspicious of the U.S. long - term military presence , do not support a surge in U.S. forces , do not think it will defeat the Taliban , and thus support negotiating with the insurgents .
In short , the prognosis is not good in either case .
The moment came less than a week after voters in Maine , like those in 30 states before it , rejected same - sex marriage , and just a day before New York legislators would again postpone consideration of a bill to legalize such weddings , conceding inadequate support .
And it underscored what a fascinating example Ms. DeGeneres is setting , not to mention how tough it is to figure out precisely where Americans stand on an issue so fiercely contested that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington , D.C. , said last week that it would scale back social service programs if the district legalized same - sex marriage .
In the handful of states where same - sex marriage is legal , legislatures and courts — not voters — have made it so .
A few polls in recent months have suggested that while a majority of Americans believe that gay couples should be able to enter into unions with some of the legal protections of marriage , a minority believe that gays and lesbians should be permitted to “ marry , ” per se .
Same - sex marriage does n’t fit into the kind of family that many Americans believe should be idealized ; it offends many others ’ deeply felt religious principles .
And yet Ms. DeGeneres , who exchanged vows with Ms. de Rossi during a span last year when same - sex marriage was legal in California , seems more popular than ever — and among audiences squarely in the mainstream .
A decade ago , she had trouble getting work , a development that she and many observers chalked up to her being “ the most famous lesbian in the world , ” as Ms. de Rossi described her on “ Oprah . ”
Role - playing giant Square Enix and casual gaming juggernaut PopCap unleashed their first collaboration this week .
Gyromancer , available on the Xbox 360 for $ 15 and on PC through Steam , looks a lot like the megahit Puzzle Quest : Challenge of the Warlords at first glance .
But the devil 's in the details .
You 're an adventurer looking to capture Qraist Kingsley , the leader of a rebel group called Temperance .
You move around a map , encountering enemies which must be fought by playing a game exactly like PopCap 's Bejeweled Twist :
Matching rows of three or more colored gems helps power up spells that can be cast to damage the enemy and gain other beneficial effects .
That 's where the two games start to diverge .
In Puzzle Quest , you took turns trying to match gems against the computer .
In Gyromancer , the gem grid is yours and yours alone to futz with .
Player and enemy each have spell meters that slowly fill with each move of the gems .
If the player matches gems the same color as their creature 's affinity , those meters will fill faster .
Match gems that correspond to the enemy 's shade and it'll slow their progress .
When these meters fill , they add a special powered - up gem to the playing field .
If the player creates a match with one of these blazing attack gems , they 'll do damage to the enemy creature .
When the opponent 's pending attacks hit the playing field , they take the form of a gem imbued with a glowing skull and a countdown clock .
The number on the skull gem is the number of turns you have left before the enemy 's attack goes off .
If you can match that gem before the timer runs out , you 'll avoid the attack .
If not , the bad guy takes a swipe at you .
Also substantially different is that fact that you 're not doing the fighting , but rather engaging the enemy with creatures that you summon .
I started out with two Power Beetles with yellow affinity and a single grey Aevis .
I soon acquired a code that would let me summon a Red Wyrm – but you can only summon them at a special location .
I had to wait to finish the first stage before I could add the Red Wyrm to my bench .
But since I could only hold three summoned buddies , I had to cut one of my Power Beetles loose .
The initial stage is quite simple – there 's just one path with a couple of outlets where you 'll find treasure and places to restore your creature 's health .
Between me and the goal were a couple of wandering monsters who had to be defeated before my first encounter with Qraist .
The game 's second stage was more maze - like , with dead ends to explore and diversions to chase .
I steered towards an beast lair and fought a boss there – a level 3 Lava Wyrm .
Defeating that baddie destroyed the lair and all the wandering monsters in the area .
It also scored me some additional treasure .
Even at these early stages , I can tell that I like Gyromancer quite a bit more than the Puzzle Quest games .
The role - playing elements feel a little more thought - out and complex .
And the battle mechanic , as filtered through Bejeweled Twist , feels a lot more like a puzzle .
There 's much less luck involved ; the battles are yours to win or lose .
The Puzzle Quest games were oddly compelling , despite the fact that they felt either unfairly hard or so easy that they were broken .
Gyromancer , with its rock - solid PopCap puzzling and engaging Square Enix role - play , feels way tighter , and thus has the potential to be dangerously engrossing .

That 's right , the guys who haul pianos and music stands at Carnegie Hall are raking in the big bucks .
Just how much ?
It 's more than you could even imagine .
According to an article on Bloomberg 's website , the average stage hand at the New York institution made an average of $ 430,543 last year .
Yes , that 's right .
$ 400 K .
Dennis O'Connell , who oversees the props made $ 530,044 , the most of anyone on the five - man crew that oversees the on -stage operations .
You should have spent more time hanging out with the theater nerds .
Clive Gillinson , the artistic and executive director of the three Carnegie stages in Midtown , makes about twice that $ 946,581 .
The only people who are n't raking it in are the musicians and singers , who usually pull down $ 20,000 a night after years and years of training .
So , yes , we 're happy for the people who make a nice fat check for what is essentially manual labor .
But you could hire a dozen unemployed journalists for the money they 're spending on stage hands .
Which is a good thing , because that 's about as many keyboard - punchers you 'd need to lift as much as one stage hand .
How did this happen ?
Bloomberg attributes it to a strong union , the Local One of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees .
Would they be interested in taking over the Freelancers Guild ?

Do n't ask , do n't tell
The declarations , two of a host of resolutions adopted Tuesday , came a day after AMA delegates rebuffed an effort by some doctors to persuade the organization to drop last week 's qualified support of the U.S.
House health care reform bill that passed Saturday .
The call for a repeal of the do n't ask , do n't tell policy says it violates doctor - patient confidentiality and causes a dilemma for gay and lesbian individuals fearful their military careers will be jeopardized if they disclose their sexual orientation when talking about certain health matters .
Military doctors are bound by the law to report personnel 's sexual orientation to their superiors .
An AMA committee said testimony from such personnel noted “ the chilling effect ” of the policy .
President Barack Obama pledged in his campaign to end the policy , instituted by President Bill Clinton , but has not made it a priority in his first year of office .
He renewed the pledge in October in a speech before the advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign .
Geoffrey Corn , a South Texas College of Law professor who writes frequently on national security issues , said the AMA resolution seems like “ another nail in the coffin for the policy . ”
He said a middle ground would be for the law to be changed to exempt doctors but added that “ it 's hard to argue the momentum is not in the direction of revoking the policy altogether , probably sooner rather than later . ”
The resolution that gay marriage bans adversely affects homosexuals followed an AMA committee report noting that marriage is a strong predictor of health insurance , particularly among women .
Gays ' partners typically are excluded from health care benefits , such as insurance and family and medical leave rights , it said .
“ Gay and lesbian couples account for 1 percent of U.S. households , ” said Dr. Russell Kridel , a Houston facial plastic surgeon and a member of the AMA Council on Science and Public Health , which produced the report .
“ Do we really want to cause disparities to those populations ? ”
Kridel said the AMA did n't call for an end to gay marriage bans because that 's “ a political position , ” not a medical issue .
He said one way to address the problem without legalizing gay marriage would be through civil unions , recognizing such relationships and extending health care benefits to couples in them .
In 2008 , the report found , nearly 17 million children - more than one in five across the US - were living in households in which food at times ran short , up from slightly more than 12 million children the year before .
And the number of children who were sometimes hungry rose from nearly 700,000 to almost 1.1 million .
The findings are from a snapshot of food in America that the US Department of Agriculture has issued every year since 1995 , based on Census Bureau surveys .
It documents Americans who are scrounging for adequate food - people living with some amount of '' food insecurity ' ' - and those whose food shortages are so severe they are hungry .
The report is the first produced during the tenure of President Barack Obama , who pledged in his campaign for the White House last year to eliminate hunger among children by 2015 , a goal no previous president has set .
His administration has not produced a fully - fledged plan to meet that objective , but White House and agriculture officials have said they are developing policies .
Among the first is a decision to use $ US85 million freed up by Congress to experiment with ways to get food to more children during the summer holidays , when subsidised school breakfasts and lunches are unavailable .
The Government 's next significant forum for debating how to improve access to food is scheduled for the coming year , when Congress is to renew the country 's main law covering food and nutrition for children .
The report suggests the main federal programs intended to help people struggling to get food are only partly fulfilling their purpose .
Slightly more than half the people surveyed who reported they had food shortages said that they had , in the previous month , participated in one of the Government 's main anti-hunger and nutrition programs : food stamps , subsidised school lunches or the nutrition program for women with babies or young children .
David Cameron has challenged the membership of the Conservative party before to take on positions that may have been unthinkable in years gone by – and , in the main , he has taken the party with him .
But his decision to announce , while giving evidence to the Speaker 's Conference , that he wants to impose all - women shortlists on some local associations from 2010 has been met with almost universal opposition .
Indeed , I hope that the force of the opposition shown to the proposal will persuade him against going down this route at all .
Among the most vociferous opponents in the party to all - women shortlists are some of the best - known female Conservative MPs .
Leading the charge , in a blog post on ConservativeHome this morning , is Mid Bedfordshire MP Nadine Dorries .
She rightly makes the point of principle that any female MP should know that she got to the Commons on merit and under the same rules as male colleagues – and not because of her gender .
Meanwhile , Ann Widdecombe was raising similar arguments , making the point that it is strange to be picking a fight with the party at this stage in the electoral cycle , when it is on the cusp of gaining power .
The grassroots response has also been overwhelmingly hostile to the proposal .
Tim Montgomerie and I at ConservativeHome took the rare step of posting a jointly signed editorial on the site yesterday to demonstrate a united front – and you only have to look at the comments posted below that piece to comprehend the sheer strength of feeling of activists around the country on this one .
At a very basic level , it is un-Conservative and against the spirit of the meritocracy in which Conservatives believe to impose a shortlist where candidates are chosen not because of their ability , but because of a particular characteristic , be that their gender , sexuality or ethnic background .
But it is also worth noting – as I did on last night 's BBC 10 O'Clock News – that imposing all - women shortlists does not sit at all easily with the party 's stated commitment to localism .
How can we convincingly talk about devolving power to people and lower tiers of government ( a policy we are correctly pursuing ) while simultaneously allowing the party to centralise power and dictate from on high when it comes to candidate selection ?
It is a particular shame that Cameron is seeking to push all - women shortlists now , since the party has actually made such great progress on selecting more women without having to resort to this form of discrimination .
Over the 90 or so years that women have been eligible to sit in parliament , only 66 women have ever sat as Conservative MPs .
If the party wins enough seats to see a Conservative majority in the Commons , that figure will almost be matched in one parliament alone .
As a matter of fact , women are being selected in roughly equal proportion to the number of women on the candidates ' list – and there are already many excellent women who I expect to enter the Commons as Tory MPs next year .
It would therefore be an affront to the principles of meritocracy and democracy if another handful is seen to be joining them only because of special measures .

Hey folks !
Gonna try to get off at least one more update today .
Stay tuned .
Meantime , go check out Goblins !
( strictly for the geek of heart ) .
- video encodings still in process -
Nell McCafferty questions the church 's apology and suggests they should give up their accolades such as " Your Eminence " , " Your Grace " etc .
Not only were dozens of priests abusing hundreds of children in the archdiocese of Dublin over five decades , their superiors were either turning a blind eye or conspiring to cover it up , often with the help of Gardai and other state authorities .
The report by Justice Yvonne Murphy 's Commission of Investigation , published today , reveals the true scale of the scandal in a church which considered itself above the law .
The report itself describes in devastating detail how the reputation of the catholic church was deemed more important than the welfare of children .
Heck , why we 're at it :
What is holy about god !?
" We would hear it – we were in the next room at Castel Gandolfo .
You could hear the sound of the blows when he flagellate himself .
He did it when he was still capable of moving on his own . "
If you 've been following the Pirate Bay drama , you know that this site will never be what it used to be .
However , amidst all that hubbub and even after the ( so far ) unsuccessful sale of the site , the actual site remained operational .
Thus , many users who were there just for the torrents perhaps did n't even notice that something is wrong .
This is about to change .
TorrentFreak reports that the Amsterdam court ruled that The Pirate Bay must remove all copyrighted torrents from the site within three months .
The Dutch court initially ruled that Pirate Bay must block access to Dutch citizens ; a decision which the site 's founders decided to appeal .
It worked to some extent , as that judgment has now been nullified , but the Court now decided that The Pirate Bay - while not guilty of copyright infringement - is guilty of assisting copyright infringement , a phrase we hear a lot in cases such as this one .
Now , Dutch anti-piracy body BREIN will supply a list of copyrighted works to The Pirate Bay , and the operators of the site must remove them within three months , facing a fine of $ 7,500 per person , per day .
The problem with this decision is the fact that The Pirate Bay has always refused to admit any guilt of copyright infringement and has probably never had plans to devise a system for removing copyrighted works from its servers .
With a bunch of lawsuits looming over the founders , they 'll probably have to comply with BREIN 's requests and stop users from uploading new torrents whatsoever .
It may be just one country ( Netherlands ) , and the Pirate Bay can choose to appeal this decision , too , but the lawsuits are piling up .
Although The Pirate Bay founders always claimed that the site can live on without them , in the end simply shutting it down might be the least painful route for everyone .
Ok , the little blog is running about 9 times higher volume than my old record .
This means there are a lot of new people who are interested in understanding this issue .
Believe me that as a technical blogger , the replies and emails read differently than if you ’re checking this out for the first time .
So one of the things I do is try to explain the issues the best way possible so not everyone has to be a climate scientist to figure this stuff out .
It does n’t always work but here we go .
Despite what RC says , there are several glaring problems in these emails which Gavin Schmidt is working feverishly to gloss over .
Here are the items I have a problem with .
Discussion of interference with IPCC procedures to block low - warming reasonable and published papers .
Discussion of removal of climate reviewers who are open minded to low - warming papers .
The fact that in GRL this apparently occurred after these discussions is a problem .
Discussion with the government about denial of FOIA to any climate audit blogger .
FOIA is not meant to be for non-controversial topics it ’s SPECIFICALLY for the contriversial ones .
Free speech does n’t protect nice words , it protects strong words .
Data manipulation discussions .
These are mostly hinted at except for a few instances but they are real and directed only toward strong warming .
So now I have to provide evidence of these problems .
Let ’s look at RC ’s reply which provides a nice foundation for our discussion .
This is a paragraph from Gavin ’s post :
More interesting is what is not contained in the emails .
There is no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy , no mention of George Soros nefariously funding climate research , no grand plan to ‘ get rid of the MWP ’ , no admission that global warming is a hoax , no evidence of the falsifying of data , and no ‘ marching orders ’ from our socialist / communist / vegetarian overlords .
The truly paranoid will put this down to the hackers also being in on the plot though .
Gavin has done a nice job declaring that there is no conspiracy but how true is it .
I do n’t know what people expected a conspiracy to look like but in my experience they are typically very simple structures by friends with a common goal or incentive .
First , before you claim what incentive , I have this link posted by Lubos demonstrating 22 million US dollars were distributed to phil jones since 1990 .
Twenty TWO million !!
I ’ve got to say , I could do a lot with that money and that sort of number will incent people to not mess up the story the money handlers want .
Also , we should n’t skip the fact that these emails are chock full of expenses paid travel to exotic places , Bejing , Shanghai , Tahiti on and on .
So let ’s look at some of the emails .
It ’s way too difficult to go through all of them but I ’ve read most .
This article will get insanely long if I put the whole email in so I ’ll give a reference number and enough to take the comments in context .

Mike ,
[ snip personal ] [ snip off topic ]
The other paper by MM is just garbage – as you knew .
De Freitas again .
Pielke is also losing all credibility as well by replying to the mad Finn as well – frequently as I see it .
I ca n’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report .
Kevin and I will keep them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is !
Cheers
Phil
Obviously this is a simple conspiracy of two to keep a paper from participation in the IPCC .
What ’s more , they apparently have the power to do it !
The paper is likely MM04 which was quite accurate in my view but that ’s beyond the scope of this article .
The boys are not concerned with the suppression of low warming views in the least .
It never crosses their minds ‘ what if we ’re wrong ’ ?
A long email with some evidence for collusion to remove an editor from GRL .

I ’m not sure that GRL can be seen as an honest broker in these debates anymore , and it is probably best to do an end run around GRL now where possible .
They have published far too many deeply flawed contrarian papers in the past year or so .
There is no possible excuse for them publishing all 3 Douglass papers and the Soon et al paper .
These were all pure crap .
There appears to be a more fundamental problem w/ GRL now , unfortunately …
Mike [ snip - irrelevant ]
Thanks Tom , Yeah , basically this is just a heads up to people that something might be up here .
What a shame that would be .
It ’s one thing to lose “ Climate Research ” .
We ca n’t afford to lose GRL .
I think it would be useful if people begin to record their experiences w/ both Saiers and potentially Mackwell ( I do n’t know him–he would seem to be complicit w / what is going on here ) .
If there is a clear body of evidence that something is amiss , it could be taken through the proper channels .
I do n’t that the entire AGU hierarchy has yet been compromised ! [ snip ]

Proving bad behavior here is very difficult .
If you think that Saiers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp , then , if we can find documentary evidence of this , we could go through official AGU channels to get him ousted .
Even this would be difficult . [ snip ]

Apparently , the contrarians now have an “ in ” with GRL .
This guy Saiers has a prior connection w/ the University of Virginia Dept. of Environmental Sciences that causes m some unease .
I think we now know how the various Douglass et al papers w/ Michaels and Singer , the Soon et al paper , and now this one have gotten published in GRL , Mike
It makes one wonder , how can the AGU community be “ compromised ” by people with different opinions ?
This can go on forever but let ’s conclude it with this beautiful piece email from Mike .

Mike
So how does this evidence of an active wish to remove an editor of Geophysics Research pan out ?
Gavin laid it out for us in a manner which is apparently supposed to allay concern of conspiracy in his latest thread .
[ Response : This is a typical over - reaction .
Perhaps you are unaware that almost all journals demand that you submit names of potential reviewers as part of the submission ?
Perhaps you are unaware that 6 editors of Climate Research resigned because of the way the Soon and Baliunas paper was handled ?
Or are n’t scientists allowed to give their opinions to colleagues ?
– gavin ]
So lessee , do 6 editors resigning in concert give confidence that no collusion to replace other editors is involved ?
Ain’t buyin’ it .
In my opinion there is clear evidence in these and many other emails for collusion to force consensus .
It ’s been a standard point of the Air Vent that consensus is an unnatural state for any group .
Put 5 people in a room and ask the wall color !
In this case the ring leader appears to be Mike ( coach ) .
He was working very hard to insure that the ‘ team ’ pull in the same direction .
I encourage readers to find other examples of collusion to maintain consensus in this pile of emails and post below .
Last names removed .
Let ’s move on to FOIA .
Again , it ’s a small simple conspiracy .
I ’ve read all the FOIA emails by searching the email directory from the zip file .
Active blocking of freedom of information requests .
Now keep in mind that freedom of information is the same as freedom of speech .
The rules are provided to force controversial information to be allowed .
There IS NO REASON for FOIA protection to non-controversial data .
Yet the AGW guys worked closely with the local government to insure that NO FOIA from CA or any CA readers get proper attention !!
None .
No conspiracy gavin ?
Here ’s the FREEDOM of information requests email .
1228330629.txt
Ben ,
When the FOI requests began here , the FOI person said we had to abide by the requests .
It took a couple of half hour sessions – one at a screen , to convince them otherwise showing them what CA was all about .
Once they became aware of the types of people we were dealing with , everyone at UEA ( in the registry and in the Environmental Sciences school – the head of school and a few others ) became very supportive .
I ’ve got to know the FOI person quite well and the Chief Librarian – who deals with appeals .
The VC is also aware of what is going on – at least for one of the requests , but probably does n’t know the number we ’re dealing with .
We are in double figures .
So if you have an unquestioned warmist viewpoint or you feel that questioning a science that desperately hopes to add trillions in taxes is too troublesome , you can ignore FOIA .
The FOIA only applies to people who want to ‘ actually understand ’ not leftists .
This is exactly what I would expect from a third world country .
This is what you get in Cuba or Venezuela .
The FOIA is n’t created protect easy government questions , it protects hard ones .
Please forgive us for wanting to know why we ’re giving millions of dollars to these people for undisclosed papers ?
Sorry , lost my temper .
How can a person be convinced to ignore the law from a FEW HALF HOUR SESSIONS !!
Gavin .. this IS a problem !
Again , I would encourage others to locate other examples of FOIA corruption and post them – last names removed – in the comments .
I ’ll finish this post which has taken too much time with the manipulation of data .
Gavin did a particularly good job of stepping in the poodo on this one .
Here Gavin describes a poor choice of words .
No doubt , instances of cherry - picked and poorly - worded “ gotcha ” phrases will be pulled out of context .
One example is worth mentioning quickly .
Phil Jones in discussing the presentation of temperature reconstructions stated that “ I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline . ”
The paper in question is the Mann , Bradley and Hughes ( 1998 ) Nature paper on the original multiproxy temperature reconstruction , and the ‘ trick ’ is just to plot the instrumental records along with reconstruction so that the context of the recent warming is clear .
Scientists often use the term “ trick ” to refer to a “ a good way to deal with a problem ” , rather than something that is “ secret ” , and so there is nothing problematic in this at all .
As for the ‘ decline ’ , it is well known that Keith Briffa ’s maximum latewood tree ring density proxy diverges from the temperature records after 1960 ( this is more commonly known as the “ divergence problem ” –see e.g. the recent discussion in this paper ) and has been discussed in the literature since Briffa et al in Nature in 1998 ( Nature , 391 , 678-682 ) .
Those authors have always recommend not using the post 1960 part of their reconstruction , and so while ‘ hiding ’ is probably a poor choice of words ( since it is ‘ hidden ’ in plain sight ) , not using the data in the plot is completely appropriate , as is further research to understand why this happens .
However , Gavin ’s claim of out of context does n’t hold water .
Hiding the decline has been one of the key points at the Air Vent since it ’s inception .
In Mann 08 this well known problem with non warming data was addressed as shown in the following plot .
Ya see , they took the inconvenient purple curve and chopped the data back to the yellow line which had very poor correlation to tempareature – no consistent warming .
Through some Mathemagic Michael Mann pasted on information from other upsloping proxies .
— Instant warming .
See hockey stick posts above .
This procedure is very well known and blindly accepted amongst the advocates WRT Briffa MXD .
The same people who we now can demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt have taken over paleoclimatology .
After replacing open minded people , the advocate editors do n’t even question the lopping of data , who knows what horrors it would do for their careers .
If you pulled this garbage in ANY other science it would be laughed out of the building but from these emails Mann , Briffa and Jones are in charge of this situation .
So , my point this morning HERE was – this problem is known by 100 % of all paleoclimatologists .
Really everyone knows .
So having the foreknowledge that everyone does this to Briffa MXD and other series , why would Jones make the following comments at TGIF with respect to his knowledge of this email :
Dear Ray , Mike and Malcolm ,
Once
Tim ’s got a diagram here we ’ll send that either later today or first thing tomorrow .
I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) amd [ sic ] from1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline .
Mike ’s series got the annual land and marine values while theother two got April - Sept for NH land N of
20N .
The latter two are real for 1999 , while the estimate for 1999 for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90 .
The Global estimate for 1999 with data through Oct is +0.35 C cf. 0.57 for 1998 .
Thanks for the comments , Ray .
Cheers , Phil
And his comment was :
Jones told TGIF he had no idea what me meant by using the words “ hide the decline ” .
“ That was an email from ten years ago .
Can you remember the exact context of what you wrote ten years ago ? ”
Well before the real climate post , my point was that EVERY PALEOCLIMATOLOGIST KNOWS DAMN WELL WHAT CONEXT THE COMMENT WAS MADE IN .
Nobody ’s speaking out because they are all on the team .
Unfortunately for them , RC does n’t read here often enough .
Here ’s what I said before the RC post :
These ‘ divergence ’ issues are widely widely widely known and discussed in paleo literature and the SOB Phil Jones knows exactly what he meant !!!
He was just too honest in his email .
How many “ widely ” ‘s a re required is personal taste but remember Gavin just flatly agreed with my point .
it is well known that Keith Briffa ’s maximum latewood tree ring density proxy diverges from the temperature records after 1960 ( this is more commonly known as the “ divergence problem ” –see e.g. the recent discussion in this paper ) and has been discussed in the literature since Briffa et al in Nature in 1998 ( Nature , 391 , 678-682 ) .
and this
so while ‘ hiding ’ is probably a poor choice of words ( since it is ‘ hidden ’ in plain sight )
That is exactly the point Gavin .
The inconvenient data has been chopped off ( in plain sight ) , the data has been replaced ( in plain sight ) , with the components of a hockey stick ( in plain sight ) .
Now do n’t you think it ’s um ….. interesting that a brilliant guy like Gavin seems to miss this point ?!!!
It ’s flat , proven , in your face , no question …… advocacy .
Climate science is corrupt , Gavin , Mann , Briffa , Osborne and Jones are complicit in my opinion .
How can a reasonable minded individual conclude otherwise .
If it looks like a duck , and it quacks like a duck my guess - - a duck .
The evidence is endless in these emails , I have n’t begun to scratch the surface here .
Here is another goofy response by Gavin to the weight of the evidence .
But if cherry - picked out - of - context phrases from stolen personal emails is the only response to the weight of the scientific evidence for the human influence on climate change , then there probably is n’t much to it .
To which I answer , what if they are ” in context ” .
Now the police are involved and this comment has been added to RC .
“ We are aware that information from a server used for research information
in one area of the university has been made available on public websites , ”
the spokesman stated .
“ Because of the volume of this information we cannot currently confirm
that all of this material is genuine .
“ This information has been obtained and published without our permission
and we took immediate action to remove the server in question from
operation .
What would you say if you were in damage control ?
The emails are genuine or they can not be verified ?
Collusion , corruption , manipulation , and obstruction are the climate standards .

Mike ,
Only have it in the pdf form .
FYI ONLY – do n’t pass on .
Relevant paras are the last
2 in section 4 on p13 .
As I said it is worded carefully due to Adrian knowing Eugenia
for years .
He knows the ’re wrong , but he succumbed to her almost pleading with him
to tone it down as it might affect her proposals in the future !
I did n’t say any of this , so be careful how you use it – if at all .
Keep quiet also
that you have the pdf .
The attachment is a very good paper – I ’ve been pushing Adrian over the last weeks
to get it submitted to JGR or J. Climate .
The main results are great for CRU and also
for ERA - 40 .
The basic message is clear – you have to put enough surface and sonde
obs into a model to produce Reanalyses .
The jumps when the data input change stand
out so clearly .
NCEP does many odd things also around sea ice and over snow and ice .
The other paper by MM is just garbage – as you knew .
De Freitas again .
Pielke is also
losing all credibility as well by replying to the mad Finn as well – frequently as I see
it .
I ca n’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report .
Kevin and I will keep
them
out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer - review literature is !
Cheers

Bra burning — the most famous habit of women ’s libbers — caused a fair amount of consternation back in the seventies , and the smoke has lingered .
Wives and mothers were torching the most intimate accessory of control ; what might they put a match to next ?
“ Often today those who cherish family life feel , even in their own homes , under constant assault , ” the cultural critic Michael Novak wrote in 1979 .
The goals of the women ’s - liberation movement , he saw , were incompatible with the structure of the traditional family .
That ’s why bra burning became the most durable and unsettling image of modern feminism .
So it may be worth noting that it never actually happened .
In 1968 , at a protest against the Miss America pageant , in Atlantic City , feminists tossed items that they felt were symbolic of women ’s oppression into a Freedom Trash Can : copies of Playboy , high - heeled shoes , corsets and girdles .
Lindsy Van Gelder , a reporter for the Post , wrote a piece about the protest in which she compared the trash - can procession to the burning of draft cards at antiwar marches , and a myth was born .
In her engaging tour d’horizon “ When Everything Changed : The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present ” ( Little , Brown ; $ 27.99 ) , Gail Collins quotes Van Gelder ’s lament : “ I shudder to think that will be my epitaph — ‘ she invented bra burning . ’ ”
It ’s as if feminism were plagued by a kind of false - memory syndrome .
Where we think we ’ve been on our great womanly march forward often has less to do with the true coördinates than with our fears and desires .
We tend to imagine the fifties and the early sixties , for example , as a time when most American women were housewives .
“ In reality , however , by 1960 there were as many women working as there had been at the peak of World War II , and the vast majority of them were married , ” Collins writes .
Forty per cent of wives whose children were old enough to go to school had jobs .
This is n’t just about the haze of retrospection : back then , women saw themselves as homemakers , too .
Esther Peterson , President Kennedy ’s Assistant Secretary of Labor , asked a high - school auditorium full of girls how many of them expected to have a “ home and kids and a family . ”
Hands shot up .
Next , Peterson asked how many expected to work , and only a few errant hands were raised .
Finally , she asked the girls how many of them had mothers who worked , and “ all of those hands went up again , ” Peterson wrote in her 1995 memoir , “ Restless . ”
Nine out of ten of the girls would end up having jobs outside the house , she explained , “ but each of the girls thought that she would be that tenth girl . ”
There are political consequences to remembering things that never happened and forgetting things that did .
If what you mainly know about modern feminism is that its proponents immolated their underwear , you might well arrive at the conclusion that feminists are “ obnoxious , ” as Leslie Sanchez does in her new book , “ You ’ve Come a Long Way , Maybe : Sarah , Michelle , Hillary and the Shaping of the New American Woman ” ( Palgrave ; $ 25 ) .
“ I do n’t agree with the feminist agenda , ” Sanchez writes .
“ To me , the word ‘ feminist ’ epitomizes the zealots of an earlier and more disruptive time . ”
Here ’s what Sanchez would prefer : “ No bra burning .
No belting out Helen Reddy .
Just calm concern for how women were faring in the world . ”
The world that Sanchez has in mind is really Washington , D.C. Sanchez has a day job as a Republican political analyst ; perhaps this is why she measures progress solely by the percentage of people with government jobs who wear bras .
Her great hope is that there will be a female President in her lifetime , and she bitterly regrets that the former governor of Alaska did not make it to the West Wing .
“ Most of us are Sarah Palins to one degree or another , ” Sanchez asserts .
Palin “ so very clearly reflected the lifestyle choices , hard work ethic , and traditional values that so many women admire . ”
One sign of our cultural memory disorder is that you can describe a female governor of a state as “ traditional ” and not get laughed at .
Conservative career women are eager to describe themselves in those terms .
“ I do n’t like labels , but , if there ’s a label for me , it would be ‘ traditional , ’ and I ’m very proud to be traditional , ’’ Cindy McCain told voters when her husband was running for President .
Since 2000 , she has been the chairman of Hensley & Company , one of the largest distributors of beer in this country , with annual revenues exceeding three hundred million dollars .
Neither she nor Sarah Palin is , of course , a traditional woman .
In a traditional family , a wife and mother does not pursue success outside her own home .
Even when a large sector of the female population worked , as Peterson pointed out , women tried to forget this reality so that they could conceive of themselves as idealized traditional housewives .
Traditionally , women were not considered suited to economic or professional independence , let alone political leadership , no matter what they had accomplished .
“ Billie Jean King was the winner of three Wimbledon titles in a single year and was supporting her household with the money she made from tennis , ” Collins writes , “ but she could not get a credit card unless it was in the name of her husband , a law student with no income . ”
Unquestioned male authority is the basis of traditional marriage , and that is why the zealots of an earlier and more disruptive time wanted to scrap it .
Feminists have long been criticized for telling women that they could have it all .
But conservatives have done us one better : apparently , you can have it all and be traditional , too .
Mrs. McCain told George Stephanopolous that she asked Palin , just after she was picked for the Republican national ticket , how Palin would reconcile her responsibilities as a mother with her prospective job .
“ She looked me square in the eye , ” Mrs. McCain recounted , “ and she said , ‘ You know something ?
I ’m a mother .
I can do it . ’ ” It used to be that conservatives thought motherhood disqualified women for full - time careers ; now they ’ve decided that it ’s a credential for higher office .
All of this raises a question : why has feminism , which managed to win so many battles — the notion of a woman with a career has become perfectly unexceptionable — remained anathema to millions of women who are the beneficiaries of its success ?
Once , it was easy to say what feminism was .
Its aim was to win full citizenship for women , starting with suffrage , an issue that began amassing support in the United States in the eighteen - forties .
More than a century later , Betty Friedan was working in that tradition when , in 1966 , she co-founded the National Organization for Women , whose goal was to obtain legislative protections for women and insure employment parity .
Like the suffragists , Friedan was devoted to a politics of equality .
Here ’s another detail we ’ve forgotten : historically , it was the Republican Party that was more amenable to women ’s rights .
“ It had been the Democrats , with their base in heavily Catholic urban districts and the South , who were more likely to resist anything that encouraged women ’s independence from the home , ” Collins writes .
The wealthier classes , represented by Republicans , had less to fear , because their families could continue pretty much undisturbed no matter how many activities the lady of the house busied herself with : they had staff .
By the late sixties and early seventies , of course , things had changed .
The argument had moved from civic equality to personal liberation : feminists started talking about orgasms as well as ambitions .
The women who marched past the Freedom Trash Can outside the Miss America pageant were n’t protesting the absence of female judges ; they were protesting the contest ’s underlying values .
“ The goals of liberation go beyond a simple concept of equality , ” Susan Brownmiller wrote in the Times Magazine in 1970 .
“ NOW ’s emphasis on legislative change left the radicals cold . ”
Betty Friedan became marginalized within the very organization she had started .
( She was , as Brownmiller put it , “ considered hopelessly bourgeois . ”
Friedan returned fire by cautioning young women against the “ bra - burning , anti-man ” feminists who were supplanting her . )
The radicals taking over feminism , many of whom were active in the civil - rights and antiwar movements , wanted to overthrow patriarchy , which would require transforming almost every aspect of society : child rearing , entertainment , housework , academics , romance , business , art , politics , sex .
Some of that happened and some of it did n’t .
By the early seventies , the Supreme Court had granted legal protection to birth control and abortion .
But the politics of equality — forget liberation — swiftly ran into resistance .
Catholic and Protestant conservatives found a common threat : the destruction of the traditional family .
The Republican Bob McDonnell , who won last week ’s race to become governor of Virginia , described the peril in a master ’s thesis he wrote in the nineteen - eighties : “ A dynamic new trend of working women and feminists ” — women who have sought “ to increase their family income , or for some women , to break their perceived stereotypical role bonds and seek workplace equality and individual self - actualization ” — is “ ultimately detrimental to the family . ”
In the run-up to the election , McDonnell scrambled to distance himself from the thesis .
But he was telling a particular truth that liberals and conservatives have different reasons for evading : if the father works and the mother works , nobody is left to watch the kids .
In societies where these families constitute the majority , either government acknowledges the situation and helps provide child care ( as many European countries do ) or child care becomes a luxury affordable for the affluent , and a major problem for everyone else .
Social movements , like armies , define themselves by their conquests , not by their defeats .
Feminism failed to make child care available to all , let alone bring about the total reconfiguration of the family that revolutionary feminists had envisaged , and that would have changed this country on a cellular level .
Like so many other ideals of the sixties and seventies , the state - backed egalitarian family has gone from seeming — to both political parties — practical and inevitable to seeming utterly beyond the pale .
The easier victories involved representation , or at least symbolic representation .
For all the backlash against Roe v.
Wade , the movement had steady success in getting women into the government and the private - sector workforce .
The contours of mainstream feminism started to change accordingly .
A politics of liberation was largely supplanted by a politics of identity .
National and the Maori Party have reached a deal on the ETS - and its not the pork - fest expected .
According to the list of agreed measures , the core of the deal is :
an extra $ 24 million for the home insulation scheme , targeted specifically at low - income homes .
EECA will be asked to work closely with iwi in delivery of this programme - something they should arguably be doing anyway .
a Treaty clause in the ETS legislation , with a specific requirement to consult on forestry , fishing , and agricultural allocations , as well as any decision to change the point of obligation for agriculture , and on future targets .
A side - deal [ PDF ] with Ngai Tahu and four other iwi to prevent them suing over bad faith in their Treaty settlements , in which they will get a 70 - year lease on 35,000 hectares of DoC land and 100 percent of any carbon credits earned for the period of the lease .
This is n't as generous as it sounds .
After all , the whole point of forest " credits " is that they are n't - they 're borrowing , not income , and every credit " earned " must be repaid when the trees are cut down .
So , if they engage in forestry , their net carbon earnings will be zero ( and taking carbon at the end of it means leaving the more valuable trees behind ) .
, not income , and every credit " earned " must be repaid when the trees are cut down .
So , if they engage in forestry , their net carbon earnings will be zero ( and taking carbon at the end of it means leaving the more valuable trees behind ) .
Two members of the iwi leadership group will get an all - expenses - paid junket to Copenhagen , courtesy of the taxpayer .
Non-preferential iwi involvement in Doc 's program to encourage afforestation on crown land .
Consultation on complementary measures .
Only two of these are really " pork " - and one is technically valueless ( or rather , the only value is the lease , not the carbon ) .
As for the rest , its perfectly acceptable .
The down - side however is that the party has agreed to vote in lock - step with the government on the rest of the bill [ PDF ] , including " all procedural motions and SOP 's advanced by other parties " .
Which means those other amendments which would fix the scheme are dead in the water .
So , when our taxes rise or our public services are cut to pay for the massive subsidies to polluters in the scheme , we 'll have the Maori Party to thank for it .
The Moral Argument In Favor Of File Sharing ?
from the is - it - wrong ?
dept
It is through sharing that we develop a culture and advance humanity .
Creative works like art and music are , at their core , about sharing with others .
They tell stories , reveal personalities , or comment on the world in ways that others can appreciate , forming a part of our culture as they are spread around .
Gregor Mendel 's discoveries about genetics had no value while they were gathering dust on the monastery bookshelf ; it is only when those discoveries were shared with the world that they became vital .
Infinite Goods Should Be Shared
Say you have something that is good for others , and it is infinite , so you will not lose any of it by giving some away .
I do n't think it 's a stretch to say that most people 's idea of morality would dictate that they should share that thing .
In general , information is something that can be seen as a public good .
If somebody has a discovery or an idea , it costs nothing to give it away , it is not scarce , yet it can potentially benefit the world .
Faced with an infinity of good things in the form of content information , why would somebody chose not to give it away ?
What is gained by hoarding something that can help others and costs nothing to share ?
Let 's say you figure out that you can protect people from a deadly virus , say , influenza , with a vaccine .
While it costs something to manufacture physical vaccines and mail them to everybody in the world , sharing the information behind it is free .
Others can chose whether or not they want to invest money in creating their own , but sharing has given them the option to do so where before it did not exist .
Faced with this situation , who would chose to let thousands of people perish by denying them even the potential opportunity to save themselves ?
Yet this is exactly the choice many people are making in the name of " intellectual property . "
They would rather see others suffer than share something infinite with them , desperately clinging to business models that depend on scarcity .
In the 21st century , ideas , information , digitized content are all infinitely available .
For these things , the Star Trek replicator has been made , and it 's time to use that as a stepping stone to greater things .
Faced with an infinite supply of information that can potentially benefit billions of people , I chose to share .
Those who try to hoard this information are both attempting to drink the ocean and doing wrong .

I 've discussed in the past the question of whether or not there 's even a moral question to consider when it comes to copyright , if you can first show a situation where everyone is better off ( i.e. , if the end result of content being shared , willingly , is better for both the content creators and consumers , why should morals even be a question ? ) .
Separately , I have made clear that I do not engage in any sort of unauthorized file sharing -- noting that it is illegal and , I personally believe , wrong .
Some people have pushed back on that latter point , suggesting that my labeling it as " wrong " is , in fact , a moral statement as well .
A couple months ago ( yes , I 'm slow , but I 'm catching up on some old " saved " submissions ) , SteelWolf sent over some thoughts on why file sharing is not wrong , and why there 's actually a moral argument in favor of sharing
On this , I absolutely agree -- but it is much more the argument for why the content creators themselves should share their content first .
And that 's where things get tricky .
I do think it makes sense to share content .
I think that content creators would find themselves better off if they share their works ( and do so strategically , in combination with a business plan that takes advantage of it ) .
But what if the original creator does n't want the content shared ?
Then what ?
SteelWolf argues that there 's a moral imperative to share , but again , this seems to apply more to the content creator , than those downstream :
While I think this is interesting , and at times compelling , in the end I 'm still not convinced there 's a moral component here , potentially for the creator / innovator .
But , at the same time , I still believe that we 're better off taking the moral discussion out of it .
Perhaps a moral argument like the one above is helpful to convince some , but it leads right back to the economic discussion , where some will ask why anyone would bother in the first place , if they 're just told they need to give it away for moral reasons .
Instead , I 'm more convinced by economic arguments that show greater opportunity in sharing infinite goods , in that it decreases the cost of creation , promotion and distribution , while making it easier reach a larger audience for selling scarce products .
Again , if you can make the economic argument , and then throw in the moral benefits of spreading information on top of it , that makes sense .
But a purely moral argument still falls a bit short for me .
Still , I 'm sure it will lead to an interesting discussion here .

I find most cornbread to be very sweet .
This one is grainy and savory , and the stuffing I make with it is my favorite .
This is easily doubled for a larger quantity of stuffing .
Bake it in a 3 - quart baking dish ( it will take about 45 to 50 minutes ) or in two 9 - inch pans .

One atheist 's musing on the nature of belief , the reasons for atheism , and general topics of interest .
Nothing is more universally reviled than a smash to the goodies .
Man , woman , child or senior , if something messes up your junk , you are not happy about it .
And , curiously , everyone else will laugh .
But sometimes injuries come along that are so harrowing , it ’s hard to find the humor in them at all .
Not impossible , just hard .
Like these ;
Raccoon
Nothing is quite as relaxing as getting back to nature .
Heading out to the woods with some friends for a bush bash , some beers , some music and all the raccoons you can sexually abuse .
If something there sounded slightly amiss to you , then you are not Alexander Kirilov , a 44 year old man who got all shitfaced on a weekend getaway with some friends , saw a raccoon wandering about and doing what raccoons do and in a move strictly contradictory to what good sense may tell you about both raccoons and sexual encounters , depantsed and tried to make a man out of that little woodland creature .
The raccoon , whose mind could very likely not even come close to fathoming just how fucked up a situation it had involuntarily just become a part of , did what most of us would do when set upon by a nude , drunken , amorous Russian .
He bit his dick off .
Surgeons would later attempt to reconstruct as much as they could but the raccoon was unfortunately not available for comment or to return several pieces so Alex is going to have to live the rest of his life with a stubby .
Water Fountain
Who does n’t love those water fountains that shoot jets of water up from the ground as though the earth itself was jizzing all over you as you frolic and play in the spray ?
The answer is a 19 year old woman named Yang who ripped herself from crotch to halfway up her stomach .
While she was playing in a fountain in the Henan Province of China with some friends , avoiding some small jets , no one had bothered to inform them that amongst the tiny jets was one rigged to some manner of jet engine that erupted with enough force to actually send Yang flying into the air .
When she hit ground , bleeding profusely , she had to be taken to hospital where it was discovered the force of the water had ripped her from her vagina up to her stomach , damaging her intestines .
The injuries were so severe it took 7 months and three surgeries to recover which still left her with some intense scars .
And that is why we refuse to let any employees pleasure themselves with a garden hose at work anymore .
It ’s just not safe .
Toilet Seats
Getting your junk smashed is never good , and for that reason it ’s best to keep your junk away from smashing things .
You do n’t blacksmith while pantsless , you do n’t bash someone ’s head in a car door with your drawers down and you do n’t ever play whack - a- mole while having sex unless you have proper safety equipment .
All of this should keep you safe .
It should .
Unfortunately , every day we put our wang near the deadly jaws of smashitude when we lift the seat to pee .
For most of us this is n’t an issue , but when you ’re three feet tall and just learning to use the toilet , that big , gaping maw of piss - smelling destruction is as dangerous as any delicious - looking drain cleanser or fun - time farm equipment .
Doctors from the UK have recorded as many as 250 cases per year of kids coming in with smashed junk thanks to heavy wood or ceramic seats trying to eat the twig off of little guys who have to stand close to the bowl .
Bottles
Who amongst has n’t suffered through a particularly lonely spell and , one day whilst in the shower , looked at the shampoo bottle and thought “ I could make a woman out of that ? ”
It ’s perfectly natural in a bizarre , lonely , unnatural way .
A gentleman in Singapore had a similar thought only he decided he wanted to join the Pepsi Generation ( or maybe Fanta , we ’re not judging , you hump whatever bottles turn you on ) .
The 77 year old man , who we assume was old and withered enough to believe that no one beyond a pop bottle would ever want him , decided to use one for his pleasure .
So he jammed his tool home and , at some point soon after , discovered that not all entrances are exits .
So basically we ’re talking about a senior citizen with his dick stuck in a Coke bottle .
Eventually he sought medical help and the bottle was cut away , however severe inflammation had already set in causing an inability to urinate .
And that alone is pretty shitty , having to get a bottle cut off your wang and then have to endure whiz pain , but the complications in this case were so severe they piled up until the man went into heart failure and died .
Glue ( and / or Vacuum )
You can only expect so much from a man known as Captain Dan the Demon Dwarf , but still , some things defy logic for even the most ridiculous amongst us .
Captain Dan , a dwarf performer in circus , had to get on stage and do his act .
Naturally , in keeping with the dignity displayed by all little people in show business , part of his act included pretending to get his junk stuck in a vacuum .
However , the apparatus that allowed the gimmick to work failed so the demon dwarf had to improvise by using glue to hold it together .
It ’s at this point you should remember those safety videos from when you were a kid that featured Peter , the Penis Protecting Polar Bear , who always warned you to never glue your penis inside a vacuum .
The result was exactly what you think the result was .
Captain Dan ’s wang was glued inside a vacuum .
This lead to him being wheeled to a hospital where efforts were made to remove the tool from his tool and probably created a legendary story that ER staff stillt ell to this day .
Mouse Trap
Since sometime in the late 90’s , it ’s been a good rule of thumb to never let your genitals get near Johnny Knoxville .
In the early 90’s it was probably cool , but not anymore .
Sadly , Perry Caravello did n’t get that memo .
In 2007 , Caravello sued Knoxville , along with Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla , for getting his junk stuck in a mouse trap and not paying him $ 10 million for it .
If that were the price for a penis mouse trapping , more people would probably be doing it , but Caravello was a special case .
If you ’ve seen the movie Windy City Heat then all of this may be familiar to you , but it was n’t and probably still is n’t to Caravello , a very naïve man who may or may not have suffered some brain damage earlier in his life ( that is n’t even a joke ) .
Caravello was the victim of a massive prank in that the movie Windy City Heat was all a joke played on him by Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla .
Drugs
This may come as a surprise to you , but cocaine and your penis are not friends .
Indeed , it sounds bizarre but thanks to the efforts of one desperately insane man we now know that injecting coke directly into your urinary tract is far more dangerous than that sentence implies on the surface .
Apparently seeking a way to make drug use more life destroying , this dude just jammed his weiner full of the stuff in an effort to improve sexual performance , because Viagra is for chumps .
This lead to severe bleeding and a painful , three day erection .
After three days in the hospital he lost his erection , probably because Satan arrived and made him pay for his transgressions .
Massive blood leakage caused blood to coagulate under the skin in his feet , hands , genitals , back and chest .
It was under his skin .
Like evil , only born from dick .
This caused his tissue to start dying .
Due to the massive tissue damage he was transferred to a burn unit where they amputated 9 fingers , parts of his legs and , finally , his penis .
If you take home no other lessons today ( besides not to hump raccoons ) it ’s that you should n’t inject drugs into your penis .
During a radio show with the three comedians to promote the film , Caravello says he was promised $ 10 million for putting his unit in the trap .
Naturally the trap went off .
No money was exchanged .
Caravello sued .
It went nowhere .
Let that be a lesson to us all to never trust a man who causes pain for laughs .

The Greatest SEO Myths of Our Century Exposed – Part 1

SEO Myths Exposed
This post is part 1 of 2 in the series ...
Ok , SEO did n’t exist way back when .
It ’s a modern day concept that only exists due to the existence of computers .
But , it is widely misunderstood , even though it ’s very much a part of this century .
SEO is definitely one of my favorite topics to discuss .
Actually , discussing it makes up much of what we Internet marketers know about it – talking with others , learning from experience and debating specific issues .
Since Google and other Search Engines can’t fill us in with all the details , we , as a community , must learn together .
After almost 5 years of learning about and applying Search Engine Optimization to various websites , I ’ve come across lots of myths and theories regarding SEO , which makes sense due to the Search Engines ’ secrecy policies .
From my experience , I ’ve found some of these myths to be true while others seem to come from left field .
Before you dive into optimizing your website , why do n’t we take a look at the misconceptions and facts surrounding search engine optimization .
Hopefully , this will arm you with the knowledge you need to truly dominate the search engines !
WARNING : Some of these topics are still up for debate .
This post centers on my own experience .
SEO is Risky Business
I ’m astonished by the amount of people who are honestly scared of optimizing their websites .
For some reason , many people consider SEO to be a “ tactic ” that was created by spammers or black hat artists .
The idea is that it goes against Search Engines ’ policies and is a way of dodging the system .
So , is this true ?
Do you risk being banned by Search Engines if you use SEO ?
TRUTH : SEO is NOT risky .
Black Hat SEO tactics ARE .
Yes , Search Engines will ban websites if they appear to be utilizing tactics that go against their policies .
But , you should have NO FEAR of such a punishment if you conduct SEO appropriately ( the way it is supposed to be used ) .
Without SEO , search engines would be empty – or at least the search results would be completely irrelevant to the user .
Search Engines actually RELY on SEO to explain to them what a website is about .
Whether it ’s through the keywords found in the content of your website , the title and Meta Tags used or the inbound links you receive , Search Engines view this data and rank you based on how relevant your website is to a particular search term .
So , the actual risk here is losing rankings by NOT optimizing your website !
All SEO is Black Hat
Is every SEO technique against Search Engines ’ policies ?
If you conduct SEO , will you be a Black Hat artist ?
TRUTH : SEO is made up of both White Hat and Black Hat techniques .
So , what are Black Hat and White Hat techniques ?
Black Hat SEO : Tactics that go against Search Engines ’ policies .
White Hat SEO ( or just SEO ) : Optimization methods that help Search Engines understand what your website is about .
Did you know Google offers its own report on SEO ?
It ’s called “ Google ’s Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide ” and it ’s filled with useful information about how to optimize your website .
Some of the topics discussed within their report include :
Creating Title Tags
Using the Description Meta Tag
Using Words in Your URLs
Using Relevant Keywords in Your Content
Do these topics look familiar ?
They should as they ’re the fundamentals of SEO .
As long as you follow the rules that are literally OUTLINED for you by the Search Engines , you will avoid ever appearing to be a black hat artist .
SEO Has Nothing to Do With Content
So many people consider SEO to be a technical process , one that is focused on website code , Meta Tags and Inbound Links and has nothing to do with content .
Is this true ?
TRUTH : SEO is ALL ABOUT content .
What are Meta Tags and Inbound Links made up of ?
CONTENT !
What is a website made up of ?
CONTENT !
Content is the key to optimizing a website .
Whether it be through the text used in Inbound Links or Meta Tags , or the keywords found sprinkled throughout your website , content is what Search Engines analyze to determine what your site is relevant to .
Without content , you ’re unlikely to gain any search rankings .
Your Content Should Focus on Search Engines , Not Visitors
It ’s easy to think that your content should be filled to the max with your keywords , or that your website should cater to the all - powerful Search Engines .
After all , that ’s how they will rank you , right ?
TRUTH : If you write for visitors , your content will be “ naturally optimized ” for search engine rankings .
Never write for Search Engines !
I could write an entire post about this one topic , but let me try to summarize it here …
Who uses search engines ?
Your potential visitors .
How will they find you ?
By typing in a keyword ( search term ) .
What will the results be ?
Websites Search Engines feel are relevant to the USER ’S search term .
We seem to always jump to number three in this list and assume that our content needs to be focused on the search engine in this scenario when in fact the USER ( potential visitor ) is our key to SEO .
The user is the one who thinks up a keyword to search for .
The user is the one who will analyze the results and click on a website they feel is relevant .
The user is the person we are trying to connect with .
Therefore , the user is KING .
This is why we conduct keyword research , right ?
To figure out what users are searching for ?
Once we create a list of good keywords , we write blog posts about these topics or offer products related to those search terms .
The only time Search Engines come into play here is when we need to let them know that our website is relevant to this user ’s search term .
If we ’ve written our content specifically for the user and their needs ( search terms ) , our content will be naturally optimized for rankings .
It ’s as simple as that .
If , however , we write our content for search engines , users will gain little value from it .
It comes down to this – do you want traffic or do you want targeted traffic ?
Do you want visitors or do you want customers ?
If you ’re writing for the user , your content or products should naturally contain keywords they ’re searching for .
You Can Over -Optimize
Speaking of content , is it possible to actually over - optimize a website ?
Can we take SEO too far ?
TRUTH : Yes , you CAN over - optimize .
The best example of over - optimization is what ’s called “ keyword stuffing . ”
Let ’s take a look at over - optimized content versus natural content …
A. Over -Optimized :
“ Welcome to our Home Décor Store !
Home décor is what we sell .
If you ’re looking for home décor , you will find it here in our home décor store .
Enjoy shopping for home décor ! ”
Number of Times Keyword is Used : 5
Ratio of Keyword to Other Text : 18 %
B. Naturally Optimized :
“ Welcome to Keller ’s Home Décor Online Shop !
Whether you ’re interested in adding a few new pieces to your exiting décor , or starting fresh with a brand new home décor collection , we ’re here to help . ”
Number of Times Keyword is Used : 3
Ratio of Keyword to Other Text : 11 %
Problems with Keyword Stuffing :
A Search Engine can tell when “ keyword stuffing ” has occurred in content and will usually penalize a site for such practices .
There are many theories on what percentage of your content should be made up of keywords , but the best practice seems to be keeping it low ( 5 - 10 % ) .
.
There are many theories on what percentage of your content should be made up of keywords , but the best practice seems to be keeping it low ( 5 - 10 % ) .
Is a potential customer more likely to buy from website A or B ? Probably B as it speaks to them , not to Search Engines .
If you write your content the way you speak to people , you wo n’t need to worry about keyword stuffing .
Write as if you ’re talking to someone .
If you write your content the way you speak to people , you wo n’t need to worry about keyword stuffing .
Write as if you ’re talking to someone .
Other Forms of Over-Optimization Include :
Building tons of inbound links , each containing the exact same anchor text .
Stuffing keywords into Meta Tags .
Writing hidden text for Search Engines ( making certain content white on a white background ) .
Listing keywords over and over again on a page .
Writing in a way that your content provides no value to your visitors .
Set It and Forget It
This is probably the biggest misperception website owners have about SEO .
When you ’re new to this world , you may think SEO is a one - time activity – set it and forget it .
TRUTH : SEO is an ONGOING process .
SEO will be a key activity for a website for as long as that website exists .
Though some activities may only need to be performed annually , others are needed daily .
For example , you may want to update your keywords and Meta Tags annually or semi-annually to ensure you ’re targeting current searches .
However , writing fresh and optimized content is a weekly ( or better yet , daily ) activity .
If you truly want to optimize your website and continue to maintain or obtain search rankings , you ’re in this for the long haul .

The producers had told her that she did n’t have to do anything she was n’t comfortable doing .
She told them she did n’t want to sing or dance ( which has been the salvation for female guest hosts like Catherine Zeta - Jones , Anne Hathaway and Scarlett Johansson ) , and the writers of her opening monologue were having trouble coming up with a premise that pleased her .
“ There ’s one specific pitch that we ca n’t do , ” Fox said .
‘ They wanted me to do a Q. and A. with the audience for the opening monologue .
And Hitler is in the audience .
Hitler stands up and says , ‘ Why did you compare me to Michael Bay ? ’ ” Fox laughed .
“ Which is funny , but we ca n’t do that . ”
Giving hope to men everywhere , Fox told Cosmopolitan magazine that her ideal date would be “ a sexy sandwich ” with Andy Samberg and the roly - poly comedian Jonah Hill , so Samberg thought about recreating that image for the monologue .
That idea was also nixed .
It was the day before the show , and the monologue still was n’t written .
On the set , Fox , in her usual uniform of leggings , low - cut T - shirt and long cardigan , was practicing her lines , which were in Russian .
In a strange way , “ S.N.L. , ” which required her to play seven different characters , was more acting than Fox has done in her entire career .
“ I ’m not one of these people who grew up studying acting or went to theater school , ” Fox told me at the hotel .
“ I do n’t know if I ’m talented , I do n’t know what I can do or ca n’t do .
I had no skills at all .
As a child , I had it in my head that I was supposed to be doing this , and then I did it .
But I did n’t know what I was doing . ”
Fox was born in Oak Ridge , Tenn .
Her mom , who Fox claims looks exactly like her , separated from her father , who was a parole officer , when she was 3 and eventually divorced him .
She then married a much older man , who moved the family to Port St. Lucie , Fla .
Fox ’s stepfather was very strict .
He was religious , and Fox grew up Pentecostal and attended a Christian high school .
“ I was always alone , ” she recalled .
“ I withdrew .
But I wanted to be an actress from the time I was 2 .
My mom said it was the only thing I ever said I wanted to do .
When I was 4 or 5 , I watched ‘ The Wizard of Oz , ’ and for a year , I asked her to call me Dorothy .
When my mom explained to me that Dorothy was not real , that an actress plays her , I decided I wanted to be an actress . ”
She modeled briefly in catalogs , and when she was 15 , an agent sent her on an audition to be an extra in “ Bad Boys II , ” directed by Michael Bay , which was shooting in Florida .
“ They put me in six - inch heels and a stars - and - stripes bikini , ” Fox said .
“ Sent me to Michael .
He approved me .
Then they put me in the scene under a waterfall .
You got $ 500 extra if you were willing to get wet , and I was thrilled to get wet .
I was still a child , but for those two days I was being treated like a grown woman .
I felt like I should be in a bikini dancing under a waterfall : that is where I thought I belonged . ”
From an early age , Fox was restless .
At 14 , she regularly stole her mother ’s car and was constantly punished , which only made her more rebellious .
“ I was always trying to get away , ” Fox said .
“ I hated authority figures telling me what to do .
They wanted me to be conservative , but when I was a kid , I was obsessed with looking like Barbie .
I was wearing the smallest clothes I could find .
My mom would n’t let me dye my hair blond , but I used Sun - In , and I had orange hair for two years .
What can I say ?
It was Florida .
But my mom was right : being brunette was the one thing that made me memorable .
I did n’t look like anybody else .
So I clung to that . ”
Her first acting role was in “ Holiday in the Sun , ” an Olsen twins film that went straight to DVD .
By 15 , she persuaded her mother to take her to Los Angeles for pilot season , where the television networks cast their new shows .
At 17 , she moved to L.A. and landed the role of Lindsay Lohan ’s enemy in Disney ’s “ Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen . ”
“ I played the bitch , of course , ” Fox recalled .
“ I was always cast as the bitch .
The light - haired girl is the sweet leading lady , and the dark girl is the sexy bitch . ”
She paused .
“ I did n’t know how to act when I did that movie .
I just mimicked all the bitches I ’d seen other people play on TV . ”
By 18 , Fox was on her own .
Her mother went back to Florida , and Fox moved to New York to co-star on “ Hope & Faith , ” which taped in Queens .
The comedy , which ran for three seasons , was about mismatched sisters and was shot in New York to accommodate the schedule of one of its stars , Kelly Ripa .
“ I had two lines a show , ” Fox said , “ but I was working , so I was happy . ”
One week , Brian Austin Green , who was part of the original cast of “ Beverly Hills , 90210 ” ( he played David Silver ) , was scheduled to appear as a guest star .
“ He played himself , ” Fox recalled .
“ Kelly Ripa ’s character was kidnapping him for some crazy reason .
I did n’t know who he was from ‘ 90210 , ’ but I liked him right away .
Everyone was around the monitor watching a scene , and Brian accidentally touched my leg .
I remember literal electricity shooting through me and out me from every direction .
It was like magic . ”
The original Assassin ’s Creed launched without a demo much to the dismay of gamers everywhere .
Now that the new IP is established , surely there would be a demo for Assassin ’s Creed II to whet the appetite of fans ?
Think again .
Perhaps as a bid of confidence from Ubisoft , it has been revealed during the recent Eurogamer Expo that the sequel to this popular franchise will not see the release of a demo version .
The original game sold around 8 million copies worldwide , so is Ubisoft ’s confidence well - deserved ?
If sales for the sequel slump then perhaps we may see a demo , but this game will ship without a demo version to accompany it on November 17th ( 20th in Europe ) .

Advertisement A bomb blast caused the Russian train crash in which at least 26 people were killed , intelligence officials say .
The Nevsky Express derailed with nearly 700 on board as it ran through remote countryside between the capital Moscow and the second city , St Petersburg .
Investigators found " elements of an explosive device " at the scene of Friday 's attack , a statement said .
Officials said a second , less powerful device went off on Saturday near the site of the first , but no - one was hurt .
There was no immediate confirmed claim of responsibility for the blast on Friday evening , which hit a train popular with government officials and business executives at peak travel time .
" Criminology experts say , on the basis of preliminary information , that an improvised explosive device , equivalent to 7kg ( 15 lb ) of TNT , had gone off , " said Alexander Bortnikov , head of Russia 's domestic intelligence service .
At least three of the 14 carriages left the tracks as the train reportedly approached speeds up 200 km/h ( 130 m ph ) .
Russia 's prosecutor - general has opened a criminal case on terrorism charges , Russian news agencies say .
If terrorism is confirmed as the cause , observers say the derailment would represent the deadliest attack outside the volatile North Caucasus region for five years .
' Attack on elite ' I think we can expect the Russian authorities to come up with some name soon , because this attack is politically very embarrassing
Pavel Felgenhauer
Novaya Gazeta newspaper Pavel Felgenhauer , defence correspondent for Russia 's Novaya Gazeta newspaper , told the BBC News website the key suspects for investigators would be " either militants from Russia 's North Caucasus region or nationalist extremists , pro-Nazi groups " .
" I think we can expect the Russian authorities to come up with some names soon , because this attack is politically very embarrassing .
" This is an expensive , high speed train , used by an elite which has been pushing to transfer parts of government functions to St Petersburg .
We already have reports of several high - ranking government and local officials among the dead .
" Whoever is responsible , this attack clearly seems aimed not so much at the public , but directly at the ruling class . "
' Loud bang '
Hundreds of rescuers and officials worked through the night at the scene near the town of Bologoye , about 400 km ( 250 miles ) north - west of Moscow .
Some reports say as many as 39 people have died .
The train was reported to be carrying around 650 passengers and two dozen or so staff .
About 90 people are in hospital , some taken there by helicopter .
Many of the injured are said to be in a serious condition .
According to some reports , the scene of the crash , in wooded countryside , was so remote it took emergency services two hours to get there .
Passengers spoke of a loud bang just before the derailment .
Russian television channels broadcast a recording of a mobile phone call from the train driver to the emergencies ministry .
" There was an explosion under the locomotive , " he said .
" I do not know what we hit .
We are derailed .
The locomotive and carriages , I do not know yet what else , everything is in smoke .
" Federal prosecutors ' spokesman Vladimir Markin told Itar - Tass news agency that a crater found at the site was 1.5 m ( 5 ft ) wide and 0.7 m deep .
" Indeed this was a terrorist attack , " he said .
In 2007 , a bomb on the same line derailed a train , injuring nearly 30 passengers .
Two men suspected of having links to Chechen rebels were accused of planting a bomb next to the track .

In recent posts I ’ve been arguing a lot with various strands of Free Market Anarchists on the benefits of using such a free market approach and on trusting in them to achieve a better result for the society .
The more I discuss , the more it dawns to me that there is a fundamental distinction between them and it basically relates to the reasons why one embraced Free Market Anarchy as a social theory .
The way I see it , there are two different reasons why one can end up being a Market Anarchist .
Free Markets are the best way to achieve liberty .
Liberty is the Free Markets .
Proponents of the first type are generally the ones who are far more interested in achieving the most personal liberty rather than in the specific system they will use to do so .
This is the utilitarian perspective which considers that the best result for humanity as a whole is by maximizing each person ’s individual liberty and are under the belief that free markets facilitate exactly that .
I generally have no problem with this type of Market Anarchist as sooner or later they will come to the conclusion that the best way to maximize individual liberty is by achieving egalitarianism as well and thus turn socialist .
This seems to be the way most Mutualists I ’ve spoken with think of it at least .
In short , for the first type , Liberty and by necessary extension Equality are the most important part , the end goal .
The Free Markets are merely the best way they believe we have to achieve this result .
Such a perspective is open minded .
Given enough arguments and solid criticism showing that the free markets cannot , in fact , achieve this goal , that person will discard this belief and embrace something that can .
That is not to say that all will , but the fact that they are open about it is what will facilitate dialogue and constructive discussion .
It is the second path to Free Market Anarchism that I find flawed .
The latter type are nominally for liberty as well but they have a very distorted view of it .
One seems to start again from questing for the best way to achieve liberty but then somehow is quickly immersed in Free Market rhetoric from the likes of the Austrian school of Economics .
Using theoretical proofs of “ working ( propertarian ) free markets ” based on pure logic and unrealistic assumptions , the concept of liberty is conflated with the concept of propertarian free markets .
It becomes dogma .
The original question of “ what maximizes liberty ? ” is forgotten .
All arguing commences from the position “ Libertarianism is the Free Markets ” which ends up misrepresenting the position of anyone who argues against this as authoritarian and easily devolves into flamewars .
Even worse , when the logical consequences of such a perspective are pointed out as non-libertarian , an extreme rationalization kicks in to turn black into white .
“ It ’s libertarian as long as it ’s voluntary “ , “ It ’s libertarian if no fraud or violence is involved . ” etc etc .
It is through such a distortion that the clear , authoritarian nature of a hierarchical relationship such as the one between boss and wage - worker can be rationalized away as “ libertarian ” , even though the worker maintains no freedom while working .
It is through such a distortion that voluntary slavery can be defended as “ libertarian . ”
If the original question is brought up again , if the original economic assumptions are challenged , I very often receive a fallacious responses of a religious fervor .
The most common being an argument from authority , most usually the authority of the Austrian school of economics naturally .
When that fails , the most common fallback arguments I see is either the abstraction of the free market to the irrelevant or the trounce card of arguing for private property rights ( and by extension Free markets to control distribution ) via the Natural Law concept .
So the main difference between these two paths to Market Anarchism can be separated between Utilitarian and Ideological perspective .
The Utilitarian perspective starts from the trying to achieve a utilitarian result , discovers that maximizing liberty is a necessary part of it and considers that free market anarchism is the best way to achieve this .
The ideological perspective on the other hand starts from various asserted axioms , eg “ Private Property rights are an objective reality ” , “ The Non-Aggression principle leads to greater liberty ” , “ Free Markets are Pareto Efficient ” etc and finds that Free Market Anti-Statism is the ideology that brings them all together in one package .
Thus , whatever the practical result of such a Free Market Anti-Statism might be is irrelevant as it has already been defined to be “ Libertarian . ”
And it is this exact reason why I often find it so frustrating to discuss with ( or even read ) the latter type of Market Anarchist , as something that is obviously authoritarian or exploitative in nature is ignored at best ( “ It can only happen via the state ” ) or defended at worst ( Slave Contracts ) .
But there is one particular argument I hear from the ideological market anarchist .
When I point to a very possible authoritarian result of propertarian markets , such as sexual harassment in the workplace , crypto- feudalism or simply widespread wage - slavery , a common response ( right after defending it as “ voluntary ” ) is to claim “ Oh that would probably never happen without the state anyway ” .
But then I have to ask :
Why do you care about that ?
Whether that comes to be or not should not matter at all as long as it is the result of the “ free market ” should it ?
In these market anarchists I see a strained dualism , where that person really wants to have a generally libertarian society , where hierarchy and authority are minimal if not abolished but at the other hand , just cannot bring themselves to consider discarding the propertarian free markets concept as all .
It manifests itself in expressions such as “ Certainly the worker has to sacrifice his liberty as a wage - slave and certainly sweatshop wage - slavery is not a good result but in a truly free market , the increased competition would give all workers such a competitive advantage that sweatshops could never exist and most people would be able to be self - employed if they really wanted to . ”
If you would not like to see widespread wage - slavery , propertarian feudalism , hierarchy from 3rd institutions etc then why do you not start from this position in the first place ?
Why do n’t you start by considering a socioeconomic system which would make such possibilities systematically impossible .
Perhaps this will be possible via the free markets .
Perhaps you ’ll have to abolish private property .
Perhaps you ’ll have to move away from the markets altogether .
But as long as your basic results are achieved , you should n’t care anyway , right ?

Bei der Linkbuilding - Strategie handelt es sich um einen Teilbereich der SEO - Strategie für eine Webseite .
Mit der Linkbuilding - Strategie wird insbesondere der Bereich Backlinks abgedeckt , der nach wie vor entscheidend für die Umsetzung einer erfolgreichen SEO - Strategie ist .
Das gilt insbesondere für Seiten aus jenen Nischen , in welchen der Wettbewerb groß ist .
Wie gut ist die Seite „ OnPage “ aufgestellt ?
Bevor sich ein Seitenbetreiber um das Thema Linkbuilding Gedanken macht , sollte er zunächst einmal überprüfen , wie gut die Seite OnPage gegenüber der Konkurrenz aufgestellt ist .
Dazu gehören Aspekte wie qualitativ hochwertiger Inhalt , die Ausstiegsraten der Seitenbesucher und die Frage , wie gut die Keywords eingebunden sind , beziehungsweise , wie gut die Seite technisch umgesetzt werden .
Zunächst einmal sollte sich der Seitenbetreiber also erst einmal auf die OnPage - Optimierung konzentrieren , bevor er das Linkbuilding angeht , dazu im Blog mehr .
Denn wenn diese Voraussetzung nicht erfüllt ist , hält sich der Erfolg auch beim Linkbuilding in einem überschaubaren Rahmen .
Das ist für erfolgreiches Linkbuilding wichtig
Seitenbetreiber müssen zunächst einmal eine sorgfältige Bestandsaufnahme vornehmen und ihre Ziele definieren , damit die Linkbuilding - Strategie auch von Erfolg gekrönt wird .
Unter anderem ist in diesem Zusammenhang eine klare Definition der wichtigsten Keywords besonders wichtig .
Natürlich braucht der Aufbau eines nachhaltigen Rankings auch seine Zeit .
Um dies schneller zu erreichen , empfiehlt es sich unter Umständen , zunächst einmal Unterseiten weiter zu stärken , die bereits ein hohes Ranking aufweisen und nicht allzu viele Mitbewerber im Netz haben .
Damit lassen sich auch kurzfristig Erfolge erreichen , die dem Seitenbetreiber ein Umsatzplus bescheren .
Damit das Linkbuilding möglichst effizient gestaltet werden kann , ist es zunächst einmal notwendig , eine gründliche Wettbewerbsanalyse durchzuführen .
Dabei werden vor allem die Linkprofile jener Seiten genauer unter die Lupe genommen , die für die wichtigsten Keywords bereits ein Ranking auf den vorderen Plätzen erreicht haben .
Der Grund : Dadurch lässt sich ermitteln , welche
Art von Links für die Webseite interessant sein könnten und wie viele Links überhaupt benötigt werden .
You need to do what your heart is telling you to do .
If marrying this man is more important that keeping the peace with your family , then you should do it and hope that your family will get on board gradually .
A parent 's love for his or her child is stronger than their disapproval of that child 's choices .
On the other hand , make quite sure that this man is very much worth the family trauma marrying him will cause .
Ask yourself these questions ;
1 ) Are you in the " first blush " of the relationship ?
If you have n't been together for very long it is possible that your attachment will fade .
In this case , give yourself a long engagement rather than a fast wedding .
2 ) Can you really deal with living for he rest of your life in the role you are playing right now ?
Are you passive in the relationship right now ?
Do you ever feel uncomfortable in that position ?
Would he be flexible and grow with any changes that may develop in your personality over the years ?
3 ) Do you approve of the way he and his father treat his mother ?
This is a very good indication of how you will also be treated after a long marriage .
4 ) Does he say ugly things or behave rudely to your own family ?
If he harbors a lack of respect for your family , those feelings can leach into his behavior towards you .
5 ) Have you both discussed important issues ?
How will birthdays / holidays be dealt with ?
Will there be children planned ?
What religion will those children be raised in ?
Who will be responsible for the money in the family , for being primary caregiver for any children ?
These are questions that are best hashed out BEFORE the wedding takes place !
If you can ask yourself these questions honestly and still feel comfortable and connected with your man , he is probably worth the unpleasantness between your family and yourself .
If you are uncomfortable with even one answer , you may want to seek some serious counseling .
And remember , as I said , your family may well come around in time .
They want what is best for you , if your man can prove he is the best for you , they will be happy .
Following Zakheim and Pentagon trillions to Israel and 9 - 11
By Jerry Mazza
Online Journal Associate Editor
Jul 31 , 2006 , 00:19
Think of this as part two of Recherche du trillions perdu , my Online Journal article on Dov Zakheim , former Bush appointee as Pentagon Comptroller from May 4 , 2001 to March 10 , 2004 .
At that time he was unable to explain the disappearance of $ 1 trillion dollars .
Actually , nearly three years earlier , Donald Rumsfeld announced on September 10 , 2001 that an audit discovered $ 2.3 trillion was also missing from the Pentagon books .
That story , as I mentioned , was buried under 9 - 11 ’s rubble .
The two sums disappeared on Zakheim ’s watch .
Yet on May 6 , 2004 , Zakheim took a lucrative position at Booz Allen Hamilton , one of the most prestigious strategy consulting firms in the world .
One of its clients then was Blessed Relief , a charity said to be a front for Osama bin Laden .
Booz , Allen & Hamilton then also worked closely with DARPA , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which is the research arm of the Department of Defense .
So the dark card was shifted to another part of the deck .
Judicial Inc ’s bio of Dov ( linked below ) tells us Zakheim was / is a dual Israeli / American citizen and an ordained rabbi and had been tracking the halls of US government for 25 years , casting defense policy and influence on Presidents Reagan , Clinton , Bush Sr. and Bush Jr . He is , as I described him earlier , the bionic Zionist .
In fact , Judicial Inc points out that most of Israel ’s armaments were gotten thanks to him .
Squads of US F - 16 and F - 15 were classified military surplus and sold to Israel at a fraction of their value .
Judicial Inc also points out that Israel , a country of 4.8 million Russian and Polish Jewish émigrés , flies on one of the biggest Air Forces in the world , thanks to Dov. Conflict of interest here ?
Depends on what you ’re interested in .
That is , in 2001 Dov was CEO of SPS International , part of System Planning Corporation , a defense contractor majoring in electronic warfare technologies , including remote - controlled aircraft systems , and the notorious Flight Termination System ( FTS ) technology that could hijack even a hijacked plane and land or crash it wherever .
More from the resume : Wikipedia points out that Zakheim is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and in 2000 a co-author of the Project for the New American Century ’s position paper , Rebuilding America ’s Defenses , advocating the necessity for a Pearl - Harbor - like incident to mobilize the country into war with its enemies , mostly Middle Eastern Muslim nations .
As to Dov ’s hell - raiser lineage , Judicial Inc points out that Grandpa Zakheim was born in 1870 , Julius Zakheim ( Zhabinka ) , in the Ukraine , a Russian rabbi who married a relative of Karl Marx .
He was a Menshevik / Bolshevik and played a leading role in the 1905 turmoil that paved the way for the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution .
The Bolshevik master plan called for the state of Israel , which was chosen for its proximity to the world 's oil and an area of religious significance .
Dov ’s Father , Rabbi Jacob I. Zakheim was born in 1910 and reared in Poland ’s swarm of Zionist hard guys , read assassins and bombers .
His Polish town , near Bilaystok , also brought us Yitzhak Shir , and family friends included Menachem Begin and Moshe Arens .
Dov ’s father was an active member of Betar , formed in 1923 in Riga , Latvia .
Its goal was to control the Middle East ( and its oil ) .
It was known that the Jewish people needed their own country and they chose Palestine and claimed it a Jewish state “ on both sides of the Jordan . ”
Betar was in essence a terrorist organization formed because Zionists were sick of being chased from and arrested in country after country .
They wanted both a place to escape and a base for their power .
Betar joined forces with the Haganah , Irgun , and Stern gangs .
With no prospect of a Jewish state in sight , they argued that armed struggle against the British was the only way .
Since Britain occupied Palestine and was containing them they went on a blood feast of bombings that killed hundreds of British soldiers .
The British pulled out , but the Zionists continue to maul the Arabs to this day .
For a concise history on the Formation of Israel in 1947 , I suggest this link to theocracywatch.org .
For an interesting look at “ The United States and the Recognition of Israel : A Chronology ” compiled from Harry S. Truman and the Founding of Israel by Michael T. Benson , link above .
For a rounded look at Israel , see Wikipedia .
Returning to Dov : he was born in Brooklyn in 1943 and attended exclusive Jewish schools , spent summers in Israel Zionist camps , which trained the Zionists of the future .
As to Dov ’s formal education , he graduated from Columbia University in 1970 and the University of Oxford in 1972 .
From 1973 to 75 , he attended the London school of Jewish studies , described as a “ Harry Potter ” type cauldron ; among the subjects Jewish supremacy , Advanced Bible , Talmud , Jewish Mysticism , Holocaust , Anglo - Judaica , and Zionism .
After , he was ordained a Rabbi .
From 1975 to 80 , Zakheim was an adjunct professor at the National War College , Yeshiva University , Columbia University and Trinity College , Hartford , Connecticut .
As he stepped into the Reagan administration , he talked them into funding development of the Lavi Fighter at a cost of $ 3 billion .
The Lavi was a total flop and Israel dropped it , though it owed $ 450 million in contract fees that were cancelled .
Israel , according to Judicial Inc , also created a story that China was eager to buy the Lavi .
Zakheim convinced Reagan that China had to be sandbagged .
Reagan gave Israel $ 500 million for its lost contracts .
Reagan then threw in a wing of F - 16’s as a bonus and sign of good will .
Do we see a pattern here , personal , familial , career - wise , of over - the - top Israeli advocacy ?
Again , during Zakheim ’s tenure as Pentagon controller from May 4 , 2001 , to March 10 , 2004 , over $ 3 trillion dollars were unaccounted for .
Additionally , military Information was jeopardized and military contractors billed the US for Israeli items : $ 50 million dollar fighter jets were rated as surplus and the list rolls on .
As the scandal of the missing trillion dollars surfaced and Dov resigned , Israel was handed the finest fighter jets in the US inventory while 15 percent of US jets were grounded for lack of parts .
In whose best interest was this ?
But Dov is not alone .
He is one of an elite group of Jewish Americans / Israelis who inter-marry and enter government .
They and their Christian counterparts are called neocons and their sole purpose is directing US policy .
Most of them are dual citizens and few serve in the US military .
Think of Paul Wolfowitz , Elliot Abrams , Richard Perle , Ben Wattenberg , to mention a few .
Whether their motivation is anger at the Muslim world , seen as a religious and territorial enemy , or a deep - rooted reaction to the Holocaust , the culmination of European anti-Semitism , their reactionary militarism becomes a world - threatening force unto itself .
Hence our concern .
Dov and the World Trade Center
Perhaps not coincidentally in May 2001 , when Dov served at the Pentagon , it was an SPS ( his firm ’s ) subsidiary , Tridata Corporation , that oversaw the investigation of the first “ terrorist ” attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 .
This would have given them intimate knowledge of the security systems and structural blueprints of the World Trade Center .
From the '90s through 2001 , WTC Security was handled by Securacom , a Kuwait - American firm , on whose board Marvin Bush , the president ’s brother , sat .
After 9/11 , Securacom was let go , changed its name to Stratosec , and was delisted from the Stock Exchange in 2002 .
According to Conspiracy News.net writers Shadow and ‘ Pax ’ in Dov Zakheim and the 9/11 Conspiracy , ( and I suggest you look at this link ) “ According to the SPC website ( 4 ) , a recent customer at that time was Eglin AFB , located in Florida .
Eglin is very near another Air Force base in Florida - MacDill AFB , where Dov Zakheim contracted to send at least 32 Boeing 767 aircraft , as part of the Boeing / Pentagon tanker lease agreement . ( 5 )
” As the events of September 11 , 2001 occurred , little was mentioned about these strange connections , and the possible motives and proximity of Dov Zakheim and his group .
Since there was little physical evidence remaining after the events , investigators were left only with photographic and anecdotal evidence .
“ There is a photograph of the Flight Termination System module , from their site . ( 5 ) .
Note it has a cylindrical shape , and is consistent with the size and shape of the object observed under the fuselage of flight 175 .
“ The Boeing lease deal involved the replacement of the aging KC - 135 tanker fleet with these smaller , more efficient Boeing 767s that were to be leased by Dov Zakheim 's group .
The planes were to be refitted with refueling equipment , including lines and nozzle assemblies . ”
( Remember both Flight 175 , that hit the South Tower , and Flight 11 , that hit the North Tower , were Boeing 767s .
Flights 77 and 93 were 757s . )
“ In the enlargement of flight 175 ’s photo , we can clearly see a cylindrical object under the fuselage , and a structure that appears to be attached to the right underside of the rear fuselage section .
” When seen in comparison , it is obvious that the plane approaching the Trade Center has both of these structures - the FTS module and the midair refueling equipment , as configured on the modified Boeing 767 tankers .
Of particular interest is the long tube - like anomalous structure under the rear fuselage area of flight 175 - this structure runs along the right rear bottom of the plane , as it also does on the Boeing 767 refueling tanker pictured .
” After considering this information , I [ the author / s ] am convinced that flight 175 , as pictured on the news media and official reports , was in fact a refitted Boeing 767 tanker , with a Flight Termination System attached .
Use of this system would also explain the expert handling of aircraft observed in both New York and Washington investigations , which has been officially credited to inexperienced flight school students .
“ Since the refitted 767s were able to carry both passengers and a fuel load , as shown in this photo , it is likely that the plane designated Flight 175 was in fact a refitted 767 tanker , disguised as a conventional commercial passenger plane .
“ As shown in this photo of a 767 being serviced , the FTS unit , when in position , would be small and unobtrusive enough to be fairly innocuous ( at least to casual observers , such as passengers ) .
The smallest circle indicates the size and position of the anomaly depicted in the photos of Flight 175 .
The larger circle , which is the size of the engine housing , shows the size of the anomaly in relation to the engine .
Note the size and position of the open hatches on the engine housing , which would tend to discredit the widely held theory that the anomaly is an open hatch or cargo door .
“ As the . . . diagram shows , all flights involved in the events traveled very near many military installations , and appear to have traveled in a manner suggesting guidance and possible transfer of the control of the planes among the bases .
” Since the evidence from the World Trade Center site was quickly removed , there is little concrete evidence of the involvement of Dov Zakheim , who has since left his position at the Pentagon .
However , the proximity of Eglin AFB to MacDill AFB in Florida and Dov Zakheim 's work via SPC contracts and the Pentagon leasing agreement on both of these installations , combined with SPC 's access to World Trade Center structural and security information from their Tridata investigation in 1993 , is highly suspicious .
Considering his access to Boeing 767 tankers , remote control flight systems , and his published views in the PNAC document , it seems very likely he is in fact a key figure in the alleged terrorist attacks in New York City on September 11 , 2001 . ”
EDITORIAL RESPONSE TO READERS ' COMMENTS :
” In response to some of our readers who have questioned our premise that it was Rabbi Dov Zakheim who ' called for ' the Pearl Harbor type of incident , we here at Conspiracy News
Net acknowledge that the PNAC document was written by the likes of William Kristol and Donald Kagan , and therefore as the real brains behind the agenda they are the ones calling for it in a literal sense .
However , we do stand by our assertion that the Rabbi called for it as well , insofar that he signed his name onto this document .
If he signed it he agrees with it and therefore he is calling for it .
” Some of you have argued that we are singling out Rabbi Zakheim because he is Jewish , implying that we are pushing some sort of twisted anti-Semitic agenda while noting that he is not the only one who signed the PNAC document and therefore wondering why our article is about him and not the others .
We do not mean to imply that the Rabbi acted alone , our article simply points out that Rabbi Zakheim had access to things like structural integrity , blueprints and any number of important facets of information about the WTC through his work with TRIDATA CORPORATION in the investigation of the bombing of the WTC in 1993 .
“ That he had access to REMOTE CONTROL Technology through his work at System Planning Corporation ( SPC ) .
That he had access to BOEING AIRCRAFT through a lease deal HE BROKERED while working at the Pentagon .
“ . . .
Finally that he was part of a group of politically radical Straussian Neo-Conservatives , who , through their association with PNAC , called for restructuring of the Middle East , noting that a Pearl Harbor type of event MAY BE NEEDED to foster the frame of mind required for the American public to accept such a radical foreign policy agenda .
In light of all this information we here at Conspiracy News Net stand by our statement that Mr. Zakheim not only called for the slamming of the WTC Towers on 9 - 11 , but he activity took part in their demolition by providing the logistics necessary for such an attack to occur . ”
Coda , a Bitter Frosting on the Cake
Whether or not you agree in whole or in part with these findings , here is an eye - opening article originally from the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette by Milan Simonich .
It is titled Army unit piecing together accounts of Pentagon attack , and from it comes this striking information in paragraph six . . .
" One Army office in the Pentagon lost 34 of its 65 employees in the attack .
Most of those killed in the office , called Resource Services Washington , were civilian accountants , bookkeepers and budget analysts .
They were at their desks when American Airlines Flight 77 struck . ”
Apart from the question of whether it was F 77 that struck the Pentagon , it is more than ironic that accountants , bookkeepers and budgets analysts , the very people who could pick up the financial frauds were struck .
Especially since the hit was directed supposedly at the Office of Naval Intelligence .
Nevertheless ,
Dov is busy at his Booz Allen job , involved in Strategic Services and who knows what other dark plans as we speak , even as the Middle East is under heavy fire once again from Israel and its fervid ally , the US government .

The NYSE hedged its bets earlier by invoking the rarely used Rule 48 , which " provides the exchange with the ability to suspend the requirement to disseminate price indications and obtain floor - official approval prior to the opening when extremely high market - wide volatility could cause delay opening securities on the exchange . "
The full disclosure was made on the NYSE blog :
Rule 48 is intended to be invoked only in those situations where the potential for extreme market volatility would likely impair floor - wide operations at the exchange by impeding the fair and orderly opening of securities .
Accordingly , the rule sets forth a number of factors to be considered before declaring such a condition , including :
Volatility during the previous day ’s trading session ;
Trading in foreign markets before the open ;
Substantial activity in the futures market before the open ;
The volume of pre-opening indications of interest ;
Evidence of pre-opening significant order imbalances across the market ;
Government announcements ;
News and corporate events ; and ,
Any such other market conditions that could impact floor - wide trading conditions .
And some other " do not panic , we have nothing under control " information dissemination by the NYSE :
The invocation of Rule 48 is in effect only for today .
Previously , the NYSE invoked the rule on 11 March , 2008 ; 23 Jan. , 2008 ; 22 Jan. , 2008 ; and 12 Dec. , 2007 .
The rule was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission on 6 Dec. , 2007 .
Now add 17 March , 2008 to the list .
I kind of had an uneasy feeling all weekend about Bear Stearns , and felt even worse upon seeing the announcement on Sunday night .
To my train buddy at Bear Stearns and his colleagues , I 'm sorry to see this happen .
And just for reference , here 's a link to our circuit breakers .
Here 's hoping we do n't need them today .
Or any other day , for that matter .
Good luck today , everyone .
Good luck indeed .
If Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves was merely the sum of its parts its story would be Tomb Raider meets Indiana Jones , its gameplay the bastard child of Metal Gear Solid 4 and Infamous , and its graphics a cross between a comic book and a creepily suggestive puppet show .
But Uncharted 2 is more than the sum of its parts ; it ’s one of those special games .
It ’s a world - class platformer / adventure game , possibly the finest “ interactive movie ” experience the industry has ever produced , and features online play good enough to make it a serious gamer ’s go - to shooter .
Yes , this one is a must - play , and if you do n’t have a PS3 , it ’s worth buying one for .
Even with a lot of good product already out there , it ’s my feeling that anyone who loves games but has n’t played Uncharted 2 is missing out .
But its leap into the review score stratosphere ( Metascore : 97 ) since its release last week inspires questions about the pseudo - science of Metacritic rankings .
Scott Jones wrote a piece for Crispy Gamer last month which looked at Metascritic ’s impact on game criticism and the PR / Marketing forces whose job it is to leverage good Metascores ( conflict of interest much ? )
A Metascore of 90 has become somewhat of a holy grail in game marketing ( and man , we sure are seeing a lot of 9s these days ) and Jones laments how work for games journalists is unstable , often not well - paid , and just how easily writers might be leveraged by ruthless marketing types , who are increasingly obsessed with Metascore .
He writes :
The darkest thought of all ?
What happens when you ’re new to this business , and you get a call from [ a PR rep ] , who complains about your score ?
If the word “ blacklist ” gets tossed your way , would n’t it be more than a little tempting to placate him ?
What then ?
– Scott Jones
True that .
I ’m sure we have n’t heard the last line of questioning about the integrity of review score data , or the practice of influencing Metascores as a means of ensuring a game ’s success .
But what of the significance of Metacritic at the consumer end ?
I perked up when I first heard that Gamespot ’s early review gave Uncharted 2 a 9.5 ; only a handful of games get a 9.5 .
The world ’s biggest gaming site undoubtedly holds sway in Metacritic ’s weighted averages and sure enough , ‘ universal acclaim ’ and a terrific Metascore followed .
But I ’ve been thinking lately that too many games get 90s , undermining the impact of Metascores .
The number usually does n’t mean much to gamers , except to tell them whether a game lands in an acceptable range .
Exclusive company is all that makes a game ’s review score meaningful , and 80s and even 90s are n’t all that exclusive anymore ; could this mean that PR folks are succeeding in turning 88s ( and maybe even 82s ) into 90s ?
Nonetheless , anything within a certain range ( say , 75 - 100 ) is in the same ballpark , and thus ‘ worth playing ’ BUT unless they ’re at the upper end of that range , the number actually means very little .
At the upper end of the range , it means a lot .
Here are the current - gen titles to earn a Metascore of ninty - FIVE or better ( yes , this is all of them ) :
Xbox 360 / Playstation 3 : Grand Theft Auto IV , Rockstar Games ( 2008 ) 98 Wii : Super Mario Galaxy , Nintendo ( 2007 ) 97 Playstation 3 : Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves , Sony Computer Entertainment ( 2009 ) 97 Xbox 360 : BioShock , 962K Games ( 2007 ) 96 Wii : The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess , Nintendo ( 2006 ) 95 Playstation 3 : LittleBigPlanet , Sony Computer Entertainment ( 2008 ) 95
And you see that 95 still means something – each of these games is more than good .
They ’re outstanding “ it factor ” games .
They ’re special .
And at the other end of the scale we have :
Xbox 360 : Hannah Montana : The Movie , Disney Interactive Studios ( 2009 ) 25 Wii : Ninjabread Man , Conspiracy Entertainment ( 2007 ) 20 Playstation 3 : Leisure Suit Larry : Box Office Bust , Codemasters ( 2009 ) 17
A metascore of 20 tells you something ; it tells you that a game is a broken mess .
And ( for the moment , anyway ) games 95 and up are special .
So what does Metascore mean to the consumer ?
Usually not much … but at the upper and lower ends of the spectrum , quite a bit .
Senator John Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts , co-sponsor of the Senate legislation , said he believed that the president ’s actions would give a boost to the Copenhagen talks and help move the Senate bill .
He called the decision to declare an American target a “ game changer , ” domestically and internationally .
“ By announcing a provisional target , contingent on the support of Congress , the president has defined a path to an international agreement that challenges the developed and developing nations to fulfill their obligations , ” he said .
“ It lays the groundwork for a broad political consensus at Copenhagen that will strip climate obstructionists here at home of their most persistent charge , that the United States should n’t act if other countries wo n’t join with us . ”
But Senator James M. Inhofe , the Senate ’s most outspoken skeptic on climate change , said that Mr. Obama ’s public pledge would do little to speed an international agreement and foolishly prejudged the outcome of a Senate debate that had barely started .
Mr. Inhofe , Republican of Oklahoma , said that Senate climate legislation was “ dying on the vine ” and that the Senate would never ratify a treaty that did not require strong emissions reductions from major developing countries .
“ The U.S. Senate has made clear on numerous occasions that unilateral action by the United States is unacceptable , because it will harm our economy and have virtually no effect on climate change , ” Mr. Inhofe said .
Mr. Obama takes little risk in appearing briefly at the Copenhagen conference because he and other world leaders punctured expectations for the session 10 days ago in a side meeting of leaders of Pacific nations .
The leaders agreed that they would work at Copenhagen toward an interim political declaration on climate change that stopped short of a binding international treaty .
Delegates are expected to pledge to complete work on a treaty next year .
Mr. Obama came to office promising to end eight years of relative inaction on climate change under the Bush administration , but the inaction of Congress has limited the administration ’s ability to negotiate with other nations .
At the Kyoto climate conference in 1997 , the Clinton administration joined other industrialized nations in pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 percent by 2012 , but Congress refused to ratify the agreement because it made no demands of developing nations .
Many foreign leaders , particularly those in European nations that have been more aggressive in dealing with climate change , have become critical of Mr. Obama ’s seeming passivity on the issue .
The White House appears to hope that the announcement of the targets and the trip to Copenhagen will quiet some of the dissension and help Mr. Obama re-establish American leadership on what he calls one of the signature issues of the time .
From the Louisville Courier - Journal ‘s “ Man with IQ of 61 may face death penalty “ :
He has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic with an IQ of 61 — a legally mentally retarded man who , according to his attorneys , has been in and out of institutions , suffers from depression and has attempted suicide numerous times .
But while Kentucky law bans execution of a person with an IQ of 70 or below , when Donald Giles [ right ] stands trial Friday for the 2003 murder and robbery of Charles Goodlett , jurors will have the option of sentencing him to death if he is found guilty .
In rejecting a motion by Giles ’ attorneys to exclude the death penalty because of his low IQ , [ Jefferson County Circuit ] Judge Martin McDonald ruled that under state law , Giles , 41 , would have had to have taken an IQ test when he was still a child …
Some experts on the death penalty say the logic in McDonald ’s ruling was faulty .
They say that while a defendant must show signs of mental retardation during their childhood — to prove they have not suffered a more recent brain trauma or alcohol abuse that would not exclude the death penalty — it does n’t have to be diagnosed during childhood .
Ted Shouse , who had worked for the Department of Public Advocacy defending convicts on death row and is the supervising attorney of the Kentucky Innocence Project , said he has never heard of a similar ruling .
Just another example of how Kentucky ’s death penalty system is arbitrary , broken , and out of step with modern thinking .
After the aforementioned article appeared , Judge Martin McDonald delayed the trial , “ partly out of concerns that recent publicity could bias potential jurors ” according to the Courier - Journal .
Senior Judge Martin McDonald criticized
The Courier - Journal on Friday for an article the previous day about Donald Giles , who is legally mentally retarded but facing the possibility of the death penalty along with Robert Holt in the 2003 murder and robbery of Charles Goodlett .
“ I do n’t like The Courier - Journal blasting something in the media about a case we ’re getting ready to start jury selection on , ” McDonald said Friday , as the trial was set to begin .
“ I mean , it ’s counterproductive . ”
When a Kentucky man who ’s a paranoid schizophrenic with an IQ of 61 is on trial for his life , the media should shout it out .

MONTREAL —
Gold production will continue to fall , despite a brief boost in 2009 and soaring prices , as deposits are exhausted and new discoveries remain elusive , say miners .
In terms of production , “ 2009 is the outlier as far as the trend , ” Omar Jabara , spokesman for US - based Newmont Mining , the second - largest gold producer in the world , told AFP .
ADVERTISEMENT
Overall , “ it ’s a fact that gold production from mines has been in decline since 2001 and has gone roughly from 85 million ounces to about 75 million ounces a year , ” said Vincent Borg , spokesman for number one producer Barrick Gold .
“ It sort of goes down about one million ounces every year and our forecast is that it will continue to decline despite the higher price ” for gold nowadays , he said .
Almost everywhere , mineral deposits are being exhausted and new deposits are not being found fast enough to replace them , these experts explain .
South Africa , which was once at the vanguard of world production , saw a 9.3 - percent drop in production year - over - year in the second quarter , according to its Chamber of Mines .
Globally , “ it ’s just that the assets are not there anymore , ” Tonya Todd , a spokeswoman for Goldcorp , Canada ’s second biggest gold mining firm .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Just because gold reached a new high today does n’t mean we can send a message to our 26 mines saying produce as much gold as you can today because they are already , ” said Borg .
“ It ’s not like a water tap you can turn on and it comes right away . ”
Barrick and Newmont expect nevertheless to continue increasing production next year by seven percent and five to 10 percent , respectively .
But long - term , it ’s downhill .
ADVERTISEMENT
Omar Jabara explained that it takes from seven to 10 years to start production of a mine after finding an economically viable gold deposit .
And “ no significant new discoveries have been found in recent years , despite the higher gold prices and despite higher exploration budgets , ” said Borg .
ADVERTISEMENT
What is already happening and is likely to continue is that the grade or quality of deposits industry - wide will be “ on average lower than deposits discovered in the past , ” opined Jabara .
The global gold mine production is forecast to rise by 3.7 percent in 2009 to about 2,500 tonnes , but will satisfy only two - thirds of demand , which soared this year amid the global financial crisis to 3,800 tonnes , according to the World Gold Council .
Historically , gold recycling or the sale of central bank stockpiles made up for supply shortages .
ADVERTISEMENT
But during the latest financial crisis , banks have been buying up gold in large quantities to protect monetary reserves against weakness in the US dollar .
Since the start of November , for example , India ’s central bank has scooped up 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund , at market value for about 6.7 billion dollars .
Amid uncertainty in the stock market , small investors and hedge funds are also coveting gold , driving up demand for the precious metal .
With mine production sloping downwards , an increasing supply of gold must come from existing supplies — such as coins , bullion or jewelry — but it will be very limited .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ All the gold ever produced through history amounts to about 165,000 tonnes , which would barely fill two Olympic - size swimming pools , ” said Jabara .
Gold prices soared to a record above 1,180 dollars in London on Wednesday hitting 1,180.20 dollars an ounce in trading on the London Bullion Market , after striking a series of historic peaks in recent days and weeks .

Large areas of New Orleans were flooded by Hurricane Katrina A US judge has ruled that negligence by the US Army Corps of Engineers led to massive floods in parts of New Orleans as Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 .
The court upheld complaints by six residents and a business against the Corps over its maintenance of a navigational channel .
They were awarded damages totalling $ 720,000 ( £ 431,000 ) , and the ruling could lead to thousands more claims .
About 80 % of New Orleans was flooded by Hurricane Katrina .
More than 1,800 people died on the US Gulf coast in the devastating storms .
The Corps is responsible for maintaining a system of canals and earthworks that protect New Orleans from storm surges .
US district judge Stanwood Duval ruled " negligent failure " to maintain the Mississippi River - Gulf Outlet - a shipping channel - had led to flooding in the city 's Lower 9th Ward and nearby St Bernard Parish .
Forceful attack
However , he said the Corps had not been responsible for flooding in eastern New Orleans .
Government lawyers have argued the system had been overwhelmed by the hurricane and that levee breaches could not be blamed on the channel alone .
In his 156 - page ruling , Judge Duval said he believed it was the failure to shore up the outlet that " doomed the channel to grow to two to three times its design width " and " created a more forceful frontal wave attack on the levee " .
It was the first time a US court has found the federal government directly responsible for some of the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina .
The government can appeal against the ruling .
US justice department spokesman Charles Miller said it would review the judge 's ruling before making a decision on how to proceed .
Correspondents say that , if upheld , it could set a precedent for thousands more flood victims to sue the government for damages .

Des recherches encourageantes sur des souris pourraient conduire à des traitements pour améliorer le fonctionnement mental des enfants trisomiques , selon une étude publiée mercredi 18 novembre .
A la naissance , ces enfants ne sont pas mentalement attardés mais développent avec l'âge des problèmes cognitifs en raison des déficits de mémoire inhérents à la trisomie 21 , encore appelée syndrome de Down .
Cette incapacité à mémoriser handicape l'apprentissage , puisque le cerveau éprouve les plus grandes difficultés à mémoriser les expériences pour un développement cognitif normal , expliquent ces chercheurs de la faculté de médecine de l'université Stanford , en Californie .
Leurs travaux , parus dans la nouvelle revue médicale Science Translational Medicine , apportent un éclairage sur le mécanisme neural responsable du dysfonctionnement de la mémoire , et proposent une nouvelle stratégie pour corriger les effets de ce problème avec des médicaments .
La recherche menée sur des souris manipulées génétiquement pour les rendre similaires à des enfants trisomiques a montré pour la première fois que la stimulation de la production de noradrénaline améliorait leurs capacités mentales .

Le Monde avec AFP
Sharks co-owner and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Kevin Compton has seemingly offered his support of Jim Balsille 's three - year bid to purchase an NHL franchise , with the eventual intention of moving that team to Southern Ontario .
Compton is on a five member committee of San Jose Sports and Entertainment Enterprises , a list that consists of CEO Greg Jamison , Tom McEnery , Gregory Reyes , and Brent Jones .
He has been a partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers since 1990 , investing heavily in the enterprise software and telecommunications industries , as well as serving on the board of several companies which include , but are not limited to , Citrix Systems , Verisign , and Kodiak Networks .
Via Mirtle , here is the relevant portion of the Sports Business Daily article :
Compton said Research - in - Motion co-CEO Jim Balsillie should be an NHL owner and called the Coyotes fiasco a " joke . "
Compton said , " Jim loves hockey .
Jim 's got a lot of money .
Jim 's got a lot of passion . "
Compton said he was " 100 % " certain Balsillie will be an NHL owner in the future .
When asked why the owners were locking out Balsillie , he said he did not know .
He added , " Owners are n't . "
Meanwhile , Compton said that the NHLPA turmoil reflected the distance between older players who are hardline labor advocates and younger players , who are paid well and do n't always understand what the union does .
He added , " They ( the union ) have to figure out a way to bring value to the young players . "
He added that they have not done a good enough job explaining what the union does for them .
On the news that Don Fehr will be assisting the NHLPA , Compton said , " I 've had better days than when I read that . "
He described Bettman negotiating with Don Fehr as something that would make " good television . "
The San Jose Sharks joined in the league - wide unanimous vote against Jim Balsillie 's bid for ownership this summer .
Compton 's comments to Sports Business Daily signal that either he has changed his opinion on the Phoenix Coyotes ' ability to become financially viable , was never in agreement with the Sharks final decision to begin with , or that overwhelming pressure from the league office influenced their decision to join the 25 other owners who took part in this process .
And who 's to say that pressure was only felt in San Jose ?
Implying that the league 's owners were n't the ones locking out Jim Balsillie is a pretty damning statement .
In a recent interview with Canadian magazine MacLean's , Bettman stated ( in regards to Balsillie ) , " The owners decided they did n’t want him as a partner , " eventually going on to say , " It ’s not something that I foresee any time soon . "
The contrast between Bettman 's and Compton 's statements seems to indicate there may be more at play than just a candid interview -- Compton 's investment in the telecommunications industry raises a flag , as Kodiak Networks signed a global licensing agreement with Research In Motion during January of 2007 for the Push - to - Talk technology to be used on Blackberry cellular phones .
With Compton serving on the board of Kodiak Networks , and Jim Balsillie the co-CEO of RIM ( developers of the Blackberry ) , it is possible that they have formed an amicable business relationship that may have led to these comments .
So where does that leave us ?
It is uncertain whether or not the views shared by Compton represent anything close to a substantial opinion amongst the league owners , but for a group that was supposedly ironclad in their dissatisfaction with how Balsillie attempted to bull his way into the league , it would be hard to argue that this is not a symbolic break in the ranks .
And an unprecedented one at that .
With the NHLPA currently in the midst of an ongoing saga of their own in search of something that vaguely resembles stability , and a co-owner of one of the league 's franchises contradicting statements made by the Commissioner , you have to wonder just how the upcoming CBA negotiations are going to shake out when the agreement expires in 2011 .
With Donald
Fehr in the mix , it 's a long shot to think they 'll be anything other than a firestorm .

Infinity Ward ’s community manager , Robert Bowling ( aka FourZeroTwo ) dropped a bomb on PC gamers this weekend .
In what was set to be an otherwise low key appearance on the bashandslash.com podcast , Bowling divulged a monumental shift in the Call of Duty franchise .
He revealed Infinity Ward ’s intentions to take total control of the PC community with their new matchmaking service , IWNet .
The message was clear : there wo n’t be dedicated servers in Modern Warfare 2 .
The internet exploded in response to Bowling ’s statements , but for many casual observers , IWNet may appear to enhance their online experience .
The typical server browser will disappear in favor of an Xbox - like matching service , which will find acceptable games based on a player ’s skill level .
Bowling even promised that we would still have the ability to create private matches .
Despite his attempts to sell IWNet , the response has been generally negative .
This new service registered as a deathblow to many PC gamers ( myself included ) .
As a result , Infinity Ward ’s official forums were set on fire Saturday evening .
Irate gamers picked up their pitchforks , and a mob mentality flowed freely without moderation .
This knee - jerk reaction may have done damage to our cause , but many gamers felt betrayed by this news , and for good reason .
This information could have been disclosed at an earlier date , and more time would have given the protest a chance at becoming a dialog .
Infinity Ward waited until the 11th hour and pulled the rug out from under our collective feet .
Some reacted to this news furiously , and they will continue to do so until their demands are met with some sort of public response .
Gamers do n’t like being lied to .
Less than a month ago , shacknews asked Robert Bowling if there were any changes to Modern Warfare 2 ’s functionality on the PC .
Bowling responded simply and definitively : “ [ the ] PC will be the same as it always was . ”
It ’s unknown if this fib was intentional , or if Bowling was simply misinformed , but this was clearly contradicted by his recent revelations .
It ’s Bowling ’s job to connect Infinity Ward with their fans , and so far as many people are concerned , he mislead PC gamers in that interview .
It may have been more of a mistake than a lie , but it only serves diminish Bowling ’s credibility .
But let ’s put this into perspective — what do we stand to lose in this transition ?
One of the advantages commonly associated PC gaming is modded content .
This is a fairly broad domain .
A mod can be just about anything ; it can be a new weapon skin , a custom level , or an entirely new game .
Games like Counter Strike , Team Fortress , and Battlefield 2 all began life as amateur projects , but less ambitious endeavors have still had a tremendous impact on the community .
In many ways , the community has reshaped Call of Duty to fit our needs .
The unregulated nature of the platform has allowed gamers to make PC gaming whatever we see fit — this idea seems antiquated in the face of certain regulation .
Enter : eSports .
For years , competitive gaming has been a cornerstone of the PC experience .
There ’s a league or ladder for every skill level .
Call of Duty 4 , like its predecessors , is immensely popular in these circles .
It ’s important to note how large of an impact IWNet will have on these “ eSports . ”
Gaming clans require private servers to fulfill a variety of needs .
Private rooms within Infinity Ward ’s matching service may give teams a place to play , but it ’s uncertain if they will meet their requirements .
If IWNet uses peer - to - peer technology , we can expect less reliable hosts and unwelcome ping advantages .
Without mods , re-balancing a game designed around public play will be nearly impossible .
Mods and private servers are both critical here ; without them , Call of Duty will be all but dead to serious competition .
The sects most directly impacted by this new system may seem minute in comparison to the scope of the total audience , but they ’re by no means insignificant .
PC gamers were n’t born yesterday , and we did n’t start gaming yesterday either .
Our expectations have been formed by decades of loyal patronage and support .
It ’s not unreasonable that we might expect the PC to remain the enthusiast ’s platform .
We expect more direct control over our software .
These high expectations have only been enforced by the relationship we ’ve had with game developers for ( many ) years .
There are thousands , if not millions of gamers who may not feel the impact directly , but they will be categorically affected by IWNet .
Nevermind the contributions that gamers have made to the industry , especially in this genre , consider the community .
Call of Duty has been the darling of PC gamers since it stole Medal of Honor ’s thunder several years ago .
Its popularity can be witnessed in every corner of the PC market .
It ’s hard to say what Activision and Infinity Ward ’s real motivation is here , but it ’s not a stretch to imagine that these systems are being put in place to support premium add - ons .
Whatever their motivation is , we expect better treatment .
We still love Valve , because despite our recent disputes , they have shown us respect ; Infinity Ward , on the other hand , lied .
All of our most reasonable complaints and concerns have already been considered .
Somewhere in a board room , people from Infinity Ward and Activision must have had this conversation .
They were n’t born yesterday either , and they ’ve been with us long enough to know how devastating this would be to their original audience .
Personally , I thought Infinity Ward was better than that , but it appears that I was wrong .
Do n’t listen to the people trying to quiet your voices .
They might not listen , but sign a petition , post on a forum , or rant about it on your damn blog .
Even if our dissent goes unrewarded , Infinity Ward and Activision need to hear us clearly .
Make sure that the powers that be know that you wo n’t pay more for less .
My message is clear : until this situation is properly resolved , do not buy this game .
… and just for fun , watch this video .
SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3 is n’t due out for a couple more months .
In the meantime why not check out these new trailers to whet your appetite for this handheld shooter .
The first trailer showcases a glimpse of the single - player campaign :
The second trailer shows us more of the single - player campaign , but more specifically the squad - based element of the game :
Finally , the third trailer shows us extensive use of the auto - aiming functionality as well as what the screen displays when the player is hurt .
Zooming in on a locked - on enemy is also featured .
Look forward to this title releasing January 12th , 2010 on both UMD and the PlayStation Store .

Winner
The winning design , from Polish studio Mobius Architects , is intended to be built on top of tower blocks of social housing common in eastern Europe but found throughout the world .
The three architects involved , Przemek Olczyk , Wojtek Gawinowski and Wojtek Sumlet , learned during research that the roofs of many of these tower blocks are unused and over - engineered .
They can easily support additional development in the form of lightweight housing and green roofs , they say .
( Image : Mobius Architects / Architecture for Humanity Vancouver )
All the furniture inside the house is integrated into the walls to make best use of space .
Built with wooden frames insulated with hemp fibres , the houses are intended to be easily expandable .
For example , it should be straightforward to add a second level to the basic design .

Thick - Skinned Regionalism
Runner -up
Cities worldwide grow outwards , but leave the large rivers at their historical centres unused , realised the London - based architects behind this idea .
Their design makes use of that space .
Each of the floating homes is built from 49 wooden layers , or " ribs " , with chequered walls on each end to provide storage and let in light .
The ribs have varying shapes so that when layered together they create " furniture " in the building 's structure .

Pods
Runner -up
Shawn Blackwell and Kate Fretz of Blackwell Architecture , based in Vancouver , Canada , focused on making construction of a fully functional home possible in a short period of time .
Building involves defining the house 's outline with four " pods " that between them contain all the services needed to make a house work , including plumbing and electricity connections , and heating .
Floor , roof and wall panels span the gaps between the pods to complete the house and enclose the main living area .

From Parking to Living
Honourable mention
Some of the most desirable land in São Paulo , Brazil , is given over to car parks run by the landowners as they speculate on future land prices .
Danilo Hideki Abe , Mayra Rodrigues and Régis Sugaya of Áporo Arquitetura in São Paulo think this land would be better used to site prefab homes that can allow more efficient use of the space , but also quickly make way for more permanent development in future .
The homes take up around two parking spaces each and are largely made from corrugated polyurethane , with wooden panels and a metal frame .

Urban Tree House
Honourable mention
As cities grow , many architects look to expand upwards into vertical space , but Jason Labutka of New York architects Jason David Designs wants to expand horizontally , to use the " negative space " above city streets .
Cantilevering makes it possible to sling the 3 - by - 12 - metre structure over the roadway , level with the tree canopy to make an " urban tree house " .
The street - side " entry box " takes care of services like plumbing and also provides storage for bicycles .
Stairs lead to the living areas .
While the cantilever and entry box would need to be constructed on site , the living area can be prefabricated and lifted into place .
( Image : Jason David Designs / Architecture for Humanity Vancouver )
Spontaneous House
Honourable mention
Designed by Claudia Bastos Coelho and Mariana Matayoshi at Cobogó Team based in Diadema , Brazil , this was partly inspired by the " spontaneous " structures that appear in slums and other densely populated urban areas when people take building into their own hands .
The individual prefabricated pods are designed to be stacked in a variety of ways , making it possible to create analogues of a variety of housing arrangements , such as tower blocks and low terraces .

Origins of the bonfire ; beware the garden rabbit menace ; is the human body an efficient machine ?
Why is it a " bonfire " rather than " fire " ?
Just as some religious festivals were grafted on to existing calendar events – eg Christmas superseded the pagan festival of Sol , or the winter solstice – the creation of Bonfire Night was a propaganda exercise that was grafted onto an annual event in the agricultural calendar .
As the growing season effectively comes to an end around the beginning of November , farmers would prepare to eke out their winter fodder by slaughtering most of their animals , keeping only breeding pairs with a view to replacing their stock the following spring .
Having preserved the meat , rendered the fat and treated the hides , they were left with the carcasses .
In order to convert these into fertiliser , they had to be burned on a " bone fire " , shortened over time to " bonfire " .
The propaganda exercise proved so successful that Bonfire Night continues to be celebrated more than 400 years after the event , even though both the event it commemorates – the execution of Guy Fawkes – is now highly un - PC , and the annual ritual of " bone fires " has long since faded out of practice .
Bill Finlay , Aspatria , Cumbria
The word derives from the mid-15th century word " banefire " , originally a fire in which bones were burned .
Dr Johnson mistakenly derived it from the French " bon " ( good ) .

How can I stop my neighbours ' cats from relieving themselves in my vegetable patch ?
Regarding the discussions about cats and rabbits ( N&Q , 4 November ) , a friend of mine moved into a house with a large garden some years ago and wondered why there was n't much growing in it .
The answer came when he looked out early one morning and saw that the garden was full of rabbits .
He solved the problem by aquiring two cats , which rarely needed feeding as they were full of rabbit .
Not having a rabbit problem , I find that criss - crossing canes or similar over my vegetable beds discourages the cats , as does the netting , fleece etc I put in place to keep out insect pests and birds .
There 's always something trying to benefit from your best efforts .

How efficient is the human body as a machine that turns food into energy ?
This partly depends on how efficiency is defined .
Respiration , the process of turning chemical or food energy into usable energy , is 38 % efficient ( this is the percentage of chemical energy available from glucose oxidation that is converted into the chemical energy of ATP – adenosine triphosphate ) .
Like an endless procession of porters , each molecule of ATP carries a little parcel of energy to where it is needed .
The remaining 62 % of energy manifests itself as heat .
This explains why we are warm .
This energy is not wasted , as being warm - blooded bestows advantages that may revise the efficiency figure upwards .
However , of the 38 % available to the cells , half is " wasted " in physical exercise , reducing the overall efficiency to about 20 % .
But it depends on who is doing what activity : for example , endurance cyclists with slow twitch fibres tend to be more efficient than those with fast twitch fibres .
Efficiency also varies between different tissues or organs .
Compared to other tissue , muscle wastes more energy as heat .
Given that men are generally more muscular than women , this is the physiological explanation of why women generally feel colder than men .
Proof , if any were needed , that men are less efficient .

When I first picked up this book I was surprised by its length .
Somehow , after reading The Rails Way , I got stuck in my mind that The Merb Way had to be almost equally voluminous .
Instead , this book is about 300 page long , roughly as long as the sum of the chapters devoted to ActiveRecord in Obie Fernandez ’s acclaimed Rails bible .
Apparently it only takes 300 pages to describe a web framework nowadays !
I could n’t help but feeling a bit skeptical at first .
Even in the foreword , Obie Fernandez presents the book – and the whole Merb framework – with some initial skepticism : is n’t Ruby on Rails enough ?
Why do we need yet another Ruby web framework ?
And above all , seeing that Merb is going to eventually be merged into Rails 3 , why on Earth do we need a book about Merb , now ?
Needless to say , Foy Savas proved that both Merb and its book cannot be dismissed just like that .
Getting started
The book starts with the original Merb Pastie , a single page of Ruby code able to sort out HTTP requests , dispatch them to the appropriate controllers and render a web page .
This piece of code is enough to convey what Merb is : a new breed of web framework , almost as simple as it can get but very poweful and flexible at the same time .
As you start diving in through the first chapter , you realize you ’re reading about a Hacker ’s Web Framework .
That ’s precisely what Merb is : a very versatile tool to get the job done , in the simplest way possible .
Similarly ,
The Merb Way immediately feels like a Hacker ’s Handbook rather than an ordinary guide on how to develop web applications .
You wo n’t learn what MVC is by reading this book , and do n’t expect to be taught what a mixin is ; you are reading a book about a Ruby web framework that was born after the Rails Revolution , so it is safe ( for the author ) to assume that :
You know the Ruby programming language
You know what Ruby on Rails is and you tried it out , at the very least
The first few chapters are about the core functionalities provided by an an MVC framework : after a comprehensive first chapter about Merb ’s fundamentals ( from the layout of a Merb application to an overview of Merb internals ) you are quite abruptly “ introduced ” to routing , controllers , views and models .
These chapters do not aim to provide a comprehensive description of each component , they simply tell you : here ’s how Merb does this .
Out of the first five chapters , favorite is definitely the one about Models .
Although Merb is ORM - agnostic , DataMapper is the de facto standard for Merb applications , and it fully embrace the framework ’s design and extreme flexibility without being in the way of your code .
Foy does an excellent job in this chapter by strategically describing DataMapper ’s code from the top to the very bottom , from the highest abstractions to raw SQL code , using a plethora of snippets taken from the actual Merb code .
It ’s about how Merb works , not how to work with Merb
After reading the Models chapter I decided to go back and re-examine the previous chapters .
I did n’t notice until then , but the author sneakily smuggled a consistent amount of Merb source code into this book .
This is rather unusual for books about web frameworks : they normally tell you how to use the framework , not how it was built !
While this can be disappointing for people used to read Rails books , it came as a very pleasant surprise to me .
About 40 - 50 % of this entire book ( and I ’m not exaggerating ) is Ruby source code .
In a good way , it feels like a collection of strategically - positioned code snippets glued together with explanations of the most tricky bits and digressions on how the framework was designed .
In other words , it probably contains just enough text to make sure that the average reader understands the code , but remember that the average reader of this book must know Ruby failry well .
There is no pointless prose in this book , no explanations of obvious methods , no fancy words , no useless boasting on how cool the framework is : just an objective description of how Merb works and of the key design decisions behind it .
If I may , the only thing that does n’t feel quite right with this book is its title : Merb Internals would have been a better choice .
Once you realize this , the book suddenly makes sense , and can even make you a better Ruby programmer .
The Merb Way does an excellent job in describing how to design a web framework , or any real - world Ruby application for that matter .
It teaches you that modularity is the key to flexibility by showing how the Merb stack is organized .
Sure , it does n’t teach you how to create a blog in five minutes , but perhaps a thorough explanation of how anthentication is implemented ( Chapter 9 ) will actually be useful in two months time , when you ’ll have to create your own Merb plugin from scratch .
Some constructive criticism
The idea behind this book is clever but a bit dangerous .
I flipped through the pages in front of my wife and asked her what was wrong with it .
“ There ’s too much code ! ” she said , without hesitation .
Precisely .
It is damn good Ruby code , but sometimes you wish there was more text describing how to use it in practice .
Or maybe some code examples on using the framework on a real - world application .
Not a chance .
Of all that holy code , there ’s not much featuring something other than Merb itself .
Basically the exact opposite of all the other books about Rails or other web frameworks !
Even accepting the fact that you are not reading a book about developing web applications , there are two more things which could be improved :
Merb ’s design is very intriguing , and you grasp the essentials by reading this book , but a few diagrams here and there and more in - depth digressions on the subjects would have been nice .
Besides DataMapper , what I really wanted to read about were Slices and Parts – unfortunately the chapters about them are far too short and shallow .
The reasoning behind this is that their future may be uncertain due to the Rails 3 merge .
Pity .
Conclusion
The death of Merb has been greatly exaggerated .
Too bad I gave up web frameworks altogether for my site , because after reading this book I would have gone for Merb today rather than waiting to see the wonders of Rails 3 tomorrow .
Even a book with this title could have been written in a very different way , I would still recommend it if you want to become a better Ruby programmer by learning from the best :
Merb code really stands out , even compared to Rails , and Foy Savas does a great job presenting and describing it .
Deadly accidents are common in China 's mining industry
China has charged nearly 60 people with covering up a deadly mine disaster just weeks before last year 's Olympic Games , the state - run China Daily has said .
The July 2008 accident in Hebei province , near Beijing , killed 34 miners .
News of it was suppressed for nearly three months , China Daily said .
Officials are alleged to have moved bodies , destroyed evidence and bribed journalists to hush up the disaster .
Relatives of the miners were kept quiet with threats and " large payments " .
The charges result from an investigation ordered by China 's State Council , or cabinet , China Daily said .
In total , 10 journalists and 48 government and mining officials have been charged .
The 10 journalists were paid $ 380,000 ( £ 230,000 ) to not report the disaster , the report said .
The miners were killed in an explosion at the Lijiawa mine in Yuxian county , Hebei province , on 14 July last year .
The Yuxian county government allegedly took out expensive advertisements in the newspaper of one of the journalists charged .
China 's mines are notoriously dangerous .
The central government has made improving safety standards a priority , but rules are often ignored in favour of profit as the economy has boomed .
All of you know Stillwater Dwellings .
This new company is indeed very busy these days with an array of orders .
They have recently completed their first prefab home in Bend , Oregon .
This home was built using the sd231 floor plan and includes 2,950 square feet of space .
This house contains three bedrooms , two and half bathrooms , a laundry room , and 600 square feet of garage space .
The cost of construct this house was $ 175 per square foot which includes the entire site work .
This house features a Marmoleum flooring in guest bath & laundry room ; Honed Caesarstone countertops ;
Dual flush toilets and low - consumption plumbing faucets ;
All Energy Star appliances ; Passive cooling with clerestory windows at the highest point of the room ; Hardwood floors finished using a OSMO Hardwax Oil ; 100 % natural wool carpets ; SFI certified wood windows with low-e film and argon gas ; High - efficiency heat pump ; Automated HVAC system pegged to outside and forecast weather ; automated lighting systems when the lighting is dim .
This is a great home to stay .
If you 're a copyright owner who has gone to the trouble and expense of tracking down online copyright infringers , do n't send warning letters to Verizon without striking a deal first ; Verizon simply chucks them in the bin .
Do a deal with the " big V " and Verizon is willing to forward warning letters on to its subscribers , but that 's it .
No customer information is exchanged and no sanctions are implemented — and Verizon has been handling the issue this way for years .
That 's why today 's report that the RIAA has signed a deal with Verizon to forward notices breaks no real ground , though the arrangement certainly does expand the scope of Verizon 's letter - forwarding .
Everybody 's doing it
Verizon refuses to play Web sheriff , but it is upfront about its willingness to forward warning letters .
" Verizon receives notices from owners of copyrighted works ( such as movies and other content ) that identify Internet connections they believe are being used to download or upload content in possible violation of the copyright laws , " says the company to customers .
" Verizon has made individual arrangements with certain of these copyright owners to forward their notices on to the customers involved ( without identifying the customer to the content owner ) . "
Verizon did such a deal with Disney back in 2005 and has similar deals in place with other companies that it wo n't divulge .
The Disney deal helped secure certain Disney content for use on Verizon 's network , though ; part of the price for gaining access was helping Disney control online infringement by passing warning letters along to Verizon subscribers .
What Verizon is getting out of the RIAA deal is n't clear .
A Verizon source tells
Ars that the deal , if it has in fact been signed , would likely be a 90 - day trial run but would also just be " more of the same " for the company .
And do n't even think about calling it " graduated response " — there are no sanctions , and the company is keen to point out that it is not in the business of enforcement .
When the RIAA last year announced it was abandoning its widespread litigation campaign for a graduated response push , we assumed that at least some ISPs would have signed on by now .
That does not appear to be the case , though as we reported earlier this year , several major US ISPs do already forward copyright infringement notices from the record labels .
AT&T , Cox , Comcast , and Verizon all forward copyright infringement notices in some way , but Cox appears to be going furthest when it comes to sanctions .
Many ISPs clamp down on their very heaviest users due to capacity concerns , but Cox explicitly acts on copyright warnings .
After a customer receives multiple notices , Cox can toss them into a " walled garden " and they will be shown a " special screen when they log onto the Internet " that explains the issue in more detail .
Users then must contact Cox directly to talk about the issue .
Nearly all accounts are reinstated at this point ;
Cox says that it has actually terminated less than one - tenth of one percent of accounts to which it has sent letters .
That arrangement goes back years , however , and has nothing to do with the RIAA .
Does forwarding these warning letters get results ?
Hard to say .
AT&T told us earlier this year that a pair of trials it did were quite successful at preventing repeated infringement even without sanctions ( making mom and dad aware of what was being done on the family Internet account was often enough to stop infringement ) .
Surveys on this question in the UK have been mixed , showing that letters were likely to get good results simply by stripping away the anonymity that Internet users often feel .
But a follow - up survey suggested that , if those receiving the letters know that sanctions are off the table , compliance tumbles .
As for what the RIAA wants , the group has made it clear to us on multiple occasions that warning letters alone are a good step forward , but that a real graduated response system with increasing sanctions is really needed to give the warnings some teeth .
New York state 's attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , ramping up his investigation of Merrill Lynch 's purchase by Bank of America Corp. , issued subpoenas to the five directors on the bank 's audit committee at the time of the deal , according to people familiar with the situation .
Mr. Cuomo , who also is weighing possible civil fraud charges against BofA Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis , also plans to subpoena all 15 of the Charlotte , N.C. , company 's directors as of early December , when shareholders approved the deal .

God Wants You To Be Rich
N
ew York Times Bestseller
Paul Zane Pilzer ’s unique gift is to tame the mysteries of making money and put you in the saddle .
God Wants
You to Be Rich will set your mind racing with new ideas .
— Scott DeGarmo Editor in Chief and Publisher , Success Magazine
A must - read — Paul Zane Pilzer has helped to shift our thinking from scarcity in resources to one of a cornucopia of economic abundance and richness .
— Anthony Robbins bestselling author of Awaken the Giant Within
This book is PHENOMENAL –it is a pre-internet book , and yet it discusses how technology changes the world and the economy .
— from a reader in New York on Amazon.com
From the back cover of God Wants You To Be Rich :
“ Even successful people sometimes view the desire to get rich as something shameful .
Having been taught that we live in a world of finite resources they never achieve the complete success they deserve because they believe it comes at the expense of someone else .
But now Paul Zane Pilzer , the author of Other People ’s Money and Unlimited Wealth , explains how and why God wants each of us to be rich , in every possible way–in health , love and peace of mind , as well as material possessions .
An individual ’s success is good for all of society , argues Pilzer , because wealth begets wealth for everyone .
Pilzer exposes the key error–the belief in scarcity –that leads to a misunderstanding of the process of creating wealth .
Countering this zero -sum view of economics , Pilzer shows how a society ’s wealth is determined not by the supply of physical resources , which are supposedly limited , but by human ingenuity , which constantly redefines what counts as a resource in the first place .
Thus , in the nineteenth century , as the supply of whale blubber shrank , humankind found a way to make use of the worthless black goo that oozed out of the ground in Texas and the natural gas that was regarded as a hazard in Pennsylvania coal mines .
Today , the most important technology , the microchip , is made out of the world ’s most common material–silicon , which is basically sand .
So wealth is not limited by physical resources , it is as unlimited as the power of our minds .
Our economic system rewards those who make the largest positive impact by fulfilling the wishes and needs of the most people .
Their success does not come at someone else ’s expense : rather , it contributes to the constantly changing resources that we all draw upon .
A theology of economics that explains why God wants each of us to maximize our economic potential , God Wants You to Be Rich also explains howto accomplish this .
In insightful and practical chapters , Pilzer shows how readers can take advantage of revolutionary changes in distribution ( such as network marketing ) , what the workplace of the twenty - first century will look like , how to quit before you ’re fired in an era of downsizing , how to make your ( former ) employer your first customer , and what government can and ca n’t do about our social and economic ills .
Provocative as well as practical , God Wants
You to Be Rich offers a cornucopian view of our society–a new theological and economic understanding of why and how to accumulate wealth . ”

The worm changes the wallpaper of the phone
The first worm to infect the Apple iPhone has been discovered spreading " in the wild " in Australia .
The self - propagating program changes the phone 's wallpaper to a picture of 80s singer Rick Astley with the message " ikee is never going to give you up " .
The worm , known as ikee , only affects " jail - broken " phones , where a user has removed Apple 's protection mechanisms to allow the phone to run any software .
Experts say the worm is not harmful but more malicious variants could follow .
" The creator of the worm has released full source code of the four existing variants of this worm , " wrote Mikko Hypponen of security firm F - secure .
" This means that there will quickly be more variants , and they might have nastier payload than just changing your wallpaper . "
The picture of Rick Astley is believed to be a nod to the internet phenomenon known as Rickrolling , where web users are tricked into clicking on what they believe is a relevant link , only to find that it actually takes the user to a video of the pop star 's song " Never gonna give you up " .
' Stupid people '
The worm has so far only been found circulating in Australia , where the hacker - Ashley Towns - who wrote the program lives .
The 21 - year - old told Australia 's ABC News Online that he created the virus to raise the issue of security .
It only exploits jail - broken phones that have SSH installed , a program that enables other devices to connect to the phone and modify the system and files .
My prediction is that we may see more attacks like this in the future
Graham Cluley
The worm is able to infect phones if their owners have not changed the default password after installing SSH .
" What 's clear is that if you have jail - broken your iPhone or iPod Touch , and installed SSH , then you must always change your root user password to something different than the default , ' alpine ' , " wrote Graham Cluley of security firm Sophos .
" In fact , it would be a good idea if you did n't use a dictionary word at all . "
After a phone becomes infected it disables the SSH service , preventing reinfection .
The code contains numerous comments from Mr Towns about his motivation .
Jail breaking allows a user to run non-Apple approved software
One comment reads : " People are stupid and this is to prove it . "
" It 's not that hard guys .
But hey who cares its only your bank details at stake . "
The worm can be removed by changing the phone 's password and deleting some files .
A spokesperson for Apple warned against jail - breaking handsets .
" These hacks not only violate the warranty , they will also cause the iPhone to become unstable and not work reliably , " the spokesperson said .
Some estimates suggest that up to 10 % of all iPhones and iPod Touches are jail - broken .
The practice allows a phone user to install software and applications that have not been approved by Apple .
" Phone users may rush into jail - breaking their iPhones in order to add functionality that Apple may have denied to them , but if they do so carelessly they may also risk their iPhone becoming the target of a hacker , " said Mr Cluley .
" My prediction is that we may see more attacks like this in the future . "

Jordan 's ties with Israel turn cold
AMMAN // Jordan and Israel mark 15 years of peace today , but ties between both countries are cooler than ever .
Since the right - wing Israeli government of Benjamin Netenyahu took office in May , Jordan has been left further disappointed with its neighbour .
“ Our relation is getting colder , ” King Abdullah told Israel ’s daily Haaretz newspaper this month .
“ Let ’s remember that the peace treaty was signed as part of a process to achieve comprehensive peace .
And the full potential of not just Jordanian - Israeli relations , but the whole region , will not be realised unless comprehensive peace is achieved . ”
The king has for years expressed his frustration with Israel ’s intransigence over the peace process , its ignoring the two - state solution , expanding the settlements , building the separation wall and continuing oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza , but his latest remarks indicate that he is fed up .
“ After 15 years , the peace treaty started losing its political value for Jordan , ” wrote Fahed Kheitan , a political columnist with Arab Al Yawm , an independent daily in Amman .
“ Our experience in the past 15 years reiterate that the unilateral agreements cannot be a substitute to just and comprehensive peace … the Wadi Araba agreement is no longer a red line , and instead of being a burden on Jordan , it is now on the table to be used as a [ tool ] to pressure Israel . ” ...
... “ After a decade and a half , there is cold peace between Jordan and its western neighbour .
Successive Israeli governments ’ measures in Jerusalem are provocative .
When it came to the prisoner swap between Hizbollah and Israel in 2008 , Israel handed the remains of Jordanian soldiers to Hizbollah instead of Jordan .
And when Israel and Hamas agreed on a truce last year , Israel embarrassed Jordan and Egypt who were trying to isolate Hamas , ” Mr Momani said .
The peace treaty did enable Jordan to come out of a state of isolation from the West and many Arab countries for its perceived support for Saddam Hussein ’s regime in Iraq in the Gulf War in 1991 .
“ If you look at the treaty from a regional perspective , it is not up to expectations , ” said Fayez Tarawneh , a former prime minister and the former head of the Jordanian delegation to the Jordan - Israeli peace talks .
“ Also , the split in the Palestinian scene is a breaking bone for the Arabs .
“ Jordan , however , would have been in a vulnerable situation if it did not have a peace treaty .
Just remember what was Jordan ’s situation before 1994 when it refused to join the coalition against Iraq , ” Mr Tarawneh said .
Today , Jordan is banking on the Obama administration to pursue a strategy that would ultimately create an independent Palestinian state ...

Have you ever met a PC gamer in person ?
Your experiences may be different than mine , but they tend to resemble normal human beings .
Some may even live in your very home .
Most of my friends are PC gamers , and they buy their games , have fun playing online , and go about their lives .
None of them resemble the skulking , insane caricatures seen in chat rooms , gaming blogs , and comments on the Internet .
Those foul beasts writhe and spit at the slightest provocation .
" That 's why I pirate your games ! " one may howl at a company when faced with a demo that has been pushed back an hour or two .
" PC gaming is dying !
Sign my petition !
I 'm boycotting you ! " another may shriek at a company that did n't deliver the exact online experience they were hoping for .
The question is a simple one : what are these people trying to prove ?
What do they think they 're changing ?
Why this is a problem
This is an issue because in many cases , there are tangible steps companies could take to make gamers happier .
Foster some discussion about why content is being held back .
Ensure the PC experience as open and malleable as possible .
Keep your dedicated community close , and make sure they 're happy .
The problem is , when the first response to any real or imagined slight is threats of piracy and hate , why would you want to engage with these people ?
" You need to know it , because nobody else is going to tell you : you guys sound like Goddamned subway vagrants , " Jerry " Tycho " Holkins wrote in a Penny Arcade newspost .
" Of course when you speak exclusively to each other , it all sounds so reasonable .
It 'll be reasonable when you all board the bus ... and when you douse yourself with gasoline and immolate yourself in front of the offices of Infinity Ward , one assumes this will be reasonable also . "
The problem is that the presumed anonymity of Internet can bring out the worst in people .
We decided to speak to a few people in the industry and explore how you can make yourself heard ... without making yourself easy to ignore .
Discussion leads to positive change
" Active , passionate communities have never been shy about telling teams and companies what they like and dislike .
It 's actually a good thing .
We 've seen really positive changes to games made as a result . "
We talked with Christian Svensson , the Vice - President of Strategic Planning at Capcom .
He 's also a board member of the PC Gaming Alliance .
Capcom , through its Unity blog and numerous events open to the public , has long engaged its fans directly .
He agreed to talk with us on the subject after some harrying on our part ; this is topic people treat with some care .
Who wants to say that the audience for their games can seem slightly insane in their complaints and demands ?
Svensson brought up changes made to Team Fortress 2 and the decision to offer the add - on content to Resident Evil 5 as a digital release in North America as things influenced by direct communication with gamers .
" There are several projects we 've done that would n't have existed , or directions we 've taken in our games that never would have happened , without listening to that feedback , " he told Ars .
" There 's dozens of good examples around the industry .
Vocal communities engaging with smart teams and creative companies in constructive ways have incredible power .
" The key word in the prior sentence is ' constructive . '
I know that I 'm a lot more receptive to feedback from fans when someone tells me what they are looking to spend money on ... and it's not in a post that is ALL CAPS ! "
The trick , Svensson says , is to explain what you'd be willing to support with your money , not what would cause you to turn a game down .
Talk about what you love to see , not what you hate .
" [ Companies ] tend to respond better to ' how can I generate more ' discussions rather than ' how can I retain what I should / would have generated , ' " he explained .
Svensson pointed out that there is a way to present this data that will make it easier to get the changes the community would like enacted ... and it's not by telling everyone how few people will buy the game if a hated feature is n't taken out or changed .
" It is much easier to have a discussion like ' I 'd like to make these changes that have XYZ costs associated with them in order to raise our forecasts by $ PDQ based upon fan feedback ( and where $ PDQ is some percentage higher than $ XYZ ) . "
What does n't work ?
Telling the people who control the purse strings that they have to pay to make changes or they 'll lose customers .
" Regardless of whether it is appropriate to do so , those that control the purse strings are often not moved [ by that argument ] , " Svensson said .
" So , while I certainly understand and respect the passion and conviction of some fans , threatening to pirate or not buy a game is n't likely to provide the ammunition a team needs to affect the changes that the community is asking for . "
Especially when it's so often a lie
There is that now - famous image of the Steam group for the Modern Warfare 2 boycott ... filled with people playing their copies of Modern Warfare 2 .
I took part in a podcast about the issues involved with Modern Warfare 2 with the people who first broke the story of the lack of dedicated servers , and to our chagrin we found that all but one of us had purchased the game .
The problem with threatening to not buy a game is that everyone knows you will probably buy the game after all .
Randy Stude is the President of the PC Gaming Alliance , and is also Director of Intel 's Gaming Program Office .
I 've spoken to him a few times in the past ; this is someone who lives and breathes PC gaming and realizes there are plenty of fish in the sea .
" There is some bad news about a popular PC game right now , but I believe that PC gamers will wholeheartedly put their energy into a new franchise that supports the gameplay , modifications , anti-cheat , dedicated and large server match play that we know and love about this platform , " he told Ars .
In other words , stick to your guns , do n't buy the games that do n't give you want you want , and reward those that do .
A nasty comment on a website wo n't change things .
Your money certainly can .
" Like the Internet , video streaming , online gaming , social networks , blogs , and Twitter ... the PC moves on .
PC
Gaming is still the most innovative , highest quality , breakthrough - technology - driven platform in the world , " he told us .
People are making money on the platform , and Stude points out that only 40 percent of revenue from PC Games would equal the entirety of software revenue from one of the major consoles .
"
The business of gaming on the PC is evolving and some old players will reinvent to keep pace while others will stay focused on the old way of doing things — or worse draw closer to the console model — and cease to be relevant in this marketplace , " Stude said .
This creates an opportunity for gamers : by buying the games that give us what we want , and sticking to our guns on those decisions , we can shape where the industry goes .
Publishers pay attention to sales and positive feedback , not to threats or piracy .
So what can you do ?
The easiest thing you can do is to vote with your dollar .
Companies do n't listen to what you say , they watch to what you do ; the loudest complaint does n't matter if you go ahead and purchase the game .
Tell companies what they can do to earn your money instead of threatening them with losing it .
Threatening anyone with a criminal act does n't get anything done .
If you convince everyone you 're a pirate , you remove yourself from the conversation completely .
Why make yourself so easily ignored ?
You can also join the Entertainment Consumers Association to keep up with current events in gaming and stay organized with the greater community .
" Prior to ECA , consumers did n't have a conduit with which to speak to the industry in general , or rights holders in particular .
So we 're in a transitory process at present , ramping - up our membership , getting the word out about the org and educating consumers on the various issue areas in which they can become involved , " ECA President Hal Halpin told Ars .
" As we do that , I 'd hope that we 'll see less of the extremist — and often anonymous — ranting and raving online , which is counterproductive and tends to give folks on the other side of the table justification for marginalizing their argument . "
Halpin argued for more disclosure in the use of Digital Rights Management in games , and for a standardized End User Licensing Agreement during the Federal Trade Commission 's Summit on the matter .
This is a man who can help to get things done .
PC gamers make a lot of noise online , but the amount of concrete action pales in comparison .
By spending less time organizing public boycotts and more time simply buying good games , by choosing not to fly the Jolly Roger and changing the discussion to things publishers can do to earn your money , by organizing in a real way and criticizing productively , you can make things better for PC gaming .
Change wo n't begin in the comments of this story , or in any review .
Editor 's Note : L. Tammy Duckworth , an Iraq War veteran , is assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Veterans Affairs .
She lost both legs and partial use of one arm when a helicopter she piloted was attacked by a rocket - propelled grenade in Iraq in 2004 .
Washington ( CNN ) --
In the Army you live by the Warrior Ethos , which states , " I will always place the mission first .
I will never quit .
I will never accept defeat .
I will never leave a fallen comrade behind . "
I am alive today because my helicopter crew lived by these words .
When our aircraft was shot down in November 2004 , the injuries I sustained were devastating .
The amount of blood I had lost in a matter of minutes was so vast that my crew thought I was dead .
They could have left me in that dusty field in Iraq , but they did n't .
Instead , they stood their ground in the face of approaching enemy , risked their lives , and carried me to safety .
They did this regardless of whether I was dead or alive , because the American warrior does not leave a fallen comrade behind .
My crew and all the men and women in the U.S. armed forces know what it means to be a part of something greater than themselves .
They are America 's finest sons and daughters , and we made a promise to care for them after they serve .
It is our job in the Department of Veterans Affairs to make sure that promise is kept .
We at VA stand at a historic time with great opportunities to further our mission in caring for the nation 's 23.4 million veterans and their families .
With the largest one - year percentage increase in VA 's budget in over three decades , President Obama has made it very clear that serving our nation 's veterans is a top priority in his administration .
He wants to increase funding for VA by $ 25 billion above our current baseline over the next five years .
He launched a new initiative to expand eligibility for veterans ' health care to as many as 500,000 Priority Group 8 Veterans who were previously denied care .
And he wants us to invest in better technology to deliver services and benefits to veterans with the quality and efficiency they deserve .
As commander in chief , President Obama has charged Secretary Eric Shinseki and all of VA 's leadership with a new mission : to transform VA into a 21st - century organization .
Secretary Shinseki has begun to do just that by making VA a more veteran - centered , results - oriented and forward - looking department .
It will be a different organization from the one that exists today .
It will be accessible , responsive and transparent .
To achieve the president 's vision , we must leverage new technologies to serve the various demographics and needs of today 's veterans , while also renewing our commitment to the older generation of veterans .
These technologies will carry us well into the 21st century as we maintain our mission to serve our nation 's veterans for the rest of their lives .
Tonight , 131,000 veterans will sleep on the streets of our cities .
These are the same men and women who allowed us to have the opportunities to go to school , get a job and buy a home .
We are all dishonored anytime a veteran is forced to sleep on the streets , and President Obama , Secretary Shinseki and the VA leadership team will not stand for this .
Within the next five years , we aim to eliminate veteran homelessness by providing grants to community - based organizations assisting homeless veterans and by attacking all the areas that often lead to homelessness .
Our veterans deserve better , and we are determined to provide them the best care and most timely benefits possible to end homelessness in their ranks .
We will improve medical care to minority veterans , including female veterans , who are enrolling in VA at historic rates .
We will also improve access to VA for veterans who live in rural areas .
All our veterans deserve the best care possible regardless of race , gender or where they live .
And we are working with the Department of Defense to build a fully interoperable electronic records system that will provide each member of our military with a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record .
For VA , this will revolutionize our claims process by making it faster with higher - quality decisions and with fewer errors .
Five years from now , we intend to make VA the provider of choice for veterans -- in insurance , health care , education , home loans and counseling .
We are going to be the advocate for veterans , their dependents and survivors to make sure we meet their needs , hear their concerns , and take proper action .
We know that we have a big task ahead of us .
But there is not a population more deserving of the absolute best than the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our freedoms .
In the same way that my crew refused to leave me behind , each and every one of us at VA will fight everyday for our nation 's military heroes to ensure that they are never left behind .
It is our turn to serve America 's warriors , and we at VA consider it a privilege .
" We were not able to surround and destroy that enemy because we were in a hurry and we assigned two generals to waste 15 days in negotiations with jackasses and idiots , " he said .

Replacing electron charge with electron spin paves the way for a new mode of computing .
Could spin cut the power consumption of silicon chips ?
Dave Porter / Alamy
Low - power computer chips that do n't rely on an electrical current to handle data have just come a big step closer .
The key result , unveiled today in Nature1 , sounds deceptively simple : scientists have injected electrons into silicon at room temperature and set a majority of them spinning in the same direction .
But the experiment " is a real breakthrough " , says Jaroslav Fabian , a theoretical physicist at the University of Regensburg , Germany .
" Silicon is entering in a big way into spintronics . "
Conventional electronics uses the electron 's charge to move and process information .
Spintronics — or spin- transport electronics — offers an alternative , relying on the electron 's magnetism , or spin , to encode information .
Charge can be stored and is easy to manipulate using electric fields , properties that have enabled electrical engineers to develop ever - smaller chips over the past four decades .
" But there are now increasing concerns that this progress may come to a halt , " says Ron Jansen , a physicist at the University of Twente in Enschede , the Netherlands .
As chips shrink they also become more complex and operate at higher speeds , driving an exponential growth in the amount of power needed to move electrons around them .
Unless an alternative can be found , Jansen says , electronic devices may soon become too power - hungry to be practical .
Jansen and others believe that the answer may lie in spin .
Rather than moving charges around , spin - based devices would simply have to flip the direction of an electron 's internal bar magnet .
Single - layer success
The difficulty with spintronics is that although electron spins are readily aligned in magnetic materials , they are less well - behaved in the semiconductors used in the electronics industry .
To build a spintronic device , researchers must be able to move spin-aligned electrons from magnetic to semiconductor materials without losing that alignment .
Previous experiments had managed the feat at ultra-cold temperatures , or by using exotic semiconductors such as gallium arsenide .
But now Jansen and his colleagues have successfully injected spin electrons en masse into everyday silicon at room temperatures1 .
The team began with a magnetic nickel–iron alloy used in the read head of hard - disk drives , and an ordinary slab of silicon .
Between the two they sandwiched an ultra - thin layer of aluminium oxide , roughly a nanometre thick .
The aluminium oxide acts as an insulator , but when a voltage is applied some electrons are able to quantum - mechanically tunnel from the magnetic material into the silicon .
The aluminium - oxide interface allows some spin directions to pass through more easily than others , creating a net excess of spins pointing in the same direction .
The key to the team 's success was the single layer of aluminium oxide .
Previous experiments had used two or more such layers , which stifled the flow of spin-aligned electrons .
A single , thin coating between the magnetic material and the silicon allowed the electrons to flow smoothly at room temperature .

The simplicity and reliability of the technique are likely to make it a new standard in the field , says Shinji Yuasa , a researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba , Japan .
But there are still a few more steps before spintronics can come to fruition , says Jansen .
Crucially , researchers must develop reliable ways to flip spins around once they are in silicon .
Still , " The building blocks are there , " he says .
" Now it 's just a matter of building something . "
Malcolm Turnbull 's future will be decided by his colleagues next Tuesday morning when the party will meet to consider a push led by Tony Abbott to hold a leadership spill .
The party is in crisis after mass resignations yesterday in protest against Mr Turnbull 's decision to back the Government 's emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) .
The Government is also heaping pressure on the Coalition after the Senate failed to vote on the legislation today , opening speculation about the possibility of a double dissolution election .
Ten MPs and senators , led by Mr Abbott , want to move a motion for a leadership spill at 9:00 am next Monday morning , with Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott emerging as possible replacements .
But Mr Turnbull 's office has confirmed the party will meet on Tuesday morning at 9:00 am to consider the motion .
The meeting will be held one day after the Government is hoping to get its ETS legislation through the Senate , as it sits all day Monday .
It will be the second motion held for a leadership spill in less than a week after a move last Wednesday failed .
Senator Nick Minchin - who also resigned yesterday - was this afternoon demanding Mr Turnbull agree to Mr Abbott 's demand .
" Given that someone like Tony Abbott and nine of his colleagues have requested a meeting at 9:00 am on Monday to consider the question of the leadership it is incumbent on the party to have that meeting at 9 am , " he said .
But climate change spokesman Ian Macfarlane says the timing of the meeting is Mr Turnbull 's prerogative .
" I 've told Malcolm Turnbull he has the numbers and it's his call , " he told PM .
" And Malcolm says he will never walk away from a fight . "
Mr Macfarlane also called on the climate change rebels to " show some honour " and let the deal go through that was agreed in the party room earlier this week .
" Are we going to have a spill every day or is it more sensible to do the job that is in front of us and keep our word with the Australian people ? " he said .
" It 's up to him when the meeting is held and , to be fair , it 's also up to some of the members , all of whom have gone back to their electorates . "
' Honour the agreement '
The Senate will sit on Monday but still has about 250 amendments to debate .
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard has urged the Opposition to honour the agreement Mr Turnbull made with the Government .
" And if they fail to honour the agreement then that will tell you that they have been conquered by the sceptics and deniers in their ranks , " he said .
" Mr Turnbull has shown great courage and great determination to deliver this change in the nation 's interests . "
But Ms Gillard would not speculate on whether today 's lengthy debate or a Coalition move to defer the legislation to a committee would give the Government a double dissolution trigger .
" We are not focused on anything other than delivering the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through the Parliament , " she said .
She also refused to be drawn on whether the Government would move to gag debate and bring on a vote on Monday .
Mr Turnbull has warned that if his party does not pass the scheme , it would face being wiped out at the next election .
If Mr Turnbull is deposed it is unlikely the ETS will clear the Senate this year .
The Times of India has a news report up about a 12 - year - old - girl raped in a moving car .
This happened in Palam , near the IGI airport in Delhi , where this seventh - standard girl was taken for a drive by her neighbours .
“ The car had tinted dark windows and I could n’t see anything , ” the girl said .
She was raped by both men .
A senior cop has been quoted as saying , “ The accused threatened the girl not to report the matter to the police . ”
And then :
The girl , however , recounted her ordeal to her parents who landed up at the Palam Village police station to lodge a case .
The police initially refused to treat the complaint seriously as “ that would bring a bad name to the family ” , said the girl ’s father , who works as a clerk in a private firm . [… ]
It was not until the media intervened and senior officials were sounded that the arrests were carried out .
In an earlier post on a similar subject , I wrote that “ our cops are generally an apathetic lot ” and that they were n’t too responsive to people who were n’t “ well heeled or well connected . ”
I then received disapproving emails from people , presumably connected to the internet , obviously writing in English , who insisted that from their personal experience , this was not so .
The police had always helped them out .
Well , duh .
Let me reiterate : for the vast majority of people in this country , the rule of law is notional .
If you live in a slum and your rights are infringed by some local gangster , you ’d have to be damn lucky to get any kind of justice .
This is especially true for women .
Indeed , out of the context of this particular case , imagine how hard it would be to be a single mother in a slum bringing up a couple of daughters .
Think of the daily stress .
And think of the bad name your family could get .
As previously reported , Merge has just reissued Neutral Milk Hotel 's two albums , 1996's On Avery Island and 1998 's stone classic
In the Aeroplane Over the Sea , on 180 - gram vinyl .
To mark the occasion , the folks at Merge have posted two live Neutral Milk Hotel videos on Merge 's blog .
They were filmed at New York 's Knitting Factory in 1998 .
We are n't sure if these videos are entirely new , but we 've never seen them before , and they 're certainly worth a view regardless .
In those two videos , which you can watch below , Jeff Mangum plays " Two - Headed Boy " and " April 8th " with the sort of fearsome intensity you rarely see from any performer , in any genre .

In pictures : Top Gear 's winning formula
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 16 November 2009
The article below about the television programme Top Gear said that presenter Richard Hammond 's Triumph Herald with a sail sunk in minutes when he attempted to cross the English Channel in it .
We meant sank , not sunk , and Hammond was driving a Volkswagen camper van .
The Triumph Herald belonged to James May , another of the show 's presenters .
In 1977 , the television equivalent of a beige Austin Allegro trundled on to our screens .
With its quaint name and features about road safety , Top Gear undertook the serious business of reviewing new cars .
In the years since , however , this Allegro of the airwaves has undergone a transformation every bit as dramatic as the family car , exploding into a colourful , snarling great SUV of a television programme .
Top Gear has in fact taken over the world .
It is now broadcast in more than 100 countries , claiming a global audience of 350 million .
It is the most illegally downloaded show on the planet .
Its format , which its makers describe as " crap men adventures with crap cars " , has turned three shabby , middle - aged motoring journalists into global rock stars .
This month not only sees a new series but a world tour , Top Gear Live , which will take the show to cities including Sydney , Cape Town , Hong Kong and Amsterdam .
Top Gear is not simply BBC2's highest rating programme ; it is a phenomenon .
Schoolboys and teenage girls flock to public appearances by its presenters , Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond and James May .
Even environmentally conscious viewers get guilty pleasure from its ludicrous stunts filmed with enormous budgets .
And it 's political : it kicks against what it sees as New Labour 's nanny state ( a Downing Street website poll demanding Clarkson become prime minister attracted nearly 50,000 signatures ) and does everything in its power to provoke the politically correct sensibilities of the BBC .
Barely a month passes without the show crashing into controversy , with Ofcom rulings on its jokes about prostitutes and suicide , and accusations that it is sexist , environmentally reckless and glamorises speeding .
To properly understand the show in its current format you have to go back – perhaps unsurprisingly – to school .
It was at the public school of Repton , almost 40 years ago , that a boy called Andy Wilman befriended a fellow boarder with " a massive gob , really bad music taste and massive hair – the full Leo Sayer " : the teenage Jeremy Clarkson .
The pair ended up working together on Top Gear , and according to Wilman , now the executive producer of the show , their schooldays have been a profound influence on the revamped model : the presenters behave as if they are still at school and are celebrated and condemned alike for their puerile sense of humour .
The arrival of the motormouth Clarkson in the late 80s shook up strait - laced Top Gear , but audiences declined after he departed in the late 90s .
Wilman , a burly , sweary 47 - year - old who , when we meet is frantically stitching together the new series in an edit suite in Soho , was actually sacked from the old model Top Gear in 1999 .
The show looked " fucking old - fashioned " next to new formats such as Changing Rooms , he says now , and after it was finally axed in 2001 , he and Clarkson got together over a pub lunch to draw up a manifesto for a brand new Top Gear .
One , it would have a news section so " important but boring " cars could be dispensed with quickly .
Two , it would be filmed before an audience in an old aircraft hangar , that would become " an oasis for people who like cars " .
Three , they would have an all - male line - up .
Four , and perhaps most importantly , " it would always be an unfair show , " says Wilman .
" The BBC would say , ' You should get Professor Suchabody on talking about the environment ' and we would go , ' Fuck off , he can have the Ten O'Clock News . '
Do the Two Fat Ladies say , ' And if you want to have a low - fat version of this recipe you can use single cream ' ?
They never do .
They go , ' Pile it on ; heart attack now ' . "
Other winning ingredients were arrived at more by accident .
The show needed a professional driver – but " a racing driver with brains " was impossible to find .
Clarkson suggested an anonymous masked driver who never spoke , like the Gimp in Pulp Fiction .
Wilman approached racing drivers : " We 'd ask , do you want to be this secret racing driver on Top Gear ?
They 'd say , ' I 'm on . '
You 'll be called the Gimp . . .
They 'd go , ' You can fuck off . ' "
So he and Clarkson relented : their " captive racing driver " would be called The Stig , the nickname for new boys at Repton .
The bolshy , rebranded Top Gear – a blend of TFI Friday , Tiswas and That 's Life , according to Wilman – was relaunched in 2002 , but it was not an immediate success .
" It was just a car show on BBC2 so we were afforded the time without having to force it , " explains Richard " the Hamster " Hammond when we talk .
" There was no artifice , there was no , ' Jeremy will be the big bombastic one and you , Richard , can be the short , noisy one . '
We just sat down and did what we did and we were afforded the opportunity to let it grow organically . "
The on - screen gang was completed with the arrival of the cerebral James May for the second series .
Whatever you think of these three white , middle - class , middle - aged men with their schoolboy humour , all three are smart .
Or , as a Top Gear editor said recently : " Thick people doing thick things is not funny .
Clever people doing clever things is not funny .
But clever people doing thick things really is funny . "
Their onscreen chemistry and cartoon characters took shape over several series .
" Jeremy is walk through a door rather than open it , Richard 's massively accident prone and cheeky chappie , and James is a pedantic nerd , " says Wilman .
His young children love these " black - and - white , tabloid characters " ;
Wilman jokes that Top Gear 's audience is all schoolboys and prisoners .
Hammond , who grew up as one of three brothers , points out that a trio works well : one of them always gets in trouble , or gets picked on .
Like any gang , they mercilessly take the piss and have even started to speak the same : Hammond now seems to echo May 's distinctive way of saying " I wuz " and " becuz " .
As audiences grew and Top Gear attracted A - list guests from Joanna Lumley to Usain Bolt to race in its " reasonably priced car " each week , its stunts became more outlandish and its films more exotic .
The trio graduated from converting old bangers into stretch limos to road trips across America , painting " Man Love Rules OK " in pink on an old pick - up for a ride through Alabama that ended with locals throwing rocks at them .
" One of our watchwords , a phrase that permeates our productions , is ' ambitious but crap ' , " says Hammond , chuckling to himself .
" I love setting off on projects like trying to make a car and cross the English Channel . "
Hammond 's Triumph Herald with a sail sunk in minutes and a coastguard called them irresponsible .
" I love setting off with deliberately childish and innocent and wide - eyed hopefulness , and I think people enjoy that . "
May , a donnish , genteel man nicknamed Captain Slow by his colleagues for his championing of comfort over speed in cars , thinks Top Gear gives viewers vicarious pleasure .
" Maybe a lot of people would like to make an amphibious car but not everybody can – we 'll tell you about it and hopefully keep you amused while we are doing it , " he says .
" We are not hidebound by the conventions of television or political correctness ; we just do what we think would be a good laugh and film it for television .
People quite like the refreshing honesty of it .
It 's a fairly simple concept , Top Gear : three blokes pushing the boundaries of automotive acceptability . "
It appeared they had pushed the boundaries too far in 2006 when Hammond nearly died while filming a stunt at Elvington airfield near York .
A tyre on his dragster burst as he reached 288 mph and a serious brain injury left him depressed and disorientated for many months .
" I 'd get confused between responses to things and I 'd respond in the wrong way to things ; it would be heartfelt and genuine but wrong , " he says now .
" Ongoing from that was a phase of a propensity for depression , for compulsion , for paranoia .
I experienced those things and they are very unpleasant . "
When Hammond returned to Top Gear , Clarkson handed him a tissue in case he started " dribbling " – another crass joke that was jumped on by critics .
" Just because we make light of it on the show , do n't think for a second I make light of it myself because I do n't – it was bloody horrible , " Hammond says .
While Wilman is called " the boss " by Hammond , Clarkson is the " engine room " of Top Gear according to Wilman .
" It 's Jeremy 's show .
No question , because it can't be a democracy .
It 's Jeremy 's vision .
We 've all got drive but his drive is noticeably amazing . "
Arriving home at midnight after a recent Top Gear Live event , Clarkson worked on a rough edit of the new series and called Wilman with his notes at 8 am the next day .
" I doubt Jonathan Ross is doing that , " Wilman says .
Clarkson would not be interviewed for this article .
He refuses all interviews , claims Top Gear 's publicist , although he pops up in the pages of the Sun and the Sunday Times often enough .
Which is a shame , because Clarkson is an easy hate figure for Guardian readers , even those who secretly enjoy Top Gear .
He seems to ooze contempt for the environment .
During filming for Top Gear , it was claimed he damaged a peat bog in Scotland .
On another occasion , the BBC was forced to apologise after he rammed a pick - up into a chestnut tree to test the vehicle 's strength .
He rails against political correctness and health and safety regulations , and earlier this summer was accused of calling Gordon Brown " a cunt " in unbroadcast comments to his Top Gear audience , whom he has also referred to as " oafs " .
He has been condemned by chief constables for glamorising speeding , has joked about truck drivers murdering prostitutes , and said a woman presenter would be " a disaster " on Top Gear .
He sounds like a sexist monster and a bully , but then Clarkson 's reactionary opinions are probably the calculated wind - ups of a professional stirrer .
Wilman 's account of their schooldays is revealing : " Going to school together is more important than most people realise with Top Gear , " he says .
At school , Clarkson found his niche perpetually needling teachers and those in authority .
" He 'd be like somebody doing that to you . "
Wilman leans over and repeatedly prods me with his finger .
" If they do that to you for four years , you want to kill them . "
The pair learned in boarding school that there was a limit to punishments – they already had bad food and early bedtime – so they felt almost untouchable .
" Which is why I can't be arsed with Ofcom , " Wilman says of their frequent brushes with authority .
( The latest was this week , when the regulator ruled that Top Gear breached broadcasting regulations with its spoof VW advert depicting a suicide . )
" If the BBC get cross with us , we struggle to take it seriously . "
Curiously , the Labour government has been another ingredient in Top Gear 's success .
" I believe there is a load of reasons why Top Gear is popular – families like it , girls like to watch men being thick and we do that with aplomb , and the third thing is we are a release valve for people who get nagged to fuck , " says Wilman .
" We know this Labour administration has put more rules in since ' 97 than anyone else because they have passed more laws . "
May agrees .
" I hope people like the fact we 're not going to be cowed into toeing the Labour party line .
We do n't like being told by other people how we should live and how we should think . "
He pauses and adds with genial irony : " We 're striking out for freedom on Top Gear . "
Under a Conservative government , Top Gear 's status as an enjoyably subversive pleasure may disappear .
Wilman admits the team are " a bit Tory wanker " , but argues they will " end up doing opposition " because any new government will " still pop the motorist because it 's an easy target " .
One analogy that keeps returning to Top Gear is of a rock band .
After years of obscurity , this gang of four blokes has gone global .
They may be at the peak of their powers – with their world tour , solo projects , long hair , helicopters and big houses in the country – but just like jaded rockers they sense their own mortality .
Indeed , May has said that if he had known how massive Top Gear would become , he would not have joined in the first place .
Hammond is not convinced : " James is not without ambition .
None of us are .
You do n't do our job unless you really want to .
It does n't happen by accident and do n't think for a second it does .
But none of us imagined it would get this big . "
If personality clashes do n't kill Top Gear ( these days , the presenters sound increasingly convincing when they describe how much they dislike each other ) , then budget cuts might .
On BBC orders , Top Gear has cut costs this year and must do so again next year .
Wilman is worried that its lavish films – " our signature dish " – will suffer .
It has been reported that each show costs £ 100,000 , but " it 's more than that , " Wilman brags .
" We spend that on crisps . "
Global rights and merchandising make millions for Worldwide , the BBC 's commercial arm , which then pays for a quarter of Top Gear 's budget .
The rest is from the licence fee .
But reports that Clarkson earns £ 2 m a year are " the biggest pile of bollocks , " says Wilman .
" They are not getting paid stupid money . "
As well as the budget , Top Gear has been forced into a new , schoolboy - unfriendly 9 pm time - slot because The X Factor results show is now at 8 pm on Sunday .
Wilman would happily have Simon Cowell back on Top Gear , but " this time we might cut through the brakes " .
Critics may dislike Top Gear 's swagger and argue that it appears more scripted these days ( not true , says Wilman ) .
For the new series , they have romped around South America in 4x4s , crashed a caravan - airship and are hoping to create a smash - hit art exhibition out of cars .
If Top Gear is a rock band , are n't these expensive stunts a self - indulgent concept album too far ?
Wilman insists they do not stage their misadventures but admits it is " less spontaneous " after 13 series .
" We know we want calamities to happen .
There is no surprise to us any more , just relief , when things go wrong , " he says .
Unlike great rock bands , he does not think they will be destroyed by their own hubris .
" It will end because we are a one - trick pony , as all good shows are , and at some point we will run out of ideas or the public will go , ' We 've got the point now . ' " he says .
" But we 'll run out of songs first . "
A new series of Top Gear begins on BBC2 at 9 pm on Sunday , and also on the BBC HD channel .
Hillary Transue could n’t imagine that anyone could take serious offense .
In July 2006 she had created a MySpace page that mocked the vice principal of her high school in Mountain Top , Pa. , by suggesting the woman daydreamed “ about Johnny Depp in nothing but tighty whites . ”
The first shock for Transue , then 14 , was that the vice principal notified the police and pressed harassment charges .
But that was nothing compared to her disbelief when she appeared before juvenile judge Mark Ciavarella Jr. in April 2007 .
Expecting no more than a slap on the wrist , she and her mother , Laurene , had n’t even hired a lawyer .
Instead she got a harsh lecture from Ciavarella , who ended by announcing “ adjudicated delinquent ! ” and banging down his gavel .
Hillary was taken away in handcuffs , sentenced to three months in a boot camp .
“ The whole thing lasted about 30 seconds , ” she says .
“ It was so surreal . ”
But all too common in Luzerne County , as it turned out .
Stunned by what had happened to her daughter , Laurene Transue began asking questions about the workings of Ciavarella ’s court .
She ultimately enlisted the assistance of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia , which helped the FBI uncover an astonishing scandal : Ciavarella and another judge , Michael Conahan , pleaded guilty on Feb. 12 to $ 2.6 million in fraud and tax evasion in a kickback scheme that federal prosecutors say involved sending thousands of juveniles to two private detention facilities — even if it meant railroading teens for the smallest infractions .
( Ciavarella and Conahan have denied that they were paid cash for kids . )
On March 26 a Pennsylvania judge announced that the records of hundreds of kids sent away would be expunged , with the prospect that even more would be cleared in the months ahead .
“ It ’s impossible to describe the level of outrage you feel , ” says Marsha Levick , deputy director of the Juvenile Law Center .
“ There is nothing else in the history of the legal system like it . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Certainly Transue had never experienced anything like what she found at Camp Adams .
( Prosecutors have not accused Camp Adams of being part of the kickback scheme . )
On arrival she was given a pair of sweatpants , a T - shirt and used underwear .
“ It was raining , and it looked like a desolate campground in the middle of nowhere , ” she says .
“ The first night was pretty horrible .
I cried a lot . ”
She was allowed to speak to her family for only eight minutes a week .
Laurene contacted the Juvenile Law Center , which furnished an attorney who got Hillary another hearing before Ciavarella .
After a month Hillary was set free .
But officials at the Law Center , appalled by Ciavarella ’s treatment of Hillary , pressed their inquiry about why the judge seemed to have turned a key legal principle — which is to use incarceration of juveniles only as a last resort — on its head .
The investigators came across numerous cases of what appeared to be grotesquely severe punishment handed out by Ciavarella .
One of them involved Charlie Balasavage of Wilkes - Barre , whose ordeal began in the summer of 2006 when he was 15 and his parents bought him a used motor bike from a cousin .
A few weeks later , the police showed up at the house to inform Charlie that the bike had been stolen .
The family explained they had no idea , but that did n’t matter — all three of them were arrested .
The charges against Charlie ’s parents , Charlie Sr. and Joanne , were quickly dropped .
But in January 2007 Charlie was summoned to appear before Ciavarella .
Outside the courtroom parents and their children waited to be called in .
The Balasavages soon realized that they were in for trouble .
How ?
“ That day I did not see one parent come out with a kid , ” says Charlie , “ and there were a lot of kids . ”
Sure enough , when it was Charlie ’s turn , Ciavarella threw the book at him , sentencing him to six months at Camp Adams and having him led away in shackles .
( Adults convicted of receiving stolen merchandise usually get probation . )
Since then Charlie has been to more than half a dozen youth offender camps , two of which have been implicated in the kickback scheme .
“ You feel you ’re in this wind tunnel , ” says an angry Joanne , “ a whirlpool , and you ca n’t get out . ”
Parents felt powerless to stand up to the judges .
“ Ciavarella sold kids like they were cattle — black , white , it did n’t matter what color they were , ” says Fredrick Johnson , whose son DayQuawn , 16 , was thrown in a juvenile facility for three days in 2006 .
His crime ?
He had been given a subpoena to testify against a classmate who allegedly had a knife .
DayQuawn , who was 13 and suffers from a learning disability , never told his parents and never showed up for the hearing , which led to his being hauled away from his school in handcuffs .
Attorneys for the Juvenile Law Center discovered that kids who appeared before Ciavarella were sent to detention facilities 26 percent of the time , while the state average is between 8 and 10 percent .
What ’s more , a large number of kids were evidently encouraged to waive their right to have an attorney present .
Prosecutors say Conahan even made sure authorities shut down a county facility for juveniles that would have competed with the private ones .
There were rumbles about irregularities in Ciavarella ’s courtroom , but for years nothing came of them .
“ In that courtroom you were presumed guilty , ” says attorney Barry Dyller , who had clients before Ciavarella .
“ But whatever anyone ’s suspicions , no one had actual evidence of wrongdoing . ”

Members of the Republican Party are angry at President Barack Obama ’s Nobel Prize for Peace because none of their politicians will win one anytime soon , says US House Rep. Alan Grayson .
“ I think I understand their disappointment , ” Grayson told MSNBC ’s Ed Schultz on Friday .
“ They ’re not going to be winning the Nobel Peace Prize anytime soon .
They probably wish there was a Nobel prize for fear , a Nobel prize for hatred , a Nobel prize for racism .
Then they ’d be in the running . ”

Schultz aired a clip of Grayson speaking on the House floor Thursday , in which the Florida congressman took on the Republicans for their opposition to much of the Obama White House ’s agenda .
“ America understands that there ’s one party in this country that ’s in favor of health care reform , and one party that ’s against it , and they know why , ” Grayson told the House .
“ They understand that if Barack Obama were somehow able to cure hunger in the world , the Republicans would blame him for overpopulation , ” Grayson continued .
“ They understand that if Barack Obama were to somehow bring about world peace , they would blame him for destroying the defense industry .
In fact they understand that if Barack Obama had a BLT for lunch tomorrow , they would try to ban bacon . ”
Grayson ( D - FL ) has recently been thrown into the spotlight as one of the most vocal , and perhaps controversial , supporters of health care reform .
Last month , he raised the ire of congressional Republicans when he described the GOP ’s health care policy as hoping that sick people “ die quickly . ”
When Republicans demanded an apology , Grayson took to the floor of the House and pointed to a Harvard study showing that 44,000 Americans die every year due to lack of access to health care .
“ I apologize to the dead , ” Grayson said .

Kraken , by China Miéville ( Ballantine )
Miéville plunged us into magical noir realism with this year 's The City & The City , but promises to return to a more scifi / fantasy world with Kraken .
The author is so spoiler - averse that very little is known about this book , other than the auspicious title .

And even if the title turns out to be entirely misleading , I 'm still along for the ride .

Its organisers need a safe place to meet , and where better than the virtual spaces of an online game ?
Lucy , who works for a start - up games company in Edinburgh , has a project that almost seems made for the job : a game inspired by The Krassniad : an epic folk tale concocted by Lucy 's mother Amanda , who studied there in the 1980s .
Lucy knows Amanda is a spook .
She knows her great - grandmother Eugenie also visited the country in the '30s , and met the man who originally collected Krassnian folklore , and who perished in Stalin 's terror .
As Lucy digs up details about her birthplace to slot into the game , she finds the open secrets of her family 's past , the darker secrets of Krassnia 's past - and hints about the crucial role she is destined to play in The Restoration Game ...

Blackout , by Connie Willis ( Spectra )
Award - winning author Willis returns to the world she created in her time - travel masterpiece Doomsday Book with this tale of World War II in London .
Here 's the book jacket description :
Oxford in 2060 is a chaotic place .
Scores of time - traveling historians are being sent into the past , to destinations including the American Civil War and the attack on the World Trade Center .
Michael Davies is prepping to go to Pearl Harbor .
Merope Ward is coping with a bunch of bratty 1940 evacuees and trying to talk her thesis adviser , Mr. Dunworthy , into letting her go to VE Day .
Polly Churchill 's next assignment will be as a shopgirl in the middle of London 's Blitz .
And seventeen - year - old Colin Templer , who has a major crush on Polly , is determined to go to the Crusades so that he can " catch up " to her in age .
But now the time - travel lab is suddenly canceling assignments for no apparent reason and switching around everyone 's schedules .
And when Michael , Merope , and Polly finally get to World War II , things just get worse .
For there they face air raids , blackouts , unexploded bombs , dive - bombing Stukas , rationing , shrapnel , V - 1s , and two of the most incorrigible children in all of history - to say nothing of a growing feeling that not only their assignments but the war and history itself are spiraling out of control .
Because suddenly the once - reliable mechanisms of time travel are showing significant glitches , and our heroes are beginning to question their most firmly held belief : that no historian can possibly change the past .

Redemption in Indigo is a clever and entrancing debut which incorporates folktales to tell the story of a woman who frees herself from a troublesome and capricious husband only to become the unwitting heroine in a fantastic struggle to reconcile the supernatural forces of fate with humanity 's free will .

Lord writes that the book is set " in a vaguely African - Caribbean imaginary country ( such as one might expect from a Barbadian writer inspired by a Senegalese folk tale ) . "
Among Others , by Jo Walton ( Tor )
Walton is the beloved author of the alternate history series that begins with Farthing , set in London after Hitler wins World War II ; and she penned the world 's only drawing room melodrama featuring dragons as main characters , Tooth and Claw .
She 's the master of rich detail , dark wit , and plotting that sucks you in before you realize it .
Among Others is a change of pace for her , a semi-autobiographical tale of growing up nerdy .
Of course the book contains fantastical subplots , and characters who are heartbreakingly real - especially for people who grew up with their noses buried in fantasy novels .
There is no way you should miss out on this one .

Kosher Guide to Imaginary Animals , by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer ( Tachyon )
When Ann VanderMeer told me about this book , I was instantly in love with the idea .
A handsomely - illustrated collection of imaginary creatures , this is actually a Kosher cooking guide for those with fantastic palates .
The VanderMeers consulted with chefs familiar with Kosher cooking to find out which creatures of yore belong on the Passover table , and which should be avoided if you want to stay Kosher .
A demented homage to cooking , Judaism , and monsters , this is pretty much the perfect book for your coffee table .
Zendegi , by Greg Egan ( Night Shade )
Anything new from Egan is always cause for celebration , because this guy knows his science and has an imagination that 's ridiculously pyrotechnic .
Though he 's penned some incredible space operas set a zillion years into the posthuman future , Zendegi finds Egan focusing on Earth in the near - term .
Here 's the scoop , from the publisher :
Nasim is a young computer scientist , hoping to work on the Human Connectome Project : a plan to map every neural connection in the human brain .
But funding for the project is cancelled , and Nasim ends up devoting her career to Zendegi , a computerised virtual world used by millions of people .
Fifteen years later , a revived Connectome Project has published a map of the brain .
Zendegi is facing fierce competition from its rivals , and Nasim decides to exploit the map to fill the virtual world with better Proxies : the bit- players that bring its crowd scenes to life .
As controversy rages over the nature and rights of the Proxies , a friend with terminal cancer begs Nasim to make a Proxy of him , so some part of him will survive to help raise his orphaned son .
But Zendegi is about to become a battlefield .

Expect nothing short of amazing from this conclusion to the Chaos Walking series .
Lightborn , by Tricia Sullivan ( Orbit )
Here 's a description :
Lightborn , better known as ' shine ' , is a mind - altering technology that has revolutionised the modern world .
It is the ultimate in education , self - improvement and entertainment - beamed directly into the brain of anyone who can meet the asking price .
But in the city of Los Sombres , renegade shine has attacked the adult population , resulting in social chaos and widespread insanity in everyone past the age of puberty .
The only solution has been to turn off the Field and isolate the city .

New Model Army , by Adam Roberts ( Gollancz )
Roberts is a darling of the literary scifi scene , and his new novel sounds like it will be intriguing and thought - provoking , as well as a good satire .
Set in a near - future England , the novel is about a civil war that rips the UK apart .
But it 's also about social media technologies , because the group that unseats the British army is the world 's first " truly democratic army , " assembled via new grassroots communications technologies .
I 'm always interested to see critical explorations of where the so - called liberating power of social networking might take us .
And I want to see where Roberts goes with this one .
Death of the Author , by Scarlett Thomas ( Houghton Mifflin )
I fell in love with Thomas after reading The End of Mr. Y , her novel about enchanted books , body - hopping , the nature of belief , and hundreds of mice .
Like Roberts ,
Thomas is known for her philosophically - minded writing , which she leavens with extremely weird plot developments that will keep you reading .
Not much is known about her new novel , other than that the title is borrowed from an essay by Roland Barthes about how a truly good critic should n't care what the author 's intent was in writing a story .
Often , the best interpretations ignore what the author intended entirely , which is why Barthes argues that the author is for all intents and purposes dead .
Given Thomas ' love of post - structuralist types like Barthes , I predict a bizarro slant on this idea , which will hopefully involve some angry dead authors begging to differ .

Thanks to Niall Harrison for some great suggestions !
Scientists advocate a switch to people powered transport for health and climate
Cutting emissions to mitigate climate change will also make people healthier , according to research .
A special series of articles , published in medical journal , the Lancet , outlines how such policies could have a direct impact on global health .
The series has been released ahead of the UN climate summit in Copenhagen .
World Health Organization ( WHO ) director , Margaret Chan , said health protection should be a criterion by which mitigation measures were judged .
Dr Chan was just one of the key figures in global health research who wrote a comment article that was published alongside the Lancet reports .
Another was Professor Sir Andrew Haines , director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , who is chair of the international task force of scientists that wrote the series .
KEY FINDINGS
Food : High - producing countries should reduce livestock production by 30 % .
If this translated into reduced meat consumption , the amount of saturated fat consumed would drop sharply , which could reduce heart disease Transport : Cutting emissions through walking and cycling and reducing use of motor vehicles would bring health benefits including reduced cardiovascular disease , depression and dementia Household :
In low - income countries , solid fuel stoves create indoor air pollution .
National programmes to introduce low - emission stoves could avert millions of premature deaths and reduce greenhouse gas emissions Pollution : Short - lived pollutants including ozone and black carbon contribute to climate change and damage health .
Reducing emissions of these would offer immediate benefits Energy : Decreasing the proportion of carbon - based electricity generation would give health benefits worldwide , particularly in middle - income countries such as India and China
He said that the public health benefits of mitigation policies had not had " sufficient prominence " in international negotiations .
Dr Chan commented : " As this series shows , cutting greenhouse gas emissions can represent a mutually reinforcing opportunity to reduce climate change and improve public health . "
Some of the key findings presented in the reports included evidence that moving towards low carbon transport systems could reduce the health impacts of urban air pollution and physical inactivity .
Researchers also found that changes in farming practice to reduce livestock and meat consumption could improve health by lowering the intake of saturated fat .
And in poor countries , reducing the need to burn solid fuel indoors could have a significant impact on child and maternal health by cutting indoor air pollution .
Dr Chan pointed out that the poorest countries were the most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change .
Cleaner energy
In one of the articles , scientists from the Basque Centre for Climate Change in Bilbao , Spain , showed how decreasing fossil - fuel - dependent electricity generation could have significant health benefits worldwide .
The researchers said that the middle - income countries such as India and China would benefit most .
A reduction in pollution there could prevent many of the premature deaths that are associated with heart and lung damage caused by inhaling the polluting particles .
But the researchers also examined the health impacts in wealthier countries .
One group of researchers described the results of an 18 - year study of the long - term health effects of pollution in the US .
The team , led by Professor Kirk Smith from the School of Public Health at the University of California , Berkeley , US , pointed out that " short - lived " greenhouse pollutants , such as particles of black carbon and ozone , can directly damage the heart and lungs .
They said that " separate climate change agreements " might be needed for these pollutants .
In another paper , scientists quantified changes that were needed in the agricultural sector , which contributes 10 - 12 % of total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide .
They wrote that " high - producing countries " should reduce livestock production by 30 % to slow climate change .
Should this translate into a reduction in the consumption of meat , the scientists say that it could also reduce heart disease .
Researchers called for health and climate change scientists to work together and for more funding for such interdisciplinary projects .
Copenhagen hope
The editor of the Lancet , Dr Richard Horton cautioned against putting too much pressure on the Copenhagen meeting .
He said : " By suggesting that Copenhagen is the ' last chance ' for a binding international climate change agreement , anything less will seem a failure .
" Copenhagen is a beginning , not the end . "
Professor Haines said : " The Copenhagen conference presents an important opportunity to choose those policies that can not only achieve needed reductions in greenhouse gases , but also move toward development and health goals . "

For 35 years , William John Woods has made wooden toys for children .
Each one of the 2,000 or so he makes each year passes through his hands at his shop in Ogunquit , Maine , and no child , he said , has ever been hurt by one of his small boats , cars , helicopters or rattles .
But now he and others like him  makers of small toys and owners of toy resale shops and boutique stores  say their livelihood is being threatened by federal legislation enacted in the last year to protect children from toxic toys through more extensive testing .
Big toymakers , including those whose tainted imports from China led to the recall of 45 million toys and spurred Congress to take action , have more resources and are able to comply with the new law ’s requirements .
“ This is absurd , ” said Mr. Woods , whose toys are made of maple , walnut and cherry and finished with walnut oil and beeswax from a local apiary .
He estimates it would cost him $ 30,000  a figure he calculated from having to pay $ 400 in required tests for each of the 80 or so different items he produces  to show that they are not toxic .
“ I use beeswax , ” Mr. Woods said .
“ The law was targeted at large toymakers using lead .
There was no exclusion for benign products . ”
There is no point in denying it : we 're losing .
Climate change denial is spreading like a contagious disease .
It exists in a sphere that cannot be reached by evidence or reasoned argument ; any attempt to draw attention to scientific findings is greeted with furious invective .
This sphere is expanding with astonishing speed .
A survey last month by the Pew Research Centre suggests that the proportion of Americans who believe there is solid evidence that the world has been warming over the last few decades has fallen from 71 % to 57 % in just 18 months .
Another survey , conducted in January by Rasmussen Reports , suggests that , due to a sharp rise since 2006 , US voters who believe global warming has natural causes ( 44 % ) outnumber those who believe it is the result of human action ( 41 % ) .
A study by the website Desmogblog shows that the number of internet pages proposing that man-made global warming is a hoax or a lie more than doubled last year .
The Science Museum 's Prove it !
exhibition asks online readers to endorse or reject a statement that they 've seen the evidence and want governments to take action .
As of yesterday afternoon , 1,006 people had endorsed it and 6,110 had rejected it .
On Amazon.co.uk , books championing climate change denial are currently ranked at 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 and 8 in the global warming category .
Never mind that they 've been torn to shreds by scientists and reviewers , they are beating the scientific books by miles .
What is going on ?
It certainly does n't reflect the state of the science , which has hardened dramatically over the past two years .
If you do n't believe me , open any recent edition of Science or Nature or any peer - reviewed journal specialising in atmospheric or environmental science .
Go on , try it .
The debate about global warming that 's raging on the internet and in the rightwing press does not reflect any such debate in the scientific journals .
An American scientist I know suggests that these books and websites cater to a new literary market : people with room - temperature IQs .
He did n't say whether he meant fahrenheit or centigrade .
But this can't be the whole story .
Plenty of intelligent people have also declared themselves sceptics .
One such is the critic Clive James .
You could accuse him of purveying trite received wisdom , but not of being dumb .
On Radio 4 a few days ago he delivered an essay about the importance of scepticism , during which he maintained that " the number of scientists who voice scepticism [ about climate change ] has lately been increasing " .
He presented no evidence to support this statement and , as far as I can tell , none exists .
But he used this contention to argue that " either side might well be right , but I think that if you have a division on that scale , you can't call it a consensus .
Nobody can meaningfully say that the science is in . "
Had he bothered to take a look at the quality of the evidence on either side of this media debate , and the nature of the opposing armies – climate scientists on one side , rightwing bloggers on the other – he too might have realised that the science is in .
In , at any rate , to the extent that science can ever be , which is to say that the evidence for man-made global warming is as strong as the evidence for Darwinian evolution , or for the link between smoking and lung cancer .
I am constantly struck by the way in which people like James , who proclaim themselves sceptics , will believe any old claptrap that suits their views .
Their position was perfectly summarised by a supporter of Ian Plimer ( author of a marvellous concatenation of gibberish called Heaven and Earth ) , commenting on a recent article in the Spectator : " Whether Plimer is a charlatan or not , he speaks for many of us . "
These people are n't sceptics ; they 're suckers .
Such beliefs seem to be strongly influenced by age .
The Pew report found that people over 65 are much more likely than the rest of the population to deny that there is solid evidence that the earth is warming , that it 's caused by humans , or that it 's a serious problem .
This chimes with my own experience .
Almost all my fiercest arguments over climate change , both in print and in person , have been with people in their 60s or 70s .
Why might this be ?
There are some obvious answers : they wo n't be around to see the results ; they were brought up in a period of technological optimism ; they feel entitled , having worked all their lives , to fly or cruise to wherever they wish .
But there might also be a less intuitive reason , which shines a light into a fascinating corner of human psychology .
In 1973 the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker proposed that the fear of death drives us to protect ourselves with " vital lies " or " the armour of character " .
We defend ourselves from the ultimate terror by engaging in immortality projects , which boost our self - esteem and grant us meaning that extends beyond death .
More than 300 studies conducted in 15 countries appear to confirm Becker 's thesis .
When people are confronted with images or words or questions that remind them of death they respond by shoring up their worldview , rejecting people and ideas that threaten it , and increasing their striving for self - esteem .
One of the most arresting findings is that immortality projects can bring death closer .
In seeking to defend the symbolic , heroic self that we create to suppress thoughts of death , we might expose the physical self to greater danger .
For example , researchers at Bar - Ilan University in Israel found that people who reported that driving boosted their self - esteem drove faster and took greater risks after they had been exposed to reminders of death .
A recent paper by the biologist Janis L Dickinson , published in the journal Ecology and Society , proposes that constant news and discussion about global warming makes it difficult to repress thoughts of death , and that people might respond to the terrifying prospect of climate breakdown in ways that strengthen their character armour but diminish our chances of survival .
There is already experimental evidence that some people respond to reminders of death by increasing consumption .
Dickinson proposes that growing evidence of climate change might boost this tendency , as well as raising antagonism towards scientists and environmentalists .
Our message , after all , presents a lethal threat to the central immortality project of western society : perpetual economic growth , supported by an ideology of entitlement and exceptionalism .
If Dickinson is correct , is it fanciful to suppose that those who are closer to the end of their lives might react more strongly against reminders of death ?
I have n't been able to find any experiments testing this proposition , but it is surely worth investigating .
And could it be that the rapid growth of climate change denial over the last two years is actually a response to the hardening of scientific evidence ?
If so , how the hell do we confront it ?
( Washington , DC ) – Cuban authorities should cease all attacks on human rights defenders , journalists , bloggers and civic activists , Human Rights Watch said today .
The international community should condemn attacks on those who peacefully exercise their basic rights to freedom of expression , opinion , and assembly in the strongest terms .
On November 6 , Cuba ’s most prominent blogger , Yoani Sánchez , together with blogger Orlando Luís Pardo Lazo , were abducted by three men .
Sánchez and Pardo were forced into an unmarked vehicle , beaten , and threatened by their captors before being released onto the street .
“ The Cuban authorities are using brute force to try to silence Yoani Sánchez ’s only weapon : her ideas , ” said José Miguel Vivanco , Americas director of Human Rights Watch .
“ The international community must send a firm message to Raul Castro that such attacks on independent voices are completely unacceptable . ”
Sánchez and Pardo had been walking to attend a “ march against violence ” in Havana when they were abducted .
When Sánchez called for help and bystanders started to intervene , one of the captors warned the other civilians , “ Do n’t get involved , these people are counterrevolutionaries . ”
Sánchez wrote that , while in the car , “ one man put his knee on my chest and the other , from the seat next to me , was punching me in the face . ”
The captors told Sanchez that her “ clowning around ” was finished .
Cuba is the only country in the region that continues to repress virtually all forms of political dissent .
“ This brazen attack makes clear that no one in Cuba who voices dissent is safe from violent reprisals , ” said Vivanco .
As I blogged about awhile back , this week , Perry Klebhan , Alex Kazaks , Huggy Rao and I are running rather intense executive program called Customer - Focused Innovation .
As you can see from the schedule , we are keeping the 21 executives in the program mighty busy .
We kicked off with a tire - changing exercise led by Andy Papa , who among other things leads the pit crews at Hendrick 's Motor Sports , where one team established the all time CFI speed record , changing in a tire on a NASCAR racing car in under 13 seconds .
Yesterday , the group spent the day at the Tesla dealer in Menlo Park talking to owners , potential customers , people in sales and marketing at Tesla , and people who did n't like the idea of owning a Tesla at all .
In the picture above , the two executives on the left are interviewing George Kembel , the d.school 's executive director ( he is the tall guy facing the camera ) and the group on the right is interviewing one of the Tesla salespeople ( the woman in black with sunglasses in her hair ) .
The idea is to use their observations , empathy for others , and identified needs to develop prototype solutions to improve the Tesla car ownership experience .
The group focuses on cases , theories , and models in the mornings , and applying design thinking in the Tesla project in the afternoon .
It is a lively and motivated group , and we all are very curious to see the suggestions and prototypes they offer to Tesla executives on Thursday .
Huggy Rao and I kicked off yesterday morning by doing case discussions and a bit of lecture on the hallmarks of innovative organizations .
As part of that session , I put together the list below for the executives .
I 've also included links for anyone who wants to dig into the subject a bit further .
I will add a few more ideas and links during the course of the week .
I would love to hear some additional ways that great bosses spark innovation and comments -- and extensions -- on the ideas below .
Leading Innovation : 21 Things that Great Bosses Believe and Do
1. Creativity means doing new things with old ideas .
2. Treat innovation as an import - export business .
Keep trying to bring in ideas from outside your group or organization , keep trying to show and tell others about your ideas , and blend them all together .
3. Look for and build “ intersections ” places where people with diverse ideas gather together .
And when you go there , talk to the people you do n’t know , who have ideas you know nothing about , and ideas you find weird , do n’t like , or useless .
4 . Treat your beliefs as “ strong opinions , weakly held . ”
5. Learn how to listen , watch , and keep your mouth shut .
6. Say “ I do n’t know ” on a regular basis .
7 . Have the courage to act on what you know , and the humility to doubt your beliefs and actions .
8. Reward success and ( intelligent ) failure , but punish inaction .
9 . Make it safe for people to take risky actions and “ fail forward , ” by developing a “ forgive and remember culture . ”
10 . Encourage people to learn from others ’ failures – it is faster , easier , and less painful .
11 . Eliminate hiring and reward practices that reinforce cultures where “ the best you can be is a perfect imitation of those who came before you . ”
12 . Hire people who make your squirm .
13 . Create teams composed of both experts and novices .
14 .
Make it safe for people to fight as if they are right , and listen as if they wrong .
15 . Encourage your people to be “ happy worriers . ”
16 . Sometimes , the best management is no management at all .
Know when and how to get out of the way .
17 .
Have the confidence and resolve to make tough decisions , stop your people from whining about the decisions made , and to get on with implementing them .
18 . Kill a lot of ideas , including a lot of good ideas .
19 . Innovation entails creativity + implementation .
Developing or finding a great idea is useless if you can't implement it or sell it to someone who believes they can .
20 . Remember Rao’s Recipe for Innovation : Will + Ideas +
Tools .
21 . Innovation requires selling your ideas .
The greatest innovators , from Edison to Jobs , are gifted at generating excitement and sales .
If you can't or wo n't sell , team - up with someone who can .
As I edited this list a bit , I realized it is important to remind people that there is a lot about innovation that sucks .
Yes , it is necessary , but innovator beware , it is an inefficient and distressing process plagued by a high failure rate -- and a lot of self - delusion .
And that is when you are doing it right !

Los Angeles County sheriff ’s detectives are investigating an assault on a 12 - year - old middle school boy in Calabasas who may have been targeted after a Facebook group urged students to beat up redheads , a sheriff ’s official said today .
The boy was kicked and hit in two separate incidents on the campus of A.E. Wright Middle School in Calabasas by as many as 14 of his classmates , Lt. Richard Erickson said .
The students who participated in the attack may have been motivated by a Facebook message telling them that Nov. 20 was “ Kick a Ginger Day , ” Erickson said , but had few other details about the message .
A “ ginger ” is label given to people with red hair , freckles and fair skin .
Erickson said the victim has red hair .
He said the Facebook message stems from an episode of the animated show TV “ South Park . ”
A show in 2005 focused on prejudice against " gingers . "
The incident occurred about 8:30 a.m. Friday .
The boy sought help from the school nurse , who contacted the principal .
Sheriff ’s officials arrived on campus shortly afterward .
“ He was accosted by seventh - and then eighth - graders , ” Erickson said .
“ He was kicked and hit with fists in various areas of the body . ”
No arrests have been made yet .
Detectives are investigating the incident as a possible assault with a deadly weapon .
Erickson said he did n’t believe that the boy ’s injuries were serious enough to require hospitalization .
The victim 's name was not released because he is a juvenile .
Deputies believe there may have been other victims but no other students have come forward .
The principal of A.E. Wright , Kimmarie Taylor , could not be reached for comment today .
One parent , Steve Bernal , said he was told that school officials made an public address announcement about discrimination and then teachers led discussions about the topic in their classrooms .
Bernal said he was upset about what happened but glad that the school responded so well .
He said he was concerned about how the Internet may have motivated the students involved .
“ How does this happen off of Facebook ? ” he said .
“ Does n’t Facebook monitor these groups that are being created ? ”
Bernal said what happened prompted him to have a candid conversation with his daughter .
“ First thing that I need to do is start talking to my daughter more , ” he said .
“ It ’s an eye - opener as a parent . ”
Last year on the same day , several similar incidents occurred in Canada , according to media reports .
Anyone with information about the Calabasas incident is encouraged to call the sheriff 's station at ( 818 ) 878-1808 .

Foreigners in Canada on temporary work permits are being pushed into Toronto 's underground economy by the recession and a controversial federal program that leaves them vulnerable to abuse , a Star investigation has found .
They include people like Tony , a 29 - year - old Honduran , who left his Alberta farm job after complaining of long hours and lower - than - promised wages .
He rode a bus to Toronto in mid-September with two fellow Hondurans from the same farm .
He now works illegally renovating homes , and his friends work illegally cleaning schools .
" I want to be someone , to do something with my life – that 's why I 'm here , " says Tony , who fears being deported .
Also citing employer abuse is a Salvadoran couple fired from their Halifax hotel jobs when the woman got pregnant .
They moved here to look for work in September .
In another case , 20 Filipinos arrived in Vancouver last May after each had paid a recruiter $ 5,000 plus airfare .
But the factory where they were to work had burned down a month earlier .
No one bothered to tell them , or to notify the government to cancel their work permits .
At least two of them are now working illegally in Toronto .
Others find themselves in positions similar to the 120 migrant workers at Rol - Land mushroom farm near Guelph , laid off last December when the recession hit .
" Closed " work permits barred them from jobs with other employers .
Thirty of them remained in Canada to face precarious prospects in the underground economy .
Unemployed temporary foreign workers add to the pressures on the city 's own " guest workers , " hit by the recession and an unemployment rate of 10 per cent .
The trend has intensified concern about a federal program that – virtually without debate – has almost doubled the number of workers entering Canada with temporary permits since 2003 .
They are here to fill labour shortages identified by employers and Ottawa .
Last year , 192,519 foreigners came with work permits of up to two years – almost as many as the permanent residents Canada selected through the immigration system .
According to an official count , on Dec. 1 , 2008 , there were 251,235 temporary foreign workers in the country .
The program is widely criticized for being poorly monitored and for leaving the workers vulnerable to exploitation .
Some experts say it smacks of the failed guest worker programs in Europe , which developed generations of marginalized and resentful residents .
Employers , on the other hand , insist that regardless of the economy 's ups and downs , labour shortages are real and longterm .
BUT IS THE Temporary Foreign Worker Program the best way to fill the need ?
For many who study the program , the recession 's impact on foreign workers has made that question more pressing .
When times were good , foreigners could renew work permits with the same employer or get federal approval to switch jobs .
When times got bad , and domestic unemployment rose , the government began closing the tap on the program .
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada ( HRSDC ) must conduct labour market opinions ( LMOs ) when employers seek approval to hire workers abroad .
LMOs are supposed to determine whether local citizens or permanent residents could do the job .
In 2008 , HRSDC approved 176,368 positions with LMOs .
But the first three months of this year saw a 25 per cent reduction in the number of jobs approved with LMOs ( 29,607 ) from the same period last year ( 40,020 ) .
LMOs rejected in the first half of this year included ones involving employers who wanted to renew work permits for those already on their payroll – forcing the employers to lay them off instead .
They also included employers prevented from hiring foreign workers already here and out of a job .
( Workers can remain in Canada until their work visas expire , but can't legally work for another employer without a new LMO . )
For many jobless foreign workers , returning home is n't much of an option .
They left lives of poverty , are often burdened by debt from money paid to recruiters , and have families back home who depend on remittances .
" For the average Canadian worker , the economic downturn is a crisis , but for the temporary foreign worker , it 's a catastrophe , " says Naveen Mehta , a lawyer with the United Food and Commercial Workers union .
Gauging the impact of foreign workers on the underground economy is difficult .
Officials at Citizenship and Immigration Canada insist that the " vast majority " return home before their permits expire .
But they can't prove it .
The government does n't track when – or if – foreign workers leave the country .
Nor does anyone track the number of those laid off .
But it does advise employers to lay off foreign workers before Canadian citizens or permanent residents .
" We 've got a growing illegal workforce , " says Yessy Byl , an expert on the Temporary Foreign Worker Program in Alberta , the province that experienced the biggest increase of foreign workers in the past three years .
" It 's growing by leaps and bounds .
" You 've got a hugely growing group of destitute people , " adds Byl , who is also a labour lawyer with the Alberta Federation of Labour .
" They have to work to survive . "
Byl says the worst is yet to come : many of the 365,000 foreign workers who came to Canada in 2007 and 2008 will see their permits expire next year .
In a 2007 report , the RCMP estimated the number of undocumented workers in Canada ranged from 200,000 to 500,000 .
Toronto is widely seen as having the largest concentration .
St. Christopher House , a downtown social service agency , is bracing for an influx of underground foreign workers and has hired a new coordinator who recently completed doctoral studies on migrant workers .
" We are trying to get out in advance of that train coming down the track because we believe this issue is going to be big , " says executive director Maureen Fair .
Francisco Rico- Martinez , co-director of Toronto's FCJ Refugee Centre , says every month he sees two or three temporary foreign workers looking for help .
One week in September , he met Tony , the Alberta farm worker , and the Salvadoran couple from Halifax .
But settlement agencies are in a bind .
The federal government does n't fund services for guest workers .
If agencies help , they 're diverting scarce funds from refugees and landed immigrants .
HISTORICALLY , the Temporary Foreign Worker Program was a relatively small federal initiative that brought in mostly high - skilled workers for specialized jobs .
The live - in caregiver and seasonal agricultural worker programs were the only exceptions .
All that changed in 2002 when Ottawa allowed employers to bring in a wide range of low - skilled foreign workers to toil in the hospitality , food services , construction and manufacturing sectors .
Increases have been especially steep since 2006 , under the Conservative government 's watch .
" It 's a priority of Stephen Harper 's government to have immigration tailored more to the needs of Canadian employers , " says Jeffrey Reitz , an immigration expert at the Munk Centre for International Studies .
The economy was hot , and employers – from Tim Hortons franchises to developers of Alberta 's oilsands – scrambled to find workers .
They turned to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program .
" They were doling out work permits like lollipops , " says Toronto immigration lawyer Sergio Karas .
The most persistent criticism of the program is that it has addicted employers to cheap , disposable labour .
In August , the federal government told a parliamentary committee that " overuse " of the program is the cause of many of its problems .

But it defended the program as necessary , noting that seasonal or cyclical jobs – vegetable picking or work on the oilsands – do n't require permanent employees .
The Harper government also described the regular immigration system as woefully inflexible and unable to meet labour market demands .
That system , which considers only workers with highly developed skills for permanent residency , is groaning under a backlog of some 900,000 applications .
Decisions can take six years .
In 2007 , at the peak of a revved - up economy , Canada let in 41,251 skilled workers as permanent residents – 17,660 fewer than in 2001 .
Meanwhile , 165,000 guest workers were brought in – the majority of them low - skilled .
" The temporary foreign worker program has become the faster and preferred way to get immigrants to Canada to meet long - term labour shortages , " the bipartisan report of Parliament 's Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration noted in May .
Some argue that the service industry is bringing in foreign workers to flip burgers , pour coffee and clean hotels simply to avoid offering the higher wages needed to attract domestic labour .
What seems clear is that many are doing jobs few Canadians want – for example , dismembering pigs on " disassembly lines " in meat plants .
Yet , while high - skilled temporary workers can apply to become permanent residents under federal or provincial programs , most low - skilled workers can't ( live - in caregivers are the big exception ) .
" The attitude is , ` We do n't want none of them riff - raff here , ' " Byl charges .
Governments are rejecting the kinds of people who largely built the country after immigrating in successive waves through the last century , says Toronto immigration lawyer Elizabeth Long .
" Good enough to work , good enough to stay , " is a slogan widely used by advocates of giving low - skilled workers a route to permanent status .
The Harper government is doing the opposite .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney last month proposed changes that would cap at four years the amount of time foreigners could work in Canada on temporary permits .
They then would be barred from receiving another permit for six years .
The proposals have been widely panned .
The parliamentary committee had recommended a path to permanent residency for all guest workers , at least those already here .
It also called for " open " permits that would allow workers to switch jobs in the same sector .
Observers say foreign workers are much less likely to leave Canada if they 're allowed to stay four years , as Ottawa is proposing .
As one slogan , based on the experience of Europe and the U.S. , says : " There is nothing more permanent than temporary foreign workers . "
Germany stopped recruiting guest workers in 1973 .
But many stayed and brought over their families .
By the mid-1980s , the program was largely responsible for having increased the number of permanent immigrants in Germany by almost 4 million .
Left without settlement services for years , many live marginalized lives .
Jenna Hennebry , a sociologist at Wilfrid Laurier University , has researched temporary foreign workers for years .
She believes a majority who lose their jobs stay in Canada beyond the time allowed by their work visas .
Some get advice from consultants to apply for refugee status .
That clogs up the system but buys them time to stay and work in Canada .
Others become undocumented .
Last spring , the Canadian Border Services Agency launched raids at several farms in southern Ontario , detaining about 100 people who had overstayed or violated the conditions of their work permits .
After one raid , about 40 workers from Thailand with expired work permits were sent to a detention centre in Rexdale .
Immigration lawyer Long , who represented one of them , said most were deported without getting a chance to speak to a lawyer or file an assessment – guaranteed by the Charter of Rights – of the risk they faced if sent back .
Long said her client had borrowed $ 17,000 from " loan sharks " in Thailand to pay recruiters .
Yet he was paid far less money than promised to work an overnight shift six days a week catching free - range chickens .
He , too , was eventually deported .
Union officials and immigration experts say the size of Toronto 's undocumented workforce keeps official employer demands for temporary foreign workers in the city – other than nannies – relatively low .
" Why would an employer go through the hassle of a temporary foreign work visa when he can draw from that pool of undocumented workers ? " says Diego Mendez , spokesperson for the Greater Toronto local of the Service Employees International Union .
Toronto immigration lawyer Amina Sherazee believes the growing pool of undocumented workers suits Ottawa just fine .
" It 's almost a deliberate attempt ... on the part of the government to keep a competitive workforce here who can be exploited cheaply to meet the needs of the market , " she says .
Rico -Martinez notes that undocumented workers make up half of his centre 's caseload .
" We try to talk to the government about this issue , but they 're in total denial . "

A Baltimore city police officer delivered the fright of a lifetime to a haunted house employee , pulling a gun on the chainsaw - wielding man at the end of his act , authorities said on Monday .
Sergeant Eric Janik , 37 , was charged with assault and reckless endangerment for pointing his service handgun at the worker , who was dressed as Leatherface , the killer from , Baltimore County police said .
The employee , Mike Morrison , followed Janik and several other people up a staircase Sunday night at the end of the haunted house tour in a bid to get " one last scream " out of them , police said .
When the group exited into a parking lot , Janik pulled his gun and pointed it at Morrison from less than three metres away , according to police and Morrison , who said he dropped the chainsaw , put his hands up and backed away .
The saw had no chain .
Only then did Janik identify himself as a police officer , said Morrison , who retreated into the building .
Washington ( CNN ) -- Victories in New Jersey and Virginia Tuesday provided a major shot in the arm for the Republican Party heading into the 2010 elections , but the Democratic losses of these two governorships should not be interpreted as a significant blow to President Obama .
While the economy and jobs were the chief concern for voters in both states , 26 percent of New Jersey residents said property taxes was also a major issue , while another 20 percent mentioned corruption , according to CNN exit polling .
In a similar CNN survey taken in Virginia , health care was the most important issue for 24 percent of the voters , while 15 percent named taxes and transportation was mentioned by 7 percent .
Further proof that this election was not solely focused on Obama , 56 percent of Virginians said that the president was not a factor when it came down to their vote .
In New Jersey , that number increased to 60 percent of the people who went to the polls on Tuesday .
Perhaps this was the problem for Virginia Sen. Creigh Deeds and New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine .
Neither Democratic candidate was Obama ; neither was a great spokesman for " change ; " and Democratic strategists and grassroots activists said each candidate failed to give independents a reason to support them .
Still , in the coming days a storyline will develop that this was a referendum on Obama and his policies .
At the same time , another narrative will continue to evolve over the future of the Republican Party as grassroots conservative activists seek to increase their influence following the success of forcing the centrist Republican nominee in a New York congressional special election from the race .
Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman 's loss to Democratic nominee Bill Owens was just a side note in a greater story about the beginning of a civil war between conservative activists and party leaders as the GOP seeks to rebuild after suffering devastating losses in 2008 .
Two story lines , whether right or wrong , that will help shape the thinking , the strategy and the politics of Democrats and Republicans heading into the midterm elections .
Embrace Obama 's agenda
The inclination by some Democrats seeking reelection next year might be to run away from Obama and chart an independent path believing that he was at least partially to blame for the defeats of Corzine and Deeds .
But Democratic strategists and activists caution that this is the wrong decision to make .
In order to win in 2010 , these Democrats said candidates need to embrace the president and embrace his policy goals .
" You want to run as somebody who is supporting the Obama agenda , with an exception here or there , instead of being disdainful , " said Steve Murphy , a consultant who works with conservative Democratic incumbents and challengers .
Jane Hamsher , founder of the liberal political blog firedoglake , noted that it is freshmen and sophomore Democrats who won by narrow margins in 2006 and 2008 , who " are scared " of losing their seats in 2010 .
" I would suggest that appealing to Republican interests is not the best way to turn out Democrats , " Hamsher said .
" It is just a fact of life .
They have to turn out Democrats . "
The problem does not just lie with House and Senate Democrats .
It is an issue for the White House .
Obama 's political operatives must decide how best to help their allies in Congress win next year .
In 2008 , African - Americans turned out for Obama , young people turned out for Obama and independent voters looking for " change " turned out for Obama .
" The political challenges for this White House will be to transfer this kind of political power to other candidates , " said a veteran Democratic strategist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to draw fire from the Obama administration .
iReporter : " Very good night " for Democrats
On Tuesday , the Obama magic did not rub off on Corzine or Deeds .
In New Jersey , while Corzine overwhelmingly won among African - Americans , only 14 percent of the vote was black ; young people , age 18 to 29 , made up 9 percent of the vote and 36 percent of them backed Republican Chris Christie .
Meanwhile , 60 percent of independents supported Christie as well .
The numbers were worse for Deeds in Virginia .
Ten percent of the electorate was age 18 to 29 and Republican Bob McDonnell captured 54 percent of this voting bloc .
Deeds overwhelmingly carried the African - American vote that made up16 percent of people who turned out on Tuesday , while 66 percent of voters who identified themselves as independents backed McDonnell .
The White House has already played an active role in the 2010 mid-term elections and now the question is whether the Obama political operation will try to devise a formula to catch lightning in a bottle once again to help Democratic allies on Capitol Hill .

GOP civil war
For the past year , the Republican Party has been without a national leader as it works to rebuild after losing the White House and additional House and Senate seats in 2008 .
At times , the likes of talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has helped drive the conversation , but it is the grassroots activists who have emerged as important players in the reconstruction of the GOP .
Hoffman 's loss certainly does n't help these conservatives , but it is not a fatal blow , either .
The battle for these activists was with the GOP leadership , and they won by successfully pushing GOP nominee Dede Scozzafava out of the race .
It is just the beginning , said conservative leader Richard Viguerie .
" We want to take the party back to a small government party , " he said .
" The train has left the station .
The battle has been engaged . "
And by engaged , Viguerie means by the non-traditional conservatives who have rallied around the Tea Party idea .
" There are new people , " he said .
" They are saying it is time to lock and load and go to war with these establishment Republicans . "
But is an internal battle in the GOP good for the party ?
Conservative columnist Matt Lewis said he thinks that these internal struggles help to strengthen the party in the long run .
" This is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party , " Lewis said .
" Political parties ought to have vigorous primary campaigns , fight it out in the primaries over ideological battles . "
Lewis predicts seeing more primary challengers emerge to take on GOP establishment candidates following a path blazed by Marco Rubio in Florida and Chuck DeVore in California .
" I happen to think when Republicans stay conservative , Republicans win , " Lewis said .
Berlanty Azzam had nearly finished her degree at Bethlehem University Israel 's Supreme Court has said a Palestinian woman whom the Israeli army deported to Gaza from the West Bank should be able to challenge the move .
Bethlehem University student Berlanty Azzam , 21 , was deported two weeks ago .
The Israeli military said she had been given a permit in 2005 allowing her to spend only a few days in Jerusalem .
But an Israeli human rights group says that when Ms Azzam left Gaza there was no such thing as a special permit for Palestinians to enter the West Bank .
The organisation , Gisha , believes tens of thousands of other Palestinians in the West Bank are also under threat of deportation for similar reasons .
' Illegal resident '
Ms Azzam was stopped at a checkpoint in the West Bank by Israeli soldiers at the end of October , two months before she was due to complete a degree in business management in Bethlehem .
I 'm dreaming of the day when I can return to my studies
Berlanty Azzam
When they saw that the address listed on her identity card was in Gaza , she was detained for six hours , then blindfolded and handcuffed and told she would be taken to a detention centre in the southern West Bank .
" The driving took longer than it should have and I started to think something was wrong .
I started to wonder , what are they doing to me ? "
Ms Azzam said .
After the car stopped and the blindfold was lifted , she saw she was at the Erez crossing to Gaza .
She was then forced to enter the territory without being given the chance to speak to a lawyer .
" The decision that a person 's address listed in the Population Registry constitutes an essential condition for the legality of his / her residence at that address - with no explicit legal basis and with no official notification ... undermines the fundamental principles of the law , " said a lawyer for Gisha , Yadin Elam , in its petition to the Supreme Court .
Gisha warned that if Ms Azzam 's deportation were permitted , an estimated 25,000 Palestinians living in the West Bank who had Gazan addresses on their identity cards risked being removed .
The human rights group also noted in its petition that Israel had made no security allegations against Ms Azzam , and that the manner in which she was removed had violated her right to due process .
Regarding the army 's claim that Ms Azzam was present in the West Bank " illegally " , Gisha argued that at the time she left Gaza , a special permit for Palestinians to remain " simply did not exist " .
Furthermore , it said , Israel did not allow people to change their addresses from Gaza to the West Bank , and had not issued a single entry permit for the purpose of travelling to study to Palestinians from Gaza despite an Israeli High Court ruling in 2007 saying they should be allowed .
At Thursday 's hearing , the Supreme Court ordered the state to give Ms Azzam the chance to challenge the process of her deportation .
There will be an " administrative hearing " , before Israeli military officials , at the Erez crossing next week , for which she will be entitled to legal representation .
" I 'm dreaming of the day when I can return to my studies .
I am worried and fearful of what might happen , and I hope that my right to education will not be violated , " Ms Azzam said .

Without it international travel would be in turmoil and calling friends in faraway places at the right time impossible .
Exactly 125 years after the Greenwich Meridian line was drawn , how and why did Britain become the centre of time ?
At longitude 0° 0 ' 00 " , the arbitrary stroke on our maps that passes from pole to pole and bisects the UK , France , Spain , Algeria , Mali , Burkina Faso and Ghana divides the Earth into east and west , just as the Equator splits it into north and south .
This imaginary line now known as the Greenwich Prime Meridian not only allows us to navigate the globe but also keeps the world ticking to the same symbolic 24 - hour clock .
But it has not always been so .
Until the 19th Century , many countries and even individual towns kept their own local time based on the sun 's passage across the sky and there were no international rules governing when the day would start or finish .
Maps with multiple meridians were confusing
Enlarge Image
However , with the rapid expansion of the railways and communications networks during the 1850s and 1860s , setting a standard global time soon became essential .
" The world was in a very big mix - up , " explains Dr Avraham Ariel , author of Plotting the Globe .
" People had lots of prime meridians .
Earlier in Europe there were 20 prime meridians .
The Russians had two or three , the Spanish had their own and so on . "
And so , 125 years ago this week , 41 delegates from 25 nations gathered in Washington in the US for the 1884 International Meridian Conference to decide from where time and space should be measured .
By the end of the difficult summit , which , according to Dr Ariel , dragged on until " smoke came out " , Greenwich had won the prize of longitude 0 º by a vote of 22 to one , with only San Domingo against and France and Brazil abstaining .
The meeting also agreed Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) would be used as the standard for the world , with the day beginning at midnight at Greenwich and counted on a 24 - hour clock .
Political opponents
One of the main reasons for British victory over key rivals Washington , Berlin and Paris , was that 72 % of the world 's shipping already depended on sea charts that used Greenwich as the Prime Meridian , says Dr Rebekah Higgitt , curator of the history of science and technology at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich .
The contenders in the Prime Meridian race Hot favourite : With 72 % of global shipping already using it as the Prime Meridian , Greenwich was always the frontrunner ahead of the 1884 conference .
Rival 1 : Washington was a key competitor , but the US threw its weight behind Greenwich , taking it out of the race .
Rival 2 : Berlin supported the US 's move to back Greenwich and went on to rule itself out .
Rival 3 : Greenwich 's main rival of Paris knew it had little chance of success and pushed for a " neutral " meridian .
It lost .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Greenwich 's reputation among seafaring nations and the wide range of maps and charts using Greenwich as the Prime Meridian meant those at the conference " could see that was the way it was going " , she says .
Another factor in Britain 's favour was that the US had already plumped for Greenwich as the basis for its own national rail time system .
But , as the San Domingo , French and Brazilian votes showed , the choice was not without its opponents .
There remained some desire , particularly among Britain 's European competitors , for " something more neutral " - a location that did not have such national ties , Dr Higgitt says .
" France suggested using an older idea of a meridian running through the Canaries - and even after the 1884 conference , Jerusalem was suggested as a site , particularly by Italy . "
Opting out
Yet while the conference 's Greenwich decision has stood until this day , the ultimate aim of some of those at the conference - a simple centralised system of 24 uniform time zones for 24 hours - never came into being .
LONGITUDE
All points on the Prime Meridian are at 0° longitude
All other points on the earth have longitudes ranging from 0° to 180°E or from 0° to 180°W
The international date line lies along the 180° meridian Meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude together form a grid by which any position on the earth 's surface can be specified Unlike the parallels of latitude , which are defined by the rotational axis of the Earth , the Prime Meridian is arbitrary
Over the years , many countries have opted out of the system to demonstrate national independence , keep in time with neighbours or maintain standard days within their borders .
As recently as 2007 , Venezuela 's president Hugo Chavez shifted the entire country back half - an - hour , while other countries operate similar fractional zones - half - hour or quarter - hour deviations .
Yet more , such as China and India , use single time zones even though their territory extends across many hours .
" These things come up .
Sometimes it 's popular will or sometimes it is government choice , " says Dr Higgitt .
" France and Spain should be on the same time as the UK , but it is more convenient to be in sync with those they are attached to by land . "
And while such political and practical considerations have caused time zones to change in relation to Greenwich over the years , scientific and technological advances have also challenged Greenwich 's role as the centre of time and space .
Leap seconds
Since the 1960s , atomic clocks rather than astronomy have been keeping the world 's time and have forced GMT to adapt .
The combination of atomic clocks ' super - accurate measurement and the fact that the rotation of the Earth is irregular and slowing mean atomic time and Earth time - and therefore GMT - slowly drift apart .
The Greenwich Meridian has attracted visitors for decades
To keep them in sync " leap seconds " are added and produce a compromised version of GMT called Coordinated Universal Time , which keeps atomic time tied to the Earth 's rotation .
On top of such changes to GMT , the advent of GPS technology and its ability to precisely track location has also had its impact on Greenwich as the zero point of longitude .
GPS 's World Geodetic System 1984 system now places the Prime Meridian 100 m to the east of Greenwich Observatory - away from the line defined by its large " Transit Circle " telescope and its corresponding brass strips straddled by tourists eager to have one foot in the East and one foot in the West .
Dr Ariel argues this renders the historical Prime Meridian no longer meaningful .
But Dr Higgitt believes it simply highlights the fact it is not a scientifically - determined line and simply the result of global agreement .
" People stand on it because people think it is a predestined place , " she says .
" But it has never been official .
It just exists in terms of habits and international usage .
It is just something that has happened over a period of time . "
The 125th anniversary of the Prime Meridian will be celebrated with a talk by Graham Dolan at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich at 1900 BST on Tuesday 20 October .
Below is a selection of your comments .
It is amazing that in this day and age of global devices , from GPS and television , to cell phones and sporting events , we still put up with clocks set to local time and , horror of horrors , daylight saving .
One only has to look at an airline itinerary that takes in New York , London , Dubai and Johannesburg to see how ridiculous it is .
It is absolutely essential that all the world 's countries go over to GMT or its modern equivalent as soon as possible .
It would take a couple of months for us in North America to get used to having lunch at 16:00 and going to bed at 02:00 , but think of the convenience .
I could schedule a phone call to an associate in Zimbabwe for 08:00 GMT knowing that I would catch him before supper .
The only unresolved issue would be the 360 degree circle , but that has to be the subject of some future rant .
Frank , Vancouver , Canada
The article overlooks one big advantage of Greenwich for the 0 degrees meridian : it defines an International Date Line ( 180 degrees ) which passes over the fewest and least populated land masses .
Having one 's feet straddling East / West is bizarre enough , but how about straddling Today / Tomorrow ?
Ian Clark , Whitby , England
The location of the prime meridian does have some geographical relevance because of what happens 180 degrees away , the international date line .
Having two different dates on one piece of land would be rather inconvenient .
This needs to avoid land and although the Pacific is a huge place , there are still many islands that it has to detour around .
A Washington meridian would mean a dateline passing through Asia .
Hugh Kennedy , Essen , Germany Imagine if the meridian were in Palestine - parts of the US ( or Brazil and Canada ) would be one day and parts the next day off by 23 hours .
That would have been nasty .
On this count I have to go with our imperial overlords .
Sri , Chennai Surely the country at 0,0 ( lat , long ) is the " centre of the world " .
England has as much claim as anywhere on that line .
But being on both the equator and the prime meridian is doubly special .
Ette Nuahs , UK Surely John Harrison with his brilliant chronometers had something to do with the world accepting Greenwich as the prime meridian ?
Barry Bernstein , London
The person who developed the 24 time zones was a Canadian , Sir Stanford Fleming , whose simple idea was adapted at the 1884 Congress .
His development was born of necessity , with the development of the train system across the current 5 time zones of Canada .
He was accused of being an " internationalist , and a communist for daring to interfere with God 's natural work " .
Dan McWilliams , Vancouver , Canada Sir Sanford Fleming was born in Scotland but emigrated to Canada at the age of 18 .
He proposed time zones at the International Conference .
And he proposed Britain due to his heritage .
Neena , Toronto , Canada
The Washington conference may be interesting , but the issue was already a foregone conclusion by then .
The real reason the meridian is at Greenwich is that the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich was the first - indeed , really the only - person to have done the research required to calculate navigational tables .
He naturally took his own telescope as the baseline , and once the nautical almanacs which resulted were published no - one could be bothered to do the research all over again merely to establish a different base .
It 's important to note that the meridian is at Greenwich , not Charing Cross : so it honours a great scientist rather than Britain .
And who was that scientist ?
None other than Nevil Maskelyne , the villain of Dava Sobel 's popular book Longitude , but arguably the real solver of the longitude problem .
Peter Hankins , Wallington
I believe that another reason that Greenwich was chosen for the prime meridian is that it would be appropriate to locate the center of world time in the great British Empire on whose flag the sun never set .
Allan Holmgren , Burnsville MN USA GMT became the standard due to Britain 's economic , political and especially maritime dominance of the time .
I do not think at present that the GMT will be abandoned , as news over the internet still use GMT , CET , EET and so on .
As for shifting time due to less power consumption , this is no longer the case .
At the time when this practice was implemented lights were the main source of power consumption , these days so many appliances run that shifting time has no effect on saving electricity .
Christos Koumides , Nicosia , Cyprus
Hey , at that time , the British scientists were ahead of all others - AND Britannia ruled the waves .
I think the Brits have a right to own this one .
Vikram Modak , Saratoga , California
Shame the UK wo n't move its zone to match France .
More light in the evenings in winter , less power consumption , less depression , fewer suicides , fewer road deaths - lots of benefits , albeit angry Goths .
And since this is all arbitrary anyway , if the Scots think this could cause problems in deepest winter with kids going to school in the dark ( as opposed to coming home in the dark , which happens to those staying for after - school clubs ... ) , we could always draw a time - zone line across the UK .
Craig , United Kingdom
I invariably fail to comprehend why time zones can affect when schools stop and start .
After all , schools set their own actual stopping and starting times .
We do not have a regulation of all schools must start at 08.30 and finish at 15.30 , so why the fuss about the local time changes must allied to schools .
Long time ago , working in Botswana where we did not have winter time , there was a cheer from the students when the head teacher announced that for the next term school would start at 07.30 instead of 07.00 .
Jane , Essex
You mention that the 1984 World Geodetic System system now places the Prime Meridian 100 m to the east of Greenwich Observatory .
As a resident of Lewes , through which the line passes , I was for some time puzzled by the fact that my GPS device disagreed with the local markings and monuments until I discovered this 1984 change .
However , you omit to say why our meridian had to move .
The answer is , of course , that the Americans set the new standard , and decided that the meridian line to be preserved was - obviously - 90 degrees West .
Ric Bithell , Lewes I have just had a tattoo done saying 36º35 '50 " N 4º38 ' 24 " W , only to discover by this article that it 's actually 100 m out ...
Bugger !
Nial , Sydney
Is n't it ironic that Britain agreed to this international effort to measure world time but can't quite bring itself to use the other internationally recognised system of measurement , the metric system .
There is , of course , the fact that Greenwich is in Britain and I guess this was n't forced on us by the EU ... but then the original idea for the metric system was also British and , despite what 's said , is n't being forced on us by the EU either .
It does show that the Britain has in the past managed to be sensible about adopting worldwide standards .
Alex Bailey , Corby , England I much prefer the idea of 24 uniform time zones .
The counter argument is that the working day in New York would start at 15:00 ( i.e. at the start of the day in NY ) rather than at 9:00 .
But the 9:00 start is purely arbitrary anyway .
And we'd no longer have to change our watches every time we travel .
After all , we do n't have " month " zones so that when it 's June in Europe it 's December in Australasia ( so that the snow that falls comes at the " right " time of the year ) .

When you have reverse cowgirl anal sex with a girl who has nasty , gross beer shits from the night previous .
While having said reverse cowgirl anal sex , the girl jumps off your dick , shits on your chest , and slides on the fecal matter right back onto your dick .
Nearly 30,000 victims of toxic dumping in the Ivory Coast may be deprived of £ 30 m compensation after an African court froze the bank accounts into which the money has been paid .
British lawyers for the victims are concerned that the legal action is the first step in the expropriation of the funds , released to the claimants this year by Trafigura , a London - based international oil trading company .
The freezing order was granted by the courts of the Ivory Coast in favour of a man claiming to represent the interests of all the victims .
Martyn Day , the British lawyer who helped settle the compensation claims with Trafigura , said that he was extremely worried that the compensation will now be transferred to the local representative , who he said " may well be a front for a senior but shadowy figure within Ivorian society " .
Yesterday the High Court in London issued an order reflecting its " deep concern " that the compensation might fall into the wrong hands .
Mr Justice Alistair MacDuff ordered the £ 30 m be held in trust by the London - based solicitors , Leigh Day & Co , " exclusively and solely for the claimants " .
He said that any money " distributed " to anyone unnamed in the September agreement would amount to " frustration of the order of the High Court " .
Trafigura paid out the £ 30 m after a three - year legal action in which it was accused of responsibility for injuries and illness to thousands of inhabitants of Abidjan , the Ivory Coast capital , after subcontracting the disposal of toxic chemicals .
Over the last three years Trafigura has issued a series of public statements saying the waste , carried by a ship called Probo Koala , had been routinely disposed of and was harmless .
Trafigura dismissed complaints of illness in a lawsuit brought by 30,000 inhabitants of Abidjan , before agreeing to pay them £ 30 m in compensation in a confidential out - of - court settlement .
The oil firm conceded in a public statement that the toxic fumes could have caused " flu - like symptoms " to the inhabitants .
But it was accepted in a statement agreed by both sides that expert evidence did not back the claims of deaths , miscarriages or serious injuries .
On 24 September Trafigura paid the settlement into two Leigh Day client accounts at the Société Générale bank in Abidjan covering the full agreed compensation for the injuries and illness .
A system of payment was worked out with the bank through payment cards and Pin numbers for the victims , as virtually none of them have bank accounts .
But just before the card distribution process was complete on 22 October , a freezing order was served on Leigh Day and the bank in relation to the accounts .
And yesterday the Ivory Coast state prosecutor supported the application to pay the money to the third - party representative 's association .
The court heard the final submissions yesterday and is likely to give its judgment tomorrow .
Mr Day , senior partner for Leigh Day , said : " This is deeply worrying news .
Trafigura paid to us the compensation very promptly and the payment process had been working extremely well .
Now , however , it would appear there is a very serious risk that all this will come to nought and the compensation monies will simply disappear and our clients will see none of it .
" Such an outcome would be deeply depressing and very , very upsetting for our 30,000 Ivorian clients who were so pleased with the outcome of the claim . "

Peculiar experiences ( Image : Christian Lichtenberg / Getty )
THE young man woke feeling dizzy .
He got up and turned around , only to see himself still lying in bed .
He shouted at his sleeping body , shook it , and jumped on it .
The next thing he knew he was lying down again , but now seeing himself standing by the bed and shaking his sleeping body .
Stricken with fear , he jumped out of the window .
His room was on the third floor .
He was found later , badly injured .
What this 21 - year - old had just experienced was an out - of - body experience , one of the most peculiar states of consciousness .
It was probably triggered by his epilepsy ( Journal of Neurology , Neurosurgery and Psychiatry , vol 57 , p 838 ) .
“ He did n’t want to commit suicide , ” says Peter Brugger , the young man ’s neuropsychologist at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland .
“ He jumped to find a match between body and self .
He must have been having a seizure . ”
In the 15 years since that dramatic incident , Brugger and others have come a long way towards understanding out - of - body experiences .
They have narrowed down the cause to malfunctions in a specific brain area and are now working out how these lead to the almost supernatural experience of leaving your own body and observing it from afar .
They are also using out - of - body experiences to tackle a long - standing problem : how we create and maintain a sense of self .
Dramatised to great effect by such authors as Dostoevsky , Wilde , de Maupassant and Poe – some of whom wrote from first - hand knowledge – out - of - body experiences are usually associated with epilepsy , migraines , strokes , brain tumours , drug use and even near - death experiences . …
NEW DELHI : Pakistan once again raised the Balochistan issue , saying ‘ comprehensive evidence ’ of Indian ‘ involvement ’ would be presented at a suitable time .
Pakistan prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani claimed that a dossier with evidence of India fomenting trouble in Balochistan would be handed over to New Delhi at an appropriate time .
`` The evidence will be presented at a suitable time , ’’ Mr Gilani said .
The Pakistani prime minister also flaunted the inclusion of Balochistan in the Sharm - el - Sheikh joint statement and said that the issue had been taken up during his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the Nam summit in the Egyptian town .
Since Sharm - el - Sheikh , Islamabad has lost no opportunity in reminding New Delhi of the Indo - Pak joint statement and has used it to accuse India of being behind the insurgency troubles in Balochistan .
Before Mr Gilani ’s statement , interior minister Rehman Malik had accused India of involvement in Balochistan province and claimed Pakistan had the evidence to back up this claim .
But US secretary of state Hillary Clinton after her trip to Pakistan had rubbished this claim saying the US had not seen any such evidence .
However , Pakistan remains undeterred in its bid to flag the Balochistan issue .
Islamabad has raised the rhetoric , accusing India of funding and aiding Taliban .
The rhetoric has been increasing in the run up to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ’s visit to Washington , where Pakistan would be an issue of discussion .
After accusing India of creating trouble , the Pakistani premier went on to express Islamabad ’s interest in reviving the composite dialogue process .
“ Pakistan wants good relations with its neighbours .
As far as India is concerned , the composite dialogue was discontinued .
We want the composite dialogue to be resumed again , ” Mr Gilani was quoted as saying at a news conference in his hometown of Multan in Punjab province .
`` I think dialogue is the only solution .
Its the only way forward because the solution of these problems is not war but dialogue , ” he said .
It 's not just NASA that 's hip to the social media game anymore .
Now , the Russian space agency Roscosmos has one of its own blogging from the International Space Station .
The blog , as translated by Russia Today , includes pictures from the ISS — and covers a much different array of topics than you usually see in NASA press releases or Twitter feeds .
A recent post detailed the " holy symbols " in the Russian area of the station , illustrated by photos of icons and crucifixes floating in zero gravity .
" We have four holy icons on the Russia segment .
We also have the gospels and a big cross , " wrote Maksim Suraev .
" And I have a reliquary cross in my cabin .
A priest gave it to me at Baikanur before the launch .
Father Job told me a piece of the original cross on which Jesus was crucified is contained in mine . "
Not exactly what you 'd find NASA astronauts like Mike Massimino writing about , and that 's exactly what makes the reflections worth reading .
We tend to receive our vision of space exploration through the American lens , so it 's great to get some outside perspective on what 's going on up there .
And Suraev 's site really feels like someone 's blog .
He even injects some dark , faux Cold - War humor into his writing .
Take , for example , his description of the photo above .
" In the photo I ’m holding the latest gadget developed by our military .
The device works in two modes .
One allows eavesdropping on our colleagues in the American segment .
You can ... record all their conversations .
Also , the device can be used for martial arts training — to be prepared for an alien attack on the Russian segment of the ISS , " he wrote last week .
" Guys , it ’s just a joke , I hope you realize !
It ’s not some weapon or a spy gadget .
Just an old pump that Roma and I replaced ! "

Girls are often threatened with violence by men who had befriended them Children as young as 10 are being moved around the UK to be sexually exploited at parties organised by paedophiles , a charity says .
Barnardo's says thousands of girls and boys are at risk of organised trafficking .
The organisation says the vast majority of local authorities do not provide expert help for such children .
But directors of children 's services insist councils are well aware of their responsibilities - and taking action .
In its report , Whose Child Now ? , Barnardo 's says although there are more than 200 local authorities across the UK , only 40 are known to provide specialist services for the victims of sexual exploitation .
Barnardo 's runs just over half of those services .
In those areas , it has been working with more than 1,000 children who were sexually exploited in the past year .
Often threatened Lisa Stacey , who wrote the report , told BBC News : " Wherever we have been asked by a council to carry out research we have come across young people who have been exploited .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" This is organised sexual abuse and it can often involve the victim being moved from one place to another .
More than half the victims regularly go missing . "
She says the victims may return after several days to their family or to their care home and say things like " I 've been staying with friends " .
They are often threatened while away and so do not ask for help when they return , she says .
The children are " basically brainwashed " , says Ms Stacey .
" Some will even believe that the man who is grooming them is their boyfriend .
It can take some of them a year of counselling to realise that they 've been abused .
" We 're talking about gangs of men , perhaps with a legitimate front .
Dress up " In Scotland , we discovered children being brought from outlying areas into cities .
We know of children being moved from north - east England to London , or from Yorkshire to London or Manchester . "
I felt looked after , wanted , loved even .
He gave me everything I wanted
Imogen
The charity has released the stories of two victims .
Imogen was taken into care shortly after her 12th birthday .
She told the charity that she tagged along with older girls who regularly ran away to boyfriends ' flats and houses .
She said : " One man started to take a special interest in me .
He was much older .
He was protective .
" I felt looked after , wanted , loved even .
He gave me everything I wanted and , when I was 13 , he handed over the keys to a flat and said ' It 's yours - use it when you need it ' . "
So guilty
But one night she was asked to " dress up " because they were going to a party .
She was taken miles from her home to London and told to have sex with different men .
She said : " I did n't have any choice .
I felt so guilty .
He 'd take me all over the country - Leeds , Bradford , Manchester , London .
He 'd take me to hotels , sometimes for two or three nights .
" I wanted to escape , but he just controlled me .
It was a mental thing .
I was terrified . "
Barnardo's said Imogen 's abuser was eventually arrested and her life was slowly turned around .
She went back to school and then on to university .
Susan was 13 when her mother died .
She did n't get on with her father and so she moved out and began drinking .
He got what he wanted and he wanted to use me .
I drank more and more to block it out
Susan
She was introduced to the father of a friend , who was 43 : " He paid for all my drink .
I suppose he did it to keep me quiet .
Soon I did n't care about anything .
He got what he wanted and he wanted to use me .
" I drank more and more to block it out . "
Fast car
One day she was taken to a flat and ordered to sleep with other men .
When she refused she was beaten until she gave in .
Barnardo 's said her abuser was arrested and Susan was put in touch with the charity .
She now has a flat and is planning to go to college .
Colin Green , who leads on child protection for the Association of Directors of Children 's Services in England , said : " Exploitation covers a wide range of behaviour from children being worked by pimps to girls being exploited in return for a ride in a fast car .
" We will be picking up vulnerable children because they may be in touch with a range of services .
" They could come to the attention of youth workers , social workers and police .
Some may be doing poorly in school , others may have mental health or emotional problems .
" There will be hot spots , often in the big cities , and councils need to judge how best to respond in their particular area . "
The Department for Children , Schools and Families said it had recently published new guidance for local authorities and introduced dedicated child abuse investigation units into all police forces .

Sapper Weston wants to stay in the Army
A soldier from Somerset who lost both legs and his right arm while serving in Afghanistan has been subjected to cruel taunts over his injuries .
Sapper Matthew Weston , 20 , from Taunton , stepped on a bomb while on patrol in Helmand Province on 29 June .
While he was being treated at Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham his mother took him out shopping where they encountered a group of " boisterous " youths .
Rena Weston , 40 , said : " They shouted he 's lost something ... like his legs " .
Shooting team
Speaking from the family home Mrs Weston said : " They were laughing at what they thought was a very funny statement to make .
" We continued around the corner and I put my arms around Matthew and said , ' are you okay love ? '
" He just went silent .
Then he said , ' I suppose I had better get used to it for the rest of my life . '
" I do n't think anyone , no matter what their disability , should be treated like that , " said Mrs Weston .
Since the incident Sapper Weston has finished his treatment at Selly Oak hospital .
" He 's determined to stay in the Army , " said Mrs Weston .
" He has trialled with the 2012 Paralympics shooting team and he 's going to receive coaching and possibly be in the team , which will be a great boost for Matthew .
" We have got no choice .
We have got to get on with it . "
Gunaxin ’s favorite Muppets are Animal and the Swedish Chef , both of whom provide nothing but uproarious comedic moments on The Muppet Show .
But we ca n’t forget Beaker , Bunsen Honeydew ’s cylinder - shaped lab assistant who is even more incoherent than Animal or the Swedish Chef .
In fact , the three have even teamed up to sing a the classic Irish song Danny Boy .
Beaker made his first appearance on The Muppet Show in the Muppet Lab sketch in season 2 .
Prior to his appearance , Honeydew ran the lab himself , and Beaker ’s addition added a much - needed level of humor .
After all , Beaker was the fallout of experiments - gone - bad , having been shrunk , cloned , deflated , turned invisible and blown up .
It was never not funny .
Beaker was voiced by Richard Hunt ( 1977 – 1991 ) and Steve Whitmire ( 1992 – present ) , although I hardly see how voicing this character is difficult , considering he only makes one sound .
You can read more about Beaker on the Muppet Wiki .
Here are some memorable Muppet Labs sketches ( with plenty more of the tribute to follow ) .

Muppet Labs : The Electronic Hammer

Muppet Labs : The Banana Sharpener

Now , Beaker was n’t just Honeydew ’s gimp .
He branched out was was used in more sketches than just Muppet Labs .
He was great at singing :
How about a Beaker Halloween costume ?
The head is made of 1 ″ thick green foam sheet from Jo - Ann Fabrics .
The felt is attached with spray adhesive .
Foam spheres are used for the eyes and nose with felt stretched over them and pinned in place .
The felt was stretched by running it under warm water and pulling it .
The labcoat was bought online and the tie from Thinkgeek .
Following Jim Henson ’s desires in his last will and testament , Beaker even has a Facebook page and a Myspace layout .
It ’s time to go shopping for Beaker merchandise on Amazon .

There is also Beaker lip balm but it is hard to find .
Can someone please explain to me the connection between Beaker and NASCAR driver Jeremy Mayfield ?
This bobblehead of Mayfield has Beaker in the title on several different sites .
And we end with Beaker ’s greatest career highlight : Beaker singing Ode to Joy , and winning a Webby Award .
Beaker ’s Acceptance Speech
Beaker Interviewed on the Red Carpet
A police employee sacked for claiming psychics should be used to crack crimes has won a landmark ruling that his views should be seen as a faith .
Alan Power , 62 , of Merseyside , claimed he was forced out of his job with Greater Manchester Police because of his spiritualist views in October 2008 .
An employment tribunal rejected a police authority appeal his beliefs did not amount to religious views .
A hearing on 23 November is due to rule on if he was forced out of his job .
' Worthy of respect '
Mr Power said he believed psychics could contact people after their death and help in the investigation of crime .
He said his beliefs stemmed back to his childhood when he saw " ghosts " .
At a previous hearing in Manchester , a tribunal judge had ruled Mr Power 's viewpoint was " capable of being religious beliefs " and was covered by the Employment Equality ( Religion or Belief ) Regulations 2003 .
Mark Hill QC , from the Greater Manchester Police Authority , said the ruling could open the " floodgates " for a series of similar claims .
The hearing in London was told spiritualism was the eighth largest faith group in Britain , with 32,000 people claiming allegiance , according to the 2001 Census .
Outside the tribunal , Mr Power spoke of his delight at the judge 's decision .
" It 's fantastic , " he said .
" It proves that spiritualism is a religion worthy of respect .
" I have n't claimed any costs .
I 'm not claiming compensation .
It 's about hurt feelings .
I expect my religion to be respected . "
Jef­frey
Haas tells a sto­ry that many of us have long wait­ed to read .
His book , The Assas­si­na­tion of Fred Hamp­ton : How the FBI and the Chica­go Police Mur­dered a Black Pan­ther ( Lawrence Hill Books , Novem­ber ) , is a much - need­ed cor­rec­tive to a bad­ly dis­tort­ed main­stream nar­ra­tive of a key event in the his­to­ry of the left and African - Amer­i­can pol­i­tics of the late ​ ’60s .
Haas reveals just how deeply the Nixon Jus­tice Depart­ment was involved in the Chica­go police raid on Decem­ber 4 , 1969 , that killed Black Pan­ther Par­ty lead­ers Fred Hamp­ton and Mark Clark .
Hamp­ton head­ed the Pan­thers ’ Chica­go branch and Clark the Peo­ria , Ill. , branch .
It ’s clear that Hoover ’s designation of the Panthers as ‘ the greatest threat to the internal security of the country ’ provided law enforcement with a virtual license to kill .
It is now clear that Hamp­ton and Clark were vic­tims of a plot hatched by the FBI and exe­cut­ed by the Cook Coun­ty State ’s Attor­ney and Chica­go police offi­cers .
Nonethe­less , con­ven­tion­al wis­dom por­trays the Pan­thers as the vil­lains .
In 2006 , Chicago ’s City Coun­cil , under pres­sure from the Fra­ter­nal Order of Police , vot­ed down a rou­tine city ordi­nance to name the block on which Hampton ’s mur­der took place in his honor .
The accu­mu­la­tion of facts pre­sent­ed in Haas ’ book por­trays Chica­go police as all too will­ing to vio­late the con­sti­tu­tion­al rights of Pan­ther mem­bers and sup­port­ers .
He reveals the cyn­i­cal treach­ery of State Attor­ney Edward Han­ra­han , whose office planned the raid under the direc­tion of J. Edgar Hoover ’s Coun­ter­in­tel­li­gence Pro­gram ( COIN­TEL­PRO ) .
Haas also pro­vides a damn­ing por­tray­al of one obsti­nate judge ’s con­tin­ued attempts to thwart the legal process .
But Haas also offers cap­ti­vat­ing details that add col­or and con­text to those tur­bu­lent times .
He evokes the infec­tious spir­it of change and activism that infused so many ide­al­is­tic young Amer­i­cans dur­ing the hal­lowed ​ ’60s .
His accounts of grow­ing up Jew­ish and mid­dle - class in Atlanta , Ga. , help locate the source of his uncon­ven­tion­al polit­i­cal lean­ings .
Haas ’ grand­fa­ther , for exam­ple , was an attor­ney for Leo Frank , a Jew­ish fac­to­ry own­er who was lynched in Geor­gia after being wrong­ly accused of mur­der­ing a teenage girl .
His father was deeply involved in the civ­il rights move­ment in the South .
Rep. John Lewis ( D‑Ga. ) , an icon of that move­ment , wrote the eulo­gy for his father ’s funeral .
Haas ’ fore­bears held rad­i­cal posi­tions for South­ern whites , and it seems Haas was sim­ply fol­low­ing ances­tral foot­steps when he aligned him­self with the emer­gent black rad­i­cal move­ment of the 1960s .
Although many thought it unusu­al for an attor­ney with Uni­ver­si­ty of Chica­go cre­den­tials to eschew wealth and sta­tus to asso­ciate with black rad­i­cals , it was a nat­ur­al move for Haas .
His accounts of the life at the U of C law school , where he met a ​ “ per­sua­sive ” Bernar­dine Dohrn , who would become the leader of the Weath­er­men fac­tion of Stu­dents for a Demo­c­ra­t­ic Soci­ety , evoke a peri­od infused with polit­i­cal pas­sions .
At that time , Dohrn chaired a group that sent law stu­dents to the South for sum­mer jobs with civ­il rights lawyers .
Haas was sent to his home , Atlanta .
“ I had to go to Chica­go to take my first steps to con­front seg­re­ga­tion where I grew up , ” he writes .
Though eas­i­ly par­o­died , the earnest ide­al­ism of those days pro­voked real change .
Haas ’ vol­ume reminds us how impor­tant naïve and opti­mistic stu­dents were to top­pling bar­ri­ers of seg­re­ga­tion in the South .
Back in Chica­go , after pass­ing the bar and while defend­ing sus­pects arrest­ed dur­ing the vio­lence that erupt­ed fol­low­ing the 1968 assas­si­na­tion of Dr. Mar­tin Luther King , Jr. , Haas met a like - mind­ed attor­ney named Den­nis Cun­ning­ham .
They formed a friend­ship and part­ner­ship , and in 1969 they joined with two oth­er lawyers to open the People ’s Law Office , which has since gained an inter­na­tion­al rep­u­ta­tion for con­sci­en­tious­ly defend­ing vic­tims of overzeal­ous law enforcement .
Haas also pro­vides some his­tor­i­cal con­text for the rise of the Black Pan­ther Par­ty , a group start­ed in 1966 by col­lege stu­dents Huey P. New­ton and Bob­by Seale to address issues of police bru­tal­i­ty in their home­town of Oak­land , Calif .
Seale and New­ton decid­ed to form an orga­ni­za­tion of armed vol­un­teers to con­front abu­sive police offi­cers direct­ly .
At the time , it was still legal to bran­dish uncon­cealed weapons in California .
The idea that African - Amer­i­cans could phys­i­cal­ly resist police mis­treat­ment was very attrac­tive to urban black youth of that era .
I was one of them .
And , like me , many had grown weary of watch­ing non­vi­o­lent pro­test­ers for civ­il rights endure humil­i­at­ing beat­ings at the hands of police .
The Black Pan­ther Party ’s dis­ci­plined audac­i­ty offered black youth an alter­na­tive that res­onat­ed with the mil­i­tant tenor of the times .
Although the group embraced a qua­si- Marx­ist ide­ol­o­gy and provoca­tive­ly chal­lenged police author­i­ty , it spread like wild­fire – most­ly in the urban north .
Their urgent sense of com­mit­ment to social jus­tice per­ma­nent­ly altered the street - gang cul­ture of urban America .
The first Pan­ther office opened in Chica­go in Novem­ber 1968 .
Fred Hamp­ton , a charis­mat­ic 20 - year - old who for­mer­ly led the May­wood , Ill. , NAACP youth chap­ter , was giv­en the lead­er­ship role by Bob­by Rush , now an Illi­nois con­gress­man , but then the Defense Min­is­ter of the Illi­nois Black Pan­thers .
Haas gives us one of the few accounts of Hampton ’s life out­side of his con­nec­tion to the Pan­thers .
Hamp­ton grew up in Chicago ’s south­ern sub­urbs , the third child of Louisiana immi­grants Fran­cis and Iberia Hampton .
The true strength of this book is Haas ’ metic­u­lous recon­struc­tion of the par­tic­u­lars that led to the par­tial vic­to­ry ( the plain­tiffs received a $ 1.85 mil­lion set­tle­ment , although the gov­ern­ment admit­ted no wrong­do­ing ) and legal vin­di­ca­tion of the People ’s Law Office .
He details how the FBI , the Cook Coun­ty State ’s Attorney ’s office and the Chica­go police con­spired to assas­si­nate Fred Hamp­ton and Mark Clark .
He clear­ly reveals , for exam­ple , how COIN­TEL­PRO , which sought to ​ “ neu­tral­ize ” black lead­ers , pro­vid­ed moti­va­tion for the Hamp­ton mur­der .
The book ’s exhaus­tive account of this inci­dent is one of the few inves­ti­ga­tions to explore the Hamp­ton assas­si­na­tion .
This is odd because many strands of U.S. his­to­ry con­verge at this point .
The FBI ’s COIN­TEL­PRO pro­gram , uncov­ered in 1973 by the Sen­ate Select Com­mit­tee on Intel­li­gence , chaired by Ida­ho Sen­a­tor Frank Church , sought to ​“ pre­vent the rise of a mes­si­ah who could uni­fy and elec­tri­fy the mil­i­tant Black Nation­al­ist move­ment . ”
That FBI direc­tive helps us under­stand just how deeply the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment feared the Black Pan­thers and some­one like Fred Hamp­ton .
A pop­u­lar leader with great poten­tial , Hamp­ton embod­ied the elec­tri­fy­ing appeal of the Black Pan­ther Par­ty among a cer­tain seg­ment of black youth .
In ret­ro­spect , it ’s clear that Hoover ’s des­ig­na­tion of the Pan­thers as ​ “ the great­est threat to the inter­nal secu­ri­ty of the coun­try ” pro­vid­ed law enforce­ment with a vir­tu­al license to kill .
What ’s more , the reck­less brava­do of the Pan­thers often pro­vid­ed police a con­ve­nient pretext .
Haas ’ impor­tant book clar­i­fies how the racial para­noia of an out - of - touch fed­er­al gov­ern­ment pro­duced a deceit­ful pol­i­cy that trashed con­sti­tu­tion­al rights even as it ignored legit­i­mate grievances .
This book should alter the con­ven­tion­al wis­dom that the Pan­thers were a dan­ger­ous threat that the police had to elim­i­nate at all costs .
Haas reveals that the cost was much too high .

Advertisement A gas blast at a coal mine in China has killed 42 people and left 66 trapped , state media reports .
Xinhua said that 528 workers were in the mine in Heilongjiang province at the time of the blast and that rescuers were searching for those trapped .
More than 400 other miners reportedly managed to escape the mine , in the region bordering Russia .
China 's coal mines are notoriously dangerous despite tighter government regulations aimed at upgrading safety .
Last year alone , more than 3,000 people were killed in mining accidents .
The latest blast happened at 0230 local time on Saturday ( 1830 GMT on Friday ) , said Xinhua .
Deep underground
Most of the workers managed to escape the pit , but many were still trapped about a third of a mile ( 500 m ) underground , Chinese media report .
China 's coal mines are notoriously dangerous despite regulations Many of the injured were being treated at the Hegang Mining Bureau Hospital , which said all 800 of its medical workers had joined the rescue operation , Xinhua reported .
Wang Xingang , a 27 - year - old electrician who suffered head injuries , said he was knocked out by the blast as he was entering the mine .
" I passed out for a while , " Xinhua quoted him as saying .
" I found I was shrouded by heavy smoke when I regained consciousness .
I groped my way out in the dark , and called for help . "
The mine is operated by the state - owned Heilongjiang Longmei Mining Holding Group .
State - run mines are generally considered safer than private collieries , whose lax safety standards contributed to a high rate of accidents .
Most are blamed on a failure to follow safety guidelines , often in an attempt to cut costs and meet an increasing demand for fuel .
The Chinese authorities have been trying to deal with the dangers by closing smaller mining operations and forcing local authorities to regulate the industry , says the BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing .
The government closed some 1,000 small mines in a recent safety drive , and says the number of miners killed has been halved as a result .
But miners are still dying at a rate of six a day , and independent labour groups say many accidents are covered up in the drive for profit and coal .
In February , more than 70 workers were killed in an explosion at a mine in Shanxi province .

We here at TPC are n’t the only ones concerned about the parallels with Japan .
There appears to be an increasingly loud drumbeat over the shocking similarities between Japan in the 90’s and the U.S.
This morning , Hong Kong ’s leader Donald Tsang had some rather alarming comments :
“ I ’m scared and leaders should look out .
America is doing exactly what Japan did last time . ”
As opposed to dealing with our issues here at home , Tsang believes the Fed has created a dollar carry trade that is simply reflating bubbles all over the world :
“ We have a U.S. dollar carry trade at the moment .
Where is the money going — it ’s where the problem ’s going to be : Asia .
You can see asset prices going up , not only in Korea , in Taiwan , in Singapore and in Hong Kong , going up to levels that are incompatible or inconsistent with the economic fundamentals . ”
As we ’ve previously mentioned , the parallels between the current deleveraging cycle here in the U.S. and Japan ’s deleveraging cycle of the 90’s , are numerous .
Credit Writedowns recently posted this excellent video from Fox Business which succinctly touches on many of these similarities .
I highly recommend readers take a look .
One of the most interesting takeaways from the video is the current tax situation in the U.S.
In Japan , the credit crisis was prolonged mainly because Japan attempted to bail their way out of their sinking ship .
Rather than deal with the problems directly ( IT’S THE DEBT STUPID ! ) they attempted to circumvent the problem by creating an environment where the government spent hordes of money to prop up failing institutions .
Here in the U.S. , we have not only bailed out failing institutions to the tune of several trillion dollars , but we have also continued to promote fiscal irresponsibility via government programs such as cash for clunkers and the first time homebuyers tax credit .
Making matters worse , we have a Federal Reserve and Treasury which have agreed to double team the ailing dollar as they print money to no end and effectively punish the prudent while rewarding the speculators ( the same bastards that helped create this mess to begin with ) .
Our tax issues have not yet reared their ugly head , but trust me , they are coming .
What we have n’t quite dealt with is how the government is going to overcome their massive revenue shortfalls and ever expanding debt .
As Jim Jubak recently described , they are going to come back to the consumer for another blow to the knees .
No , the bailouts were n’t enough .
Destroying the dollars in your pockets is n’t enough .
Because of their fiscal irresponsibility they are going to raise your taxes in 2010 .
And do n’t be fooled .
The income tax may not spike , but they will get you in every other way they can .
Sales tax , real estate taxes , etc etc .
You are paying for their mistakes .
Whether you were prudent or not .
Richard Koo is convinced that we can spend our way out of this mess .
I am not so sure .
There ’s only one way to deal with a debt problem .
Attack it head on and force those that made bad decisions to restructure and get their house in order or pay down that debt .
Injecting a bloated system with more debt does nothing but kick the can down the road ( no matter what the stock market does in the near - term ) .
Symbolic Installation was originally published on August 16 , 2006 .
Mark Mooney works in a fairly standard internal application development environment .
His group writes code , packages it up , and sends it off the Infrastructure Group for deployment to the QA servers .
Like many organizations , Mark 's group has virtually no access to these servers .
If they 're lucky , they can use the application as an end - user would .
If they 're really lucky , they can directly access the server log files .
But all this is fairly standard practice : Sarbanes - Oxley , corporate espionage , today 's world , terrorists , malicious employees , super villains , etc .
But what sets Mark 's story apart is the difficulty his group has with the Infrastructure folks .
In Mark 's organization , the Infrastructure Group is a part of the Network Operations Division , which in turn is part of the Technology Assets Unit , which in turn is part of the Internal Assets Department .
Basically , what that means is that Mark has a much easier time exercising his " six degrees " to get in touch with Kevin Bacon than he does using the " official chain of communication " to work with the Infrastructure Group .
In addition to the communication gap with the Infrastructure Group , there 's also a bit of a skill - set gap .
Because that group is comprised only of network engineers , they 'll often have a difficult time doing " developmenty " stuff , such as , " add CorporateAccounting to the COM +
Role Store on all MTS Servers . "
That will often lead to a failed deployment and require Mark 's group to go through several days of begging for temporary access and " blind debugging . "
So , in an effort to avoid all this , Mark 's group started putting together incredibly detailed , click - by - click instructions .
Unfortunately , it did n't help .
After several more failed deployments , Mark 's group came to the conclusion that the Infrastructure Group was simply not reading the instructions .
A stern email to " follow the instructions in full " was sent up the chain , across the departments , and down the chain .
A stern reply of " that 's what we 've been doing " was sent back up the chain , back across the departments , and back down again .
Obviously , the " official chain of communication " was n't going to get them anywhere .
Many failed deployment later , the Director of the Technology Assets Unit sent a very stern email to the Director of Application Development , demanding a meeting between their groups to discuss this problem .
One of the Network Operations managers was furious and this latest failed deployment was " the final straw "
In their meeting , in front of the Directors and Vice President , the Network Operations manager blasted the Development group , saying how completely unprofessional it was to send a document with nothing but " Wingdings gibberish " instead of installation instructions .
He professed that , despite what Development says , the Infrastructure Group always reads and follows every single word of the installation guide , and that the failed deployments were a result of Development 's utter incompetence in making useful instructions .
Timidly , one of the Development managers admitted to making the change .
The Network Operations manager fired back , demanding to know how he could possibly think that insulting his team like this , amidst all the deployment problems , would be a funny practical joke .
" Well , " the Development manager replied , " it 's funny because we 've been releasing our guides like that for the past twelve deployments . "
U.S. Senator John McCain has introduced legislation that would block the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from creating new net neutrality rules , on the same day that the FCC took the first step toward doing so .
McCain on Thursday introduced the Internet Freedom Act , which would keep the FCC from enacting rules prohibiting broadband providers from selectively blocking or slowing Internet content and applications .
Net neutrality rules would create “ onerous federal regulation , ” McCain said in a written statement .
The FCC on Thursday voted to begin a rulemaking process to formalize net neutrality rules .
The rules , as proposed , would allow Web users to run the legal applications and access the legal Web sites of their choice .
Providers could use “ reasonable ” network management to reduce congestion and maintain quality of service , but the rules would require them to be transparent with consumers about their efforts .
The new rules would formalize a set of net neutrality principles in place at the FCC since 2005 .
McCain , an Arizona Republican , called the proposed net neutrality rules a “ government takeover ” of the Internet that will stifle innovation and depress an “ already anemic ” job market in the U.S. McCain was the Republican challenger to President Barack Obama in the 2008 election , and Obama has said net neutrality rules are among his top tech priorities .
McCain protested the FCC ’s proposal that wireless broadband providers be included in the net neutrality rules .
The wireless industry has “ exploded over the past 20 years due to limited government regulation , ” McCain said in the statement .
“ Today I ’m pleased to introduce the Internet Freedom Act of 2009 that will keep the Internet free from government control and regulation , ” McCain said .
“ It will allow for continued innovation that will in turn create more high - paying jobs for the millions of Americans who are out of work or seeking new employment .
Keeping businesses free from oppressive regulations is the best stimulus for the current economy . ”
It ’s unclear whether the legislation would pass .
Democrats , who generally support net neutrality rules , have majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives , but in recent days , more than 70 House Democrats have written the FCC expressing concern over net neutrality regulations .
Elsewhere , reaction to the FCC ’s decision was mixed .
Supporting net neutrality rules :
-- “ Network neutrality protects the fundamental rights of Americans in using the Internet and accessing content , applications , and services of their choice .
A well - reasoned network neutrality policy also ensures a level playing field for companies large and small as they create an online presence , and will continue to foster the entrepreneurial innovation found not only in corporate office suites , but in college dorms across the country . ” -- Statement from Senators Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat , and Olympia Snowe , Maine Republican .
-- “ It is clear to us that at the end of the proceeding , consumers and innovators will benefit from an open and nondiscriminatory Internet .
As a result , the economy will benefit in the future , as it did in the past , from the stability of an Internet that grants equal opportunity to all to participate in an open Internet environment . ” -- Statement from Gigi Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , a digital rights group .
-- “ This is a down payment on creating a digital democracy .
Today ’s vote to begin the process of requiring nondiscrimination insures , among other things , that large internet providers will be unable to block or throttle speech from competitors or those who disagree with them .
The nondiscriminatory environment in which the Internet was developed fostered unprecedented opportunities for political and artistic expression . ” -- Statement from Andrew Jay Schwartzman , president and CEO of the Media Access Project , a media reform and digital rights group .
Opposed to net neutrality rules :
-- “ I remain concerned ... that the FCC is poised to take intrusive action into a well - functioning Internet ecosystem without either the demonstrated need or clear legal authority to do so .
I know of no empirical evidence suggesting that the openness of the Internet that we all value is under threat today , or is likely to be under threat tomorrow .
In the absence of evidence of market failure or demonstrable consumer harms , the costs of government intervention are more likely to outweigh the benefits . ” -- Statement from Barbara Esbin , a senior fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation , a free - market think tank .
-- “ As the FCC ’s Broadband Task Force said recently , it could take $ 350 billion to build next - generation broadband across America , and most of that money will have to come from the private sector and companies like Comcast .
We continue to hope that any rules adopted by the commission will not harm the investment and innovation that has made the Internet what it is today and that will make it even greater tomorrow . ” -- Statement from David Cohen , executive vice president at Comcast
-- “ I understand there is a regulatory revival climate in Washington under the Obama Administration , but the FCC ’s launch of a rulemaking proceeding to adopt new Internet regulations stands out as an example of a proposed regulation in search of a problem that will then search for a solution to address the non-problem .
At the FCC meeting , there was absolutely no evidence presented by the FCC ’s staff of any market failure or pattern of marketplace abuses .
It is risky business for regulators to mess with a technologically dynamic environment that is working well for American consumers and the economy . ” -- Statement from Randolph May , president of the Free State Foundation , a free - market think tank .
Consumer bankruptcies topped one million for the first nine months of this year , the highest point since the system was overhauled in 2005 .
The number of personal bankruptcy filings for the nine months rose to 1,046,449 as of Sept. 30 , the American Bankruptcy Institute , an organization made up of attorneys , accountants and other bankruptcy professionals , said Friday , using data from the National Bankruptcy Research Center .
There were 773,810 personal bankruptcy filings for the same time period in 2008 .

Italy 's constitutional court yesterday began deliberating whether to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his immunity from prosecution against a backdrop of alleged subversive plots and talk of a snap election .
Already on the defensive because of a lurid sex and drugs scandal , Italy 's prime minister faces going back on trial in two cases if the act passed last year to shield him from the law is ruled unconstitutional .
In his address to the court , Berlusconi 's lawyer Gaetano Pecorella said that , as a result of changes to the electoral law , the prime minister could no longer be regarded in the same way as other politicians .
Pecorella told the judges that Berlusconi was " no longer ' first among equals ' , but ought to be considered ' first above equals ' . "
The court had been expected to rule today , but may have to delay its decision if there are deep divisions of opinion between the judges .
They can endorse or overturn the immunity law altogether , or veto parts of it – which would allow the government to come up with an amended version .
For more than 15 years the media tycoon turned conservative politician has been proclaiming that he is a victim of systematic persecution by leftwing judges and prosecutors .
Many , if not most , Italians now believe him .
One of Berlusconi's most senior colleagues , defence minister Ignazio La Russa , declared yesterday that if the law were thrown out it would be " a political decision , more than a juridical one " .
Some of Berlusconi's associates were pressing for street demonstrations if the court decided against him .
But influential allies in the Northern League said the prime minister would do better to go back to the country for a renewed mandate .
In a statement on Monday the leaders of Berlusconi 's party in parliament issued a statement claiming a " subversive plan " was being enacted to " challenge the democratic will of the Italian people " .
The 15 members of Italy 's most august tribunal began considering the immunity act the day after a judge in Milan again drew attention to Berlusconi 's history of problems with the law .
Judge Raimondo Mesiano ruled that Italy 's prime minister had been " jointly responsible " for the bribing of a judge in a trial that was crucial to the expansion of his business empire .
Mesiano was giving the reasons behind a decision on Saturday to award € 750 m ( £ 695 m ) damages against Fininvest , the financial holding company at the apex of the Berlusconi group .
Fininvest was told to pay damages to the rival CIR group as compensation for having bribed a judge to ensure it won a battle for control of the publishing group Mondadori .
Berlusconi's former lawyer , Cesare Previti , was convicted of bribing the judge two years ago .
CIR owns La Repubblica , the centre - left daily which has led a campaign to get Berlusconi to answer a string of allegations about his private life .
The law under discussion yesterday grants immunity from prosecution to Italy 's top four officials : the president , the prime minister and the speakers of the two houses of parliament .
But the president already enjoys a broad measure of immunity and neither of the two speakers has asked for it , so the law is in effect tailor - made for Berlusconi .
Its approval led to the suspension of charges against the prime minister in two trials : one for allegedly bribing David Mills , the husband of British Cabinet Office minister Tessa Jowell , to give false evidence ; the other for alleged tax evasion .
Prosecutors in the second trial appealed to the constitutional court , arguing the immunity act violated principles in the charter of the republic , including citizens ' equality before the law .
This is the second time Italy 's prime minister has tried to shield himself from the law .
A previous immunity act , passed by parliament during his last government , was ruled unconstitutional in 2004 .
PM 's battles
David Mills case Tessa Jowell 's husband was sentenced to 4½ years in February .
It is alleged Berlusconi paid a lawyer £ 387,000 to give false evidence at two trials in the 1990s , during which the Italian prime minister was accused of using offshore companies , set up by Mills , to channel illegal payments .
In a letter to his accountant , Mills wrote that he had " kept Mr B out of a great deal of trouble " .
Mills is appealing against sentence , a case to be heard on Friday .
Tax evasion Mills is also implicated alongside Berlusconi and 12 others in a trial alleging tax fraud .
Prosecutors claim Berlusconi used offshore companies to buy American film rights and then sell them on , at an inflated price , to Mediaset , a television company that is part of the Berlusconi group .
It is alleged that this shaved € 60 m off Mediaset 's tax bill by reducing profits , and that Berlusconi siphoned off the difference for his children .
He is charged with tax evasion , embezzlement and false accounting ; David Mills is charged with money laundering .
Fininvest Last week a judge ordered Berlusconi 's holding company Fininvest to pay $ 1bn to a rival for the takeover of the Mondadori publishing house in a case in which three Berlusconi associates were convicted of corrupting a judge to rule in favour of Fininvest .
Berlusconi was n't prosecuted in the case , but the court found he was " co-responsible " .

The New York Court of Appeals will hear arguments against recognition of same - sex marriage today , City Room reports :
" The judges of the state ’s Court of Appeals will consider two cases [ pdf ] brought by opponents of same - sex marriage .
In one case , the opponents are challenging a 2007 policy , adopted by the State Department of Civil Service , that extended health insurance benefits to the same - sex partners of state and local government employees who married out of state .
In the other case , the opponents are seeking to overturn a similar administrative order , issued in 2006 by Andrew J. Spano , the Westchester County executive , directing county officials to recognize same - sex unions performed elsewhere .
The opponents are represented by the Alliance Defense Fund , based in Scottsdale , Ariz. , which argues that both orders were ' illegal , unconstitutional , and resulted in the unlawful disbursement of public funds , ' according to a summary of the cases provided by the Court of Appeals .
In both cases , trial and midlevel appellate courts have found that recognition of same - sex marriages by Mr. Spano and the Department of Civil Service were ' valid exercises of their authority , ' the summary noted . "
In related news , State Senator Tom Duane is saying a marriage equality vote could come before election day .
A Somali pirate gang said it will kill 25 Chinese sailors aboard a hijacked ship if China makes good on a threat to launch a rescue attempt .
The De Xin Hai , carrying 76,000 tonnes of coal from South Africa to India , was captured 550 miles north - east of the Seychelles yesterday morning .
Reuters quoted a gang associate in Haradheere , a noted piracy town on Somalia 's east coast where the captured vessel may be headed , warning against any military operation to free the sailors .
" If they try that we will execute the whole crew … we tell them to change their mind regarding any rescue , otherwise they will regret it , " said the man identified only as Hassan .
In Beijing , a foreign ministry spokesman , Ma Zhaoxu , earlier told reporters that the government was making " all - out efforts to rescue the hijacked ship and personnel " .
China has three warships patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean .
Though Chinese sailors have previously been held hostage on Taiwanese and Korean - flagged ships off Somalia , the De Xin Hai appeared to be the first Chinese vessel captured by pirates , according to Andrew Mwangura , head of the East African Seafarers ' Assistance Programme .
He said a rescue attempt was unlikely because of the risk of crew casualties and the nature of the cargo .
Coal carriers are vulnerable to tipping if " messed with " , Mwangura said .
" The gunmen are willing to die .
The only way out of this is negotiation . "
Somali pirates are now holding six vessels and 146 foreign crew .
With the rough seas of the monsoon season becoming calmer , attacks are expected to increase sharply in number and geographical scope until April .
In the past few weeks pirate gangs using " mother ships " have moved into previously safe waters .
One attack took place off the coast of Oman , to the north of Somalia , while the Chinese bulk carrier , which is owned by the Qingdao Ocean Shipping Company , was taken 700 miles south - east of the Somali coast .
There are up to 33 foreign warships on anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean , but co-ordination among the different navies as well as shipping firms was still lacking , Mwangura said .
The De Xin Hai , for example , was not registered with the Maritime Security Centre ( Horn of Africa ) , which seeks to safeguard ships travelling in the region by tracking their positions .
" The Chinese navy is working one way , and Nato another , " said Mwangura .
" Meanwhile the pirates are expanding their area .
It 's very hard to stop them . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) is set to forecast global supplies of natural gas will rise faster than demand in coming years , the Financial Times newspaper reported on Thursday .
“ Global gas markets have evolved from a seller ’s market , driven by tight supply and demand , to a buyer ’s market as demand weakens while new supply comes onstream , ” the IEA says in a draft report of it World Energy Outlook , to be published November 10 , according to the FT .
The energy adviser to 28 industrialized countries expects overcapacity of liquefied natural gas terminals and gas pipelines to reach at least 250 billion cubic meters by 2015 , over four times the spare capacity in 2007 .
“ Projected global demand points to significant under utilization of inter-regional pipeline and LNG capacity around the world , ” the IEA is reported to say in the draft report .
“ This looming glut could have far reaching effects on gas pricing . ”
There ’s a common knowledge story kicked around about “ The Triple Filter Test . ”
Sometimes it involves Socrates and other times it involves an Arab scholar , but the truth of the story is the same .
Here it is :
***
In ancient Greece , Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high esteem .
One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said , “ Do you know what I just heard about your friend ? ”
“ Hold on a minute , ” Socrates replied .
“ Before telling me anything , I ’d like you to pass a little test .
It ’s called the Triple Filter Test . ”
“ Triple filter ? ”
That ’s right , ” Socrates continued .
“ Before you talk to me about my friend , it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you ’re going to say .
That ’s why I call it the triple filter test .
“ The first filter is TRUTH .
Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true ? ”
“ No , ” the man said , “ actually I just heard about it and … ”
“ All right , ” said Socrates .
“ So you do n’t really know if it ’s true or not .
Now let ’s try the second filter , the filter of GOODNESS .
Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good ? ”
“ No , on the contrary … ”
“ So , ” Socrates continued , “ you want to tell me something bad about him , but you ’re not certain it ’s true .
You may still pass the test though , because there ’s one filter left : the filter of USEFULNESS .
Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me ? ”
“ No , not really . ”
“ Well , ” concluded Socrates , “ if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful , why tell it to me at all ? ”
***
Most people leave it at that and assume that the story is just about the information we spread .
The real truth behind it , however , is about the information we seek and create .
Imagine how different the world would be if we only chose to seek or create information that was true , good , or useful .
Those of you who have been reading this blog for a bit can probably figure out that it ’s the test that I ’ve been using the whole time .
SOMERVILLE , N.J. -
An Illinois man has admitted banking more than $ 470,000 in paychecks from a New Jersey company he never worked for .
Thirty - five - year - old Anthony Armatys of Palatine , Ill. , pleaded guilty Monday in New Jersey Superior Court to one count of theft .
Prosecutors say Armatys accepted a job with Basking Ridge , N.J. - based telecommunications company Avaya Inc. in September 2002 , then changed his mind .
But the company 's computer system never removed his name from the payroll .
Paychecks were deposited into his bank account until February 2007 , when Avaya auditors discovered the mistake .
Prosecutors are recommending a six - year prison term and restitution .
Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 8 .
Flâneur points me to the 35 - page staff report for Jay Rockefeller on " Aggressive Sales Tactics on the Internet " .
It concentrates on three extremely sleazy companies , all based in Norwalk , Connecticut : Affinion , Webloyalty , and our old friends Vertrue , the employers of Ben Stein .

Flâneur points me to the 35 - page staff report for Jay Rockefeller on “ Aggressive Sales Tactics on the Internet ” .
It concentrates on three extremely sleazy companies , all based in Norwalk , Connecticut : Affinion , Webloyalty , and our old friends Vertrue , the employers of Ben Stein .
Here ’s a typical datapoint :
In discussing methods for reducing the cost associated with the call centers , Vertrue employees estimated that it received “ 7 million customer calls per year ” and that “ cancellation calls represent approximately 98 % of call volume ” .
In general , the customers of these companies have no idea that they ’re customers until they discover mysterious charges on their credit - card bills .
When they investigate further , they find that during the checkout process at reputable websites like priceline.com or 1800 flowers.com , they inadvertently clicked on a link which automatically gave their credit card details to these rip - off merchants .
Why would otherwise - admirable websites get into bed with these creatures ?
Here ’s a hint :
No , those are n’t misprints : we ’re genuinely talking here about CPMs in the thousands of dollars .
( A typical internet banner ad pays CPMs in the single digits ; at a high - prestige website appealing to rich individuals , it might get into the $ 30 - $ 40 range .
But never anything remotely like this . )
The money being made in these scams is enormous :
Financial information provided to the Committee by the companies shows that Affinion , Vertrue , and Webloyalty and their e-commerce partners have generated over $ 1.4 billion in revenue from Internet consumers who have been charged for membership programs .
Of the $ 1.4 billion in total revenue , $ 792 million went to the e-commerce companies that partnered with Affinion , Vertrue , and Webloyalty .
The websites and e-retailers that have partnered with Affinion , Vertrue , and Webloyalty include some of the most well - known and high - traffic e-commerce websites on the Internet .
They include travel sites , airline sites , electronics sites , movie ticket sites , and the websites for popular “ brick and mortar ” companies .
Eighty - eight e-retailers have made more than $ 1 million through partnering with Affinion , Vertrue , and Webloyalty and , of the 88 , 19 companies have made more than $ 10 million .
Classmates.com , which has been partnered with each company at different times and has earned more than any other partner , generated approximately $ 70 million in revenue .
And where ’s the money going ?
Primarily , it turns out , to private equity :
In 2001 , Cendant rebranded its membership club unit as “ Trilegiant ” and , in 2005 , sold it to Apollo Management , a New York - based private - equity group , which in turn renamed the company Affinion …
Webloyalty is owned by the Greenwich , Connecticut private - equity group , General Atlantic , LLC …
In 2004 , MemberWorks changed its name to Vertrue .
Three years later , in 2007 , Vertrue was de-listed and sold for approximately $ 800 million to a group of private equity investors led by One Equity Partners , the private equity arm of J.P. Morgan .
These are big , reputable private - equity shops : what are they doing in this ultra-sleazy world of making money off unsuspecting dupes by exploiting loopholes online ?
In the real world , vendors ca n’t take your credit - card information and “ data pass ” it to someone else with minimal disclosure , but that ’s still legal on the internet .
As the report notes ,
Affinion , Vertrue and Webloyalty use aggressive sales tactics intentionally designed to mislead online shoppers …
While Congress and the Federal Trade Commission have taken steps to curb similar abusive practices in telemarketing , there has not yet been any action to protect consumers while they are shopping online .
I wonder whether anybody at JP Morgan knows or cares that its private equity arm is paying large sums of money to predatory bait - and - switch merchant Ben Stein in an attempt to boost the amount of money misleadingly extracted from individuals who can least afford it .
And I wonder too how and why all these companies have ended up in private - equity hands .
Is it because private companies do n’t need to answer to the public in the same way that public companies do ?
Pit Bull Saves Two Women From Deadly Cobra , Dies Wagging His Tail

Four - year - old " Chief " , an American Pit Bull Terrier , dashed in front of a venomous snake which was poised to strike at 87 - year - old Liberata la Victoria and her granddaughter Maria Victoria .
Shielding the women from the attack , Chief saved them but died minutes later from the snake 's bite .
" You think dogs will not be in heaven ?
I tell you , they will be there long before any of us . "
- Robert Louis Stevenson ( 1850 - 1894 )
The children in the Fronteras household referred to their dog as Kuya ( " big brother " ) , and he certainly proved it on the day he sacrificed his life to protect the family .
At around 2 p.m. , " Chief " , an American Pit Bull Terrier , rescued Liberata la Victoria , 87 , and her granddaughter Maria Victoria Fronteras from a deadly cobra which had entered their house through an opening in the kitchen .
Liberata la Victoria and Chief had been watching TV on the sofa when suddenly Chief jumped up and alerted her to the presence of a cobra less than 10 feet away .
Maria Victoria rushed in and pulled her grandmother into a separate room , hoping the snake would leave .
But when Maria Victoria later emerged from the room , she was terrified to find the cobra poised about two feet away .
Equally startled , the cobra expanded its hood and appeared to be spitting venom as it prepared to strike .
" The snake was in front of us , maneuvering a deadly attack , " says Maria Victoria .
" I screamed out loud to ask for help . "
That 's when from " out of nowhere " , Chief dashed between the cobra and the two women , using himself as a shield against the cobra 's attacks .
Chief then seized the cobra by the neck and slammed it into the floor , killing it .
But for Chief it was a Pyrrhic victory .
In the struggle , he sustained a fatal bite to the jaw , and moments later he began gasping for breath and collapsed .
The family sought the help of a veterinarian , but they were told that nothing could be done .
According to the vet , the bite was too close to Chief 's brain , and the venom had already spread .
Maria Victoria called her husband Marlone who , stunned by the news , rushed home immediately .
Ian de la Rama , a friend of the family , says it was less than 30 minutes from the time Chief had been bitten that he " went wobbly and lost control of his organs , " urinating and defecating uncontrollably .
Yet he still kept clinging to life .
It was n't until Marlone arrived that Chief finally let go .
Ian de la Rama describes , " Chief gave his two deep breaths and died .
He was fighting and saving his last ounces of breath to see a glimpse of his master for the last two seconds of his life . "
Ian adds that the last thing Chief did as he gazed up at Marlone was wag his tail .

Three Los Angeles police officers were charged with perjury and conspiracy Tuesday for allegedly lying under oath in a drug- possession case that was dismissed last year when a videotape sharply contradicted their testimony .
The felony charges mark the most serious allegations of police perjury in Los Angeles since the Los Angeles Police Department ’s Rampart scandal about a decade ago .
Prosecutors allege in court documents that two officers falsely testified during the trial that they saw a suspect throw an object that split open to reveal crack and powder cocaine .
They said they immediately recovered the drugs .
A third officer is accused of falsely claiming in an earlier court hearing that he did not help his two colleagues search for the drugs .
The drug trial ended dramatically when a defense attorney produced grainy surveillance video of the area shortly after the arrest took place .
The quality of the tape , a copy of which was obtained by The Times , is poor but shows a group of officers searching for more than 20 minutes before one announces that drugs have been found .

It is difficult to hear what is being said , but at one point an officer seems to make a reference to the arrest report that needed to be filled out .
“ Be creative in your writing , ” the officer appears to tell another after the drugs are found .
“ Oh yeah , do n’t worry , sin duda [ no doubt ] , ” is the reply .
After viewing the video , a judge took the unusual step of declaring the defendant to be “ factually innocent . ”
Advertisement
“ This is very , very disturbing , ” said John Mack , president of the L.A. Police Commission , the civilian panel that oversees the department .
“ We expect LAPD officers to possess the highest integrity and certainly we expect them to be truthful .
This is frankly a black mark . ”
Chief William J. Bratton called the allegations “ as serious a charge as you can levy against officers , ” but said he was confident that it was an isolated incident .
He and Mack said sweeping reforms in the wake of the department ’s Rampart scandal , in which dozens of officers were accused of serious misconduct , including perjury and evidence - tampering , had made it much more difficult for officers to engage in such behavior .
“ This is not something that we sweep under the rug , ” Bratton said .
“ When we find it , we deal with it . ”

Attorneys for the accused officers said their clients would fight the charges and noted that portions of the video appear to have been edited .
The footage , which comes from an apartment complex managed by the suspect ’s mother , also begins after his arrest .
“ Once again , Los Angeles is going to be subjected to the sad spectacle of officers unfairly charged because the video camera goes on either too early , too late or is edited , ” said attorney Ira Salzman , who represents one of the officers .
“ We do n’t know how it was edited .
And if the video was turned on earlier , it would have presented a completely different view of the case . ”
The drug charges rested almost entirely on the word of the police officers .
Officers Richard Amio and Evan Samuel testified that they were on patrol in East Hollywood on July 6 , 2007 , when they recognized Guillermo Alarcon , a suspected gang member , standing on the sidewalk outside his apartment .

As they shined their car ’s spotlight at him , they said , Alarcon fled down a walkway .
The officers chased him into the apartment building ’s carport .
There , they testified , they saw Alarcon throw a black box -- which turned out to be a key holder -- toward a trash bin .
“ As it hit the Dumpster , I observed that once it landed on the floor it cracked open , ” Amio told jurors .
During his testimony , Amio was asked whether it took about 20 minutes to find the drugs .
“ No , ” he replied , with a laugh .
Samuel gave a similar account .
The officers said Samuel picked up the box .
Inside , they said , he found 12 bindles of powder cocaine and two rocks of crack cocaine , a total street value of about $ 260 .

Under cross-examination , Samuel and Amio denied that the key holder had been found by Officer Manuel Ortiz and that it had to be pried open .
The questioning climaxed when Alarcon ’s attorney asked Amio : “ Are you aware of a video and audio recording that completely contradicts what you have testified to today ? ”
“ No , sir , ” Amio replied .
The video starts shortly after Alarcon was detained in the carport .
Officers had seen Alarcon close the door to a nearby laundry room .
The video shows the officers spending roughly 15 minutes looking for someone to unlock the door to the room .
The video does not show who found the drugs .
But more than five minutes after the door is opened , it shows a group of officers huddled together talking about trying to open a container .
An officer appears to say , “ Manny found that . ”

After viewing the tape , prosecutors said they believed about 13 seconds of audio had been edited out .
Nevertheless , they asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Alarcon .
Allegations of police officers testifying falsely are hardly unusual in criminal cases , but perjury charges against officers are rare .
Prosecutors and others note that defense attorneys and defendants have a vested interest in portraying police as untruthful .
To file a criminal case , prosecutors must believe that someone intentionally lied rather than simply made a mistake and that any lie could have affected the outcome of a case .
“ Perjury charges are rare against anyone , and rare against police officers , ” said Sergio Gonzalez , the L.A. County deputy district attorney who oversees the unit that prosecutes police officers .

Gonzalez could recall only one case in recent years in which an on - duty police officer was charged with lying in court .
Alarcon ’s defense attorney , Deputy Public Defender Victor Acevedo , said he was gratified that charges were filed .
“ When you have a police officer who comes to court and lies under oath . . . how much confidence can you have that this is somebody who should be wearing a badge and carrying a gun ? ” Acevedo said .
All three officers were charged with conspiracy .
Ortiz , a nine - year veteran , also faces one count of perjury .
Amio , who joined the department in 2002 , is charged with two counts of perjury .
Both are on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation .
Samuel , who joined the LAPD in 2002 and left for the Chino Police Department in 2008 , faces four counts of perjury .
He was fired while on probation in Chino two weeks after The Times reported on Alarcon ’s case .

The FBI also launched an investigation into the allegations last year .

Meet the best , loudest ( and only ) Christian - libertarian - capitalist - environmentalist - lunatic farmer on the face of planet Earth .
Joel Salatin , self - professed owner of that lengthy honorific , has a personality bigger than the Grain Belt and a genius for farming that has made him a glib , brilliant prophet to a growing movement of back - to - nature farmers from California to Swoope , Va. ( pop. 1,326 ) , where his 550 - acre Polyface Farm rests at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
Mr. Salatin ’s agricultural preaching has influenced food author and journalist Michael Pollan ( “ Omnivore ’s Dilemma ” ) and earned him a prominent spot in the documentary “ Food , Inc. , ” making waves worldwide .
What makes Salatin so powerful on the farming scene is a unique mix of ingenuity , faith , and business savvy .
Whether making farming lectures feel like religious revivals or handling customers ’ questions at the family store , it ’s this blend of agricultural potency and inspirational vision that enables him to gross roughly $ 2 million annually and stand at the front of a growing community of farmers that may look like quintessential American rustics but whose techniques are anything but traditional .
On a foundation of Christian principles , Salatin has built a farming ecosystem where cows , pigs , chickens , turkeys , and rabbits interact ecologically in a way that goes beyond conservation .
“ What we ’re looking at is God ’s design , nature ’s template , and using that as a pattern to cut around and lay it down on a domestic model to duplicate that pattern that we see in nature , ” Salatin says .
What that means for Polyface in practical terms is that the cattle graze different areas of pasture every day .
Then chickens pick through the same fields , eating bugs and spreading cow manure before clucking back to mobile coops .
The farm ’s pigs generate fertilizer by rooting around the floor of the barn , lured by sweet corn into aerating the mix of hay , cow manure , and wood chips .
The finished compost is spread on fields .
This process not only takes almost nothing out of the environment , it puts nutrients back in .
“ We believe that the farm should be building ‘ forgiveness ’ into the ecosystem , ” Salatin says .
“ What does that mean ?
That a more forgiving ecosystem is one that can better handle drought , flood , disease , pestilence . ”
Salatin concedes that when his father bought the farm in 1962 , the family ’s initial emphasis on sustainable farming had more to do with environmental concerns than faith convictions .
But as the business evolved , Salatin began to see himself situated at a unique place in America ’s moral conversation .
“ We should at least be asking , Is there a righteous way to farm and an unrighteous way to farm ? ...
The first goal is to at least get people to appreciate that how we farm is a moral question , ” he says .
“ Once you get to that point , then you can actually discuss :
What is a moral farm ?
What is a moral way to raise a chicken ? ”
How farm animals are treated on the majority of farms today dismays Salatin .
What Americans do to pigs , chickens , and cows speaks ill of the nation ’s moral health , he says .
“ A culture that views its life from such a manipulative , disrespectful stance will soon view its citizens the same way and other cultures the same way .
It ’s how we respect the least of these that creates a moral - ethical framework . ”
Do n’t be confused : Salatin is no crunchy - granola transplant to Appalachia .
He graduated from archconservative Bob Jones University in Greenville , S.C. , with a degree in English .
While he appreciates the “ bearded , beaded , braless , Woodstock revolution ” set who make up the bulwark of environmentally conscious farming , he ’s delighted that half of those coming to visit his farm nowadays are involved in the home - school movement .
It ’s this broad appeal that makes Salatin unique , says Teresa Heinz , the American philanthropist whose foundation recently awarded him a $ 100,000 award for his work .
“ Salatin is a person who is accessible conceptually and conceptually acceptable to a huge number of people – not just the Massachusetts guys , but people from anywhere , ” Ms. Heinz says .
What breaks Salatin ’s heart is that the rest of the religious right has been largely uninterested in picking up the banner of environmental stewardship .
“ I think the whole religious right community should be very apologetic and repentant that we – who should have carried the banner of Earth stewardship – got co-opted on that message , ” he says .
But his position as a darling of the environmental left but with increasing cachet and respect from the religious right may make him the catalyst in bringing the two groups together .
“ Buying food as a community is a very fundamental Christian value .
It ’s a value of many religions , and it ’s a value of the liberal community as well , ” says David Evans , who owns Marin Sun Farms , 40 miles north of San Francisco .
“ I like to believe that around food production is where we can become more politically neutral .
Everyone should be around the table on these issues . ”
Like Salatin , Mr. Evans refuses to sell his products beyond a roughly four - hour drive from his farm .
By following Salatin ’s model of marketing directly to local restaurants , farmers ’ markets , and grocers , Evans has tapped into a community - based form of economic growth .
“ We were growing at 50 to 100 percent a year for the last 10 years , ” Evans says , adding that sales between June 2008 and August 2009 increased by 100 percent .
“ It ’s easy to adopt [ Salatin ’s ] practices because he has proven results . ”
In partnerships with local ranchers , Marin Sun Farms grosses roughly $ 3 million per year by selling to three public school districts , 49 restaurants , and Stanford University ’s dining services , among others .
Salatin , by comparison , sells to roughly 2,000 families through local “ buying clubs ” and about 50 restaurants , including a Chipotle franchise in Charlottesville , Va .
While farmers are often quick to grasp Salatin ’s agricultural practices , persuading them to adopt the marketing portion of his program is much more difficult .
“ They assume they can just sit out on the tractor seat and till the crop and not have to deal with the people , ” says Galen Bontrager , a former apprentice at Polyface Farms who now runs a small , Salatin - inspired farm in Iowa .
Moreover , Mr. Bontrager says , farmers have become so used to relying on those outside agriculture for guidance on their farms that they ’ve lost their initiative .
This is part of the reason Salatin spends nearly half his time preaching his agricultural evangelism from coast to coast .
By all accounts , his presentations are barnburners .
“ Hearing him talk is like going to a revival meeting , ” says Jo Robinson , a journalist and founder of eatwild.com , a clearinghouse for information on pasture - raised animals .
People come away from his meetings , saying , “ ‘ I ’m going to do everything he ’s doing ! ’ ” she adds .
“ He takes people who have never been farmers and inspires them to become farmers . ”
But the big question is , Can this sort of small - scale , environmentally sustainable farming really feed the world ?
Salatin answers with a resounding yes , even though ecoconscious farming currently accounts for less than 5 percent of American food production .
And that ’s after what he estimates is a quadrupling of the number of environmentally friendly farms in the past five years .
“ Not only can we feed the world , we ’re the only system that can feed the world , ” Salatin declares .
“ What ’s happening is that the current industrial system is beginning to break down . ”
Still , Polyface Farms faces an ethical limit when it comes to producing food :
By promising personal connections with the purchasers of Polyface products , the business can grow only so large .
“ His model is not scalable in terms of getting bigger and bigger .
That defeats what he ’s doing , ” Ms. Robinson says .
“ It can be multiplied – there can be many people that do what he does .
There are people who are scaling up so that they can sell to restaurant chains and Whole Foods , and he ’s not a part of that . ”
If Salatin ’s model is going to be more than a footnote to American agricultural history , many more farmers will need to attempt his delicate balance : growing big and savvy enough to make a decent profit while staying small enough to remain part of the community .
Until then , Salatin and his devotees hope to find converts in more and more farmers ’ markets , local restaurants , and buying clubs .
“ We know that the best - tasting stuff and the most integrity is found by buying right from the farmer you know , ” Evans says .
“ It does n’t get any better than that . ”

President Obama today signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd , Jr. Hate Crime Prevention
Act which was apart of the 2010 Defense Authorization bill .
The new legislation adds sexual orientation , gender , disability , or gender identity to existing hate crimes laws .
Joe Solomnese of HRC and Judy Shepard respond to the signing …
“ This law honors our lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender brothers and sisters whose lives were cut short because of hate , ” said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese .
“ Today ’s signing of the first major piece of civil rights legislation to protect LGBT Americans represents a historic milestone in the inevitable march towards equality .
Although this is a major step in fighting the scourge of hate violence , it is not the end of the road .
As a community , we will continue to dedicate ourselves to changing not only laws but also hearts and minds .
We know that hate crimes not only harm individuals , but they terrorize entire communities .
After more than a decade of advocacy , local police and sheriffs ’ departments now have the full resources of the Justice Department available to them . ”
“ We applaud President Obama for signing this bill into law and thank the leadership and our allies in the House and Senate .
We also will always remember the tireless efforts of Senator Edward Kennedy on this issue .
Senator Kennedy once said that this legislation sends ‘ a message about freedom and equality that will resonate around the world . ’
This marks the first time that we as a nation have explicitly protected the LGBT community in the law .
And this law sends a loud message that perpetrators of hate violence against anyone will be brought to justice , ” said Solmonese .
“ We are incredibly grateful to Congress and the president for taking this step forward on behalf of hate crime victims and their families , especially given the continuing attacks on people simply for living their lives openly and honestly , ” said Judy Shepard , executive director of the Matthew Shepard Foundation .
“ But each of us can and must do much more to ensure true equality for all Americans . ”
US was ‘ hell - bent ’ on Iraq invasion , Greenstock says
The administration of George W. Bush was so dismissive of efforts to get UN approval for an invasion of Iraq that it effectively scuttled attempts at making the war legitimate , a former British ambassador to the UN says .
Sir Jeremy Greenstock , who was the UK ’s ambassador to the UN from 1998 to 2003 , told Britain ’s Iraq war inquiry that the Bush administration was “ decidedly unhelpful ” as he struggled to gain support from UN member countries for a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq .
ADVERTISEMENT
The UN passed resolution 1441 in November , 2002 , mandating the return of weapons inspectors into Iraq .
But the US and its allies invaded Iraq in March , 2003 , without a second resolution that Britain had sought , which would have authorized the invasion .
As a result , Greenstock said , the war was of “ questionable legitimacy . ”
“ I regarded our invasion of Iraq , our participation in the military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy in that it did not have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of member states , or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the UK , ” Greenstock said .
“ The UK ’s attempt to reconstitute a consensus had only a slim prospect of success , made slimmer by the recognition by anyone else following events closely that the United States was not proactively supportive of the UK ’s efforts and seemed to be preparing for conflict whatever the UK decided to do , ” the Times of London quoted Greenstock as saying .
“ The lack of a second resolution has led many critics of military action to argue that the invasion was illegal under international law – an allegation the British Government has always denied , ” reports the Daily Telegraph .
The former ambassador said the second UN resolution never happened because the international community believed the US was ‘ hell bent on the use of force ’ regardless of the UN and world opinion , the Associated Press reports .
ADVERTISEMENT
Greenstock told the inquiry he was so alarmed at the lack of US co-operation that he threatened to resign over the matter .
The Chilcot Inquiry , as the British inquiry is known , heard on Wednesday that then - Prime Minister Tony Blair was told ten days before the invasion that Iraq likely did n’t have weapons of mass destruction , and almost certainly had no means to deliver them , but Blair continued to insist all the same that Iraq was building WMDs .
On Thursday , Britain ’s former ambassador to Washington told the inquiry that then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice was already focused on the possibility of an Iraqi link to 9/11 on the day of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon .

The inquiry will hear from Blair early next year .
It is expected to release a report on the Iraq invasion by late 2010 .

There are more fears about the Qadbak company , which has acquired the Sauber F1 team from BMW .
The mysterious Swiss foundation is also the owner of the Notts County soccer club in England but the latest news from there is that the soccer team may be wound up on November 18 at the High Court as a bankruptcy order has been tabled following the failure of the previous owner Blenheim 1862 to clear a debt .
The petition to wind the team up comes from HM Revenue and Customs .
Qadbak owns Notts County via a British Virgin Islands company called Munto Finance , which owns the shares of Blenheim 1862 .
It is reported that as part of the purchase it was agreed that the £ 400,000 owed to HM Revenue and Customs would be paid , but it has not been , raising questions about whether Qadbak really has the money it claims .
It is worth noting also that there has been a change in recent days on the board of the BMW - Sauber team with highly respected financier Oswald Grubel resigning his position .
The chief executive of UBS has not given any reason for his decision .
A photograph handed to The Independent claims to show Iraqi civilians captured in southern Iraq being mistreated by British soldiers in breach of international law and the Geneva Conventions .
The incident is to be investigated at a public inquiry to be announced tomorrow by Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth , which will also examine evidence of one of the worst atrocities ever carried out by the British Army .
It is claimed that hours after the picture , left , was taken , the four men were transferred to a UK - run detention camp where they were badly beaten and where 20 other civilians were murdered by British soldiers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lawyers for the men say the photograph , held by the Army since May 2004 but only disclosed this year , supports evidence of the routine abuse of Iraqi prisoners .
The covering of a prisoner 's face and rear handcuffing on the ground is a breach of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions which prohibits the humiliating and degrading treatment of detainees .
When this is done to support interrogations , as in this case , it also contravenes Article 31 : prohibition of physical and moral coercion .
It is also a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , as well as the Army 's own rules on the hooding of prisoners .
The International Committee of the Red Cross raised concerns about similar breaches in February 2004 when it warned the UK and US governments of these practices .
The new evidence will add to calls for a full and proper public inquiry into 33 further abuse cases involving allegations against the British Army in Iraq between 2003 and 2008 .
Last night , Lord David Ramsbotham , a former commander of the British Field Army and a former chief inspector of prisons , said he believed the picture showed inhuman and degrading treatment .
He told The Independent : " There can be few people who have not been sickened , and saddened , by the images of Iraqi citizens being subjected to what is well described as inhuman and degrading treatment , at the hands of certain British soldiers .
" Sickened because this is not the kind of treatment associated with a nation that calls itself civilised ; saddened because it besmirches the reputation of the British Army , so carefully preserved by so many people in many different circumstances , " he said .
Kevin Laue , the legal adviser to Redress , which works with victims of torture , said : " In my view , what the photograph shows could well constitute cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ... they appear to have been blindfolded to such an extent that almost their whole face has been covered , including the nose and even the mouth , which if so would obviously make normal breathing difficult ...

" The photograph raises numerous questions which would need to be asked and answered to decide if the treatment could be justified .
On the face of it , it is wrong , " he said .
Phil Shiner , the lawyer who pushed for a public inquiry into the alleged massacre and mutilation of 20 Iraqi civilians in the aftermath of the Battle of " Danny Boy " , which involved British forces , near Basra in May 2004 , said : " The MoD conceded an inquiry not simply because of late disclosure , but because much of that disclosure supported our clients ' allegations .
" This evidence had gone uninvestigated by the Royal Military Police , undermined the MoD 's case and showed how it had been misrepresented to the court .
An inquiry is essential so that lessons can be urgently learned and , where necessary , perpetrators brought to justice in relation to this incident and the hundreds of other cases involving civilians that we now know went uninvestigated in Iraq . "
Government lawyers admitted in the summer that in 2004 the Armed Forces minister had written a draft confidential letter , addressed to No 10 , which referred to complaints made by the International Committee of the Red Cross in connection with the alleged ill - treatment of detainees held by the Army after the battle .
It was the discovery of this correspondence which led the Government to withdraw its defence to a judicial inquiry into the alleged massacre and abuse of the Iraqis .
Lawyers for the Iraqis and the families of those who died said the case raised allegations that were among the most serious in modern British military history .
Tomorrow , Mr Ainsworth will tell Parliament the name of the judge chosen to head the inquiry , referred to as Al Sweady after the lead claimant in the case .
The Government has always maintained that the victims were all killed in battle while their families ' lawyers say they were innocent farmers who tried to flee the fighting .
An MoD spokesman said : " We have found no credible evidence that those detained , as a result of the attack on British troops and prolonged fire - fight at the Danny Boy checkpoint , were mistreated .
" The treatment of the detainees shown in the photograph does not amount to a breach of the Geneva Conventions , it is important to remember that our first priority at the end of such attacks is to protect our personnel from further threats .
" The events that followed will , in due course , be considered by the Al Sweady inquiry . "
Geneva Conventions
* Hooding , cuffing and forced to lie in stress positions in the sun :
Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions prohibits the humiliating and degrading treatment of detainees .
* Article 31 of the Conventions prohibits physical and moral coercion techniques used to support interrogations .
* Article 3 of the European Conventions on Human Rights bans inhuman and degrading treatment .
The Army 's own rules forbid hooding of prisoners and handcuffing their arms behind their back on the ground .
Covering the faces in this way restricts breathing , and to all intents and purposes , is the same as hooding .
Its use in May 2004 contradicts the assurances given by the Armed Forces minister in 2004 and General Brims in 2006 to the Parliamentary Joint Human Rights Committee that hooding / face covering had been effectively outlawed .
* Handcuffing to the rear restricts breathing , has been known to lead to deaths in custody and renders a prisoner unable to break his fall if pushed .
Humans are ‘ programmed ’ to believe in God and the supernatural , scientific researchers have found .
A study into the way children ’s brains develop suggests that beliefs in the supernatural are present from birth .
The findings of Bruce Hood , professor of developmental psychology at Bristol University , challenge the claims of atheists such as Richard Dawkins .
Professor Dawkins ’ assertion that religious belief is a result of poor education and ‘ indoctrination ’ is well known .
Professor Hood said : “ Our research shows children have a natural , intuitive way of reasoning that leads them to all kinds of supernatural beliefs about how the world works . ”
Other academics have said that their research supports Prof Hood ’s findings .
In the science journal Nature , Washington University anthropologist Professor Pascal Boyer said : “ Religious thinking seems to be the path of least resistance for our cognitive systems ” .
“ By contrast , disbelief is generally the work of deliberate , effortful work against our natural cognitive dispositions — hardly the easiest ideology to propagate . ”
Speculating as to why their research showed religious belief to be ‘ hardwired ’ , Prof Hood and his colleagues offered an evolutionary reason .
They suggest that in the past , shared religious beliefs brought social benefits as believers cooperated to ensure mutual survival , while atheist societies lacked such beneficial cohesion .

There were tons of police there , uniformed and the plain clothes Civil Affairs Unit team .
I had a chance to meet , briefly , the protesters who were planning to engage in civil disobedience .
It felt good to be able to claim that OpEdnews probably has more content items on universal single payer than any other site -- well over 1000
Here are some of the OEN tags they are listed under .
Eight of 13 protesters who later engaged in Civil DisobedienceBC / BS employees were watching the protesters .
They were nice people , but for all we know , they may work on death panels or may be the people who inform patients that their treatments or meds are n't covered ... the first time , until a doctor or lawyer calls , or a TV show intervenes and they reverse their position .
Of course , we know that only a small percentage fight for reimbursement .
Many just take that first no .
Or maybe they just handle claims or questions from doctors .
But they make a living working for a company that is fighting for health care reform that will save lives .
The protesters should also have been carrying signs saying things like .
This Company Has Death PanelsThis Company Issues DeathDecrees and Kills People .
This Company Destroys Families ( makes them go bankrupt ) When anti-abortion , " pro-live " protesters protest at family planning centers , they carry signs and verbally go after employees .
There 's something to learn from them .
Then , the demonstrators moved the protest off the city streets to the area in front of the BC / BS headquarters .
The Police Civil Affairs Squad ( in suits and sport jackets ) blocked the protesters from entering the building .
The women in the foreground are BC / BS employees I later spoke to .
The Asian women with a hat with bright green was a legal observer .
This woman in the turquoise was watching the whole thing , throughout , so I asked what her connection was .

She refused to answer .
Anyone want to research it ?
The protesters sit down in front of the doors .
They read a letter to BC / BS .

Black ’s first concert film , set to open this week , is unsparing in its criticism of both political parties .
In a clip played by MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann , Black says , “ Our two - party system is a bowl of shit looking in the mirror at itself .
…
Basically , the last eight years , I feel , the Republicans stood around farting and the Democrats went , ‘ Ooh , let me smell it . ' ”

“ It ’s a pungent truth , ” Olbermann commented to Black .
“ I think it probably has never been more obvious than currently during this health care debate . ”
“ It ’s just unbelievable , ” Black agreed .
“ How did we end up in a position with people defending health insurance companies ? ”
“ What I ’ve always wanted to do with these protesters , ” Olbermann suggested , “ is go , ‘ What ’s your personal medical history ? ’ and I would bet you that you ’d get 75 % of them going , ‘ Never been sick a day in my life ! ’
That ’s the only way you could be satisfied . ”
Black added with astonishment , however , that “ I ’ve become a mainstream comic . …
I ’m hosting the USO benefit tomorrow night . …
It seems strange that in our lifetime , we went from Bob Hope to me . ”

There is nothing new under the sun .
Have you seen Algol 68 ?
As you might imagine , it 's an Algol variant that came out in 1968 .
( Which makes it older than I am . )
It begat Pascal , Modula , Oberon etc and is a cousin of C. ( I think it 's Lua 's uncle . )
There 's a good Wikipedia page : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68
It 's a bit scary .
It looks * just like a modern programming language * .
It 's got C - like types ( although to be more accurate , C has Algol - 68 - like types ) .
It 's got user defined polymorphic perators ( with user defined precedence ) .
Keywords and identifiers occupy different namespaces .
Identifiers can contain spaces !
It 's got block expressions .
It 's got OCCAM - like concurrency ( there 's a par keyword for running processes in parallel and built - in support for namespaces ) .
You can use values before you define them !
Most syntax elements have a short form and a long form , where the short form is designed for single statements and the long form for multiline statements .
Example : # create a new type , ' vector ' , of an array of reals indexed 1..3 # mode vector = [ 1:3 ] real ; # now create a matrix type similarly # mode matrix = [ 1:3 , 1:3 ] real ; # create some vectors # vector v1 := ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) ; vector v2 := ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) ; # create an operator that works on vectors # op + = ( vector a , b ) vector : begin vector out ; for i from lwb a to upb a do out [ i ] := a [ i ] + b[ i ] ; od ; out # value of last expression in block is value of block # end # define a matrix from our vectors matrix m := ( v1 , v2 , v1+v2 ) ; # get a reference to one of the rows of the matrix ref vector horizontal = m [ 2 , ] ; # get a reference to one of the columns of the matrix ref vector vertical = m [ ,2 ] ;
There are a few features I have n't seen anywhere else , such as the universal loop construct which replaces both for ... next and while ... end , which I 've never seen anywhere else : # loop in ' for ' mode for i from 1 to 10 do print ( i ) od # ... and in ' while ' mode while i < 10 do print ( i ) ; i := i + 1 ; od # ... and in both ! for i from 1 to 10 while checkWhetherCancelled ( ) do print ( i ) od # ... just loop , no counter ! to 10 do print ( " Ten times ! " ) od # ... minimum syntax do print ( " Loop forever " ) od # ... maximum syntax for i from 1 by 1 to 10 while checkWhetherCancelled ( ) do print ( i ) od Algol - 68 has some particularly interesting pointer semantics , nicer than C's IMO .
This : int i ; ... is actually sugar for : ref int i = loc int ; ' loc int ' is an expression that returns a new integer stored on the stack .
( You can also say ' heap int ' to create a new integer stored on the heap . ) ' ref int ' creates a pointer to an int .
In other words , all variables are actually pointers .
Unlike C , Algol - 68 has distinct operations that work on the pointer and operations that work on the value ; most operators will implicitly dereference their operands .
If you want to , say , compare two references to see whether they 're pointing at the same thing , there is a specific ' a is b' operator for doing so .
Personally I think this is much more consistent and less ugly than C ( and Go's ) approach , where you have to know whether you 're dealing with a pointer or a scalar before you can deal with it ; but for some reason it's not a concept that seems to have taken off .
...
So , to get back to the point : Go vs Algol - 68 .
TBH , I think the 41 - year - old language is richer , clearer and more expressive .
It 's certainly missing some features , like any form of object orientation , polymorphic functions , but the overall design is much more consistent and well thought - out .
In 1968 Neil Armstrong was still pootling about in orbit and integrated circuits were rockets science .
Why am I able to compare a language from this era with a contemporary one on an equal basis ?
Because , depressingly , state - of - the - art in programming languages has n't moved much in those 41 years .
I think that it 's entirely plausible that if someone were to take the Algol - 68 spec , redraft it in modern terminology ( types instead of modes , names instead of variables , etc ) , update some of the odder areas such as transput , give it a catchy Web - 2.0 name and produce a decent compiler for it , then it would be heralded as the next great development in programming languages .
Which is kind of depressing ... - -- ┌─── ｄｇ＠ｃｏｗｌａｒｋ．ｃｏｍ ──── ─

um yeah .... being weird again .
but you can actually blame one of my friends for this cause he mentioned wanting to have a unicorn skull on the back cover of the book he wants to write and of course my brain went " ooooh , pretty ... " and i had to paint it .
No renders or image manip this time .
It 's all painted in photoshop using reference ( for the horse skull and cracked dirt ) .
Aprox 6 hours .
oh and the title and quote at the top of this desc .
come from the Killdares song " September " which i've been listening to pretty steadily for the last couple days .
Now , weirdness out of my system , I have an apointment with a hot tub and a friend i have n't seen in a couple months .
Update : I 'm so happy .
This is the first piece I 've tried to submit to Epilogue and it got accepted on the first shot !
Yay !

This text by Jeff Vail , from March 2008 , is still very much worth reading and pondering .
The non-excerpted part of this text deals with the positive construction of a rhizome - based world , but in this excerpt , he convincingly links hierarchical social forms to the problem of infinite growth .
Thanks to Ryan Lanham for the suggestion .
Jeff Vail :
Infinite growth is impossible in a finite world–a great deal of economic growth may be possible without a growth in resource consumption , but eventually the notion of perpetual growth is predicated on perpetual increase in resource consumption .
This growth in resource consumption causes problems : it brings civilization into direct conflict with our environmental support system .
Growth is also one way of improving the standard of living for humanity by creating more economic produce , more material consumption per human .
Growth , however , produces very unevenly distributed benefits , and there is little convincing evidence that the poorest , most abused 10 % of humanity is actually better off today than the poorest , most abused 10 % of past eras .
Furthermore , if you accept my statement above that infinite growth is impossible in a finite world , then employing growth today to “ solve ” our immediate problems incurs the significant moral hazard of pushing the problem — perhaps the greatly exacerbated problem — of addressing growth itself on future generations .
With that in mind , my intent here is to propose one possible means for humanity to directly address the problem of growth itself .
I am attempting to take what I see as an inherently pragmatic approach — one that does not rely on the universal cooperation of humanity , nor on the assumption of yet - to - be - developed technologies .
My approach to the problem of growth is to stop trying to address its symptoms — overpopulation , pollution , global warming , peak oil — and attempt instead to identify and address the underlying source of the problem .
That source is the hierarchal structure of human civilization .
Hierarchy demands growth .
Growth is a result of dependency .
The solution to the problem of growth , then , is the elimination of dependency .
This essay will elaborate on each of those points , and then propose a means to effectively eliminate dependency by creating minimally self - sufficient but interconnected networks that I call Rhizome .
It is my hope that this topic , while not directly involving crude oil reserves or some similar topic , will be highly relevant within the context of Peak Oil and Peak Energy .
Infinite growth requires , eventually , infinite energy .
Assume that we develop a perfect fusion generator , or that we cover the entire surface of the Earth with 100 % efficient solar panels .
None of this actually solves the problem of growth — it just shifts the burden of dealing with that problem onto our grandchildren , or perhaps even 100 generations from now .
It ’s easy to take the self - centered perspective that such burden - shifting is acceptable , but I find it fundamentally morally unacceptable .
This essay will begin and end with that understanding of morality , and attempt to find a way forward for humanity that balances the quality of life demands of both present and future generations .
This essay is n’t about how to find more oil , how to recover more oil , or how to use energy in general more efficiently so that we can keep on growing .
It is an opinion piece , not a data - driven scientific paper .
It is about living well , now and in the future , individually and collectively , without growth .
I. Hierarchy Must Grow , and is Therefore Unsustainable
Why must hierarchy continually grow and intensify ?
Within the context of hierarchy in human civilization , there seem to be three separate categories of forces that force growth .
I will address them in the order ( roughly ) that they arose in the development of human civilization :
Human Psychology Drives Growth
Humans fear uncertainty , and this uncertainty drives growth .
Human population growth is partially a result of the desire to ensure enough children survive to care for aging parents .
Fear also drives humans to accept trade - offs in return for security .
One of the seeds of hierarchy is the desire to join a redistribution network to help people through bad times — crop failures , drought , etc. Chaco Canyon , in New Mexico , is a prime anthropological example of this effect .
Most anthropologists agree that the Chaco Canyon dwellings served as a hub for a food redistribution system among peripheral settlements .
These peripheral settlements — mostly maize and bean growing villages — would cede surplus food to Chaco .
Drought periodically ravaged either the region North or South of Chaco , but rarely both simultaneously .
The central site would collect and store surplus , and , when necessary , distribute this to peripheral settlements experiencing crop failures as a result of drought .
The result of this system was that the populations in peripheral settlements were able to grow beyond what their small , runoff - irrigated fields would reliably sustain .
The periodic droughts no longer checked population due to membership in the redistributive system .
The peripheral settlements paid a steep price for this security — the majority of the surplus was n’t redistributed , but rather supported an aristocratic priest class in Chaco Canyon — but human fear and desire for security made this trade - off possible .
Still today , our fear of uncertainty and desire for stability and security create an imperative for growth .
This is equally true of Indian peasants having seven children to ensure their retirement care as it is of rich Western European nations offering incentives for couples to have children in order to maintain their Ponzi - scheme retirements systems .
Fear also extends to feelings of family or racial identity , as people all over the world fear being out - bred by rival or neighboring families , tribes , or ethnic groups .
This phenomenon is equally present in tribal societies of Africa , where rival ethnic groups understand the need to compete on the level of population , as it is in America , where there is an undercurrent of fear among white Americans that population growth rates are higher among Hispanics Americans .
The Structure of Human Society Selects for Growth
The psychological impetus toward growth results in what I consider the greatest growth - creating mechanism in human history : the peer - polity system .
This phenomenon is scale free and remains as true today as it did when hunter - gather tribes first transitioned to agricultural “ big- man ” groups .
Anthropologically , when big - men groups are often considered the first step toward hierarchal organization .
When one farmer was able to grow more than his neighbors , he would have surplus to distribute , and these gifts created social obligations .
Farmers would compete to grow the greatest surplus , because this surplus equated to social standing , wives , and power .
Human leisure time , quite abundant in most ethnological accountings of remnant hunter - gatherer societies , was lost in favor of laboring to produce greater surplus .
The result of larger surpluses was that there was more food to support a greater population , and the labors of this greater population would , in turn , produce more surplus .
The fact that surplus production equates to power , across all scales , is the single greatest driver of growth in hierarchy .
In a peer - polity system , where many separate groups interact , it was not possible to opt - out of the competition to create more surplus .
Any group that did not create surplus — and therefore grow — would be out - competed by groups that did .
Surplus equated to population , ability to occupy and use land , and military might .
Larger , stronger groups would seize the land , population , and resources of groups that failed in the unending competition for surplus .
Within the peer - polity system , there is a form of natural selection in favor of those groups that produce surplus and grow most effectively .
This process selects for growth — more specifically , it selects for the institutionalization of growth .
The result is the growth imperative .
The Development of Modern Economics & Finance Requires Growth
This civilizational selection for growth manifests in many ways , but most recently it resulted in the rise of the modern financial system .
As political entities became more conscious of this growth imperative , and their competition with other entities , they began to consciously build institutions to enhance their ability to grow .
The earliest , and least intentional example is that of economic specialization and centralization .
Since before the articulation of these principles by Adam Smith , it was understood that specialization was more efficient — when measured in terms of growth — than artesian craftsmanship , and that centralized production that leveraged economy of place better facilitated growth than did distributed production .
It was not enough merely to specialize “ a little , ” because the yardstick was not growth per se , but growth in comparison to the growth of competitors .
It was necessary to specialize and centralize ever more than competing polities in order to survive .
As with previous systems of growth , the agricultural and industrial revolutions were self - reinforcing as nations competed in terms of the size of the infantry armies they could field , the amount of steel for battleships and cannon they could produce , etc .
It was n’t possible to reverse course — while it may have been possible for the land area of England , for example , to support its population via either centralized or decentralized agriculture , only centralized agriculture freed a large enough portion of the population to manufacture export goods , military materiel , and to serve in the armed forces .
Similarly , the expansion of credit accelerated the rate of growth — it was no longer necessary to save first buy later when first home loans , then car loans , then consumer credit cards became ever more prevalent , all accelerating at ever - faster rates thanks to the wizardry of complex credit derivatives .
This was again a self - supporting cycle : while it is theoretically possible to revert from a buy - now - pay - later system to a save - then - buy system , the transition period would require a significant period of vastly reduced spending — something that would crush today ’s highly leveraged economies .
Not only is it necessary to maintain our current credit structure , but it is necessary to continually expand our ability to consume now and pay later — just as in the peer polity conflicts between stone - age tribes , credit providers race to provide more consumption for less buck in an effort to compete for market share and to create shareholder return .
Corporate entities , while existing at least as early as Renaissance Venice , are yet another example of structural bias toward growth : corporate finance is based on attracting investment by promising greater return for shareholder risk than competing corporations , resulting in a structural drive toward the singular goal of growth .
And modern systems of quarterly reporting and 24 - hour news cycles only exacerbate the already short - term risk horizons of such enterprises .
Why This is Important
This has been a whirlwind tour of the structural bias in hierarchy toward growth , but it has also , by necessity , been a superficial analysis .
Books , entire libraries , could be filled with the analysis of this topic .
But despite the scope of this topic , it is remarkable that such a simple concept underlies the necessity of growth : within hierarchy , surplus production equates to power , requiring competing entities across all scales to produce ever more surplus — to grow — in order to compete , survive , and prosper .
This has , quite literally , Earth shaking ramifications .
We live on a finite planet , and it seems likely that we are nearing the limits of the Earth ’s ability to support ongoing growth .
Even if this limit is still decades or centuries away , there is serious moral hazard in the continuation of growth on a finite planet as it serves merely to push that problem on to our children or grandchildren .
Growth cannot continue infinitely on a finite planet .
This must seem obvious to many people , but I emphasize the point because we tend to overlook or ignore its significance : the basis of our civilization is fundamentally unsustainable .
Our civilization seems to have a knack for pushing the envelope , for finding stop - gap measures to push growth beyond a sustainable level .
This is also problematic because the further we are able to inflate this bubble beyond a level that is sustainable indefinitely , the farther we must ultimately fall to return to a sustainable world .
This is Civilization ’s sunk cost : there is serious doubt that our planet can sustain 6 + billion people over the long term , but by drawing a line in the sand , that “ a solution that results in the death of millions or billions to return to a sustainable level ” is fundamentally impermissible , we merely increase the number that must ultimately die off .
Furthermore , while it is theoretically possible to reduce population , as well as other measures of impact on our planet , in a gradual and non-dramatic way ( e.g. no die off ) , the window of opportunity to choose that route is closing .
We do n’t know how fast — but that uncertainty makes this a far more difficult risk management problem ( and challenge to political will ) than knowing that we have precisely 10 , 100 , or 1000 years .
This is our ultimate challenge : solve the problem of growth or face the consequences .
Growth is n’t a problem that can be solved through a new technology –all that does is postpone the inevitable reckoning with the limits of a finite world .
Fusion , biofuels , super - efficient solar panels , genetic engineering , nano - tech–these cannot , by definition , solve the problem .
Growth is not merely a population problem , and no perfect birth control scheme can fix it , because peer polities will only succeed in reducing population ( without being eliminated by those that outbreed them ) if they can continue to compete by growing overall power to consumer , produce , and control .
All these “ solutions ” can do is delay and exacerbate the Problem of Growth .
Growth is n’t a possible problem–it ’s a guaranteed crisis , we just do n’t know the exact time - frame .
Is there a solution to the Problem of Growth ?
Can global governance lead to an agreement to abate or otherwise manage growth effectively ?
It ’s theoretically possible , but I see it about as likely as solving war by getting everyone to agree to not fight .
Plus , as the constitutional validity and effective power of the Nation - State declines , even if Nation - States manage to all agree to abate growth , they will fail because they are engaged in a very real peer - polity competition with non-state groups that will only use this competitive weakness as a means to establish a more dominant position–and continue growth .
Others would argue that collapse is a solution ( a topic I have explored in the past ) , but I now define that more as a resolution .
Collapse does nothing to address the causes of Growth , and only results in a set - back for the growth - system .
Exhaustion of energy reserves or environmental capacity could hobble the ability of civilization to grow for long periods of time–perhaps even on a geological time scale– but we have no way of knowing for sure that a post - crash civilization will not be just as ragingly growth - oriented as today ’s civilization , replete with the same or greater negative effects on the environment and the human spirit .
Similarly , collapse that leads to extinction is a resolution , not a solution , when viewed from a human perspective .
A solution , at least as I define it , must allow humans to control the negative effects of growth on our environment and our ability to fulfill our ontogeny .
The remaining essays in this series will attempt to identify the root cause of the problem of growth , and to propose concrete and implementable solutions that satisfy that definition .
II .
Hierarchy is the Result of Dependency
The first section in this essay identified the reason why hierarchical human structures must grow : surplus production equals power , and entities across all scales must compete for this power — must grow — or they will be pushed aside by those who do .
But why ca n’t human settlements simply exist as stable , sustainable entities ?
Why ca n’t a single family or a community simply decide to opt out of this system ?
The answer : because they are dependent on others to meet their basic needs , and must participate in the broader , hierarchal system in order to fulfill these needs .
Dependency , then , is the lifeblood of hierarchy and growth .
Dependency Requires Participation on the Market ’s Terms
Take , for example , a modern American suburbanite .
Her list of dependencies is virtually unending : food , fuel for heat , fuel for transport , electricity , clothing , medical care , just to name a few .
She has no meaningful level of self - sufficiency — without participation in hierarchy she would not survive .
This relationship is hierarchal because she is subservient to the broader economy — she may have negotiating power with regard to what job she performs at what compensation for what firm , but she does not have negotiating power on the fundamental issue of participating in the market economy on its terms .
She must participate to gain access to her fundamental needs — she is dependent ( consider also Robert Anton Wilson ’s notion of money in civilization as “ bio- surival tickets ” ) .
Compare this to the fundamentally similar situation of family in Lahore , Pakistan , or a farmer in rural Colombia .
While their superficial existence and set of material possessions may be strikingly different , they share this common dependency .
The Colombian farmer is dependent on a seed company and on revenue from his harvest to fuel his tractor , heat his home , and buy the 90 % of his family ’s diet that he does not grow .
The family in Lahore is dependent on the sales from their clothing store to purchase food — they cannot grow it themselves as they live in an apartment in a dense urban environment .
They are dependent on participation in hierarchy — they cannot participate on their own terms and select for a stable and leisurely life .
The market , as a result of competition between entities at all levels , functions to minimize input costs — if corn can be grown more cheaply in America and shipped to Colombia than it can be grown in Colombia , by a sufficient margin , then that will eventually happen .
This requires the Colombian farmer to compete to make his corn as cheap as possible — i.e. to work as long and as hard to maximize his harvest .
While if he were participating on his own terms , he may only wish to work 20 hours per week , he may have to work 50 , 60 , or more hours at hard labor to make enough money off competitively priced corn to be able meet the basic needs of his family in return .
He is in competition with his neighbors and competing entities around the world to minimize the input cost of his own efforts — a poor proposition , and one that is forced upon him because he participates on the market ’s terms , all a result of his dependency on the market to meet his basic needs .
The situation of the family of shopkeepers in Pakistan or the Suburban knowledge - worker in America is fundamentally the same , even if it may vary on the surface .
The Blurring of Needs and Wants
Why not just drop out ?
It is n’t that tough to survive as a hermit , gather acorns , grow potatoes on a small plot of forest , or some other means of removing oneself from this dependency on the market .
To begin with , “ dropping out ” and becoming self - sufficient is not quite as easy as it sounds , and just as importantly , it would become nearly impossible if any significant portion of the population chose that route .
But more fundamentally , humans do n’t want to drop out of participation in the market because they desire the enhanced consumption that is available — or at least exists in some far - off - promised land called “ America ” ( fantasy even in the mind of most “ Americans ” ) — only through such participation .
It may be possible to eat worms and acorns and sleep in the bushes , but this would be even more unacceptable than schlepping to work 40 + hours a week .
Most people cannot envision , let alone implement , a system that maintains an acceptable “ standard of living ” without participation in the system , and all but the very lucky or brave few ca n’t figure out how to participate in that system without being dependent on it .
There is certainly a blurring of “ needs ” and “ wants ” in this dependency .
Humans do n’t “ need ” very much to remain alive , but a certain amount of discretionary consumption tends to increase the effectiveness of the human machine .
From the perspective of the market , this is desirable , but is also an input cost that must be minimized .
This is the fundamental problem of participating in the market , the economy , the “ system ” on its terms : the individual becomes nothing more than an input cost to be minimized in the competition between entities at a higher organizational level .
John Robb recently explored this exact issue , but from the perspective of the local community –the implications are quite similar .
In an era of globalization , increased communications connectivity , and ( despite the rising costs of energy ) an ever increasing global trade network , this marginalization is accelerating at breakneck speed .
Is your job something that can be done online from India ?
How about in person by an illegal immigrant ?
Because there are people with doctorates willing to work for ¼ what you make if you ’re in a knowledge field , and people with high tolerance for mind - numbing , back - breaking labor willing to work hard for $ 5 / hour or less right next door ( or for $ 2 / day overseas ) .
If this does n’t apply to you , you ’re one of the lucky few ( and , if I might add , you should be working to get yourself to into just such a position ) .
Maybe they do n’t know how to outsource your function yet , but trust me , someone is working on it .
Participation in the market on its terms means that the market is trying to find a way to make your function cheaper .
This dependency on participation in the hierarchal system fuels the growth of hierarchy .
Even if there is a severe depression or collapse , hierarchy will survive the demand destruction because it is necessary to produce and redistribute necessities to people who do n’t or ca n’t produce them themselves .
It may be smaller or less complex , but as long as people depend on participation in an outside system — whether that is a local strong man or an international commodities exchange — to gain access to basic necessities , the organization of that system will be hierarchal .
And , as a hierarchy , that system will compete with other hierarchies to gain surplus , to grow , and to minimize the cost of human input .
Dependency on a Security Provider
One of the most significant areas in which people are dependent on hierarchal systems is to provide security .
This seems to be especially true in times of volatility and change .
While it may be possible to set up a fairly self - sufficient farm or commune and provide for one ’s basic needs , this sufficiency must still be defended .
If everyone does n’t have access to the necessities that you produce for yourself , then there is potential for conflict .
This could range from people willing to use violence to access to your food or water supply to governments or local strong - men expecting your participation in their tax scheme or ideological struggle .
Ultimately , dependence on hierarchy is dependence on the blanket of security it provides , no matter how coercive or disagreeable it may be , and even if this security takes the form of “ participation ” in exchange for protection from the security provider itself .
Why this is Important
Virtually everyone is dependent on participation in hierarchal systems to meet their basic needs , of one type or another .
This dependency forces participation , and drives the perpetual growth — and therefore the ultimate unsustainability — of hierarchy .
If growth is the problem , then it is necessary to identify the root cause of that problem so that we may treat the problem itself , and not merely a set of symptoms .
In our analysis , we have seen in Part 1 that hierarchies must grow , and now in this installment that human dependency is what sustains these hierarchies .
Dependency , then , is the root cause of the problem of growth .
III .
Building an Alternative to Hierarchy : Rhizome
So far in this essay , I have argued that competition between hierarchal entities selects for those entities that most efficiently grow and intensify , resulting in a requirement for perpetual growth , and that ongoing human dependency on participation in this system is the lifeblood of this process .
At the most basic level , then , an alternative to hierarchy and a solution to the problem of growth must address this issue of dependency .
My proposed alternative — what I call “ rhizome ” — begins at exactly this point .
Achieving Minimal Self - Sufficiency
The first principle of rhizome is that individual nodes — whether that is family units or communities of varying sizes — must be minimally self - sufficient .
“ Minimally self - sufficient ” means the ability to consistently and reliably provide for anything so important that you would be willing to subject yourself to the terms of the hierarchal system in order to get it : food , shelter , heat , medical care , entertainment , etc .
It does n’t mean zero trade , asceticism , or “ isolationism , ” but rather the ability to engage in trade and interaction with the broader system when , and only when , it is advantageous to do so .
The corollary here is that a minimally self - sufficient system should also produce some surplus that can be exchanged — but only to the extent that is found to be advantageous .
A minimally self sufficient family may produce enough of its own food to get by if need be , its own heat and shelter , and enough of some surplus — let ’s say olive oil — to exchange for additional , quality - of - life - enhancing consumables as it finds advantageous .
This principle of minimal self - sufficiency empowers the individual family or community , while allowing the continuation of trade , value - added exchange , and full interaction with the outside world .
It should be immediately apparent that “ dependency ” is the result of one ’s definition of “ need . ”
Total self - sufficiency in the eyes of a Zimbabwean peasant , even outright luxury , may fall far short of what the average American perceives as “ needing ” to survive .
As a result , an “ objectively ” self - sufficient American may sell himself into hierarchy to acquire what is perceived as a “ need . ”
To this end , what I have called “ elegant simplicity ” is a critical component of the creation of “ minimal self - sufficiency . ”
This is the notion that through conscious design we can meet and exceed our “ objective ” needs ( I define these as largely experiential , not material , and set by our genetic ontogeny , not the global consumer - marketing system ) at a level of material consumption that can realistically be provided for on a self - sufficient basis .
I ’ve written about this topic on several previous occasions ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) .
Leveraging “ Small - Worlds ” Networks
How should rhizome nodes interact ?
Most modern information processing is handled by large , hierarchal systems that , while capable of digesting and processing huge amounts of information , incur great inefficiencies in the process .
The basic theoretical model for rhizome communication is the fair or festival .
This model can be repeated locally and frequently — in the form of dinner parties , barbecues , and reading groups — and can also affect the establishment and continuation of critical weak , dynamic connections in the form of seasonal fairs , holiday festivals , etc .
This is known as the “ small - worlds ” theory of network .
It tells us that , while many very close connections may be powerful , the key to flat - topography ( i.e. non-hierarchal ) communications is a broad and diverse network of distant but weak connections .
For example , if you know all of your neighbors well , you will be relatively isolated in the context of information awareness .
However , if you also have weak contact with a student in India , a farmer across the country , and your cousin in London , you will have access to the very different set of information immediately available to those people .
These weak connections greatly expands information awareness , and leverages a much more powerful information processing network — while none of your neighbors may have experienced a specific event or solved a particular problem before , there is a much greater chance that someone in your diverse and distant “ weak network ” has .
In high - tech terms , the blogosphere is exactly such a network .
While many blogs may focus primarily on cat pictures , there is tremendous potential to use this network as a distributed and non-hierarchal problem solving , information collection , and processing system .
In a low - tech , or vastly lower energy world , the periodic fair or festival performs the same function .
Building Rhizome Institutions
The final aspect of the theory of rhizome is the need to create rhizome - creating and rhizome - strengthening institutions .
One of these is the ability of rhizome to defend itself .
Developments in fourth generation warfare suggest that , now more than ever , it is realistic for a small group or network to effectively challenge the military forces of hierarchy .
However , it is not my intent here to delve into the a plan for rhizome military defense — I have explored that topic elsewhere , and strongly recommend John Robb ’s blog and book “ Brave New War ” for more on this topic .
One institution that I do wish to explore here is the notion of anthropological self - awareness .
It is important that the every participant node in rhizome has an understanding of the theoretical foundation of rhizome , and of the general workings of anthropological systems in general .
Without this knowledge , it is very likely that participants will fail to realize the pitfalls of dependency , resulting in a quick slide back to hierarchy .
I like to analogize anthropological self - awareness to the characters in the movie “ Scream , ” who were aware of the cliché rules that govern horror movies while actually being in a horror movie .
When individual participants understand the rationale behind concepts like minimal self - sufficiency and “ small - worlds ” network theory , they are far more likely to succeed in consistently turning theory into practice .
Additionally , it is important to recognize the cultural programming that hierarchal systems provide , and to consciously reject and replace parts of this with a myth , taboo , and morality that supports rhizome and discourages hierarchy .
Rules are inherently hierarchal — they must be enforced by a superior power , and are not appropriate for governing rhizome .
However , normative standards — social norms , taboos , and values — are effective means of coordinating rhizome without resorting to hierarchy .
For example , within the context of anthropological self - awareness , it would be considered “ wrong ” or “ taboo ” to have slaves , to be a lord of the manor , or to “ own ” more property than you can reasonably put to sustainable use .
This would n’t be encoded in a set of laws and enforced by a ruling police power , but rather exist as the normative standard , compliance with which is the prerequisite for full participation in the network .
Finally , institutions should be devolutionary rather than accrete hierarchy .
One example of this is the Jubilee system — rather than allow debt or excess property beyond what an individual can use , accumulate , and pass on to following generations–a system that inevitably leads to class divisions and a de facto aristocracy –some ancient cultures would periodically absolve all debt and start fresh , or redistribute land in a one - family - one - farm manner .
These specific examples may not apply well to varying circumstances , but the general principles applies : cultural institutions should reinforce decentralization , independence , and rhizome , rather than centralization , dependency , and hierarchy . ”

The ACLU 's vision of an uncensored Internet was clearly shared by the U.S. Supreme Court when it struck down the 1996 Communications Decency Act ( CDA ) , a federal law that outlawed " indecent " communications online .
Ruling unanimously in Reno v. ACLU , the Court declared the Internet to be a free speech zone , deserving of at least as much First Amendment protection as that afforded to books , newspapers and magazines .
The government , the Court said , can no more restrict a person 's access to words or images on the Internet than it could be allowed to snatch a book out of a reader 's hands in the library , or cover over a statue of a nude in a museum .
The importance of the Internet as the " the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed , " requires that the courts perpetually uphold the freedom of speech .

When I turned 39 , a few days ago , I wrote a list about 39 things I learned through experience .
A few of them got picked up by my readers and broadcasted on Twitter .
Being bitesized really helped this process , I do n’t think any of those items were bigger than 140 characters .
One of the most retweeted was number 8 :
“ Goals are good , but no better than the mechanical rabbit at a dog race .
At the end of the race , they ’re useless . ”
Since that seemed to touch a lot of people , I thought it would be a good idea to write a full post about it .
Which I am doing as right now . 🙂
The Promise of Goals
Everybody knows the power of goals .
They light the path , throw away the fog and make your efforts worthwhile .
Some of the most popular goals are :
get out of debt
get a compatible partner
be your own boss
get a promotion
Of course , there are other smaller goals like owning a specific house or car .
Or even buying a specific computer .
I want to have a Mac by Christmas .
That ’s a goal .
Usually , goals are good .
But , once you reached your goal , what happens ?
Where is the drive to run ?
Where is the motivation ?
Gone , of course .
You reached your goal .
The race is over .
The only thing that would make you run again is another race .
Another goal .
Another mechanical rabbit running in front of you , close enough so you can tell it ’s worthwhile , but far enough to be out of reach .
In order to catch the rabbit , you have to stretch .
To go over your limits .
Usually , you do that .
But after the race you bump into that frustration again .
What the hell is wrong with that rabbit ?
Where does it hides ?
Every time I think I caught it , it disappear .
Damn you , rabbit !
Running in the Right Context
The problem is not the rabbit .
The problem is the context .
A dog race is a limited context .
It ’s a stupid competition , trying to establish a winner among a pack of dogs .
A dog race stretches the animals until one has the power to reach out and become what we call “ the winner ” .
This is pretty much what happens in the real world of jobs and careers .
This time theÂ mechanical rabbit is a certain lifestyle , a certain amount of money in the bank , a specific power position .
A lot of dogs are running after that rabbit .
One of them , after years of struggling and sacrifices , go in front of the others .
The result : the dog who catch the rabbit is a winner .
The rest are losers .
They have to start the race again .
And again .
And again .
I think you can see now how a limited context can totally change the game .
Imagine a dog in the wild .
And wild here is not defined as a context with no rules , but with less limitations than a stupid dog race .
Imagine a dog at wild , chasing real rabbits .
Is there winner there ?
Barely .
The natural context is so large that the chances that 2 dogs are chasing the same rabbit are pretty low .
And when it happens , they usually share , somehow .
A dog chasing real rabbits will do it for the thrills and for survival .
If it does n’t catch the rabbit , his meal will be gone .
There is no competition here other than continuing to live .
The victory here will be life in itself , not the first place and a medal .
Choosing Your Race
Fact is goals are highly dependent on the context .
If you chose to live your life in a limited context , chasing goals will feel as frustrating as running at a dog race .
You wo n’t be living a real life .
You would actually live a dog ’s life , being enslaved for the benefit of others .
Do n’t blame the mechanical rabbit for that , as it does the best it can .
It runs .
That ’s what a goal does , it runs before you until you reach it .
But was it worth the effort ?
The whole race was something that fulfilled you ?
Being “ number one ” is making you really happy ?
Most of the time , the answer to these questions is “ No ” .
Running over and over trying to defeat other people with the stupid hope that being ahead of them in a limited context will make you happy , that , instead of being your source of happiness , as you expect , it will eat you up inside .
The context in which you are running is limited .
So are the goals .
But , what happens if you would chose a larger context ?
Avoid the dog race altogether , step out of it .
Get rid of notions like “ winner ” or “ loser ” .
Think in terms of living , not racing .
Just being joyful for the run .
And then chose a goal on which your entire life will depend .
What if , instead of chasing a career or a political position , you would chase a life .
A different life .
Living in a certain way .
Earning enough to travel the world , for instance , but not entering any Fortune 500 list .
The difference is that once you reach this new goal , in this new context , you will feel alive and thrilling .
Reaching that goal in this new context will make your life go on , instead of just preparing you for another race .
It will leave you free and full of energy , not empty and frustrated .
That goal will be the real rabbit .
Instead of being just a mechanical impostor , it will actually give you the energy to go on .
And continue to live as you chose .
I used to chase mechanical rabbits all the time .
Being the first in my niche , with my business .
Been there , done that , felt like crap .
Maybe it was a necessary milestone for my personal evolution , but truth is I never truly enjoyed this type of competition .
Once I stepped out of the context , everything changed .
Once I left the dog race yard , with all those mechanical rabbits ready to run in front of me , something changed .
The whole game , changed , in fact .
There is no victory and no first place when you chose to live your life .
There is only life .
Sometimes you catch the rabbit , sometimes not .
But running after a real rabbit , after something on which your entire life depends , that is so amazingly different .
What type of rabbits are you chasing now ?
Are you in a dog race , following a stupid social device which will leave you empty inside once you complete the race ?
Or are you chasing out in the wild , with no limitations in a game with no victory or defeat ?
It ’s just a question of choice .

But we wanted to
The medicine man enters the outer vestibule of the sacred healing chamber .
He dons the ceremonial vestments and performs the ritual ablutions , purifying himself for the healing ritual that is about to commence .
Putting on identical masks , he and his acolytes enter the chamber , to which all others are forbidden entrance .
The man they are healing is ready , having been ushered into a deep trance by another shaman using a magical elixir .
Within the chamber are the ritual implements , which have themselves been purified , and which none but the initiated are allowed to touch .
The medicine man calls for each implement in turn , handed to him by an acolyte .
He uses these in a ritual scarification procedure that removes a small part of the ill man 's body .
When he awakens from the trance , the man is magically healed , though some further ceremonies are required before he is able to leave the grounds of the temple of healing .
To even be allowed to perform this complex healing ritual , the medicine man must go through many years of training that include numerous tests , initiation ordeals , and the mastery of a special esoteric language .
Upon completing his training , he is welcomed into the brotherhood of adepts , and his name is altered with a symbolic suffix .
He swears a sacred oath and is given a piece of paper inscribed with mystical symbols in an archaic script .
Thenceforth , he is treated with honor by his people and accorded all the perquisites of status .
I have just described surgery , as performed by licensed physicians in a modern hospital .
All of the elements of ritual are present , yet we do not typically see what goes on as a ritual .
" That 's not a ritual , " we say , " because each of those actions — the hand washing , the surgical masks , the professional training — all have a very good , rational reason . "
Rituals , we think , must tap into something irrational , something magical ; if they have any real effects , they are purely psychological in origin .
We see rituals as a separate category of action that has been largely eliminated in today 's rational , science - based society .
Asked for an example of a ritual , we might point to Communion in a Catholic church , or to a sweat lodge ceremony , or to something indigenous people do on the Discovery Channel .
I would like to offer a different conception of ritual that illuminates its continuing ubiquity in today 's world , and that suggests a means to deploy ritual as an agent of transformation .
Let 's play with this definition : a ritual is a prescribed sequence of symbolic actions that draws meaning and power from a " story of the world " .
In turn , it reinforces and affirms that story .
What , then , is a " story of the world " ?
By a story I mean a system of meanings and explanations that focuses human intention , assigns roles , coordinates activity , and says what is real .
One example is the Story of Money , which assigns meaning to the slips of paper and information bits that comprise our money system .
When that story falls apart , such as in Weimar Germany or 1993 Yugoslavia , money becomes nothing more than its physical substrate .
If you can enroll people in a story , then you can create something much bigger than you could build with your own hands .
Even something so mundane as building a house requires telling a story that people believe in .
The story , " A house will be built here , " includes such elements as workers ' paychecks , agreements to deliver materials , disbursement schedules , and so on .
All of these are symbols .
On the physical level , the workers ' paychecks are but slips of paper with blobs of ink on them .
They have power only because of the story that embeds them , a story that all participants believe in .
An alien anthropologist , though , might laugh patronizingly at our concern over these magical talismans with their sacred inscriptions .
The same goes for the construction contract , inscribed with the mysterious personal mark of each signatory , and the delivery contract , which we inscribe with row after row of symbols in the superstitious belief that the desired materials they symbolize will actually show up in a truck on the appointed day .
Our lives today are rife with little rituals that sustain the Story of the World in which we have been living .
There is nothing unusual about this ; it is as it has always been .
However , we are entering one of those special moments in history when an old story is coming to an end , to be replaced by a new one .
We are emerging from two stories , in fact , two stories that are deeply interlocked .
The first is the story of Self and World : we are discrete beings , fundamental separate from each other and from the objective universe that contains us .
The second is the Story of the People : it is the Ascent of Humanity , in which science and technology lift us from a state of dependency on nature to become nature 's master , separate and superior .
The consummation of this story would be a destiny of space colonization and immortality , in which computers , nanotechnology , and genetic engineering complete our domination of nature and free us from natural limitations .
These stories embed other , smaller stories , stories within stories within stories , that include everything in our world that depends on agreements , meanings , and symbols .
So money , as I 've said , is a story .
The government is a story .
The American Medical Association is a story .
The law is a story .
Dates and times are a story .
An educational degree is a story .
Professional licensure , your credit rating , ownership of any property , the air traffic control system , all are stories .
The rituals that sustain these stories include such things as writing a check , signing a contract , affixing a stamp , waiting in line , voting , filling out a form , writing a report , issuing a grade , affixing a label , signing off on a proposal , asking permission , showing a passport at immigration , friending someone on Facebook , registering a vehicle , making a schedule , using a theater ticket , filing a lawsuit , or issuing a receipt .
I think it is quite easy to see how these actions maintain the web of stories that underlies our society .
It is perhaps more difficult to see the ritual nature of such activities as using hand disinfectant , getting a vaccination , dialing a telephone , taking a pill , using a condom , studying for an exam , performing a safety check on an airplane , performing surgery , or planting a garden .
These tap into a much deeper level of story , that which underlies what we call physical reality .
I wo n't discuss this level much right now : the metaphysics of symbols , the ontological status of the storyteller , and so on .
The laws of physics , that we think are so objective , reflect on a deep level our sense - of - self and the story of What Is that defines self and world .
But my purpose right now is not to undo these deep metaphysical stories .
For now I will speak mostly of the stories and rituals that create social reality .
They will be enough to create a world far more beautiful than we dare imagine today .
As the overarching stories of our civilization draw to their conclusion , the rituals that draw from them and sustain them begin to grow stale .
They lose their seamless integration into the logic of our lives , and begin to look , well , like " rituals . "
Their meaning drains away from them .
In previous essays I described how this is happening to our language , provoking a crisis of meaning where words are losing their magic .
This is obvious to me every time I download some software or make a purchase on line , and have to click an " I agree " button located underneath a voluminous scrolling window filled with legal text entitled " Terms and Conditions . "
When I do this , I am supposedly entering into a contract , a concept that draws on ancient sacred ceremonies that involved the swearing of oaths , the letting of blood , and so on .
In political and legal philosophy , one often comes across the term " the sanctity of contract . "
But today we recognize the numerous on - line contracts that we enter into as meaningless formalities , and we do not really feel like we are lying when we affirm , " I have read and agree to all these terms and conditions . "
In a similar vein , many of the more important ritual underpinnings of our society are dissolving as well .
The ritual incantations of our financial officials , for example , are no longer having the intended effect on the economy .
Our medical rituals are becoming less effective as well , a fact we , in a desperate effort to preserve the familiar story , attribute to " superbugs " or " patient noncompliance " or mysterious " genetic factors , " when in fact , it is the deep story of the War on Germs and the Conquest of Nature that underlies our medicine that is coming to an end .
Something similar is happening in the educational system , where the multitudinous rituals based on the factory paradigm of standardization , " class " - ification , " grading " ( as of industrial materials ) , and the subsumption of the individual to authority , are becoming increasingly ineffectual .
Finally , the rituals of politics have become a transparent charade , where elected officials cynically invoke once - sacred principles neither they nor their listeners actually believe in .
When they fail to keep their promises , when they enact policies that few of their supporters agree with , we increasingly do n't even bother to be disappointed , because the ritual of the campaign promise has become , transparently , nothing but that , a " ritual . "
Rituals are seamlessly woven into a story of the world and are , therefore , not even recognized as rituals ( e.g. , writing a check ) .
When they start turning into " rituals , " we know that that story of the world is falling apart .
What is happening to the rituals that sustain our civilization today has happened before , leaving impotent relics that we call rituals , but that are actually " rituals " in quotation marks .
We might perform them out of nostalgia , a reverence for tradition , or in an attempt to restore the lost sacredness of modern life by borrowing it from another culture , but they will have little effect if we do not believe in a story that embeds them .
Let me offer a few examples of fake rituals , these " rituals in quotation marks . "
Nearly all of the sweat lodge ceremonies I have been to were replete with fake rituals .
Even if they scrupulously followed the prescribed procedures of the native tradition from which they originated , what was once authentic had become fake .
That is because we did not truly believe the Story of the World in which the rituals were once embedded .
In former times , when a Native American firekeeper invoked the ancestors , he was speaking from a world view in which the ancestors were a present , perhaps a palpable , reality .
When he invoked the Four Directions , again he was speaking from a system in which the Four Directions , interconnected with many other stories , were an unquestioned , basic pillar of his understanding of the world , as undoubtedly real and objective to him as protons , neutrons , and electrons are to us .
But today we are steeped in a different story , a story in which the ancestors do not participate in the events of our lives , and in which the four directions are merely points on a map .
Science defines our basic understanding of what is real , and this reality picture has no room for ancestors , spirits , or Grandmother Spider creating the world .
Even if we strive to believe in them , we cannot .
A feeling lurks in the background , " This is n't real . "
Wanting to believe something based on sentiments about respecting traditions or restoring connection to earth or spirit is not the same as actually believing something .
Beliefs are not mere vapors in the head , but reveal themselves as actions .
Some months ago , I attended a sweat lodge conducted by a full - blooded Native American .
The ceremony was held at the top of a hill , with a station to be purified with sage smoke , another station to hear of the rules for the lodge , and so on .
Each ritual was contained inside a larger ritual .
But guess what the largest ritual was , the one that contained the whole experience ?
At the very bottom of the hill , before we could participate , we had to sign a waiver .
The entire experience took place within a legal container , and that initial ritual gave primacy to the Story of the Law .
I do n't think anyone experienced the sweat lodge as transformational ; certainly I did not .
The only real ritual was the signing of the waiver .
Everything else was a " ritual . "
To be sure , it is possible for a very very powerful person to hold a group of people in his or her own Story of the World ; in other words , to believe it so completely that he can hold that belief on behalf of those who do not believe .
I have experienced rituals of that sort as well , but in my life they have been very rare indeed .
In the case I just described , I could sense an inauthenticity , a breach in the integrity of the ceremony caused by surrendering its primacy to a story that was alien and hostile to it .
I hope that the reader someday has an opportunity to be in the presence of someone who can invoke the ancestors for real .
Such a person will never say , " I would like to invoke the ancestors … , " which is two steps removed from a true invocation , or even " I invoke the ancestors , " which is one step removed .
He will address them directly , and in his invocation you will hear truth .
You will feel the ancestors ' presence , and while your mind may doubt your heart will not .
That feeling is unmistakable .
Today it is only available to us in special moments , but as the old stories collapse and we reenter a world story that has room once again for the ancestors , we will have this experience more and more often .
Life is so much richer for it !
Humanity today is transitioning into a new Story of the People , a new Story of Self , and a new Story of the World .
I sometimes articulate it as " The connected self living in joyous cocreative partnership with Lover Earth . "
I explained the paradigm of Lover Earth a little bit in " Money and the Turning of the Age " ; no longer do we treat earth as a mother from whom we are entitled to take and take without thought for how much she is capable of giving .
Such a relationship is proper for a child .
I want my own children to feel free to receive — it is up to me to determine how much I am able to give .
But the relationship to a lover is different : to a lover we desire to give as well as to receive , and we desire to create together , each offering our gifts toward a purpose transcending each of us , so that our union becomes greater than the sum of our individuality .
And so , humanity - plus - earth is becoming a new thing ; out of our sacred union , a third thing will be born .
At the peak of our separation from nature , we fell in love with the earth , a moment marked perhaps by the first satellite photographs of our gorgeous planet .
As for the connected self , this is the self of inter - beingness , the self that realizes , not only as an intellectual concept but as a felt experience , that its very being includes the being of all other creatures .
Contrary to the self of Descartes , of Adam Smith , of Darwinian biology , it is untrue that more for me is less for you .
It is the self of the Gift , the self that knows that as we do unto others , so we do unto ourselves .
And , that as we do unto ourselves , so we are in fact doing unto others .
Such as self no longer lives in an objective universe of impersonal forces and generic masses .
Its every choice shifts the cosmos , and everything that happens in the cosmos in some way happens within the self too .
Just as the rituals of the old world create and sustain it , so also can we use rituals to create and sustain the new world - generating stories .
Rituals occupy a special status among all the actions and beliefs that form a story - matrix .
Rituals connect us to what is real within that story .
They are among our most powerful tools of reality creation .
Therefore , if you would like to participate in the creation of the world of the connected self living in cocreative partnership with Lover Earth , I suggest you enact rituals that empower and create this new story .
You can easily recognize them , because from within the new story they are natural and true .
They are not " rituals , " but an integral part of the new reality .
From within it , they make sense .
From the perspective of separation they are irrational , but from the perspective of reunion they are not irrational or magical at all .
They will , however , feel sacred .
Let 's consider a small example : sorting out your garbage for recycling , composting , etc .
In the old story , unless you are doing it to avoid a fine , this is quite irrational .
What benefit is there to you if the landfill is a few inches lower ?
In the objective world of force and mass , it simply does not matter if you , one person , recycle or not .
It does n't matter either if you buy lots of plastic packaging , or eat beef from a deforested Brazilian jungle , or save a few gallons of water every day by conserving toilet flushes .
In any event , the juggernaut of destruction rolls on .
These actions only matter if everyone else does them too , and if they do , then it does n't even matter if you do them or not .
Therefore , it is irrational to do them if they involve any expense or inconvenience , as often they do .
Because they do not make sense from within the old story , we find all kinds of ways to make ourselves do these things anyway .
The favorite means is to connect them to our self - image , so that we get to think of ourselves as worthy and good because we recycle , care about the environment , and so on .
We can understand them as rituals — which is what comes to mind naturally as I watch people sort different kinds of cans into different bins — whose symbolic meaning is " I am doing my part , " " I am good , " " I am right , " or " I am worthy of love . "
Unfortunately , they actually feed a deeper story , which is something like , " I am not really good , so I must recycle , I must try hard , I must be a good boy or girl . "
In the case of many environmental activists , these efforts usually accompany a sanctimonious attitude : a conditional approval of the self and a resentment toward those who are less enlightened , less ethical , less conscious .
There is little joy to be found in sanctimony .
These same rituals become much more powerful within the new story .
Instead of thinking about them in terms of ethics , doing your part , or being good , think of all the irrational things you do as gifts to Lover Earth .
When you pay triple for a fair - trade shirt , or do without one ; when you plant a tree or help stop a new road ; when you make any contribution , no matter how small , to the well - being of the planet and its animals , plants , waters , air , soil , and people , source that act in the spirit of gratitude and offer it in the spirit of a gift .
Even if your offering is like the shy , small gift of a teenage boy to his sweetheart , the earth will be touched and grateful .
This gratitude is something we can feel .
In the old story , the story of impersonal laws and generic masses , the only explanation for this feeling is that we are imagining it , projecting it , anthropomorphizing the earth .
From the story of the separate self , how could you feel what another is feeling , and why would you even care ?
It is irrational .
But in the world of the connected self , it is quite to be expected that we can feel what others are feeling , for they are us .
Each of us is the sum total of our relationships , and not separate beings having relationships , discrete subjects possessing something separate from our core being called a " relationship . "
What is irrational and difficult in the old story becomes easy and natural in the new .
The struggle to be good is over .
That struggle , that war against the self , is based on a conception of a self that is bad : the Economic Man seeking to maximize rational self - interest , the selfish gene seeking to maximize reproductive self - interest .
Our civilization is built upon that self ; hence a penal system , a religious system , an educational system designed to overcome our natural selfishness through fear , guilt , and shame .
Do you , my friend , feel guilty for not living more sustainably ?
For your complicity in a culture that is destroying the earth ?
Do you wield that guilt over yourself and others in order to compel better behavior ?
If you do , then the rituals of recycling and reducing will actually strengthen the old story of which that guilt is part .
Instead , I invite you to embed these rituals in the new story , and in turn to draw upon the new story in creating new rituals .
From the old story , it is stupid for me to wash used pieces of plastic wrap and stick them to the refrigerator to reuse .
How much oil or landfill space am I going to save that way ?
Not very much !
But I do n't think of it that way at all .
I am not doing this to be good or to do my part .
I am having a personal relationship with that piece of plastic wrap , and with all the beings that created it , and with all of its relations .
When I bury my compost instead of putting it in the trash can , I feel the happiness of those apple cores at returning to the ground , and the happiness of the earthworms who will turn them into soil , and of the soil that will receive the worm castings .
Entering the new world means shedding any pretense that you or I are better , more ethical , more moral , or more spiritual than anyone else , and allowing our true selfishness — the selfishness of the connected self — to blossom .
It is an opening to more pleasure , a bigger trusting of desire , not a conquest of pleasure and desire .
And if the joy I share with the apple core is my projection , if the story of the connected self is my own comforting illusion to assuage the loneliness of living in a cold hard universe of force and mass , then so be it !
Many of the rituals of the old world can be embedded in the new .
In addition to the above , such things as writing a check can be done in a new spirit of gratitude and gifting rather than payment .
Other of the old world rituals are fast becoming obsolete , however , and we want no part of them .
I , for example , cannot bear to write a resume when one is requested for a conference I 've been invited to speak at .
Nor do I participate in many of the rituals of the medical system or school system .
Other rituals that feel wrong to me I still participate in , because I am afraid or not ready to exit that part of the old world .
I still file an income tax return , for instance .
Each of us , as we pioneer in our own way our unique part in the story of the connected self on Lover Earth , is moved to leave behind different of the old rituals .
Rituals bridge the distinction between symbol and reality : they do n't just mean something , they are something .
They are actions in themselves .
When tribal peoples conducted a ritual reenactment of the creation of the universe , they were n't just narrating or representing that creation , they were actually participating in it .
For them , cosmogenesis was n't a discrete event at the beginning of linear time , but an ongoing event taking place outside of time and diffracted onto it .
The ritual did n't represent the creation of the world ; it was the creation of the world .
So also , the world - creating rituals we enact today must be real to us .
Do not invoke the Four Directions or the ancestors unless they are a living reality to you .
Otherwise you will just be " playing Injun ' " and reinforcing the story behind the phenomenon of cultural appropriation .
Rituals must not be less real than any other action ; they must be more real .
Rituals are actions that are infused with sacredness , connecting us to what is real , true , and important .
Perhaps one day , a fully healed humanity will no longer distinguish something called a ritual , because all actions will be sacred .
Until then , rituals serve to remind us of the sacred world - creating power of all we do , just as prayers can remind us of the sacredness of all speech , and holy sites can remind us of the sacredness of all the earth .
Make your rituals real .
Your gifts to Lover Earth and to other parts of your connected self are not just symbols of love , they are love .
I am not saying to be content with reusing your plastic wrap .
Momentous and heroic actions , that save a forest or free a nation , come from our enactment of the roles of a new story too .
They are always irrational from within the story of separation .
No one ever did anything great by fighting herself and trying hard to be good .
No will is strong enough .
But when we give ourselves to a great story , it carries us towards acts which , from outside it , look brave and magnanimous .
As we release ourselves into the story of the connected self and Lover Earth , as that story becomes real to us and we believe it in every cell , we become capable of miracles : things which were impossible from the old story , but possible from the new .
The institutions built upon the stories of the Ascent of Humanity and the separate self are falling apart around us .
I believe that everyone knows in his or her heart that we are indeed connected , interdependent for our very being , and that we are coming into cocreative partnership with a planet we are falling madly in love with .
You may know it and not quite believe it yet .
My job is to help you believe what you already know .
But even if you do n't fully believe it now , no matter .
The old stories cannot hold much longer .
Like it or not , we are being thrust into the new .
But why wait ?
The rituals that connect us to the reality of Reunion are already coalescing , forming new systems of meaning , institutions , forms of social interaction , conceptual vocabularies , exchange infrastructure , and the myriad human roles of the new stories .
Paradigms as diverse as permaculture , energy healing , nonviolent communication , P2P economics , alternative currency , and thousands more all draw from and contribute to the new Story of the People , Story of the World , and Story of Self .
As we work , each according to our gifts , to create them , we make it all the easier for the heart 's knowing of a more beautiful world to blossom into belief and then into reality for all of us .
That new world is a place we can only enter together .
The reality of the connected self requires it .

Chinese mainland 's last D - Day veteran dies at 91 ( Xinhua )
Updated : 2009-11-18 16:30
HANGZHOU : Huang Tingxin , the Chinese mainland 's last veteran of the D - Day campaign to end the Nazi domination of Europe in 1944 has died .
He was 91 .
Huang , who died on November 11 , was made a Chevalier of the National Order of the Legion of Honour , France 's highest recognition of merit in 2006 .
Upon receiving the medal , Huang said , " The honor goes to all the Chinese soldiers who fought there . "
A graduate of the Qingdao Naval Academy , in east China 's Shandong Province , in 1942 at the age of 24 , Huang and 23 other young naval officers went on to study and fight in Britain .
After training at Royal Naval College , in Greenwich , London , Huang was deployed as deputy watch officer on a US - manufactured 10,000 - tonne escort carrier HMS Searcher , which carried up to 25 fighter aircraft , in March 1944 .
His duty was to make sure the ship maintained course and remained in formation .
Huang saw active duty when the vessel took part in the Allied landings at Toulon , France , on D - Day , June 6 , 1944 .
" My part on the ship was not much , " Huang recalled in an interview with Xinhua in 2006 .
" Some other Chinese soldiers fought on the front line .
One of my comrades showered thousands of artillery shells on the Nazi defenses . "
Huang returned to China in 1948 and served in PLA navy after the founding of the People 's Republic of China .
He left the navy 10 years later and taught at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University ( ZSTU ) until retirement .
" We are all impressed by his diligence and sense of responsibility in his work , be it English teaching or managing the foreign books , " Jin Jingru , deputy secretary of the ZSTU committee of the Communist Party of China , told Xinhua the day before Huang 's death .
Huang kept a low - profile and seldom talked about his life in the navy .
He started to dictate his war experiences to his son , Huang Shansong , only when he was confined to bed by Parkinson 's disease .
" My father dictated what he saw in war - shattered Europe so as to remind us the cruelty of war and the preciousness of our peaceful life , " said Huang Shansong , holding the 60,000 - word transcript , on Tuesday .
" His contribution to world peace might be trivial , but he played his part .
In peacetime , he led a plain , but happy life and saw the development of our country .
" I think it's in the spirit of the Chinese people -- willing to die for the greater good when occasion demands , while appreciating the plain peacefulness of everyday life , " Huang Shansong said .
Mao Luqiong , a student at ZSTU , on Tuesday recalled the words of Huang , " I wish the word ' war ' to be a historical term and remain so forever . "
Chemical Peel
In modern world everyone likes to look younger and for that everyone is
trying different things to make their skin shine in nature .
There are many techniques available in this modern world ranging from simple facial techniques to plastic surgeries .
To remove the dead cells and wrinkles in the face there are various techniques available and by making use of any one you could get your beautiful appearance back with an attractive skin .
This kind of eliminating wrinkles from anyone face makes their look attractive and will give them a moral boost in the crowd .
Because many feel complex with their wrinkles to appear in gathering and hence removing all these makes them to appear in any gathering with courage and with a charming look .
The main reason for skin to get damage is by exposing to sunlight .
This makes the skin outer layer to damage and results in storage of dead cells on the skins outer surface as wrinkles .
This is mainly due to the dust that settles in the pores .
All these things make your skin to grow older and older as the year ’s moves .
To correct this many apply acne scars , freckles and even many facial techniques but all these will give a good look to television stars and movie stars not for ordinary people .
Hence it is better for those people to look at some other way .
Many movie stars are interested in plastic surgery .
This plastic surgery is one kind of technique which makes your appearance different from the original .
But this kind of surgery will cause more pain and hence pain reliever plays the vital role in this .
Also in this case people who are undergoing plastic surgery have to stay away from the routine work for months .
This makes the people to step away from this kind of technique and only few are willing to do .
Other than these the cost of the surgery also very high and hence it is not popular among moderate people .
Another important thing with this kind of plastic surgery is it is applicable to done only on face whereas other peeling techniques can be done anywhere in body where the skin is not good looking .
If you are the one not interested in the ordinary facial techniques as the results are not absolute and also having fear in plastic surgeries then it is better to approach chemical peel technique .
This is nothing but a simple technique used to remove the dead cells from the skin and makes the skin look attractive and normal without wrinkles .
This is done using some chemicals and hence it got the name as chemical peel .
The chemicals play the major role in removing those wrinkles and make the skin softer and attractive .
These chemicals peel the skin to remove those wrinkles and it is done generally on the surface of face , neck or hands .
This gives the very attractive look for everyone who feels the skin is having uneven tones and scars because of pimples .
Other than this it is applicable for people who like to enhance their look by some activities or techniques then this kind of peeling is the best choice .
If you are interested in this chemical peel technique then do this kind of activity with the professionals and not with ordinary people .
Because many without knowledge may apply some of the chemicals which cause side effects .
Hence it is strictly advised to look for professionals in this field to remove the dead cells and wrinkles using chemicals .
The professionals in this field are dermatologist or any plastic surgeon .
This chemical peels are classified into three types based on the deepness it peels the skin and they are ,
Superficial
Medium and
Deep .
Superficial peel :
Superficial peels are done with the help of some applicator and that includes brush , sticks or any other of this kind .
Using this applicator liquid or paste like chemicals are applied in the skin where you have to remove the wrinkles or dryness .
This chemical is removed by applying water or suitable alcohol .
Removal of this chemical is an easy process and it does n’t involve any pain or any side effects .
Other than this it does not require any time limits because it can be done every week in a month .
By doing this you will feel the change of skin color as pink after removing chemicals and this is seen as a result of peeling .
This makes your skin very bright and changes the look very attractive .
Medium peel :
This is some what tougher than the superficial peel as the chemicals used will cause pain , and irritation .
And also the chemicals have to be applied in the skin for longer period .
The pain and irritation is caused mainly because of the chemicals which sting in the pores of skin .
In some case the patient is given medicines to feel free of the pain while the applying and removing of chemicals in the skin .
Beyond this irritation people have to take rest for two days to get rid of all irritation and to continue with the work .
As the chemical application is very deeper when compared to superficial peel this kind of peeling has to be done once in six or eight month gap .
As a result of this medium peel you could see water blisters and a few layer of peeling in skin .
This makes your skin look glowing and attractive without ay wrinkles , acnes , and warts .
Deep peel :
Deep chemical peels deal with the next level of peeling as compared to superficial peel and medium peel .
This kind of peeling technique uses stronger chemicals than the previous techniques and it takes months time to completely get away from this chemical .
Because the chemicals used here penetrates deeper into several layers and makes the dead cells to fall off from the skin and removes wrinkles , acnes and warts as the whole .
This kind of deep peel is used for pre-cancerous treatment and it is advised to consult a dermatologist before going for this kind of technique .
Also people who are undergoing this kind of treatment have to keep them away from their work for long hours .
After taking this kind of deep peel procedures make sure to avoid any other peeling technique as it may result in some drawbacks .
Also avoid exposing skin to sunlight for a month period from the treatment .
All these things will helps you to keep the skin good and attractive .
In these three categories there are many peeling technique available and that includes ,
Phenol peels
Beta hydroxy acid peels
Tricholoroacetic acid peels
Alpha hydroxy acid peels
Jessner ’s peel
In this phenol peel is the strongest chemical peel solutions .
This removes the wrinkles as the whole and in this further treatment is not necessary as it peels very deep into your skin .
This is one of the best techniques which are being followed by many beauty technicians and dermatologist .
Next technique is the Beta hydroxy acid peels which is not strong as the previous one but makes your skin appearance good and removes acne scars , wrinkles to the greater extent .
Tricholoroacetic acid peel is the next one which is an intermediate between deep peeling agent and medium peeling agent .
Alpha hydroxy acid peel also known as AHA peel .
This is one of the mildest peel which helps in clearing dryness in the skin , wrinkles and acnes .
Finally , Jessner ’s peel is used , to remove dryness , wrinkles and pigments in the skin .
This peel is just the combination of acids like resorcinol , lactic and salicylic acid .
These kinds of peeling techniques are having risks and benefits but it varies with the people .
Because the chemical peel deals with the skin of the people so it may suit someone and may not suit others .
Hence it is advised to check with the professional dermatologist to know about your skin capacity so that which kind of peeling technique suits your skin could become familiar .
Because unsuitable chemical causes serious drawbacks and treating that will take a long time than treating the wrinkles and warts in your skin .
After becoming familiar with which chemical suits your skin proceed with the same else that will also cause some drawbacks .
It is advised to go step by step in this chemical peel process if you have to get into deep peel process .
That is by applying superficial peel at first which helps you to clear the above layer and makes the skin somewhat brighter than the original .
Then move to medium peel technique which moves deep into skin and helps in removing the skin dryness as a whole and clears the warts and wrinkles in a deeper manner than the superficial peeling technique .
If you do n’t come across any side effects and not satisfied with the other two peeling technique methods then move to the deep peel technique because it penetrates deeper into skin than the previous two techniques and clears the wrinkles , warts , acnes and unwanted marks from the skin as a whole and further treatment is not required .

With the Lisbon Treaty being signed by all European Union member states , the Pirate Party has gained another seat in the European Parliament .
The second Pirate Party seat will be occupied by the 22 year old Amelia Andersdotter , who will become the youngest Member of the European Parliament .
With more than 7 percent of the vote , the Swedish Pirate Party secured a seat in the European Parliament in June , and the possibility of gaining another if the Lisbon Treaty was signed by all member states .
The Lisbon Treaty was ratified yesterday by Vaclav Klaus , President of the Czech Republic , who was the last to sign the document .
Ironically , The Pirate Party was against the Lisbon Treaty , which has now doubled the number of seats the party has in the European Parliament .
The newly gained seat will be awarded to Amelia Andersdotter , who will become the youngest Member of the European Parliament .
In order to free up time for her political career , Amelia recently decided to quit Economics and Spanish at Lund University in Sweden .
Besides fighting for fairer and more sensible copyright legislation , she will also spend time on education and the development of Europe ’s knowledge economy .
“ The Parliament needs to be going for a sustainable knowledge economy , and that ’s where I come into play , ” Amelia told TorrentFreak .
Amelia will officially take her seat in Brussels on December 1st , where she will be joining Christian Engstrom .
The two will have plenty of work to do in the years to come , countering the growing influence from pro-copyright lobby groups .

CHESHIRE , Conn . —
In many ways it was just another day , another class of Wesleyan University , one of the more selective colleges in the Northeast .
The topic was multiculturalism in schools .
The discussion focused on methods of evaluating the rhetorical skills of various commentators , from Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. to Dinesh D’Souza .
One student pored over the text , his glasses perched at the tip of his nose .
Another raised his hand again and again , eager to speak .
A third lobbed grenades into the discussion .
Several worried aloud about their homework , a research paper due in a few weeks .
Wesleyan ’s Newest Admits
After years of slim pickings for prisoners who craved higher education , two Wesleyan University students convinced their school to bring an elite college education to inmates at a high - security prison .
Read inmates ’ application essays and course work
Unlike other Wesleyan classes , though , each of the students — all men — had numbers like 271013 or 298331 on their khaki shirts .
They were , in fact , inmates at the state prison here and all part of a daring , privately financed experiment in higher education that takes murderers and drug dealers and other inmates with histories of serious crime and gives them an opportunity to get an elite college education inside their high - security prison , the Cheshire Correctional Institution .
Though community colleges and others , like Boston University , have long had inmate programs , the two - month - old Wesleyan program is one of a few in the country where the selection process is highly rigorous , where academic potential is the primary criterion and where past criminal conduct , however heinous , is not considered in admission .
Some 120 inmates applied at Cheshire for 19 spots in the program .
The process required them to submit essays , some of which can be read here , on weighty matters like Frantz Fanon ’s view that language helped “ support the weight of a civilization ” or Sigmund Freud ’s thoughts on happiness .
The instructors were impressed with Jose Cordero ’s answer to one admission question :
What figure , past or present , would he like to meet ?
Mr. Cordero , who is serving 65 years for murder , said he would like to meet the Constitution , since it is a “ living ” document .
He got a fat envelope , filled with blank paper for his future assignments .
The rejected got those dreaded skinny ones .
Next semester , the inmates will study chemistry , biology and politics .
This fall , their courses consist of expository writing and Sociology 152 , the same introductory course Professor Charles C. Lemert has been teaching to generations of Wesleyan students at its nearby Middletown campus where tuition , room and board cost roughly $ 51,000 .
“ My father does college planning , ” said Michael Luther , a 23 - year - old who has been incarcerated since he was 15 , “ and a lot of students he recommends for Wesleyan do n’t even get in .
When he heard I had this opportunity , he was proud . ”
On Wednesdays , students from the Wesleyan campus come to the prison for joint discussion groups with the inmates .
The prison is a high - security center that houses roughly 1,350 inmates .
It is the place where all of Connecticut ’s license plates are made , and it offers a variety of other classes beyond the Wesleyan program , though not college level .
The motto posted in the school wing reads “ Non Sum Qualis Eram , ” or “ I am not what I once was . ”
Indeed , all the inmates in the program have records that speak clearly about their past wrongdoing .
The class has six convicted murderers , two convicted drug dealers and a kidnapper .
Collectively , the class faces more than 600 years in prison .
Several students , in fact , have little prospect of ever using their college credits in a career : prison will be their home for this lifetime .
But many of them speak with pure clarity about the reasons they were drawn to school again : idle curiosity , intellectual interest , a longing to be part of the big conversations of the day , and a desire for self - respect .
“ It ’s rejuvenating , ” said Antonio Rivera , 23 , who likes to read history and is less than halfway through a 12 - year sentence for drug dealing .
Christopher Capozziello
for The New York Times
Clyde Meikle , 38 , of Hartford is serving a 50 - year sentence for fatally shooting a man with whom he tussled over a parking spot .
Ten years ago , he earned his high school diploma in prison .
He likes to set a positive example for what he calls “ the younger cats . ”
“ For me , it was a self - esteem thing , ” he said .
Across the country , colleges faced with shrinking endowments are trying to cut corners , not add programs , and many colleges have given up their inmate education programs in the years since the Clinton administration decided it would no longer subsidize them with Pell grants .
Four years ago , in fact , Wesleyan balked at a proposal to install such a program .
But the university has a long history of civic engagement that traces back to its Methodist roots .
It is named after John Wesley , an 18th - century minister who championed prison reform and helping the downtrodden .
Two students , Russell Perkins and Molly Birnbaum , who had volunteered in prisons as students , revived the idea last year when they were seniors and figured out a way to finance it .
They obtained nearly $ 300,000 from the Bard Prison Initiative , a program that already pays to offer Bard College courses in a handful of New York prisons .
That should fully pay for Wesleyan ’s program for two years and provide partial financing for two more .
“ Wesleyan has taken a courageous stand here , ” said Max Kenner , the executive director of Bard ’s program , who said he is convinced that education is a key tool for reducing recidivism .
How to finance the program over the long term is still under discussion , as is the question of whether an inmate who completes the course work will necessarily receive a Wesleyan degree .
But the instructors insist that the standards are identical — that an A in prison is the same as an A on campus and that the inmates will be entitled to use the university ’s career services upon release .
Crime victims and their advocates question whether the investment will be worthwhile .
“ I appreciate the need to educate offenders , but I ’m saddened we do n’t spend that kind of money or take that kind of time to rebuild the lives of crime victims , ” said Michelle S. Cruz , Connecticut ’s independent victim advocate .
Sam Rieger , a Waterbury man whose 19 - year - old daughter was murdered by a man now incarcerated at the Cheshire prison , agreed .
“ This does not make sense to me , ” he said of the Wesleyan program .
“ What is the point ? ”
He said the money should be spent on victims or on trying to help young people make better choices .
On a recent Monday at the prison , Beth Richards , the inmates ’
English professor , looked around the class and sought to assure them that they have the same ability to succeed as their main campus counterparts .
“ Remember , ” she said , “ for most of literary history , people did it with pencil and paper .
I agree you have limitations , but you have no limit on your brain . ”
The discussion turned to whether multiculturalism had a place in schools .
Damien Thomas , 33 , who is serving a 120 - year sentence for two murders , said he took issue with the concept of the melting pot .
“ The salad bowl theory is better , ” he said .
“ Everyone keeps their different shapes and forms but still contributes something to the salad . ”
University administrators say they will raise additional money to finance the program privately so as not to siphon money from Wesleyan ’s core mission .
That was among the concerns raised by the faculty when it gathered to vote on the proposal last spring .
The vote was first scheduled to be taken on May 6 , but it was postponed when a Wesleyan junior , Johanna Justin - Jinich , was murdered that day at the bookstore , turning a tranquil campus into a raucous crime scene .
The faculty endorsed the plan two weeks later by a show of hands , with some dissent .
“ If anything is unanimous at a Wesleyan faculty meeting , we ’d be worried , ” said Michael S. Roth , Wesleyan ’s president .
He said he shared some of the faculty ’s initial concerns , but “ the students convinced me . ”
The university has not fully wrestled with what it would do if inmates were released before completing their studies .
Bard faced this issue in May , when a female inmate became eligible for release weeks before her graduation .
She extended her stay to receive her diploma .
“ Oh , my , ” Dr. Roth said upon hearing about the inmate .
“ I do n’t know if that would be the solution I ’d want to hear . ”
He said Wesleyan would be “ as helpful as possible to someone who had that kind of dedication . ”
During her class in the prison , Professor Richards walked a fine line between energizing her students with the demands of real scholarship and scaring them back into their cells .
“ My job , ” she said , “ is to make you at least partially paranoid . ”
“ Mission accomplished , ” said Michael Fauci , 28 , a convicted robber .
Vasco Thring , 34 , wanted to know whether unwittingly using a phrase like “ education begins at home , ” which may have been said by someone else before , in a paper constituted plagiarism .
“ You are all worriers , ” the professor said .
“ That ’s fine .
If I have a choice between a group that does n’t give a rip or worriers , I ’ll take the worriers .
But trust your intelligence . ”
“ You ’re allowed , ” she said , “ to make mistakes here . ”
TORONTO , Nov. 12 ( UPI ) --
Missy the cow brought in $ 1.2 million at auction in Toronto , the second most ever paid for a single bovine in Canada , its breeder says .
" She 's the most valuable young cow in the world right now , " Bloyce Thompson , the owner of Eastside Holsteins at Frenchfort , Prince Edward Island , who bred the 3 - year - old cow , told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp .

“ It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking . ” – Ron Paul , End The Fed .
“ Technology , it is clear , was a means of escaping from the confines of reality , a way of liberating the imagination . ” – Modris Eksteins , Rites of Spring : The Great War And the Birth of the Modern Age. 1989 .
Key Porter Books : Toronto .
Pg. 322 .
The historical consensus is that the 20th century really began in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War .
But the most important event that influenced the course of the 20th century was not the war .
It was the secret creation of the Federal Reserve , a private central bank , in the United States the year before the war began .
By bringing into being history ’s biggest monetary monstrosity , the Woodrow Wilson administration committed a great betrayal against the American people , the Founding Fathers , the U.S. Constitution , and the American Revolution .
For a just , democratic , and true political order to be created in America and the world , the Federal Reserve must be destroyed .
It is because of the Fed ’s endless printing of money that America can fight endless wars against manufactured enemies such as Al - Qaeda , Iraq , and Iran .
By taking away the bankers ’ power to print money and lend to governments at high interest , we will end the demonic age of modern world wars .
The Rest ... HERE
Carbon dioxide makes up 20 percent of the gas resulting from hydrogen production , twice the concentration found in a gas stream from a typical coal plant .
Recovering it from this stream rather than a coal plant smokestack would therefore be cheaper and simpler .
In the oil industry , drillers have for years tapped underground reservoirs of carbon dioxide , brought it to the surface and moved it by pipeline to oil fields .
Then they inject it into the fields to help force oil to the surface in a process called “ enhanced oil recovery . ”
If the oil industry left the natural carbon dioxide where it was , and drew on carbon dioxide from industrial plants instead , far less manmade carbon dioxide would enter the atmosphere , experts say .
What oil drillers pay for carbon dioxide depends on the value of the oil it will help produce .
When oil is at $ 70 a barrel , carbon dioxide goes for $ 10 or $ 11 a ton , said Tracy Evans , the chief executive of Denbury , the Texas company building the carbon dioxide pipeline .
Should the Congressional legislation mandate a cap - and - trade system , that modest price could be very important .
“ Wherever you can go to store a ton of carbon the most cheaply , you will go , ” said Mr. Holmstead , the former E.P.A. administrator for air .
Another likely source of pure streams of carbon dioxide are plants that refine natural gas .
The natural gas usually comes out of the ground mixed with carbon dioxide , which natural gas sellers routinely remove so the natural gas can be considered “ pipeline quality . ”
That carbon dioxide is sometimes reinjected into the ground , but sometimes vented .
Then there are cement kilns , which produce a nearly pure stream of carbon dioxide .
For now , no one is sure what it will cost to capture and sequester carbon dioxide from coal plants because the first such project in the nation , at American Electric Power ’s coal - fired plant in New Haven , W.Va. , got under way only last month .
At the moment , the process consumes 30 percent of the coal plant ’s energy , but engineers are working to cut that in half .

Internet game that awards points for people spotting real crimes on CCTV is branded ' snooper 's paradise '
A new internet game is about to be launched which allows ' super snooper ' players to plug into the nation 's CCTV cameras and report on members of the public committing crimes .
The ' Internet Eyes ' service involves players scouring thousands of CCTV cameras installed in shops , businesses and town centres across Britain looking for law - breakers .
Players who help catch the most criminals each month will win cash prizes up to £ 1,000 .
Crime deterrent or snoopers paradise ?
The CCTV website allows access to a network of cameras where watchers can report crimes to camera owners
The Internet Eyes ' website will also feature a rogue 's gallery of the so - called ' criminals ' along with a list of their offences and which internet user caught them .
But civil rights campaigners today condemned the game , which launches in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire , next month , and branded it ' a snoopers paradise ' .
They claim nosey neighbours could snoop on homeowners putting the wrong rubbish in bins and even motorists guilty of the most minor misdemeanors .
But businessman Tony Morgan , a former restaurant owner , said it would give local businesses protection against petty criminals , and act as a deterrent once ' Internet Eyes patrol here ' signs are prominently displayed .
He will charge those who use the service , which could eventually include local authorities and even police forces as well as shop owners , £ 20 a week per camera to have their CCTV included on the site - amounting to thousands each year .
Internet Eyes : David Steele , Tony Morgan and James Woodward
He said : ' This could turn out to be the best crime prevention weapon there 's ever been .
' I wanted to combine the serious business of stopping crime with the incentive of winning money .
' There are over four million CCTV cameras in the UK and only one in a thousand gets watched .
' Crimes are bound to get missed but this way people the cameras will be watched by lots of people 24 - hours - a - day .
' It gives people something better to do than watching Big Brother when everyone is asleep .
' We 've had a lot of interest from local businesses and hope to roll it out nationwide and then worldwide . '
He said the team had seen a wave of support and denied that liberties were being affected .
' There are more than four million cameras in the UK so everybody is on camera already , it is just that no one is watching the cameras . '
Players collect points by watching the cameras , which show CCTV images in real - time , and click a button every time they see something suspicious taking place .
An SMS or text message , along with a still image of the alleged crime , is sent to whoever controls the camera .
They can then decide whether or not to take action .
The camera controller will send a feedback email back to the player indicating whether a crime has taken place .
Players are awarded one point for spotting a suspected crime and three points if they see someone committing an actual crime .
Players also lose points if the camera operator rules that the alert was not a crime .
The game has been condemned by civil rights campaigners who claim it will encourage people to spy and snitch on each other .
Charles Farrier , director of the No-CCTV pressure group , said : ' It is an appalling idea for a game and will create a snoopers paradise .
' It is something which should be nipped in the bud immediately .
It will not only encourage a dangerous spying mentality by turning crime into a game but also could lead to dangerous civil rights abuses .
' What if a group of racists decide to send alerts every time a black person is seen on screen and what 's stopping criminals using the cameras to scope out where to commit crimes . '
James Woodward , head of the technical team for Internet Eyes , which is based in Devon and Stratford - upon - Avon , said safeguards - including blocking players out for sending three incorrect alerts - would prevent the game being abused .
He said : ' For privacy reasons users will not know the location of the cameras .
They will find it very difficult to work out where the camera is .
' It is possible that someone who is blocked out could see a crime taking place but be unable to alert the operator .
' But it is probably safe to assume someone else looking at the same camera will raise the alarm .
' Whoever has a CCTV camera , be it the police , local authorities or business or home owners can sign up to have their cameras watched .
We hope to include police cameras very soon . '
The game will initially use CCTV cameras in shops and businesses in Stratford - upon - Avon but will be rolled out across Britain by December before going worldwide next year .
Last month it was revealed that Britain has 4.2 million CCTV cameras - the equivalent of one per 14 people - one - and - a - half - times as many as Communist China .

There are at least five bullets stuck in that revolver barrel .
RugerForum members seem to think is a Ruger Blackhawk in .357 Magnum .
The squib loads could have been low powered .38 Special rounds or very badly loaded .357 rounds .
That the shooter did not notice it after the 1st , 2nd , 3rd or 4th round is crazy !
It is hard to see if there is a bulge in that barrel , a symptom of a round fired into a blocked barrel .
I think if had been a semi-automatic pistol there would have been a disaster .
A revolver can vent gas in the gap between the cylinder and the barrel but in a autoloader pistol for a brief period of time the gas has no where to go and the pressure build up would be considerable .
A few weeks ago I was shooting some old .
22 Longs out of a rifle which I had not fired them out of before .
I nearly crapped my pants after the second round when I realized to forget to check the spotting scope to ensure that the first round made it out of the barrel and hit the target .
I was shooting iron sights and could not see the target .
I learnt a good lesson .
Always make sure you hit the target , especially when you are shooting low powered ammunition .

Do n't panic .
Mars is not about to pull up alongside earth
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
Every August e-mails circulate which suggest we are about to have a close encounter with Mars .
The e-mails are a hoax , but they say something about our fascination with the Red Planet .
The e-mail seems to promise something truly remarkable .
It often starts : " The Red Planet is about to be spectacular . "
It ends with the screaming caps : " NO ONE ALIVE TODAY WILL EVER SEE THIS AGAIN . "
The message tells of Mars being close to the earth on 27 August , close enough to be as big as the moon with the naked eye .
It 's the place mostly likely to have life - it's the place that science fiction nasties come from
Prof Colin Pillinger Sadly , in three weeks ' time , on 27 August , Mars will be a long way away .
But between then and now , astronomers will be bombarded with questions by curious punters about this close encounter .
" The e-mails and rumours go out every year but it is n't true .
It 's something we get asked in the planetarium a lot , " says Dr Claire Bretherton , astronomy learning officer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich .
" I get e-mails from my friends to me to check whether it 's true . "
Keith Cooper , editor of Astronomy Now magazine , is also well used to getting a sprinkling of Mars hoax e-mails every year .
Propagation mystery " It seems to do the rounds all the time .
Often there are people asking about it .
It 's variations on a theme , it is n't the same e-mail each year .
" I 'm not sure how it started or who keeps propagating it .
But it does seem to be prevalent . "
Mars has fascinated for centuries with a manned mission the current goal
The strange thing about the hoax e-mail is that most of it was true in 2003 .
Then , on 27 August , Mars came within 35 million miles ( 56 million km ) of Earth .
That compares very favourably with the next close encounter .
At the end of January 2010 it will be 66 million miles ( 99 million km ) away .
" It happens because the earth goes around the Sun in 365 days and Mars goes around in 685 days , " says Prof Colin Pillinger , mastermind of the Beagle 2 component of the Mars Express mission .
" The Earth 's orbit is only very slightly elliptical .
Mars is a very elliptical orbit . "
Every 26 months there is a close encounter .
And every 17 or so years there is a really close encounter .
Jerry Bruckheimer
But the e-mail does cause most recipients to get one thing completely wrong .
Mars will not appear as big as a full moon to the naked eye .
If this scenario occurs , you are probably trapped in the plot of a bad Jerry Bruckheimer movie .
In a host of science fictions stories , the aliens came from Mars " It says it will be as big and as bright as the full moon , which is impossible , " says Dr Bretherton .
Tides would be dramatically affected .
" It would basically have the same effect as the Moon does .
It could cause chaos . "
The original version of the e-mail makes things reasonably clear .
" At a modest 75 - power magnification Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye . "
So , with a fairly large amount of magnification Mars looked as big as the moon did with none .
Sadly , as has been noticed on urban legend sites like Snopes , that have dissected the e-mail , many readers have read the sentence as : " Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye . "
So subsequent e-mails have not only omitted the date , but also have come with the misleading catchline : " Two Moons " .
Completely absent
One would think anyone receiving it would realise something was amiss .
" Most people believe the bit about it being closest , a lot of people think twice when they hear the bit about it being as big as the full moon , " says Dr Bretherton .
But even Nasa has a page explaining the mythology behind the e-mail .
It notes that far from being close on 27 August , Mars will be so far away , 250 million kilometres , as to be " completely absent " from the evening sky .
So if the e-mail is so obviously not true , why do people keep circulating it ?
Jeff Wayne 's
The War of the Worlds is currently having a 30th anniversary tour
It might just be because they are so thrilled by the idea of a true astronomical spectacle , says Dr Bretherton .
" People keep seeing articles on the internet and start circulating them .
The idea that there is going to be something amazing in the sky is something that gets them enthusiastic . "
And Mars also has a cultural status that makes anything to do with it seem particularly alluring .
It 's the Red Planet , sharing a name with the god of war , defining character traits like anger and strength in astrology .
It also has a more recent connotation .
Aliens .
" It 's the place mostly likely to have life , " says Prof Pillinger .
" It 's the place that science fiction nasties come from . "
Wells ' vicious tripod - bound invaders in The War of the Worlds came from Mars .
Where else could they come from ?
And a slew of movies from the 1950s featured Martians .
Strange orbit
But the pop culture fascination is underpinned by centuries of genuine scientific intrigue , notes Prof Pillinger .
" It has been scientifically fascinating .
It has this strange orbit - when you look at it from Earth it goes back one way [ then ] goes back the original way .
" When people realised what that was , that was the clue that gave astronomers the information to say that the Earth went round the Sun . "
So Copernicus 's Eureka moment came from Mars , just like the B - movie invaders .
" Mars plays a role in science fiction and popular culture , aliens from Mars , the War of the Worlds , " says Mr Cooper .
" There have also been a lot of space missions .
It has always been there in the public conscience .
When we talk about searching for life , Mars is always top of the list .
I would n't call it mania but there 's definitely something that captures the fascination . "
Developments like the recent discovery of methane , which probably indicates either volcanic activity or life , keep the Mars fascination stoked .
And , then there 's the belief that Mars suffered a catastrophic event that changed its atmosphere - and terminated possible life .
" If that is true , could the same thing happen to Earth ? " asks Nasa spokesman Swayne C Brown .
" That 's one reason we send machines to the Red Planet .
The next step will be humans . "
But if you can't wait to be in the running for one such manned flight , and you are determined to see something on 27 August , Nasa suggests Jupiter might be a better bet .
Send us your comments using the form below .
I think the main reason for the fascination with Mars is that it is the only case where you can - sometimes - see the surface of another world from the surface of this one .
Venus comes closer , but it is permanently covered in clouds .
Freddy ,
An erratum to the story - Mars will not be " totally invisible " this August - it will be one of the brightest points of light you 'll see in the east before dawn .
It will be moving between the constellations of Taurus and Gemini , and about as bright as the brightest stars , at 1st magnitude brightness .
If you read the NASA article , they say that it is ' completely absent from the evening sky ' , which is perfectly true as it's in the morning sky .
The ' hoax ' though is frustrating - the original message from 2003 was deliberately altered to create the hoax , but how do you get rid of it if there are enough gullible people to pass it on ?
Andy Casely , Edinburgh
The reasons the email keeps circulating are 1 ) people having a laugh , and 2 ) most people are of surprisingly low intelligence , only marginally brighter than Mars at it 's farthest point .
Andy , London , UK I fell for this email until I actually checked the dates .
And to make it more embarassing I have a degree in Astronomy .
Matt , UK " So if the e-mail is so obviously not true , why do people keep circulating it ? "
To be blunt the real reason why people keep circulating these emails is because the closest that most of them ever get to space science or astronomy is watching reruns of Deep Space 9 on Sky .
In short , they have little or no idea how impossible the content of the email actually is because their knowledge of the solar system is woefully inadequate .
Given the state of play it is doubtful that most people in the UK over the age of 11 ( because there are always some children with an interest in space that goes beyond DS9 ) could name all of the planets in the solar system , let alone remember which order they come in .

Gallileo's Dream author Kim Stanley Robinson explains why writing about utopias is much , much harder than writing about dystopias , but also much more worthwhile if we 're planning on having descendants around to read our stories in the future .
Interviewed by Terry Bisson , Robinson explains :
Anyone can do a dystopia these days just by making a collage of newspaper headlines , but utopias are hard , and important , because we need to imagine what it might be like if we did things well enough to say to our kids , we did our best , this is about as good as it was when it was handed to us , take care of it and do better .
Some kind of narrative vision of what we 're trying for as a civilization .
It 's a slim tradition since [ Sir Thomas ]
More invented the word , but a very interesting one , and at certain points important : the Bellamy clubs after Edward Bellamy 's Looking Backward had a big impact on the Progressive movement in American politics , and H.G. Wells 's stubborn persistence in writing utopias over about fifty years ( not his big sellers ) conveyed the vision that got turned into the postwar order of social security and some kind of government - by - meritocracy .
So utopias have had effects in the real world .
More recently I think Ecotopia by [ Ernest ]
Callenbach had a big impact on how the hippie generation tried to live in the years after , building families and communities .
There are a lot of problems in writing utopias , but they can be opportunities .
The usual objection - that they must be boring - are often political attacks , or ignorant repeating of a line , or another way of saying " No expository lumps please , it has to be about me . "
The political attacks are interesting to parse .
" Utopia would be boring because there would be no conflicts , history would stop , there would be no great art , no drama , no magnificence . "
This is always said by white people with a full belly .
My feeling is that if they were hungry and sick and living in a cardboard shack they would be more willing to give utopia a try .
And if we did achieve a just and sustainable world civilization , I 'm confident there would still be enough drama , as I tried to show in Pacific Edge .
There would still be love lost , there would still be death .
That would be enough .
The horribleness of unnecessary tragedy may be lessened and the people who like that kind of thing would have to deal with a reduction in their supply of drama .
So , the writing of utopia comes down to figuring out ways of talking about just these issues in an interesting way ; how tenuous it would be , how fragile , how much a tightrope walk and a work in progress .
That along with the usual science fiction problem of handling exposition .
It could be done , and I wish it were being done more often .
Update 1.01 for the PC version of Borderlands is here !
Thank goodness , because after looking over the patch notes , you can't help but notice just how big some of these issues really are .
Characters that have lost skill points will have the lost points refunded
Clients will no longer lose proficiency progress upon leaving a co-op game
Item cards now display the intended five lines of detail text
Lilith 's
Phase strike and melee attacks from Phase Walk now function as intended
Voicechat : users can now control volume and individually mute players
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused CL4P - TP to stop progressing during the introduction
Server browser population times have been improved
Server information should now always display the correct plot mission
Benchmarking feature now works as intended
Nvidia 3D
Vision visuals now render shadows correctly ( requires minimum 195.28 drivers , available from nVidia )
Take note : if you own a retail copy of the game , you can get the patch directly from Gearbox ; if you own a digital copy , whether it be from Steam or elsewhere , you 'll have to wait on your distributor to get it out to you .
Thankfully , that should be happening momentarily .
MILAN ( Reuters ) - Italy ’s “ Brother Metal , ” a 63 - year - old monk who became famous for singing in a heavy metal band -- habit and all -- is hanging up his microphone , saying the devil made him too much of a celebrity for his own good .
The white - bearded Cesare Bonizzi , a Capuchin who recorded CDs for a punk label and was the lead singer for the band Fratello Metallo ( Metal Brother ) , said the devil was up to his usual mischief .
“ The devil has separated me from my managers , risked making me break up with my band colleagues and also risked making me break up with my fellow monks .
He lifted me up to the point where I become a celebrity and now I want to kill him , ” the monk said in his farewell video .
The video shows one of the monk ’s band members shaving off Bonizzi ’s long mane of white hair as a sign of his turning a new leaf on life .
For years Bonizzi performed at concerts wearing his traditional Franciscan brown robe , sandals and white rope around his waist .
His second heavy metal CD was called “ Mysteries , ” and was inspired by a group of southern Italian women who sang about the Virgin Mary .
Bonizzi , who fell in love with heavy metal when he attended a Metallica concert some 15 years ago , says fame had put him on the wrong path .
But he still thinks heavy metal can be a means to spread the gospel message of pace and love .
“ I think that metal is the strength of music itself .
Metal is a brother , ” he said in the video .
It ’s conventional wisdom that the legal “ wall ” between intelligence and law enforcement was one of the reasons we failed to prevent 9/11 .
The 9/11 Comission evaluated that claim , and published a classified report in 2004 .
The report was released , with a few redactions , over the summer : “ Legal Barriers to Information Sharing : The Erection of a Wall Between Intelligence and Law Enforcement Investigations , ” 9/11 Commission Staff Monograph by Barbara A. Grewe , Senior Counsel for Special Projects , August 20 , 2004 .
The report concludes otherwise :
“ The information sharing failures in the summer of 2001 were not the result of legal barriers but of the failure of individuals to understand that the barriers did not apply to the facts at hand , ” the 35 - page monograph concludes .
“ Simply put , there was no legal reason why the information could not have been shared . ”
The prevailing confusion was exacerbated by numerous complicating circumstances , the monograph explains .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was growing impatient with the FBI because of repeated errors in applications for surveillance .
Justice Department officials were uncomfortable requesting intelligence surveillance of persons and facilities related to Osama bin Laden since there was already a criminal investigation against bin Laden underway , which normally would have preempted FISA surveillance .
Officials were reluctant to turn to the FISA Court of Review for clarification of their concerns since one of the judges on the court had expressed doubts about the constitutionality of FISA in the first place .
And so on .
Although not mentioned in the monograph , it probably did n’t help that public interest critics in the 1990s ( myself included ) were accusing the FISA Court of serving as a “ rubber stamp ” and indiscriminately approving requests for intelligence surveillance .
In the end , the monograph implicitly suggests that if the law was not the problem , then changing the law may not be the solution .
Ice House Detroit
Ice House Detroit is an architectural installation and social change project currently taking place in Detroit .
Photographer Gregory Holm and architect Matthew Radune will use one of 20,000 abandoned houses and freeze it in solid ice , referencing the contemporary urban conditions in the city and beyond .
[ Peter ] deserves an award for doing more with less .
He ’s built a handheld device based on an AVR controller that has features normally associated with much more powerful devices .
Here ’s what it does n’t do : no phone calls , no text messages , no accelerometer , and best of all no app approval needed .
What it does do is leverage inexpensive , readily available components combined with common homebrew development techniques to create a touch sensitive handheld .
The demo video embedded after the break details the device playing video , rendering 3D objects , and displaying pictures and ebooks with touch scrolling .
All of this is running at 60 fps for a smooth picture .
The whole thing is no larger than the 320 ×240 LCD that he salvaged from a broken MP3 player .
An Atmel AVR ATmega644 microcontroller ties together the display , a resistive touch screen , and a microSD card for storage .
The chip also controls the backlight , a Lithium Polymer battery , and uses USB for PC connectivity , charging , and even a mouse or keyboard interface .
He etched the PCB himself for surface mount components and managed to do it with just four jumpers needed on the underside .
This is a big leap forward from the last AVR based touch sensitive device we saw .
All of the functionality seen in the demo is run using 4 k of memory and 32 k of programming space .
Because [ Peter ’s ] powering this at 3.3 v the system clock is limited to 12MHz but he ’s managed to make it work .
We asked him to post code and schematics and he did n’t hold back .
Head over to the microtouch project page to download the code , Eagle CAD files , and PCB artwork .
All of the demo files are there just waiting for you to build on his hard work .
When you ’ve got something running , do n’t forget to share it with us !
From the ' I Told You So ' files :
Back in September , Google launched Chrome Frame which embeds a Chrome - type browser inside of a Microsoft Internet Explorer ( IE ) browser .
At the time , Microsoft claimed that Chrome Frame could make IE less secure .
Guess what ?
Turns out Microsoft was right .
Late Wednesday , Google issued an update to Chrome Frame with version 4.0.245.1 for a cross -origin bypass security vulnerability .
" An attacker could have bypassed cross - origin protections , " Google warned in its advisory .
" Although important , " High " severity issues do not permit persistent malware to infect a user 's machine .
We 're unaware of any exploitation of this issue . "
What 's also particularly interesting about this Chrome Frame vulnerability is that it was not discovered by Google itself .
It was discovered by Microsoft .
So to recap , Microsoft was worried months ago that Google Chrome Frame put IE at risk and now they 've proven it .

In the following method , I declare and init a local variable " final float x = a - b ; " .
Variables " a " and " b " always have values 0.9672 ( approx ) and 0.0014 ( approx ) .
Variable " x " is always inited to 0.9658 ( approx ) .
Usually , " x " behaves as it should .
Sometimes , however , " x " is found to have been spontaneously reset to 0.0 by the time we reach the end of the method .
I have 16 threads executing this method simultaneously .
The threads have no shared variables at all .
public void update ( ) { float a = ( float ) Math.exp ( - 1 f / 30f ) ; // always 0.9672 float b = ( 1 - a ) / 23 f ; // always 0.0014 float [ ] [ ] sheetSum = new float [ ni ] [ nj ] ; final float x = a - b ; // always 0.9658 for ( Sheet sheet : sheets ) sheet.multiplyAndAdd(x , sheetSum ) ; // XXX : x should still be 0.9658 , but is sometimes 0.0 ( yikes ! ) if ( x < 0.01 ) log ( " Local variable changed spontaneously : a = " + a + " , b = " + b + " , x = a - b = " + x ) ; } Looking at the values that wind up in the " sheets " array , it is apparent that " x " starts with value 0.9658 , but changes to 0.0 partway through the loop .
There 's no way a final local primitive should ever change value .
Ever .
Yikes .
Consistently reproducible on several machines running Ubuntu Jaunty , with Sun JVM 1.6.0_16 , and 1.7 - beta .
Bug does not occur on these machines with JRockit - 3.1.0 - 1.6.0 .
Bug does not occur with Sun JVM 1.6.0_16 on Windows .
THE PROBLEM WAS REPRODUCIBLE WITH - Xint FLAG : No THE PROBLEM WAS REPRODUCIBLE WITH - server FLAG : Yes STEPS TO FOLLOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM : 1 . Run the code below on Ubuntu Jaunty , 64 - bit , preferrably on a machine with dual Xeon 55xx CPUs 2 .
Let it run for ~ 30 minutes , and watch for my log message I know it 's annoying to wait 30 minutes to reproduce , but this is a serious bug .
EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR :
Expected : final local primitive should keep the value it was initialized with .
Actual : final local primitive is sometimes reset to 0.0 .
REPRODUCIBILITY :
This bug can be reproduced often .

For several years now , but particularly since the ascendancy of Jacob Zuma and his South African Communist Party ( SACP ) and Congress of South African Trade Union ( COSATU ) allies within both the African National Congress ( ANC ) and the state , ``the left ' ' in South Africa has come to be almost completely associated with ( and presented as ) the SACP , COSATU and , to a lesser extent , the ANC itself .
Even though this state of affairs ignores a wide range of organisations and people that can stake a serious claim to being part of ``the left ' ' , the fact is that contemporary politics in South Africa are dominated , in one way or another , by these three alliance partners .
As such , it is a good time to pose a critically important question :
What is ``left '' about ``the left '' in South Africa ?
Dictionary definitions of ``left '' such as " politically radical " , " liberal " or " communist " do not help us much because they do not provide any kind of underlying , common attribution .
This is why people and organisations which are light years apart on both the ideological and practical policy / struggle front can all be called ``left '' , ranging from President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party in the USA to Kim - Jong Il and the Workers Party of Korea , and in South Africa , from the ANC to the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front .
The result is that the term ``left '' has , over time , lost most of its real ideological and practical meaning .
The term itself only came to have any substantive meaning and location in the historical context of the various oppositional struggles borne out of , and parallel to , the rise and development of the capitalist system and its accompanying ideology .
As such , at its basic definitional minimum , the ``left '' must refer to any social / political force or individual that professes adherence to an anti-capitalist ideology and practically struggles against the capitalist system and for a non-capitalist alternative .
Beyond this , it is axiomatic that there are an array of tactical , organisational and more specifically defined intra-ideological differences amongst ``the left ' ' , whether in South Africa or anywhere else across the globe .
Stripped of this basic anti-capitalist contextual and practical foundation , the term ``left '' has mostly become a crudely convenient and vacuous political label or self - anointed attribute that obscures any critical understanding and analysis of the character and content of what is ``left ' ' .
Nowhere is this more apparent that in relation to an ANC that is so clearly not anti-capitalist .
It is why Jacob Zuma , in his response just last week to charges that the SACP and COSATU were ``taking over '' the ANC , can state without any fear of contradiction or embarrassment that , " the point that many people fail to grasp is that the ANC , by its own definition and by any objective standard , is in fact an organisation of the left .
It is a multi-class national liberation movement with a bias towards the working class and poor . "
If something is repeated often enough and without any critical response / appraisal , it usually becomes accepted ``truth '' and / or reality .
In this way can a whole range of ( weak ) social - democratic political parties wholly committed to upholding the capitalist system , amongst them the ANC and the British Labour Party , come together in the ``Socialist International '' to loudly and proudly proclaim their ``left '' credentials .
Seldom has there been a more oxymoronic gathering .
Combined with Zuma 's personal ideological schizophrenia , a ``condition '' which allows him to simultaneously be the ( perceived ) champion of the working class and the political guarantor of capitalist stability and accumulation , it is no wonder there is such ideological confusion and corresponding factional conflict within the ANC .
SACP and COSATU
Things are a bit trickier though when it comes to the SACP and COSATU .
While their constitutions , key programmatic documents and public statements are clearly infused with an anti-capitalist ideology , it is in the realm of their practical politics and related strategic orientation where serious questions have to be asked .
If we accept that a ``left ' ' organisation means being anti-capitalist in both form and content , then it must , by default , have a dominant , practical organisational strategy that is embedded within the lives and struggles of those who are not , in productive , material , ideological and social terms , capitalist .
This is clearly not the case with the SACP ( and to a lesser extent , COSATU ) , whose main strategic orientation for many years now has been to embed itself within a battle for power , access and influence amongst an elite ANC cadre and within an ANC that has no interest in getting rid of the capitalist system .
Of course the SACP argues , as it has done in a strategy document recently released by its central committee , that the ``left ' ' within the Alliance ( read : the SACP and COSATU ) has been largely responsible for " the political and organisational defeat of the leading cadre behind the ' 1996 class project ' " ( read : the capitalists ) .
Evidently , this is supposed to prove ( especially if repeated ad nauseum ) both the anti-capitalist credentials and organisational strategy of the SACP and COSATU .
The immediate question that arises though is , what was / is Zuma and many of the key SACP members and leaders within the ANC and state if not a ``leading cadre '' of that same ``class project '' over the last decade or so ?
Further , what about the SACP and COSATU ’s own active involvement in and cooperation with these declared class enemies and their selective silences when it comes to the practical policy consequences of the ``1996 class project ' ' , on the organised working class and majority poor ?
Capitalist government
Ironically , it is Zuma who has provided , indirectly , the most recent and telling confirmation of the ideological and thus organisational hypocrisy of the SACP and COSATU leaderships in their holier than thou ``left '' crusade .
Rejecting the SACP and COSATU 's claims that Planning Minister Trevor Manuel is personally responsible for the ANC and state 's ( capitalist ) economic policy , Zuma stated : " As soon as we start associating government policy with one individual , we risk forgetting that these policies are developed collectively and reflect an organisational position . "
What this so unmistakably exposes is that the Alliance ``left '' has , for far too long , had it both ways .
On the one hand , constantly shouting about a lack of consultation and publicly rejecting the state 's capitalist - friendly policies .
On the other hand , a convenient silence about the fact that their own leaders have always been a part of the leadership within the ANC and the state and thus the collective debates and decision - making processes .
In real , objective terms ( and by their own proud ideological and programmatic admission ) , the SACP and COSATU are part and parcel of an ANC which makes and implements the capitalist policies that they then turn around and attack and disown .
Given this kind of chameleon politics it is not surprising that ``the left '' alliance twins have never been very keen on defining what ``left '' means .
This is mainly because any change , however slight , in the institutional character and policy content of the ANC and / or state 's capitalism which could provide some additional succour to the poor / working class is interpreted and presented as a victory for ``the left ' ' .
To do otherwise would be to undermine the larger programmatic position that it is imperative for the SACP and COSATU to remain in alliance with the ANC as well as the entire theoretical construct of the ``national democratic revolution '' upon which the alliance rests .
Perhaps though , it is the nexus between the personal and the political that presents the most uncomfortable conundrum for this ``left ' ' .
Historically , those identified with ``the left '' have been expected to hold both their personal and political lives to a higher ethical standard .
Given ``the left 's '' professed adherence to an anti-capitalism that is supposed to be intrinsically non-accumulative as well as embracing of socioeconomic and human equality / justice , it is an entirely legitimate expectation .
Yet , when the workers and poor , most of whom are simply struggling to survive , witness the ANC ``left '' in cat fights over who gets the biggest share of public monies , see South Africa ’s top ``communist '' leader vigorously defending his lavish lifestyle choices and hear the top unionist rationalising his 100 % salary increase while his subordinates get 15 % , it is not hard to understand why there is such widespread scepticism about ``the left ' ' , its leadership and its politics among the very people whom that ``left '' claims to represent .
The ``left '' likes to talk about revolution .
While both South Africa and the world at large could do with a social and political revolution , it is ``the left ' ' itself that is in dire need of its own revolution .
Otherwise , there might not be much left of ``the left ' ' .

Excellent Bill Black interview via Tech Ticker .
Topic de jure –
The horrible job Mr. Geithner did negotiating CIT ’s bailout on behalf of the American taxpayer , essentially flushing $ 2.3 billion down the toilet .
Also see my interview with Mr. Black on financial reform .
In reply to a question on whether his outspoken views have limited his career prospects he said this :
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite recent calls for him to resign coming from both the right and the left , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is n't likely to lose his job .
The bigger question is how much the recent criticism limits his ability to do his job .
And that 's an important question .
Geithner will be in the lead in many issues about to break into the forefront for the Obama administration .
He 'll be at the center of the debate over what to do with $ 300 billion left in the Troubled Asset Relief Program , and whether TARP should be extended beyond Dec. 31 .
He 'll be involved in debates over what additional stimulus should be passed to try to help the still - battered job market .
He 's also the administration 's point man in efforts to reform the regulation of Wall Street and banking .
But Geithner heads into these battles under fire for continued job losses and an unemployment rate of 10.2 % , much worse than the administration forecast earlier this year when it was rounding up votes for the stimulus package .
He also received criticism in a recent report on the bailout of AIG , which he oversaw during his time as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in late 2008 .
The report by Neil Barofsky , special inspector general overseeing TARP , reported that the Fed overpaid Wall Street firms for contracts they had with the troubled insurer .
And there was the embarrassment that a report on jobs created by the stimulus bill showed some being in Congressional districts that do n't actually exist .
While those two reports caused anger in Congress , the real problem for Geithner is the continued job losses , said Jaret Seiberg , an analyst for Concept Capital Washington Research Group .
" You always need someone to blame , and Geithner is a big juicy target right now , " he said .
" When you have 10.2 % unemployment and an economy struggling to get into recovery , it does n't matter who is in that job , they 're always going to be under attack and in a position of weakness . "
Still , the attacks on Geithner on Capitol Hill have been unusually public and bipartistisan .
Rep. Kevin Brady , R - Texas , used a recent hearing of the Joint Economic Committee to confront Geithner directly , telling him , " The public has lost all confidence in your ability to do the job , and it is reflecting on your President .
Conservatives agree , liberal Democrats agree , it really is time for a fresh start . "
That attack followed one by liberal Rep. Peter DeFazio , D - Ore. , who said in a recent cable news interview that both Geithner and White House economic advisor Larry Summers were too close to Wall Street to be trusted with turning around the economy .
He said when those names are mentioned inside the Democratic caucus , " there are boos and cries of derision .
I think there 's a growing consensus in the caucus , we need a new economic team that cares more about jobs , Main Street and the American people than it does about Wall Street and huge bonuses . "
The Treasury did not respond to a request for comment on the attacks on Geithner .
But Geithner himself responded to Brady at the JEC hearing , arguing that the stimulus program and other administration efforts have trimmed the huge job losses that were taking place when Obama took office and that the bailout of insurer AIG and other Wall Street rescues were necessary to halt a broader collapse in the economy .
" If you look at any measure of consumer or investor confidence today , if you look at any measure of the strength and stability of the American economy , if you look at any measure of confidence in the financial system , it is substantially stronger today than when the President took office , " he said .
Battles ahead
Still , some Washington observers believe that level of public criticism for the Treasury Secretary will leave the Obama administration at a disadvantage in the legislative battles that lay ahead involving Treasury .
At least some expect a change will be made sooner rather than later .
" I do n't think it 's only coming from a narrow base on the far right and far left .
Otherwise it would never have been done publicly , " said Richard Bove , banking analyst with Rochdale Securities .
Bove said that beyond any problems Geithner has on Capitol Hill , the Obama administration also has to worry about his credibility with foreign governments and in global financial markets .
The steady decline in the value of the dollar is at least partly a result of that lack of credibility , Bove said .
He predicts a change sometime in the next few months .
" If Obama feels Geithner can't sell the program , if he does n't have credibility in either Congress or internationally , the President has to replace him , " he said .
But most experts disagree with Bove , saying they doubt that Geithner is in trouble within the administration , and that a change anytime before the midterm elections next November is unlikely .
" I do n't sense it 's even remotely reached a crisis point for him , " said Greg Valliere , a political economist with Soleil Securities .
He said the calls for Geithner to resign have been limited to " a handful of loudmouths " on the political fringe .
Brian Gardner , chief political analyst for Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , an investment bank that specializes in financial firms , agrees that Geithner is n't in any imminent danger of being forced out of his job .
Despite some like Bove who have suggested that the administration turn to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to be Treasury Secretary , Gardner said any replacement who would have the necessary credibility with financial markets would spark just as much backlash for ties to Wall Street .
" Despite Geithner having a couple of not - great days , it 's not like anyone can step in and fill that void , " he said .
But given the problems in the economy and popular anger at bailing out Wall Street , Gardner and Seiberg both wonder how effective Geithner can be in the coming legislative battles .
" We 're in a very populist era that is more pronounced today than we have seen throughout most of our lifetimes , " Gardner said .
" Anything seen as helping elites or Wall Street is not going to be unpopular .
No matter who the Treasury Secretary is , with Democrats in Congress getting nervous , the administration itself is not in a strong position . "
The most recent episode of Software Engineering Radio is Software Archeology with Dave Thomas .
In his interview , Dave Thomas gives many practical tips for how to read code , especially when inheriting a project .
This interview should be required listening for computer science students .
They spend the majority of their time writing code while they ’re in school and yet they will spend the majority of their time reading code once they get out — reading code in order to debug or extend it , and if they ’re smart , reading code to learn from it .
Dave Thomas attributes one of his most unusual suggestions to Ward Cunningham .
Thomas says Cunningham recommends pasting code into Microsoft Word and viewing it in a 2 point font .
At this font size you cannot possibly read the code , but you can tell a great deal about the structure of the code .
For example , you may spot duplicate code by recognizing a recurring shape .
I tested Ward Cunningham ’s idea on a couple source files .
Example 1 :
Example 2 :
Example 1 has short functions .
Near the bottom of the clip something is very repetitive .
Skimming through the entire file you see several of these repetitive blocks .
( This is test code .
The blocks are computed values and expected values for comparison . )
Example 2 looks quite different from Example 1 .
The image comes from one long function .
( This was taken from FORTRAN code that had been programmatically translated in to C ++.
The frequent short dashes on the left are labels for goto statements . )

Just when our biggest banks thought they were out of the woods and into the money , the official consensus in their favor begins to crack .
The Obama administration ’s publicly stated view – from the highest level in the White House – remains that the banks cannot or should not be broken up .
Their argument is that the big banks can be regulated into permanently low risk behavior .
In contrast , in an interview reported in the NYT this morning , Paul Volcker argues that attempts to regulate these banks will fail :
“ The only viable solution , in the Volcker view , is to break up the giants .
JPMorgan Chase would have to give up the trading operations acquired from Bear Stearns .
Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would go back to being separate companies .
Goldman Sachs could no longer be a bank holding company . ”
Volcker may not have the ear of the President ( as the NYT points out ) , and Alan Greenspan – also arguing for bank breakup , but along different lines – might also be ignored .
But watch Mervyn King closely .
Mervyn King is governor of the Bank of England and a hugely influential figure in central banking circles .
Time and again he has proved to be not only ahead of his peers in terms of thinking about the latest problems , but also the person who is best able to frame an issue and articulate potential solutions so as to draw support from other officials around the world .
Mervyn King also does not mince words .
In a major speech last night , he said , “ Never in the field of financial endeavour has so much money been owed by so few to so many .
And , one might add , so far with little real reform . ” ( full speech )
He hits hard ( implicitly ) at the White House ’s central idea on large banks :
” The belief that appropriate regulation can ensure that speculative activities do not result in failures is a delusion ” .
And he lines up very much with Paul Volcker ’s views – breaking up big banks is necessary , doable , and actually essential .
Remember and repeat this Mervyn King line : “ Anyone who proposed giving government guarantees to retail depositors and other creditors , and then suggested that such funding could be used to finance highly risky and speculative activities , would be thought rather unworldly .
But that is where we now are . ”
The big banks will push back , of course .
But Mervyn
King ’s words mark the beginning of a new stage of real reform ; the consensus starts to crack .

" LONDON - The secretary general of NATO said Thursday that alliance forces should begin handing responsibility to Afghan forces in a coordinated way next year in areas where conditions permit .
Anders Fogh Rasmussen issued a statement after talks in London with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
The talks come as President Barack Obama weighs a decision on sending more troops to Afghanistan — though alliance nations have been reluctant to commit more troops .
The NATO chief and Brown agree that transition to Afghan leadership is the way forward .

The corporate war in Vietnam was going very badly despite intense bombing campaigns and billions thrown at it .
Morale had plummeted and the military was coming apart .
The ' 72 election was coming up and Nixon decided to rebrand america 's failing efforts to prolong the invasion , calling it Vietnamization .
Sound a little familiar ?
The empire will never leave Afghanistan until it 's defeated and thrown out just like it 'll never leave Iraq until it 's beaten and tossed out on it's ear .
These neo colonial occupations are for purposes unstated , never for the bullshit reasons they pawn off on the unwashed .
Let 's just say those giant installations that were built are n't going to be abandoned any time soon .
Methods vary from colony to colony but the template stays the same .
Empire finds reasons to invade that will be palatable for the mouthbreathers back home who foot the bills , then goes about the task of destroying all home grown opposition to the occupation , usually in a brutal manner .
Next up is to find compliant stooges who are installed as an obedient Vichy government .
If all goes according to plan , a substantially funded security apparatus gets installed , usually terrorizing the population with gusto to keep the peasants in line and the occupation 's objectives fulfilled .
After eight years that seems to be the point our overlords are at now in Piplinestan and in the psychos ' dreams they can put their feet up in their lavish bases and let their traitorous wogs do the dirty .

A Maltese - flagged freighter that mysteriously disappeared in the Atlantic over the summer has returned to Malta , officials say .
The Arctic Sea was towed into harbour in the Maltese capital , Valletta , after maritime officials inspected the vessel and declared it radiation - free .
The ship disappeared on its way from Finland to Algeria , and was eventually found off the Cape Verde islands .
It was at the centre of bizarre claims about hijacking and weapons smuggling .
The Maltese - flagged , Russian - crewed ship was purportedly attacked by pirates in Swedish waters in July .
A Russian warship located it off West Africa in August and arrested eight alleged hijackers .
The boldness of the hijacking and the elaborate effort to recapture it prompted speculation that the ship was carrying missiles for Iran or Syria , but Russian officials dismissed the claims .
Both Russian and Maltese authorities said the ship was recovered with its officially - listed cargo of timber still on board .

Betaine hydrochloride is an organic compound and vitamin - like substance found in many different foods such as sugar beets , grains , and spinach .
It is recommended by naturopaths and medical doctors as a supplemental source of hydrochloric acid in the stomach .
Studies [ 1 ] show that this compound can profoundly benefit individuals suffering from digestive upsets or a deficiency of stomach acid production .
Normally , a healthy stomach can produce enough gastric acid to kill harmful organisms .
But , when people experience deficiencies in producing stomach acid , they are more likely to have bacterial and intestinal infections and the increased presence of harmful organisms .
[ 2 ]
Betaine HCl helps the stomach break down fat and protein in the food .
It also assists the body 's detoxification processes .
It helps the body digest food and assimilate nutrients like protein , vitamin B12 , calcium , and iron .
The Action of Betaine Hydrochloride
The chemical betaine is absorbed in the digestive tract into what are known as enterocytes .
Enterocytes circulate through the liver , where the betaine is extracted and metabolized .
From there , betaine hydrochloride is converted into betaine inside the alkaline environment of the small intestine , helping to create a favorable environment for digestion .
The Health Benefits of Betaine HCl
Betaine hydrochloride is a powerful digestive aid .
It 's especially helpful for people who may have been privy to a poor diet , prolonged dehydration , and generalized stress .
It has been shown to offer digestive support to perimenopausal women and elderly individuals .
Betaine HCl is beneficial for addressing hypochlorhydria , a deficiency of stomach acid production .
It is also a crucial compound in balancing homocysteine levels , a condition related to poor cardiovascular health .
As we age , the body naturally produces fewer digestive enzymes .
Due to reduced enzymatic activity , Betaine HCl levels decrease .
Depending on the individual , this can lead to sluggish digestion and poor nutrient absorption .
It also means that the body is not detoxifying itself as well as it should .
Things that the body would normally expel remain lodged in the system .
This leads to toxic overload and systemic tissue irritation .
Many people facing poor digestion have found that taking plant - derived betaine HCl before a meal supports digestion .
Other Conditions Betaine HCl May Help
Acne
Skin disorders
Diarrhea
Gallstones
Stomach ulcer
Chronic hives
Food sensitivities
Thyroid function
Inner ear infections
Iron -deficiency anemia
Candida & yeast infections
Stomach or esophageal disorders General malabsorption of nutrients
General indigestion and heartburn
Acetaminophen - induced liver toxicity
Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD )
Arteriosclerosis ( hardening / loss of elasticity in the arteries )
How to Get More Betaine HCl
A high - quality betaine hydrochloride supplement can support digestion , and aid in the absorption of many essential vitamins and nutrients .
If you are considering taking a Betaine HCl supplement , it should not contain fillers or additives of any kind .

BRASÍLIA  Brazil ’s ambitions to be a more important player on the global diplomatic stage are crashing headlong into the efforts of the United States and other Western powers to rein in Iran ’s nuclear arms program .
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , Brazil ’s president , is set to receive Iran ’s president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , here on Monday in his first state visit to Brazil .
The visit is part of a larger push by Mr. da Silva to wade into the seemingly intractable world of Middle East politics , and follows visits in the last two weeks by Israel ’s president , Shimon Peres , and Mahmoud Abbas , president of the Palestinian Authority .
But the visit is drawing criticism from lawmakers and former diplomats here and in the United States , who say it could undercut Western efforts to press Iran on its nuclear program , and consequently chill Brazil ’s relations with the United States and damage its growing reputation as a global power .
Brazilian officials say the goal of the visit is to strengthen commercial ties between the two countries and help bring peace to the Middle East .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor ( top right ) joins the Supreme Court for the new session
Cases involving US gun laws , videos depicting dog-fighting and the presence of a cross in the Mojave desert are among those expected to dominate a fresh session of the US Supreme Court which opens on Monday .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor is a new addition to the nine - member panel , replacing liberal Justice David Souter , who retired .
The court is expected to hand down rulings on the cases it considers in the spring .
Among the cases to watch out for are : CHALLENGE TO GUN CONTROL LAWS
The Supreme Court justices have agreed to consider a challenge by gun rights activists to the city of Chicago 's ban on handgun ownership .
The case is important because it will re-open the debate over the rights to bear arms under the Second Amendment of the US Constitution .
Last year , the court ruled by 5 - 4 that a ban on handguns in the capital , Washington DC , was unconstitutional - the first time it had considered the issue for almost 70 years - and that Americans have the right to own arms for personal use .
Since then , DC and other cities with strict gun control provisions , such as Chicago , have argued that it is not clear whether that ruling extends to state laws and city regulations too .
If the justices decide that Chicago 's ban on handguns is also unconstitutional , the ruling could open the way for other challenges to state and local controls on who can own guns , whether they must be registered and how they are stored .
PRESENCE OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOL ON FEDERAL LAND
The Supreme Court will consider the case of an 8ft ( 2.5 m ) high Christian cross in the Mojave National Preserve , in California , which was put up as a monument to fallen World War I soldiers 70 years ago .
In 2003 , a federal court ruled that because the cross stood on public ground , its presence violated a constitutional ban on the government endorsing one religion over another .
Congress tried to end the dispute by transferring the land to private ownership .
But an appeals court ruled that the congressional action did not end the case .
The Supreme Court will look at whether the transfer of the land resolved the issue of the separation of church and state .
It will also rule on whether the original plaintiff , a retired park service worker from Oregon , is entitled to bring the case .
The US Park Service has been forced to cover up the cross while the First Amendment legal arguments continue .
FREE SPEECH CHALLENGE OVER DOG-FIGHTING VIDEO
The court will consider whether the conviction of Robert Stevens for distributing videos depicting dog- fighting under a law aimed at curtailing animal cruelty violated his constitutional right to freedom of speech .
The 1999 law was intended to prevent depictions of animal cruelty , but a federal appeals court found that it restricted Stevens ' right to free speech and threw out the conviction .
He argued that the videos were intended to educate people about the pit bull breed and that he was not trying to promote illegal dog-fighting .
The case has prompted debate over the restrictions that the government can place on free speech without falling foul of the First Amendment .
CAMPAIGN FINANCE
The nine - justice panel has already held a pre-term session to look at a case involving a 2008 documentary film , Hillary : the Movie , produced by the conservative group Citizens United .
The Federal Election Commission banned the film 's release , saying it was an " electioneering communication " and that because it had been made with corporate funds , it was subject to restrictions under the 2002 McCain - Feingold campaign finance law .
The court may use the case to look at the wider issue of campaign finance and corporate spending .
Oral arguments in the case were first heard in March this year and the justices may seek an early decision so the rules are clear ahead of the 2010 mid-term elections .
CHALLENGE TO LIFE SENTENCES FOR JUVENILES
The justices will hear arguments as to whether it is legal to sentence a minor to life imprisonment without parole for crimes .
The challenge revolves around the Eighth Amendment 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
It involves the separate cases of two minors in Florida , one aged 17 and one 13 , who were each convicted of violent crimes and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole .
The state of Florida rejected their appeals against the sentences .
The case follows a Supreme Court ruling in 2005 that defendants aged under 18 at the time they committed their crimes could not be sentenced to death .
CHALLENGE TO LAW MAKING IT A CRIME TO AID TERROR GROUPS
The court will examine whether a federal law that bans the provision of " material support to terrorism " is unconstitutional .
The law , which makes it a crime to give financial or other aid to any foreign group designated a terror organisation by the US , has been a central weapon in US anti-terror efforts .
The justice department has used it to prosecute more than 100 individuals , resulting in dozens of convictions , and it provides for sentences of up to life imprisonment .
First passed in 1996 , the law was strengthened by the Patriot Act that was approved by Congress following the terror attacks of September 2001 .
The groups and individuals who have challenged the law argue it that is unconstitutionally vague and bars support , including the provision of humanitarian aid , to legal , non-violent activities of designated organisations .
DISPUTE OVER HUMAN RIGHTS CASE AGAINST EX - SOMALIAN PM
The Supreme Court will consider whether a human rights case against former Somali Prime Minister Mohamed Ali Samantar should be allowed to proceed .
The lawsuit alleges that Mr Samantar , who now lives in the US state of Virginia , was responsible for killings , rape and torture while defence minister and prime minister under the authoritarian regime of Siad Barre in the 1980s and early 1990s .
A district court threw out the case in 2007 , ruling that Mr Samantar was immune from prosecution under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act .
But an appeals court disagreed , ruling that the law did not extend to individuals , only to countries and their agencies .
The justices will have to decide whether an individual acting in an official capacity for a foreign state is immune from prosecution .

Overpopulation
What does it mean to you ?
Why is it not considered an issue by those who claim we are suffering from global warming and other global issues threatening man and the natural environment ?
Why is it taboo to consider human population as a reason for or solution to our problems ?
Human population is a taboo subject .
Those with the loudest voices in this world deny this issue attention .
It 's a crime .
As the natural world around us dies off from our overabundant existence , strangely we are silent .
A Simple Lisp Parser in Python
A managed to sneak in a little time recently and write a simple Lisp s-expression parser in Python .
I started out with a version that just understands parentheses , atoms , and strings , but it was just a couple of extra lines to add in support for the quote “ operator ” , that I went ahead and threw that in there , too .
I ’ll go ahead and go through it bit - by - bit here , though I think it ’s pretty straightforward .
from string import whitespace atom_end = set ( ' ( ) " \'' ) | set ( whitespace )
When any of these things are encountered while reading an atom , the atom should be ended .
This means no need for whitespace betwen an atom and opening or closing parentheses or quotes .
def parse ( sexp ) : stack , i , length = [ [ ] ] , 0 , len ( sexp ) while i < length :
Rather than write this recursively , I am using a list as a stack and a simple while - loop to go through the contents of the string .
I start with an empty list on the stack , which will hold the entire parsed sexp when the parsing is done .
c = sexp [ i ] reading = type ( stack [ - 1 ] )
Each character is put into c and the type of the current item being read is checked .
Rather than using some variable to keep track of the current state of the parser , I just used a distinct Python type for each of the possible lisp types to be read : a list for a list , a string for a string , and a string inside a tuple for an atom .
Using this system , I just have to check what type the top element in the stack is , and I ’ll know what I ’m currently reading .
if reading == list : if c == '( ' : stack.append ([ ] ) elif c == ' ) ' : stack [ - 2].append(stack.pop ( ) ) if stack [ - 1 ] [ 0 ] == ( ' quote ' , ) : stack [ - 2].append(stack.pop ( ) ) elif c == ' " ' : stack .append ('') elif c == " ' " : stack.append ([ ( ' quote ' , ) ] ) elif c in whitespace : pass else : stack.append (( c , ) )
When reading a list :
If an opening parenthesis is encountered , add a new list to the stack
If a closing parenthesis is encountered , take the list from the top of the stack and append it to the next list down in the stack .
Check if the last thing read was a quote , and if so , add this list as the parameter to the quote call .
If an opening double - quote is encountered , add an empty string to the stack .
If a single - quote is found , add a list with a quote symbol at the beginning of it .
If c is whitespace , ignore it .
Otherwise , start an atom with whatever other character was found .
elif reading == str : if c == ' " ' : stack [ - 2].append(stack.pop ( ) ) if stack [ - 1 ] [ 0 ] == ( ' quote ' , ) : stack [ - 2].append(stack.pop ( ) ) elif c == ' \\ ' : i += 1 stack [ - 1 ] += sexp [ i ] else : stack [ - 1 ] += c
When reading a string :
If a closing double - quote is found , end the string , and check for a previous quote call like above ( it does n’t really make sense to quote a string , but this is n’t really the place to check for that , is it ? )
If a backslash is found , put whatever the following character is in the string .
This is a simplistic way to at least allow double - quotes to be escaped , but I do n’t have anything allowing for more complex escape - strings in here yet .
Anything else , add to the string .
elif reading == tuple : if c in atom_end : atom = stack .
pop ( ) if atom [ 0 ] [ 0].isdigit( ) : stack [ - 1]. append ( eval ( atom [ 0 ] ) ) else : stack [ - 1]. append ( atom ) if stack [ - 1 ] [ 0 ] == ( ' quote ' , ) : stack [ - 2].append(stack.pop ( ) ) continue else : stack [ - 1 ] = ( ( stack [ - 1 ] [ 0 ] + c ) , )
When reading an atom :
If the end of the atom has been reached , check if the atom is a number ( this code just assumes that if the first character of the atom is numeric , that it ’s a number ) .
If it is , I cheat and use eval to get its value , if it ’s not , I leave the atom as a tuple - wrapped string .
Anything else , add as a character to the atom .
i += 1 return stack.pop ( )
At the end here , I just take whatever ’s on top of the stack ( which should be the only thing on the stack if a proper s- expression was passed in ) , and return that .
I ’m going to continue working on and improving this parser , for use in another project of mine , so I will be adding more functionality .
I was thinking of doing a s-expression to Python bytecode compiler , but someone already wrote one , and they even took the name I was going to use : sexpy .
I think the first thing I ’ll be adding is the capability for the parser to yield sub -sexps so the entire thing does n’t need to be parsed in one go before returning anything .
Another thing I ’ll most likely add is some checking for invalid sexps , something I left out for clarity in my initial version .
For those who are interested , here ’s the complete version of sexp.py
Our primary intention was to create the best ecologically sustainable design .

When Jesus spoke the Truth to his accusers , he would justify himself by quoting Law .
First , he would quote God 's Law , and after quoting God's Law He would often quote the accuser 's law and use that against them as well .
For example , Jesus would say , " Did ye never read in the scriptures ... " and then quote God 's Law .
Then he would turn around and say , " Is it not written in your law ... " and quote their own law !
His accusers would have no answer , they could not overcome Him .
How could anyone overcome somebody who is obeying both God 's Law and man 's law !?
If a man made law is just , it will be in harmony with God 's Law .
This is the purpose of this article .
These maxims are the foundation and principles of the laws that man passes today .
Unfortunately , men enforce their own will more than they enforce law .
So , this is why , in addition to knowing God 's Law , it is also important to know man 's law , because man 's law is based upon God 's Law .
And when you are accused of " breaking the law , " you can do what Jesus did , and use both God 's Law and man 's law to justify your lawful acts , for this is the only thing that will excuse you .
It is important to distinguish between commercial law and maxims of law , when quoting from their law .
We should never , ever quote their codes , rules , regulations , ordinances , statutes , common law , merchant law , public policies , constitutions , etc. , because these are commercial in nature , and if we use their commercial law , they can presume we are engaged in commerce ( which means we are of the world ) , which will nullify our witness ( because we are not of the world ) .
Maxims of law are not commercial law , but are mostly based upon scripture and truth .
Here is a court case which demonstrates a typical example of the fruitlessness of describing oneself in the terms of the world , as distinguished from who and what our Heavenly Father has already told us we are .
It was rendered by JOHN V. PARKER , Chief Judge :
" Petitioner 's shield of the " Common Law " as an " Unenfranchised Sovereign Individual of the United States of America , a Republic , " provides him with the same degreee of protection from federal income taxation as did the Ghost Dance of the Sioux warrior from the repeating rifles of the federal Calvary - ZERO . "

Many insist on using the " common law " to defend themselves .
The reason we should not is because , first and foremost , you do not see the term " common law " in scripture .
Bondservants of Christ are only to use God 's Law .
Secondly , the common law is a commerical law today , created by merchants , influenced by Roman Law , and used for commercial purposes .
The following definitions are taken from " A Dictionary of Law , by William C. Anderson , 1893 . "
Custom of merchants : A system of customs , originating among merchants , and allowed for the benefit of trade as part of the common law .
Page 303 .
Law - merchant ; law of merchants :
The rules applicable to commercial paper were transplanted into the common law from the law merchant .
They had their origin in the customs and course of business of merchants and bankers , and are now recognized by the courts because they are demanded by the wants and conveniences of the mercantile world .

Roman Law :
The common law of England has been largely influenced by the Roman law , in several respects : … Through the development of commercial law .

All of man 's laws , except for many maxims of law , are commercial in nature .
The following are the definitions of " maxims , " and then the relevant maxims of law will be listed .
Clementines refresh the palate … and the loins .
I ’ve always wanted to try the Nigella clementine cake , the flourless one with the whole boiled and pureed clementines .
Nigella is sometimes too precious for me ; she uses phrases like “ give a blitz ” and “ ferrous tang ” while I ’m more likely to give instructions like “ fry that shit up in a pan , ” or “ fuck you . ”
Still , there ’s no denying the comforting yumminess of many of her recipes ( she also looks like she would give a good hug , if you were the huggy type ) , or the fact that clementines are all over the place right now , or the fact that I really like some frigging cake and I ’ve been kinda cranky this week .
So : clementine cake .
* You ’ll * be lost and gone forever , clementines … IN MY BELLY !
Clementines do n’t just flavor this cake , they are the cake .
Namely , 1 1/3 pounds of clementines , which you boil the shit out of for TWO HOURS .
1 1/3 pounds is usually around 5 or 6 fruits unless you have the mutant runts that I bought , in which case it ’s more like 11 or 12 .
Depending on how thick the clementines ’ skins are , some or all of them may self destruct during their forced bath .
I chalk it up to citric Darwinism , you gotta weed out the clunkers if you want good cake .
But do n’t worry , the weaklings still have a higher purpose .
The 4 stages of “ blitz ” : Whiz , Szuszh , Pulp , and Jonestown Massacre
Once the citrus ’ spirit is thoroughly broken , it ’s time to whir .
First , the almonds , which replace flour in this cake .
Second , the fruits , broken down into a chunky , pulpy mass .
Finally , the nuts and fruit together with sugar , eggs and some baking powder , pureed until smooth .
At this point , the batter completely obscured the processor ’s blade .
It was a fairly smooth mix flecked with bits of toothsome almond , and with a gorgeous fragrance .
Into the oven for an hour it went .
Technical term for the photo above : “ Boiling the fuck outta that shit . ”
Be sure to use the contraction “ outta ” instead of the common but incorrect “ out of . ”
I ’d boiled a few more clementines than I really needed for the cake so in addition to the pot of citrus - flavored water left over from the boil , which it seemed a shame to waste , I had some mangled clementine corpses .
I crushed them with my fingers , returned them to the pot with some sugar , and turned the heat back down to dissolve the sugar and reduce the mixture to a syrup .
Nobody puts Baby in a corner .
After about 10 minutes I cut the heat and strained out the clementine guts .
I ’d considered letting the whole thing steep for a while before straining , but judging from the strength of flavor in the syrup I ended up with , that would have been clementine overkill .
So from your de-selected , mauled fruits , you ’ll have a sweet and fragrant syrup to do with what you will .
It would be great to soak a sponge cake or add some punch to a fruit salad .
As I can personally attest , it ’s also great when mixed with some good tequila and lime juice and topped off with a splash of club soda .
Because the only thing better than cake ?
Is cake and cocktails .
Whipped Cream = Not Optional
The cake took about an hour and 5 minutes , with a foil tent for the last half - hour to keep the top from getting too brown ; I then did as instructed and let it cool ( mostly ) in the “ tin ” ( in American English : “ motherfucking pan ” ) .
When I deemed it ready to eat – I think my American understanding of “ cooled ” is a bit different than Nigella ’s – I whipped up some cream with a bit of sugar and “ tucked in ” ( “ sucked that shit down ” ) .
This is a yummy cake for those times when you want some cake ( e.g. , all the time ) but do n’t want the full - on sugar fest .
The nuts give it some texture that cake – even cake made with almond flour – does n’t usually have .
Almond and clementine get along very well , and the cake actually gets better and better the longer you let it sit and / or the more tequila you ’re drinking .
( I assume there ’s a point of diminishing returns , but I have n’t hit it yet . )
It ’s great as an afternoon treat with a cup of tea , or even as a simple breakfast .
Cheerie - fucking -o.
Clementine Cake
adapted from nigella.com
1 1/3 pounds clementines (+ 2 fruits if you plan to make the syrup )
3 c. almonds
1 1/3 c. sugar
7 eggs
2 tsp. baking powder
Put the clementines into a pot of cold water .
Bring it to a boil and cook for 2 hours .
Remove the fruit and set aside to cool .
If you plan to make the syrup , leave the cooking liquid in the pot ; if not , get rid of it .
Preheat your oven to 375 .
While the fruit is cooling , grind the almonds in a food processor .
Keep an eye on them – you want them pretty finely ground , but need to stop short before you end up with almond butter .
Set the ground almond aside .
Cut the cooled fruit in half and pick out the seeds .
Put the food in the processor , peel and pith and all .
Pulse a few times ; the fruit will immediately break down into a choppy puree .
Add the ground almond back to the processor along with all the remaining ingredients .
Blend into a smooth puree .
Pour the batter into a 9 - inch springform pan that ’s been buttered , lined with parchment , and buttered again .
Bake for about 1 hour , until a toothpick stuck into the middle comes out clean .
If your cake starts getting too brown , cover it with foil for the last 20 - 30 minutes of baking .
Cool the cake fully in the pan before chowing down .
Tastes good with some sweetened whipped cream or creme fraiche , especially the next day .
Clementine Syrup
Leftover clementine boiling water
2 - 3 cooked clementines
1 1/2 sugar
Return the cooking water to a boil ; add the sugar and cooked , crushed clementines .
Boil until reduced to your desired level of sweetness .
Strain out solids .
For a tasty cocktail , mix 2 parts tequila , 1 part syrup , and a squirt of lime in a shaker with ice .
Shake , strain and top off with a splash of club soda .
Yum .
What ’s this ?
Another Illegal Argument episode already ?
And so close to the last one - it seems the shift to working from home and remote recording has already showed a payoff .
During the last episode , I ’d had it in my mind to discuss the need to improve our documentation , and general communication skills that ...
The Iraq inquiry will start hearing evidence in open session on Tuesday , and it will almost certainly lead to fireworks .
Let us hope the media cover it properly ; five months ago , there was a sharp debate on Iraq in the Commons which the media ignored .
" Anyone with information " has been invited to get in touch , which includes serving officials and military .
Some officials resigned because they disagreed with the war , but most stayed on .
But there is plenty of evidence , including leaked documents , to show there was strong opposition to the war , and for good reasons .
As a retired diplomat myself , I hope my former colleagues will not be shy .
The situation in Iraq is still horrible .
More than 400 people died in violent incidents last month ; more than 1,400 were wounded .
Millions of Iraqis are still displaced , inside Iraq or in Syria , Jordan or elsewhere , with little prospect of their returning home .
Water and electricity are limping along , the vital oil industry will take years to rebuild .
British troops sent to train the Iraqi security forces were in Kuwait through the summer marking time , while the Iraqi government quibbled about their legal status .

We 've had umpteen Iraq inquiries already , but this one should be different .
Its terms of reference are open .
Previous inquiries concentrated on the non-existent weapons of mass destruction , the misuse of intelligence to make the case for war , the " dodgy dossier " and so on .
But there are plenty of other questions , starting with the big one : was this a war of aggression and therefore a war crime ?
There were two views about its legality , and the then attorney general seems to have held both of them .
What about the alleged links between Saddam Hussein and al - Qa'ida ?
– it seems there were no such links .
What happened to the civil planning for after the fighting ?
– according to Clare Short , who was a member of the Cabinet , there " were preparations that were then all junked , because of the hubris and deceit that went into preparing for war " .
Were the arguments for and against war ever assessed by the FCO , and was formal advice submitted to the then secretary of state , the Cabinet and the prime minister ?
Here is Clare Short again : " All the Cabinet meetings were little chats : they were never a proper consideration of all the options . "
Is it true that the Iraq experts invited to No 10 in November 2002 ( two of whom also took part in the seminar organised by the inquiry on 5 November ) decided not to tell Tony Blair whether they thought an invasion was wise or not because they thought he would n't listen ?
We have heard a lot recently about the freedom of experts to give advice which is unpalatable to the Government , so why the self - censorship ?
We need to know more about the exchanges between George Bush and Tony Blair .
According to Colin Powell , the then US secretary of state , he and Jack Straw sometimes tried to get Blair to hold Bush back .
" Jack and I would get him all pumped up about an issue .
And he'd be ready to say , ' Look here , George ' .
But as soon as he saw the president he would lose all his steam . "
Can this be true ?
When Bush tried to persuade President Chirac to go to war , Bush compared Saddam Hussein with Gog and Magog , obscure legendary figures named in the book of Ezekiel as enemies of the people of Israel .
This sounds like a joke , but seems to be true .
Chirac was baffled and his staff consulted a professor of theology who spilt the beans .
Blair told his Iraq experts that Saddam was " uniquely evil " ; the inquiry should ask him whether Bush mentioned Gog and Magog to him , or he to Bush .
The Prime Minister 's choice of the members of the committee has been criticised .
None is a military man , Sir John Chilcot was a member of the Hutton inquiry and has been closely involved with the security services , Baroness Prashar has no relevant experience , Sir Roderic Lyne was a serving ambassador at the time of the war , and so on .
Rather less attention has been paid to the curious appointment of two historians ( which seems a lot , out of a total of five ) , both strong supporters of Tony Blair and / or the Iraq war .
In December 2004 Sir Martin Gilbert , while pointing out that the " war on terror " was not a third world war , wrote that Bush and Blair " may well , with the passage of time and the opening of the archives , join the ranks of Roosevelt and Churchill " – an eccentric opinion that would se em to rule him out as a member of the committee .
Sir Lawrence Freedman is the reputed architect of the " Blair doctrine " of humanitarian intervention , which was invoked in Kosovo and Afghanistan as well as Iraq .
Both Gilbert and Freedman are Jewish , and Gilbert at least has a record of active support for Zionism .
Such facts are not usually mentioned in the mainstream British and American media , but The Jewish Chronicle and the Israeli media have no such inhibitions , and the Arabic media both in London and in the region are usually not far behind .
All five members have outstanding reputations and records , but it is a pity that , if and when the inquiry is accused of a whitewash , such handy ammunition will be available .
Membership should not only be balanced ; it should be seen to be balanced .
Tony Blair 's responsibility for the Iraq war was a strike against him as a candidate for the role of president of the European Council .
Perhaps the launch of the inquiry helped to kill the idea off .
No European democratic institution has entertained the idea of electing someone under the shadow of a war crime charge since Kurt Waldheim became President of Austria in 1986 .

So you need a new garage or utility outbuilding ?
In your city or jurisdiction , you may be required to obtain a building permit and submit your building plan for approval , but after that , the first step must be to build a solid foundation for the new building .
It 's time to think about footings .
What do footings do ?
Well - built footings carry the weight of the structure and provide stability for the building walls .
Properly built footings will ensure the structural integrity of your new building .
Many garages are built as slab - to - grade on standardized footings , perhaps 24 " wide , 6 or 8 " thick , and are usually reinforced with two rows of steel reinforcing bar ( steel “ rebar ” ) for strength .
The building can then be built directly upon the footing , and a concrete floor is poured inside the building after it is constructed to the completed roofing stage .
If no concrete floor is desired , the floor area may also be filled to the required grade with gravel and packed .
If your project involves a finished slab - to - grade , ( a slab built on grade or close to ground level ) and want a superior result , however , the most efficient , strongest , and most convenient way to do the job is to build a one - piece " Club - Foot " foundation or pad .
The construction of a club - foot foundation involves forming the footing and the floor simultaneously as one unit , which is then subsequently cast in concrete .
Ordinarily , concrete forms for footings are built separately using two 2x10 " planks , or form boards carefully set to width , grade and level .
A clubfoot foundation is different .
It is formed with one row of wooden planking or concrete forms set accurately , but around the outside perimeter only .
Here is how to build a clubfoot foundation .
1. Establish the location of the building , and set up " batter boards " at the side to establish the exact grade ( height ) of the finished concrete floor .
Normally a garage slab on grade might be established 6 " to 12 " or even higher above the original grade , depending upon ground conditions .
A planned increase in elevation may be required to ensure correct drainage around the pad .
2. Install pickets to delineate the approximate location of the corners .
3 . Excavate all topsoil and soft organic soils from the enclosed area down to undisturbed mineral soils .
Stockpile the topsoil so you can use it for subsequent landscaping as required .
4. Import granular " A " or a similar grade of granular gravel that will pack properly .
In your jurisdiction , your building code may specify the installation of crushed rock or other materials to a specific thickness .
Use what is required , but in no instance use less than 8 " of granular or gravel when packed with a plate packer unless you are building upon solid bedrock .
Using an adequately packed gravel pad will reduce the likelihood of the concrete floor cracking at some time in the future .
5 . Remember you are preparing for a combination footing and floor , so it is necessary to
" sculpt " the granular material to reflect the thickness of the footings , for instance , a 24 " wide footing will be the same depth all the way around , and 24 " wide , then starting from the INSIDE edges of the footing cavity , bevel the granular shallower toward the centre , packing the gravel to the correct elevation , which will be at the underside of the concrete floor , for example , 4 " below the desired , finished concrete surface .
If your proposed footings are 8 " thick , and your concrete floor is 4 " thick , the final result along the outside edge of your concrete " club foot " should be 12 " deep , with 8 " or more of packed granular or gravel underneath it .
6 . Set up the concrete forms .
Using 2x6 pickets driven into the ground on the outside of the form , set the first plank level and nail it into place .
Elevate or dig down the first corner as necessary to optimize and set the top of the form accurately to the correct grade .
Square the corner using the magic geometric measurements 3 '- 4 ' - 5 ' .
Measure 3 ' along one side from the exact corner , make a mark on the footing board , and from the same corner , measure the second side off at 4 ' .
When the corner is set perfectly square , the marks you have made will be exactly 5 ' diagonally from one mark to the other .
Use a carpenter 's line to ensure the inside surface of the forms are perfectly straight , and the form planks or boards must be perfectly plumb , or vertical .
Using adequate 2x6 pickets and planking , set all subsequent forming in place .
For a superior job , do not overlap the form planks , but rather butt the planks end to end , and scab the joints at a picket location with another plank on the outside of the joint .
Alternatively , you may drive extra wide pickets carefully to support the joint locations , but using a support “ scab ” ensures the joint will remain straight .
Check the levels , preferably using a transit level .
Careful use of a laser level or skillful use of a 4 ' carpenter 's level can do a perfect job .
You can use a garden hose full of water as a very accurate leveling device if you ensure there are no air bubbles in the hose .
Square the footing by measuring in " X " fashion diagonally across the corners .
Both measurements should be precise and identical but reasonable error may allow 1/8 " difference .
Adjust the forms as necessary , and place them as accurately as humanly possible .
7 . Brace the footing planking in place on the pickets by nailing it from the INSIDE of the planking to the pickets and shoveling dirt behind the planks on the outside .
8. Verify your forms are square , and always double check your grade level and position .
Correct as necessary adding extra gravel if required to ensure the bevel from the footing inward is uniform as called for in the plan .
The bevel width should be uniform all around the footing .
Raise the concrete form up , or dig it down as necessary , maintaining the required elevation and removing any extra granular as required .
9 . DO provide a pathway for any electrical cable entrance necessary under the footing at this time if you plan to install an underground cable to the electrical panel inside the building instead of coming through the wall later .
Put the cable in place , allowing adequate length to reach the electrical panel , or alternatively , correctly position a suitable conduit under the footing to allow the cable to be pulled in later .
Similarly , if any plumbing is desired , place the pipes to grade and under the footing , and install any drain pipes necessary .
For a garage , be sure to check to see if floor drains are allowed in your jurisdiction !
9 . Water the gravel heavily and pack it using a tamper or a motorized plate packer so the surface is smooth , uniform , firmly compacted , and sculpted to profile .
Do not hurry this process ; the better the granular is packed at this point , the less likely your concrete floor is to crack or fail at some point in the future .
10 . Install 6 mil polyethylene on top of the gravel .
Avoid the temptation to economize and eliminate this inexpensive step .
Polyethylene sheeting installed under the concrete will keep the concrete floor dry .
It will prevent water from soaking up through the concrete floor from the soil below .
11. Install 6 " x6 " steel mesh as required on top of the poly , or place steel reinforcing rod ( rebar ) on 12 " or 16 " centres as required by your design and plan , or as specified by code .
Wire - tie the rebar as recommended by your steel supplier .
Install steel " beams " , in the footing around the edges and tie in place appropriately with steel wire .
The " steel beams " are usually specially formed short pieces of steel that are assembled using longer pieces of rebar to form an open skeleton or “ rebar beam " that will sit in the footing cavity and be flooded with concrete .
12 . Verify all measurements and adjust the rebar for elevation as necessary , ensuring that it is not laying on the polyethylene .
Steel reinforcing may be lifted and blocked up using small pieces of concrete , brick or stone .
13 . Identify the locations of all doors by marking on the concrete forms .
Do not forget to install anchor bolts at 4 ' centres around the perimeter as necessary , and plan on beveling the concrete floor at vehicle entrance points , about 1 ' wide and the full width of any roll - up garage doors .
Doing so will allow water to drain away from the garage door seal quickly , preventing the door seal from being frozen in ice and tearing off the door seal .
Do not bevel the concrete at standard “ man-door ” openings .
14 .
Get the building inspector to to approve your work prior to pouring cement if required in your jurisdiction and make changes necessary .
15 .. Before the concrete arrives , do have a rented " power trowel " on hand , and other tools such as a long - handled bull float , shovels , wheeled barrows , hammers , hand trowels and rakes necessary .
Ensure that adequate help is available .
Pouring concrete is heavy , tiring work .
Work carefully .
Start in one corner , and as you pour the concrete , level it to grade ( the top of the form planking ) and tap the outside forms hard with a hammer to ensure the concrete settles smoothly against the forms to avoid " honeycomb " or holes in the finished concrete .
Ensure that no steel rebar is set too high , but take care to raise the steel rebar assembly up if necessary so that it is in the middle of the concrete pour .
" Screed " the rough cement surface to the desired rough level as you go using a handled screed , a suitably long 2x4 , or equivalent dimensioned lumber .
Add more concrete in spots if necessary .
16 .
Use the wide " bull - float " a long - handled metal or wooden float to rough - finish the surface to grade , and allow the concrete to " set up " for a while so that it will support the weight of the power trowel and operator .
Power trowel the surface to finish , applying extra water if necessary .
Install 1/2 " x 8 " " J " steel anchor bolts on 4 ' centers around the perimeter where required .
17 . Polish the concrete with the power trowel to acceptable finished condition .
A top quality finish should show no “ trowel marks ” or defects .
18 .
Cover the new concrete pad with polyethylene to prevent the concrete surface from drying too quickly .
Work carefully to avoid damaging the troweled surface .
* Note that after the first day , if the concrete looks dry , remove the poly , soak the concrete thoroughly with water , and reinstall the plastic cover .
Leave it covered for a minimum of 7 days if possible to ensure the strongest possible concrete .
Although you can begin construction on it much sooner , concrete reaches it 's maximum strength after about 28 days and continues to get harder .
19 .
Pry off the forms carefully to avoid breaking the corners of the concrete pad .
Fill any honeycomb holes with cement mortar and smooth .
Consider pargetting ( applying a thin layer of mortar to the visible surface ) to correct any defects and improve the appearance if required .
20 Apply waterproofing and weeping tile around the bottom of the footing if required .
21 . Get the final inspection if required , and fill around the pad with gravel as required .
Now you know how to build a clubfoot foundation !
Admire your handiwork and do n't forget to thank your helpers !
The next step is to proceed to lay concrete blocks around the perimeter for the base of your walls to the height desired , or get out the hammer , and start framing the walls !

Today is the ten year anniversary of the incorporation of Ximian , Inc .
A company founded by Nat Friedman and myself whose goal was to advance the state of the Linux desktop .
It was also an excuse for Nat and myself to hang out as we had become best friends forever in the previous two years .
Our conversations over the years have always been a little surreal .
I have megabytes worth of logs that look like this :
Ximian was made up of friends that shared this vision , and its founders had no startup , business or management experience when we launched the company .
We learned on the job and we were advised by friends that believed in our goals , and by people that cared about our mission .
From the archive : Ettore Perazzoli , Raph Levien , Nat and myself in Summer of Linux .
Ximian hired 90 % of its employees from open source contributors in the community and folks that we had met over mailing lists or IRC channels .
Nat was a Computer Science and Math graduate ; I was a math drop out and we had no management experience .
This means that we made every possible management mistake in the book , but all of our friends and employees stuck with us as we learned and as we worked to get the company off the ground .
This is an interesting time to reflect on 10 years of hacking adventures .
Writing , funding and advancing the state of the art of open source .
In the next few weeks , Nat and myself will be publishing some short stories from Ximian .
Today Ximian has been incorporated into Novell .
Our goals have been expanded , but we still continue to work to advance the state of the art in Linux .
Looking forward to another 10 years of joy and hacking .
Rolling out his approach toward the Pacific Rim , President Obama stressed in Tokyo today that he wants a cooperative relationship with China in which the two nations act as responsible global powers , setting aside differences to cope with climate change , nuclear proliferation and economic instability .
Obama said the U.S. has no wish to “ contain ” China , a strategy that grew out of the Cold War era when the American government strove to block the spread of communism .
“ I know there are many who question how the United States perceives China ’s emergence , ” he said .
“ But , as I have said , in an interconnected world , power does not need to be a zero - sum game , and nations need not fear the success of another .
Cultivating spheres of cooperation -- not competing spheres of influence -- will lead to progress in the Asia Pacific . ”
Obama ’s half - hour speech at a concert hall was warmly received by an audience of about 1,500 Japanese .
It was interrupted by applause more than a dozen times , and he got a standing ovation at the end .
Weaving in bits of his biography , Obama said his family ’s roots in Asia give him a perspective unique among U.S. presidents .

He told the crowd that he “ lived in Indonesia as a boy .
“ My sister , Maya , was born in Jakarta , and later married a Chinese Canadian .
My mother spent nearly a decade working in the villages of Southeast Asia , helping women buy a sewing machine or an education that might give them a foothold in the world economy .
So the Pacific Rim has helped shape my view of the world . ”
Obama is on the second day of a weeklong trip to Asia .
He will spend more than two days in China , where he will meet with the country ’s leaders and tour the Great Wall .
Obama ’s speech trod a bit of a diplomatic minefield .
He sought to make clear that the U.S. does not view China as a strategic threat .
At the same time , he did not want to ignore deep differences over China ’s approach to human rights and political dissent .
“ So the United States does not seek to contain China , nor does a deeper relationship with China mean a weakening of our bilateral alliances , ” Obama said .
“ On the contrary , the rise of a strong , prosperous China can be a source of strength for the community of nations . ”

Obama offered an implicit rebuke of China ’s leadership -- its censorship of the Internet and preference for one - party rule .
A universal human desire , he said , is “ the freedom to speak your mind and choose your leaders , the ability to access information and worship how you please . ”
As the Obama administration sees it , China is indispensable to meeting crucial goals .
The U.S. wants China ’s help in persuading North Korea and Iran to forswear nuclear weapons , in stabilizing Afghanistan and in setting conditions for a more “ balanced ” world economy not dependent on American consumerism .
Obama hopes to create U.S. jobs by coaxing Asian nations to boost spending and expand imports .
That ’s a theme he will press during stops in Singapore and South Korea .
Sending a message back home , he reminded American listeners that they are invested in Asia ’s success .

“ So . . .
I want everyone in America to know that we have a stake in the future of this region , because what happens here has a direct effect on our lives at home , ” Obama said .
“ This is where we engage in much of our commerce and buy many of our goods .
And this is where we can export more of our own products and create jobs back home in the process . ”
Obama devoted part of his speech to one of the thorniest issues in the region : North Korea ’s nuclear ambitions .
He said the country can choose between two possible paths .
Pursuit of nuclear weapons will only leave the regime isolated , he said .
But a more compliant North Korea will find a host of new trading partners and friends , the president said .
“ Working in tandem with our partners -- supported by direct diplomacy -- the United States is prepared to offer North Korea a different future .
Instead of an isolation that has compounded the horrific repression of its own people , North Korea could have a future of international integration .
Instead of gripping poverty , it could have a future of economic opportunity -- where trade and investment and tourism can offer the North Korean people the chance at a better life , ” Obama said .

One Japanese analyst said Obama hit the right notes for audiences across Asia .
“ President Obama covered most of the important points .
. . .
The speech itself was one that did n’t emphasize areas Japan and the U.S. were having difficulties resolving , out of respect for Japan , ” said Yasunori Sone , a political science professor at Keio University in Tokyo .
But Sone was also looking for more indication of U.S. plans .
“ He did emphasize how he is the first Pacific Rim president . . . and he understands Asia to a certain degree .
So is President Obama going to respond to a diverse Asia in a wide range of ways , or will his response to Asia be in an across - the - board manner ?
That was n’t clear . ”

THE HAGUE — A United States ambassador said Thursday that Washington was concerned about how aggression will be defined as an international crime .
“ I would be remiss not to share with you my country ’s concerns about an issue … to which we attach particular importance : the definition of the crime of aggression , ” US war crimes ambassador Stephen Rapp told a gathering in The Hague of the International Criminal Court ’s Assembly of State Parties ( ASP ) .

The court ’s founding Rome Statute , of which the United States is not a signatory , determines that the ICC can try aggression , though no legal definition has been agreed upon .
The issue is to be discussed at an ICC review conference in Kampala , Uganda , next May .
Rapp , who made no allusion to the United States ratifying the statute in the future , said Washington was concerned about the way a draft definition of aggression had been framed .
“ Our view has been and remains that , should the Rome Statute be amended to include a defined crime of aggression , jurisdiction should follow a Security Council determination that aggression has occurred . ”
He declined to elaborate when approached afterwards .

The United States is taking part in a meeting of the ASP , as an observer , for the first time since the world ’s only permanent court for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity started operating in 2002 .
The ASP , the court ’s management and oversight body , is made up of representatives of all 110 member parties .
Former president George W. Bush had fiercely opposed the ICC , fearing it could target Americans out of political bias considering US dominance around the world .

Rapp said “ the commitment of the Obama administration to the rule of law and the principle of accountability is firm . ”
On Wednesday , ASP president Christian Wenaweser welcomed the US presence as “ a very important gesture . ”
Secret Orders and organizations have always fascinated and stimulated imaginations throughout history .
Military orders like the Order of the Hospitallers , Teutonic Knights , and the Knights Templar , along with fraternal societies such as the notable Freemasons and even the Catholic Church have been written about extensively .
In some case , virtually little records about these groups survived the journey through time and their stories became myths .
Sometimes these myths could be used to precipitate fear among society for political gain like when King Philip IV of France ordered the eradication of the Knights Templar by in the 13th century .
In the society of the twenty - first century , these myths continue to permeate and hypnotize pop culture through various mediums , mainly in literature and fiction such as The Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol and , of course , visual media such as movies and , in our case , video games .
Assassin ’s Creed , which takes place at the height of the Third Crusade in the 1190s , is a prime example of a hybrid between historical events and the myths surrounding the Order of the Assassins .
In order to understand the contexts and reasons of the myths in the game , it ’s better to understand a little of the historical context and origins of the Hashshashin and how they came into existence .
The word “ Assassin ” has become synonymous with “ one who kills a person for fanatical or monetary reasons ” as many in the Western world have come to understand it .
However , the origins of the word is actually derived from the Arabic word “ Hashshashin , ” which has been speculated to have meant “ one who used hashish . ”
Many scholars have debated the actual meaning of Hashshashin .
Some have suggested that it was a derogatory term used to distinguish the radical sect known as the Nizari , which was an extreme group within Shi’ite Islam .
Another likely definition offered in the ongoing debates , is the idea that the term means “ follower of Hassan - i Sabbah , ” who was the founder of the Nizari sect .
Regardless of these differing translations of the term , the Hashshashin were one of the most feared zealots the Middle East from modern - day Iran to Egypt .
Being a minority within a minority , the Order was not able to organize along conventional military terms .
Their Sunni counterparts and the Shi’ite Fatimids from whom they had split , was able to organize .
As did their Christian rivals — the Templars and Hospitallers .
As a result of their deficiency in numbers , the Hashshashin had to result to unconventional tactics — tactics that would establish the legend , which they would be known for .
The methods , which military thinkers now call “ asymmetric warfare , ” allowed the Hashshashin to gain footholds throughout the Islamic world of the Middle East and carry out their quest for a new utopia of a state within a state — a concept that is arguably similar to that of Al - Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Hezbollah and Lebanon .
To accomplish these objectives , the Hashshashin relied on covertly converting civilians living in and around strategic points of interests .
They would also rely on a network of sleeper commando units known as the Fedayeen to protect Nizari followers from persecution .
Their most notable tactic is political assassination with a hidden knife or a blade as their trusted weapon .
They detested using poisons and bows as it increased the chances of the target ’s survival .
The order also used intimidation as a tactic to achieve its political objectives like leaving a dagger on a pillow next to a sleeping target as a warning that one was not safe anywhere .
Another trait worth noting is the meticulous execution of their missions by deliberately avoiding collateral damage to innocent life , a feature that the developers at Ubisoft made sure to reiterate .
However , in order to assert their ferocity , the Hashshashin carried out their killings in public , which players find themselves doing in the game .
After the end of the Crusades , the Hashshashin began to decline as an independent entity .
The Mongol invasions of the 13th century saw the destruction and conquest of most of their strongholds , which forced the Order to join with the Mamelukes of Egypt and essentially do the bidding of the Sultan in exchange for their survival .
However , their autonomy was destroyed .
Ubisoft ’s fine tradition of emphasis on thorough research with regards to historically - based games is emulated in Assassin ’s Creed through many of the game ’s features .
The aesthetics in relation to the environment and architecture of the time period is noteworthy .
The cities of Damascus and Jerusalem ’s old city are recreated from medieval maps along with many of their famous landmarks such as the Al - Aqsa mosque , the Dome of the Rock , Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem , and the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus .
The Hashshashin stronghold of Masyaf is a loose interpretation of what the Masyaf of 1191 may have been .
Most of what is known of the fortress is based on accounts of Crusaders who have supposedly encountered it on their expeditions .
Saladin , who is mentioned in the game , but is never seen , laid siege to Masyaf in response to his attempted assassination .
( Click for supplemental maps . )
The authenticity of the game in terms of equipment , clothing , and language spoken during the particular time period must be noted as well .
The armor and uniforms of the differing factions within Assassin ’s Creed are authentic from the emblems all the way to the helmets that are worn .
The trademark white overcoat with the red cross of the Templars is easily distinguished from the lion standard of Richard the Lionheart .
The Hashshashin method of combat also reflects the doctrine , which they espouse to .
However , Altair ’s free - running trait is purely for the wow - factor to add to the intensity of combat .
Adding to the authenticity are the differing languages that are spoken by the different factions .
Depending on the knights encountered in the different cities , players hear a variety of French , English , Arabic , and German spoken .
Lastly , is the historical content associated with the game .
Although Assassin ’s Creed is set in a historical time period , many of the events that occur are a mixture of fact and myth .
There were several figures that were met with an assassin ’s blade , who were not historically murdered by Hashshashin .
The first of these characters was Garnier de Nablus , the Grand Master of the Hospitallers .
He fought in the Third Crusade under Richard the Lionheart at the battle of Arsuf .
Robert de Sable , Grand Master of the Knights Templar , did not meet the fate as represented in the game .
He remained Grand Master until 1193 .
In the game , he is portrayed as a young man , which is a misrepresentation .
Al - Mualim , the leader of the Hashshashin , is loosely based on “ Old Man of the Mountain , ” Rashid ad - Din Sinan .
He died of old age between 1192 and 1194 .
Finally is William of Montferrat ; the father of Conrad of Montferrat , who was actually killed by Hashshashin .
There is some historical speculation that Richard contracted the Hashshashin to carry out the murder .
William of Montferrat died of old age .
Despite these discrepancies , the characters mentioned in the game were all present during the time .
Although many of the missions throughout the game were fictional , they represented what the Hashshashin were all about ; high profile assassinations and striking fear .
The general historical context in which the game takes place is real and accurate .
Assassin ’s Creed deserves praise for its effort in representing the world of the Hashshashin .
Through the use of myth and history , Ubisoft was able to craft a great game and at the same time , stimulate interest in an almost forgotten sect , whose tactics somewhat resonate in the modern world .
What can be said about Assassin ’s Creed II is another story .

OK , WTF , this got me so annoyed that I had to get out of blog posting dormancy .
I just went to Ke - Sen Huang ’s brilliant page of conference papers on the web .
Except , this time , all ACM pages ( such as SIGGRAPH 2009 , I3D 2009 , etc ) have been taken down , with the comment “ This page has been removed at the request of the ACM Publications Board . ”
What the fuck !?
ACM has no rights to request require (*) someone to remove links to pages on the net , and it ’s unfortunate that their request was complied with .
According to this page the ACM Publications Board is run by the following nasty little censoring asses :
Ronald F Boisvert ( chair ) – boisvert@acm.org
Holly E Rushmeier ( co-chair ) – holly@acm.org
Tamer M. Ozsu ( vice - chair ) – ozsu@acm.org
I strongly urge you to email them , with a cc to the ACM president Wendy Hall ( wh@ecs.soton.ac.uk ) , to tell them what you really feel about ACM practicing censorship on Ke - Sen Huang ’s pages ( or anywhere ) !
And if you have anything to do with ACM and SIGGRAPH , as people in the games industry tend to do , then I implore you to immediately stop your involvement and furthermore that you boycott their conferences ( SIGGRAPH in particular ) until they straighten their shit out .
Do not let their censoring of free information stand !

Changed the wording here , because some dip - shit on Reddit ca n’t understand the message otherwise .

They are still implying Ke - Sen ’s pages were infringing on ACM copyright , which is still a legally suspect claim as ( 1 ) Ke-Sen ’s pages are first and foremost factual listings which are not subjected to copyright infringements , ( 2 ) as Ke - Sen ’s pages were sufficiently different from ACM ’s so as not to be a derivative copy , and ( 3 ) even if they were outright copies of ACM ’s table of contents , “ fair use ” of TOCs have apparently not been tested in a court of law , so ACM has no legal leg to stand on in this issue ( and in fact , a ruling against all libraries in the US seems logistically implausible ) :
http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FWE/is_6_8/ai_n6080446/
It will be interesting to see how this truly plays out over the next several weeks , but it seems a battle has been won , though the war is likely to continue for quite some time .
Thanks to everyone who read my post and voiced your concern to the ACM Publication Board .
An organization is its members , and there is no stronger means of controlling an organization than through the vote of your voice and your purse !
Túl vagyunk az idei , 2009 - es Internet Hungary -n is , amelynek az első napján , a SEO : tipikus hibák című beszélgetésben vettem részt .
A beszélgetést Konrád vezette , Bánó és én válaszoltunk a feltett kérdésekre .
A beszélgetés jól sikerült , a közönség soraiból is sokeresk kérdés hangzott el , ez külön öröm , köszönet azoknak akik megtiszteltek az érdekl ődésükkel !
( Blumi az üvegfal mögül lefotografált minket , köszi Imi ! ) .
~ 30 kérdés volt , ezekből kiemelek néhány érdekesebbet a jövőben itt a blogon .
Jelen poszt , azzal a hibás szemléletmóddal foglalkozik , amely mentén a keres őoptimalizálást egy meghatározható számú kulcsszó halmazra alkalmazott “ kulcsszó optimalizálás ” - nak tekintik sokan , nem ritkán csupán egy kifejezésben gondolkodva .
Vannak fontos kulcsszavak , kifejezések , amelyek külön fókuszt kapnak optimalizálás során , de kifejezés típusokra és nem meghatározott kulcsszavakra optimalizálunk elsősorban .
Konrád , a beszélgetés közepe táján egy Suzuki autókeresked ő ügyfél szerepébe bújt és az ügyfelek által gyakran jellemző megközelítéseket használva kérdezett .
Első kérdése valahogy így szólt :
vállalnám - é azt a feladatot , hogy Suzuki szóra , Google találati lista első helyére juttatom az oldalát .
Amennyiben a megkeresés kizárólagos tárgya , a Suzuki szóra való első helyezés , akkor tisztelettel köszönöm a bizalmat , de a válaszom NEM .
Az ilyen vállalással kapcsolatos elvi problémákat figyelmen kívül hagyva , vizsgáljuk meg a gyakorlati értékét a kitűzött célnak .
Vessünk egy pillantást Suzuki keresésekre , a Google Adwords kulcsszó - keres ő eszközével .
Broad : havi viszonylatban , a Suzuki szó minden előfordulását tartalmazó keresésekre vonatkozóan 673.000 keresést mutat .
: havi viszonylatban , a Suzuki szó minden előfordulását tartalmazó keresésekre vonatkozóan keresést mutat .
Exact : kizárólagosan a Suzuki kifejezést tartalmazó keresések száma : 27.100 .
4 % azon keresések aránya , ahol kizárólagosan a Suzuki szót írja be a felhasználó .
Aki ismeri egy kicsit alaposabban a felhasználói intenciók alapján csoportosítható keresés típusokat , az azt is tudja , hogy még ennek a 4 % - nak is a meghatározó része navigációs keresés lesz jellemzően , egy csak a brand nevét magába foglaló keresés esetén .
Egy konkrét weboldalra irányuló keresés , magas arányú visszatér ?- látogatóval .
Lehet erőszakosan pozícióra törni általános kompetitív kifejezésekre , amennyiben saját érték nem kapcsolható hozzá , az semmit nem fog érni .
Lesz napi 120 látogatónk toronymagas lepattanási aránnyal .
( ajánlott olvasmány : a Google keres ő és a brandek )
Sokkal szerencsésebb irányvonal az , amikor a keresések másik 96 % - át törekszem kiszolgálni előbb , minőségi tartalommal és szolgáltatásokkal a látogatók keresési szokásaihoz igazodva , amely után esetleg megillet az asszociáció az elsődleges kifejezéssel , a brand nevével .
Kicsit elszakadva a Suzukitól ,
analitikában , napi többszázezres keres őforgalmat van szerencsém követni , több oldal statisztikáját összesítve .
Több tucat TOP kifejezés Google 1 . helyezéssel járó forgalmát látom .
A legkeresettebb szavak között is nagyon - nagyon kevés azon szavak aránya , amelyek napi 100 - 200 egyedi látogatónál többet szállítanak .
Igazán long - tail témákban , jól optimalizált oldalaknál , az ilyen kifejezések forgalma , nem éri el , a teljes organikus keres őforgalom fél százalékát sem .
( Itt most figyelmen kívül hagyom a honlap / brand nevére kereséssel érkező látogatókat )
Konrád következő kérdése az volt , hogy jólvan , de akkor hány kulcsszóra optimalizálunk ?
Kifejezés típusokban gondolkodjunk .
Az már számszer ősíthet ? , talán minden téma esetén , hogy hány csoportra lehet szegmentálni azokat a kifejezés formákat , amelyekre célzunk elsődlegesen , amelyekben – előzetes vizsgálgatás nélkül is egyértelmű , hogy – a legs ?r? bben előforduló elemek a gyártó egyes autó típusai lesznek , egy autókereskedés oldala esetén .
Ezek azok a brand nevet tartalmazó kifejezések amelyek kiemelten értékesek .
Példákat mondok , előzetes kutatások nélkül : autó típusra keresés ( brand + modell ) , autó típushoz kapcsolódó információkeresés , árkeresés , típushoz kapcsolódó alkatrészek keresése , lokalizált keresés desztináció meghatározásával a kereskedés ( ek ) re , tesztvezetés lehetőség keresés , szerviz információkra vonatkozó keresés …
Mindegyik típus esetén , a prioritásokat az ügyféllel egyeztetve , meghatározhatóak az elvárások , hogy nagyságrendileg mit várunk az együttműködéstől .
És a fenti megoldás alkalmazható a 10.000 terméket forgalmazó webshop , 30.000 szállást listázó szálláskatalógus és egyéb nagy adatbázisokon működő portálok esetén is .
A webanalitikához hasonlóan , a SEO esetén is elsődleges kritérium , hogy megtanuljon az ember szegmentálni , relációkban gondolkodni , különben favágás lesz a vége .

Predicted stable structures of metallic LiH2 ( left ) and LiH6 ( right ) .
Green - lithium atoms , white and pink - hydrogen atoms .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
From detailed assessments of electronic structure , researchers at the University at Buffalo , Cornell University , Stony Brook University and Moscow State University discovered that unexpected hydrides violating standard valence rules , such as LiH 6 and LiH 8 , become stable metals at a pressure approximately one quarter of that required to metalize pure hydrogen itself ; findings that were published in an October 5 , 2009 early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The paper , entitled " A little bit of lithium does a lot for hydrogen , " presents the first prediction of stable LiHn hydrides ( LiH 2 , LiH 6 , LiH 8 ) .
These hypothetical materials demonstrate that nontraditional stoichiometries can considerably expand the view of chemical bonding already under moderate pressure .
Metallic hydrogen , believed to be stable at high pressures , is theorized to be a superconductor at record high temperatures of at least a few hundred Kelvin ( room temperature or higher ) .
Due to its high ( 100 % ) hydrogen content and high density it is the ultimate energy storage material - if it can be synthesized in large quantities and subsequently brought to ambient conditions in the same metallic form .
For decades , researchers at the top research institutions around the world have predicted exotic properties for metallic hydrogen , but no credible reports of experimental synthesis of solid metallic hydrogen ever appeared because of two primary obstacles .
First , metallization of hydrogen requires pressures of about four million atmospheres , which was out of reach of static compression techniques .
Extreme pressures , even if they could be reached , imply that only tiny amounts of the material can be prepared , which would be of little practical use .
Second , the recovery of this high pressure material to ambient pressure will be almost certainly problematic .
Work of Eva Zurek , assistant professor at the University at Buffalo , her former Cornell University colleagues Roald Hoffmann and Neil W. Ashcroft , in collaboration with Professor Artem R. Oganov and his colleague Andiry O. Lyakhov at Stony Brook University , offers surprising new optimism .
" Synthesis of metallic hydrogen has long been a dream of physicists .
A dream that is now one big step closer , thanks to this theoretical work , " says Professor Oganov .
" There are fundamental reasons to be excited about this form of metallic hydrogen .
Light nucleus of hydrogen behaves like a quantum particle - wave , making it possible that there will be altogether new states of matter , simultaneously superconducting and superfluid . "
To uncover these findings , Zurek tapped the powerful computational methods developed by Oganov and Lyakhov - methods which allow one to predict the structure and composition of new stable compounds before they are synthesized in the lab .
What Zurek found was that , while LiH is a simple and well - known material at normal conditions , very unusual chemistry appears at pressures above one million atmospheres .
Unexpected hydrogen - rich metallic compounds , such as LiH 2 , LiH 6 and LiH 8 become stable .
Many of their properties would be similar to those of the long - sought metallic hydrogen , but conditions of synthesis can be readily achieved in the lab .
The study also shows a way to prepare metallic almost - hydrogen for possible practical use .
" Finding elements that would form such compounds at still lower pressures is now the most realistic solution to the metallic hydrogen problem and opens the door to a world of new chemistry , where little can be anticipated with traditional chemical concepts - no one would have expected LiH 8 , LiH 6 or LiH 2 to be stable compounds , " says Oganov .
" It is possible that new important chemical rules will be found along this exploratory path .
And who knows , maybe one day this will lead us to room - temperature superconductivity and new twists in the search for hydrogen storage materials . "

COLUMBIA , S.C. --
As he watched South Carolina inch closer to a go - ahead score early in the fourth quarter , Florida coach Urban Meyer knew it was time for one of his Gators to make a play .
Defensive end Justin Trattou was more than ready .
Trattou made a game - changing interception and No. 1 Florida finished a perfect regular season in the Southeastern Conference with a 24 - 14 victory over South Carolina on Saturday .
Tim Tebow tied the SEC career touchdown mark and Florida ( 10 - 0 , 8 - 0 ) went undefeated in the league for the first time since Steve Spurrier 's 1996 national champions .
" Every week , someone has to step up .
It 's usually someone different every week , " said Trattou , a junior playing with a painful torn left biceps .
Gamecock quarterback Stephen Garcia had closed the third quarter when he cut back around two pursuers to pick up a first down on fourth - and - 2 . South Carolina ( 6 - 5 , 3 - 5 ) eventually got to the Gators 22 , trailing 17 - 14 and ready to strike .
But Garcia 's pass was tipped and wound up in Trattou 's hand .
The 6 - foot - 3 , 265 - pounder ran along the right sidelines as a wall of Florida defenders lined up to block during a 53 - yard return .
" He looked kind of athletic there , " Tebow joked of Trattou .
Four plays later , Tebow made South Carolina pay with a 1 - yard TD run that matched LSU great Kevin Faulk for most in the SEC at 53 .
Trattou plays and practices with an injury most people would spend weeks rehabbing .
He told Meyer after it happened in October that unless he needed surgery , he 'd continue playing .
" If it 's a matter of dealing with a little pain here and there , it 's not going to keep me out , " Trattou said .
The Gators remained on track for a third national title in four years .
They again called on their SEC - leading defense to save things against former coach Spurrier , who looked as if he 'd figured out a few cracks in Florida 's front line .
By the end , Spurrier could only throw off his headset in frustration at another close call against his old school .
Ahead 24 - 14 after Tebow 's score , Florida 's defense got after the Gamecocks .
The Gators sacked Garcia four times in the fourth quarter .
Joe Haden 's interception with two minutes left sealed Florida 's 20th straight victory -- and fourth in a row over its former head ball coach .
" That turnover took a lot of steam " out of the Gamecocks , Spurrier said .
" Give Florida credit .
They played pretty well .
I do n't know if by their standards they thought they played super . "
Meyer was simply happy to leave with a victory .
" We did not play perfect .
I 'm not sure we 've played perfect in a while , " he said .
" But that 's 20 in a row and I 'm awful proud of the guys in there . "
Florida ends with two nonconference games against Florida International and Florida State , then faces Alabama in the SEC championship game in three weeks .
A win there and the Gators again match Spurrier 's 1996 team .
Three years ago , defensive lineman Jarvis Moss blocked a field goal that saved Florida 's 17 - 16 win over South Carolina and , eventually , brought a national championship .
Tebow ended 14 of 25 for 199 yards passing , including a 68 - yard touchdown throw to Riley Cooper .
Florida 's defense held South Carolina to 247 yards , the Gamecocks fewest in four games .
Tebow had led blowouts of Spurrier 's Gamecocks the past two years .
In 2007 , Tebow wrapped up the Heisman Trophy when he accounted for 424 yards and seven touchdowns in the 51 - 31 victory in the Gators ' last visit to Williams - Brice Stadium .
Then last season , Florida handed Spurrier the most - lopsided loss of his stellar career , 56 - 6 .
Things looked like they might be as easy for the Gators this time , too , as they scored on their first three series .
After Tebow 's touchdown pass to Cooper , Caleb Sturgis had a 32 - yard field goal and Emmanuel Moody broke two tackles during his 17 - yard scoring run .
That 's usually more than enough for Florida 's D , second in the country at just more than 10 points allowed a game .
But Spurrier , back in full command of the offense , found a way to make Florida sweat .
He called a fake punt on South Carolina 's opening series , Spencer Lanning throwing a perfect pass to wide open D.J. Swearinger .
An illegal shift penalty , though , negated the first down .
The Gamecocks tied it at 7 - all with a 14 - play , 84 - yard drive finished by Brian Maddox 's 1 - yard TD run .
It was the junior 's first score in eight games .
Garcia went 5 of 5 on South Carolina 's other first - half scoring drive , hitting Weslye Saunders with a 9 - yard touchdown pass in the left corner of the end zone .
Garcia gave a military salute to the South Carolina sidelines after that score , keeping with the theme of the day .
The Gamecocks wore black camouflage jerseys with values such as " Courage , " " Integrity , " and " Service " on the back instead of names to honor veterans hurt defending the United States .
The effort was sponsored by The Wounded Warrior Project and Under Armour .
Garcia had seemingly put himself in line as one of South Carolina 's alltime heroes with his late run .
Two plays later , though , came Trattou 's interception .
" That 's not what we were trying to do , " Spurrier said .
" After that we went backwards every time we touched it . "
Tensions have recently flared over a Colombian military deal with the US
Colombia has accused neighbouring Venezuela of blowing up two pedestrian bridges on its shared border .
Colombian Defence Minister Gabriel Silva said eyewitnesses had seen men who appeared to be from the Venezuelan army blow up the bridges with dynamite .
He described the incident , on the border of Colombia 's Norte de Santander region , as violating international law .
A Venezuelan official was quoted as saying that the army had blown up an illegal , improvised bridge .
It was the latest in a series of incidents to cause tension between the two neighbours .
' Walkway '
" Uniformed men , apparently from the Venezuelan army , arrived in trucks on the Venezuelan side at two pedestrian bridges that link communities on both sides ... and then proceeded to dynamite them , " Mr Silva said .
But Alexis Balza , frontier director for Tachira State governor 's office , was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying an illegal bridge had been removed .
" The Venezuelan army took down a sort of walkway , put up by the people who pass from Venezuela to Colombia , " he said .
Tensions have recently focussed on Colombia 's decision to allow the US full access to its military bases .
Venezuela has accused the United States of planning attacks on its territory through the new military agreement - though Bogota says the pact is aimed at fighting drug - traffickers and Marxist rebels within Colombia 's own borders .
Earlier this month , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez urged his armed forces to be prepared for possible war .

“ For the last year , as we ’ve struggled to pass health care reform , we ’ve been told that we have to pay for the bill -- and the cost over the next decade will be about a trillion dollars , ” the three lawmakers said in a joint statement .
“ Now the president is being asked to consider an enlarged counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan , which proponents tell us will take at least a decade and would also cost about a trillion dollars .
But unlike the health care bill , that would not be paid for .
We believe that ’s wrong . ”
Discussing the idea earlier this month , Murtha said he knew the bill would not be enacted and that advocates of a surtax were simply trying to send a message about the moral obligation to pay for the wars .
“ The only people who ’ve paid any price for our military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan are our military families , ” Murtha , Obey and Larson said in a joint statement .
“ We believe that if this war is to be fought , it ’s only fair that everyone share the burden . ”
The bill would require the president to set the surtax so that it fully pays for the previous year ’s war cost .
But it would allow for a one - year delay in the implementation of the tax if the president determines that the economy is too weak to sustain that kind of tax change .
It also would exempt military members who have served in combat since Sept. 11 , 2001 , along with their families , and the families of soldiers killed in combat .
The legislators write that their " perspectives have manifested … via Congressional Progressive Caucus Member - led legislation " including : a timeline for eventual troop withdrawal , prohibiting funds for additional troop surges , reorienting the mission so that 80 percent of US resources are devoted to economic and political development and 20 percent towards security , and prioritizing diplomacy and development over the use of force .
" We now have an opportunity to realign our defense development and diplomatic engagement to ensure political , economic , and social security for a nation deeply impoverished , " the letter closes .
" This new tack , if taken today , can transform the conflict while remaining consistent with America 's strategic interests . "
Actually , it is n't just Carl Levin who is standing up and saying that if Obama wants to escalate the war in Afghanistan he 's going to have to figure out how to pay for it without charging our great , great grandchildren , Bush and Cheney having already bankrupt our children , grandchildren and great grandchildren .
Keep in mind that each additional soldier in Afghanistan costs around $ 1 million , which means $ 40MORE if 40,000 new troops are added .
Three very senior Democrats in the House , David Obey ( WI ) , chairman of the Appropriations Committee , John Murtha ( PA ) , chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , and John Larson ( CT ) , chairman of the Democratic Caucus introduced legislation that would impose a surtax beginning in 2011 to cover the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Levin was more specific about where the tax burden should fall : an “ additional income tax to the upper brackets , folks earning more than $ 200,000 or $ 250,000 ” a year , could fund more troops , Levin , will announce in an interview onthis weekend .
The impetus and support for the Afghan war is with Republicans but there 's no way they 'll support a war that has to be paid for , especially not by rich people .
The Republican strategy is to run up big bills with wasteful wars in order to kill off social programs like Medicare and Social Security .
Last spring when Obama presented his supplemental war budget the first time he had overwhelming Republican support , but when it came back from the Senate with some price tags on it to pay for other Administration priorities , the GOP bailed .
In fact , the money would have been cut off if just another few Democratic congressmen who had run on anti-war platforms had stuck to their words and opposed the supplemental .
As is only 32 courageous Democrats broke with the war machine and did do that .
This week Katrina Vanden Heuvel , editor ofoffers Obama some advice he'd be wise to take : take seriously , very seriously , the letter the Congressional Progressive Caucus sent requesting an alternative to escalation is Afghanistan

“ An unhurried sense of time is in itself a form of wealth . ”
– Bonnie Friedman
Ever wish you had more time ?
You ’re not alone .
A recent survey found that :
70 % rate themselves as busy or very busy
50 % are more busy than they were last year
45 % sacrificed time with friends
30 % sacrificed time with family
90 % wished they had more time to spend with friends and family .
We ’re all busy , and getting busier – but our lives do n’t have to be so rushed .
Imagine what you might do with an extra hour or two a day .
Picture yourself going from project to project unhurriedly , knowing that you had enough time in your day to complete everything you needed to do .
In this article , I ’m going to lay out strategies I use to instantly make more time for myself – actionable strategies that you can use today .
Let ’s jump right in .
1. Outsource
When most people hear the word outsource , they imagine workers in remote parts of the world doing business tasks or research .
However , it can be even as simple as hiring people to do chores that you do n’t want to do .
Some examples :
Cooking .
I tracked where I was spending my time , and managed to free up 10 hours a week … for only $ 60 !

Laundry .
Either via in house or sending my laundry out to individuals and services , I ’ve managed to save 4 + hours a week .

Either via in house or sending my laundry out to individuals and services , I ’ve managed to save 4 + hours a week .
Cleaning .
Through maid services , individual maids or through assistants on their downtime , I ’ve managed to save anywhere from 2 - 7 hours per week .
I ’ve also outsourced work for my business , and trained personal assistants to help me with complex tasks .
This is the single best I ’ve discovered to make more time for myself .
Do want advanced training on how to outsource , move beyond time management , and “ clone ” yourself ?
It ’s time for you to take a look at my new course , The Outsource Solution
2. Be Unavailable
You ’ve heard me tell you before , stop checking your email so often .
When I really need to focus , I do n’t just target email however – I make myself completely unavailable .
I turn off my cell phone , log out of social media , and if I can – yes , I will completely unplug from the internet .
Not only does making myself unavailable keep me from being interrupted , the whole routine of preparing myself and mentally deciding I ’m unavailable really helps me to focus on what needs to be done .
3. Reduce Commitments
Time does n’t just spend itself : time is spent on activities .
My question to you is : are you doing those activities because you want to , or because you have to ?
How many commitments have you taken on out of obligation , because you felt they were the right thing to do – or simply because you were n’t thinking about it and said yes to them ?
I ’m all for trying new things , but if you ’ve taken on too much and are being stretched thin – stop trying to optimize and squeeze seconds out of the day , when cutting activities and projects can save hours .
4. Take Notice
One of the things I learned when I tracked where I was spending my time was the specific websites I visited that were a complete waste of my time .
You ca n’t magically turn a 24 hour day into a 30 hour day – but you can stop wasting the 24 hours each of us is given every day .
Instead of passively wasting days away , take notice of where you spend your time – so you can actively live your life .
I think one of the biggest challenges of our generation is dealing with is the twin time sucks of television and the internet .
I have a whole slew of strategies for how to stop wasting time online .
Here ’s one thought that helps me focus :
Imagine how much time you already have right in front of you that is spent online or in front of the television .
Every moment you spend watching TV or browsing random websites – you are making someone else rich .
Why not instead spend that time on yourself ?
5. Pay Yourself First
I previously discussed my strategy for paying myself first with my time .
In short : I work on my personal projects first thing in the morning .
I work on myself first regardless of how busy a day I have , and regardless of any external obligations I need to take care of .
It ’s like brushing my teeth – it ’s a habit , and the first thing I do when I wake up .
I do n’t worry about the details of how everything will get done .
Regardless of how much or little time I have the rest of the day , I always find a way to take care of everything .
And if I do n’t ?
Then clearly I ’ve taken on too much , and I need to let some things go .
Put yourself first , and work on your goals before anything else
Still need more time ?
Let ’s make the most out of your life .
The Outsource Solution can help you .
Join me , and you will learn how to outsource tasks , and buy more time – so you can spend your time on what really matters to you .

Pogoda na weekend pod psem
Od jutra znacznie więcej chmur nad Dolnym Śląskiem .
- Do końca długiego weekendu temperatury będą spadać - mówią synoptycy .
Dziś na termometrach jeszcze do 20 stopni Celsjusza , ale mogą wystąpić burze .
W niedzielę temperatura spadnie o kilka stopni , a do wtorku zupełnie się popsuje .
Wtedy temperatury spadną do 12 stopni Celsjusza .
- Przed nami również chłodne noce - ostrzega Elżbieta Wojtczak z wrocławskiego biura prognoz .
Taka pogoda utrzyma się najprawdopodobniej do połowy przyszłego tygodnia .
The Danish parliament today passed legislation which will give police sweeping powers of " pre-emptive " arrest and extend custodial sentences for acts of civil disobedience .
The " deeply worrying " law comes ahead of the UN climate talks which start on 7 December and are expected to attract thousands of activists from next week .
Under the new powers , Danish police will be able to detain people for up to 12 hours whom they suspect might break the law in the near future .
Protesters could also be jailed for 40 days under the hurriedly drafted legislation dubbed by activists as the " turmoil and riot " law .
The law was first announced on 18 October .
The Danish ministry of justice said that the new powers of " pre-emptive " detention would increase from 6 to 12 hours and apply to international activists .
If protesters are charged with hindering the police , the penalty will increase from a fine to 40 days in prison .
Protesters can also be fined an increased amount of 5,000 krona ( 671 Euros ) for breach of the peace , disorderly behaviour and remaining after the police have broken up a demonstration .
The Danish police also separately issued a statement in August ( pdf ) applying new rules and regulations for protests at the climate conference , warning that " gatherings that may disturb the public order must not take place " .
Earlier this month , the Guardian published a letter by environmental activists that described the new law as " deeply worrying " and called for the Danish government to uphold their right to legitimate protest .
Tannie Nyboe , a spokewoman from campaigning group Climate Justice Action in Denmark , said the new law was designed to control civil disobedience during the summit .
" These laws are a big restraint in people 's freedom of speech and it will increase the police repression for anyone coming to Copenhagen to protest .
Denmark normally boasts of how open and democratic a country we are .
With this law we can't boast about this anymore .
" It will increase the repression of any protester or activist coming to Copenhagen .
This law creates an image of anyone concerned about climate change being a criminal , which will of course also influence the general treatment of any activist who comes into contact with the police or other authorities . "
A Danish justice ministry confirmed that the laws had been passed today and would come into effect before the climate conference starts on 7 December .
A friend recently returned , seemingly traumatised , from what he described as " a terrible date " .
After much prompting , he relayed the reason in a hushed and horrified voice : " She tried to force me to steal money from a car park machine . "
I was fascinated .
Had the date , mistakenly thinking she had spotted criminal potential in my friend , decided to enlist him – under the cunning guise of sharing a romantic evening – as her accomplice in this most unglamorous act of theft ?
Had she brought a screwdriver along , or a whole toolkit ?
And if she had pulled off this relatively small - scale job , did she envisage the pair of them graduating to train station ticket machines , drinks machines in sports centres , or perhaps even bank jobs ?
It was hugely intriguing .
The truth , sadly , was rather less so .
My friend had parked , gone to pay for a ticket – and the machine had given him an extra three pounds in change .
" My date insisted that I should steal this money and keep it for myself ! "
It was hardly Bonnie and Clyde .
" That 's not stealing , " I lamented .
" Anyone would have picked up that cash . "
" But it was n't my money , " my friend protested .
" It would have been if you 'd taken it ! " I pointed out .
He stared at me , confused .
" But that would have been dishonest ! " he said .
I felt faintly abashed .
Was my friend , as I suspected , being painfully moral ?
Or was I myself sliding down a slippery slope to a life of crime and soap - passing ?
Was it really just a short park - and - ride from appropriating errant change to stabbing dogs in the street ?
I tried another tack .
The friend did realise , I hoped , that when he had n't collected the spare three pounds , the person behind him in the parking meter queue would have scooped it up ?
He agreed that this was quite probably the case , but that was their problem .
" Problem ? " I echoed , incredulous .
The three quid was n't their problem – it was their ice cold pint , their big juicy cheeseburger , the hot comforting bag of chips that they would n't have otherwise been able to buy .
Convinced I was right , I called a friend who happened to have studied criminal law , and recounted the story , certain that he would laugh and deem friend No 1's views ridiculous .
Instead he replied earnestly : " He 's right – it is stealing .
Admittedly , you'd be unlikely to be prosecuted for it , but there have been cases of people taking extra money from broken cash machines and being found guilty of theft . "
Friend
No 2 claimed that he would n't have taken the meter money either .
I was perplexed .
Surely it was a victimless crime – 300 pence , which would only ever have been earmarked for some dull council activity , expelled by a machine that would n't exactly be devastated at its loss ?
It was n't as though some old lady had dropped her pension money in the street .
The aesthetically displeasing machine would continue its whirring and collecting , oblivious to its moral - conundrum - creating error .
I called friend No 1 and told him he had an ally .
He said he was n't surprised .
I then warned him that his skyscraping ethical expectations would prevent him from ever finding a girlfriend .
If he went on to sever ties with every date who failed to adhere to his unrealistic moral code , he could consign himself to a life of eternal disappointment .
He told me that this was irrelevant , and pretty much what he was expecting to happen with women anyway .
After this , despite my stance that day , I kept thinking about the times that I had picked up stray cash , taken a one - stop train journey without getting a ticket , or rejoiced at a pricing oversight on my Sainsbury 's receipt – and I started feeling vaguely embarrassed .
I wondered how both friends would feel if they knew about those minor amoral moments , and whether they would still want to be friends with me .
Even though I felt that they had overreacted on the parking meter issue , I resolved to be more honest in the future and live up to their expectations , even if no one else did .
However , as I 've yet to be challenged on this resolution , I suggest that the Guardian test my virtue by overpaying me vastly for this article – then wait to see if I return the cash .
Last week , we had two posts so GITS readers could submit questions to Jason Scoggins :
Jason also has a great website called Life On The Bubble , which tracks movie box office and the spec script market .
GITS readers asked some good questions and Jason has responded with some valuable insight into screenwriting , the spec script market , and working in Hollywood .
In Part 1 today , Jason provides his take on the current state of the movie business :
Given the success of movies like SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE and DISTRICT 9 , without stars or in some cases what many in the industry considers “ commercial hooks , ” can we expect to see changes in the industry re story and audience taste ?
— Joshua
I think the industry has a pretty good feel for its audience and , in general , what ’s going to put butts in seats .
I think the two films you mentioned are great examples of the system working correctly :
The producers clearly asked themselves “ Who are we making this movie for ? , ” made their films for budgets that were appropriate to the expected box office return , and let the filmmakers involved ( all of whom had solid track records ) do their things within those constraints .
( Both also had fantastic marketing campaigns , but that ’s another topic . )
It ’s easy to look back at enormous hits and say “ Hey , why do n’t they do THAT more often ? ”
But no one expected SLUMDOG to become the worldwide sensation it was , and I doubt even the producers of DISTRICT 9 thought it would perform as well as it has so far ( $ 90 m domestic after three weekends as I write this ) .
I do think box office failures are examined pretty closely for what went wrong , but I do n’t think the question of audience taste is included in the analysis per se .
As William Goldman famously wrote , “ no one knows anything ” when it comes to whether the audience will respond to a specific film .
There seems to have been a decline in small , interesting movies in favor of tentpoles .
Is it too much to hope that more time / money / talent will be developed in that regard ?
— Joshua
Yes .
( I was so tempted to leave it at that . )
If you ’re asking whether the studios themselves will develop more small , interesting movies in the near future , then I think the answer is no .
There ’s no reason they could n’t ( it ’s a buyer ’s market , after all ) , but they seem to be locked into the pursuit of pre-sold material and projects that can be nurtured into franchises ( i.e. , future pre-sold material ) .
I read an interesting article a few months ago that suggested studios are most profitable when they make more , and more varied , movies , so in a vacuum you ’d think they ’d carve out a specific percentage of their development and marketing dollars in order to include smaller yet mainstream pictures on their slates .
Then again , it ’s easy to Monday morning quarterback the studio chiefs ; I know there are dozens of reasons it ’s difficult to make that call , and the studios ’ business models really do require feeding their pipelines with tentpoles and franchise - type product .
If the independent film market had n’t collapsed in the past two years , this would n’t be all that big a deal .
In any case , you go to war with the army you have .
Given the number of new media / opportunities to make money , does Hollywood risk losing its share of fresh talent and innovation by keeping itself closed off from original outside ideas ?
Could Hollywood become to motion pictures what IBM became to computers ?
— kgmadman
One could argue Hollywood already is the IBM of computers , in that IBM no longer makes computers , it sells computer - and computing - related services ( and makes billions every quarter doing so ) , not unlike how Hollywood has shifted its focus away from the “ making movies ” part of the movie business .
But I think you ’re asking whether I think Hollywood is forcing new voices to go to different media to be heard and thus planting the seeds of its eventual destruction .
I do n’t see it this way .
I am troubled by how difficult it is to break in a new writer right now , how dead the spec market is , and how few of the projects getting set up these days start out as screenplays ( as opposed to comic books or videogames or 70 ’ s - era toys ) , but those concerns are specific to my own business model .
There are plenty of original , outside ideas making their way into the system , and there ’s no shortage of fresh talent nor innovation making its pilgrimage to Hollywood on a daily basis .
Some may well start out in the new media hinterlands or wherever , and in fact I think that ’s a great way to break in , especially for directors .
But at the end of the day there really is n’t much money to be made out there yet , and the studios know this .
I think the holy grail will remain making movies and television for the foreseeable future .
IBM officials are saying the company plans to continue manufacturing and selling its Cell processor , refuting rumors circulating on the Internet that the technology was being killed .
The future of the Cell processor has been a topic of speculation on the Web since a Nov. 19 report from the German Website Heise Online quoted an IBM executive as saying the company was halting development of the next - generation Cell chip .
In the article , David Turek , vice president of deep computing at IBM , was quoted as saying the next - generation PowerXCell 32i- aimed at supercomputers and the high - performance computing space - was being killed .
The chip was to feature two PPEs ( PowerPC Processor Elements ) and 32 SPEs ( Synergistic Processing Elements ) .
However , Turek said parts of the Cell design would live on in other forms , though he would n't elaborate .
IBM developed the chip in conjunction with Sony and Toshiba , forming an alliance called STI .
The Cell processor found itself into such devices as Sony 's PlayStation 3 gaming console , HD television sets from Toshiba and servers from Mercury Computer Systems .
It also has become a key component in some high - end computers .
It formed the basis of IBM's Roadrunner supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , which until November was the fastest system in the world .
In a statement Nov. 24 , IBM officials said the Cell processor has formed the foundation of their belief that the future of computing will rely on the integration of multicore and hybrid technologies .
" IBM continues to invest in Cell technologies as part of this hybrid and multicore strategy , including in new Power7 - based systems expected next year , " the statement read .
It 's unclear whether IBM will continue developing new versions of the Cell processor .
However , the statement did say IBM " continues to manufacture the Cell processor for use by Sony in its PlayStation3 , and we look forward to continue developing next - generation processors for the gaming market . "
The Roadrunner supercomputer , which also uses Opteron processors from Advanced Micro Devices , was the first system to reach a peak performance of a petaflop ( 1,000 trillion floating - point operations per second ) .
The current PowerXCell 8 i chips also were the key processing technologies in the first three supercomputers on the Green500 list of the world 's most energy - efficient systems .
The most important new antidiscrimination law in two decades  the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act  will take effect in the nation ’s workplaces next weekend , prohibiting employers from requesting genetic testing or considering someone ’s genetic background in hiring , firing or promotions .
The act also prohibits health insurers and group plans from requiring such testing or using genetic information  like a family history of heart disease  to deny coverage or set premiums or deductibles .
“ It does n’t matter who ’s asking for genetic information , if it ’s the employer or the insurer , the point is you ca n’t ask for it , ” said John C. Stivarius Jr. , a trial lawyer based in Atlanta who advises businesses about the new law .
The biggest change resulting from the law is that it will  except in a few circumstances  prohibit employers and health insurers from asking employees to give their family medical histories .
The law also bans group health plans from the common practice of rewarding workers , often with lower premiums or one - time payments , if they give their family medical histories when completing health risk questionnaires .
Game development often lasts for years .
And in that stretch of time , studios have their fair share of ups and downs .
From humorous game bugs to stress - relieving antics , Game Informer peers behind the curtain of game development .
In this entry of Tidbits , developer Bethesda Softworks shares secrets behind the development of Fallout 3 .
In the world of Fallout , the bombs fell on October 23rd .
Bethesda tried to coincide the release of Fallout 3 to that .
The original inspiration for VATS was Burnout ’s crash mode replays .
The sound that plays when you enter VATS is the combat turn sound from Fallout 1 .
Fallout 3 started in 2004 and was announced before Oblivion was even announced .
A team of over 80 people worked on Fallout 3 covering three platforms - Xbox 360 , PS3 , and PC .
The dog in Fallout 3 , Dogmeat , also appeared in Fallout and Fallout 2 .
Artist Grant Struthers prototyped the VATS camera system by filming his Incredibles action figures fighting .
The very first piece of Fallout 3 art was created by Lead Artist Istvan Pely in 2004 .
It was the power armor image that became the game ’s cover .
Bethesda ’s first true - 3D shooter was Terminator : Future Shock in 1995 , which was also set in a large post - apocalyptic city .
Todd Howard is often credited with creating the first “ mouse look ” interface for it .
Bethesda ’s first game was Gridiron !
In 1986 .
Bethesda Softworks was actually only in Bethesda , Maryland , for a short time .
Their offices are in Rockville , Maryland .
Actress Courtney Cox worked at Bethesda briefly in the 1980s .
The bell that sounds after shooting the Fat Man Nuclear Catapult is the lunchroom bell at the Bethesda offices .
The Fat Man is based on an actual nuke launcher , the M - 388 Davy Crockett Tactical Nuclear Recoilless Rifle which was made in the 1950s .
The cars in Fallout 3 are based on the Ford Nucleon , a concept car built to run on a nuclear generator in the 1950s .
The downtown DC area in Fallout 3 was twice the size at one point and the team decided it was too large and confusing and cut half the space out .
Though the wasteland area was half the size , and the team felt it was too small , so the wasteland doubled .
The voice of the one - year - old baby you play who says “ Da Da ” is Jake Howard on his 1st birthday , son of game director Todd Howard .
The voice of Timmy Neusbaum , who you have to make cry in Tranquility Lane , is the voice of Cullen Pagliarulo , son of lead designer Emil Pagliarulo .
The voice of young Paul Hannon , at your 10th birthday party , is Luke Lafferty , son of producer Craig Lafferty .
The voice of Mr. Handy and Harold is that of Stephen Russell , who also plays Garrett in the Thief series of games .
Production director Ashley Cheng provides the voice for the Chinese commandos .
At one point , Fallout 3 featured a surgery minigame , where you had to cauterize your own wounds while watching your character scream in pain .
The team felt it slowed down the game ’s pace to just heal your limbs .
In the original design , you actually drove Liberty Prime and did battle with a working and floating Rivet City .
If you sneak up and activate a Brahmin , your character will tip it over .
In the Hubris Comics ’ building is a terminal that has an actual working text adventure in it called “ The Reign of Grelok . ”

WASHINGTON
I had a four - hour dinner once with Rush Limbaugh at the “ 21 ” Club in Manhattan , back in the days when I was still writing profiles as a “ reporterette , ” to use a Limbaugh coinage .
He was charming , in a shy , awkward , lonely - guy way .
Not a man of the people .
He arrived in a chauffeured town car and ordered $ 70 - an - ounce Beluga , Porterhouse and 1990 Corton - Charlemagne .
But he was not a Neanderthal , though he did have a cold and blew his nose in his napkin .
He talked about Chopin ’s Polonaise No. 6 , C.S. Lewis and how much he loved the end of the movie “ Love Story . ”
In those days , he called himself a “ harmless little fuzzball . ”
He ’s a lot less harmless now .
I went on to columny , as my pal Bill Safire called it , and Rush went on to calumny .
• US secretary of state praises concessions by Israel • ' Israel can get away with anything , ' claims Arab League
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , sought to deflect the anger and disappointment of pro-western Arab states today after backing Israel 's position that it did not need to freeze settlement activity as a prelude to resuming peace talks with the Palestinians .
Clinton was due to meet foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia , Egypt and other key Arab states at a G8 conference in Morocco after brief talks in Jerusalem and Ramallah at the weekend .
In what appeared to be a significant policy shift she publicly supported the position taken by Binyamin Netanyahu , Israel 's Likud prime minister , and even praised him for making " unprecedented " concessions .
Amid mounting concern that Barack Obama 's much - heralded engagement with the Middle East peace process is going nowhere fast , Arab leaders expressed their fury at Clinton 's endorsement of Israel 's argument that it is not required to halt settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , as the administration had previously demanded .
The Palestinian Authority , Jordan and Egypt all protested .
Speaking in Marrakech she qualifed her remarks to say that Netanyahu 's offer of " restraint " on settlements fell short of US expectations but would still have a " significant and meaningful effect " on limiting the growth of Jewish outposts on land the Palestinians want for their own state .
But she clearly faced an uphill struggle in convincing Arab states that Washington has not changed tack in favour of Israel .
Earlier today Amr Moussa , the secretary general of the Arab League , said : " I am telling you that all of us , including Saudi Arabia , including Egypt , are deeply disappointed … with the results , with the fact that Israel can get away with anything without any firm stand that this cannot be done . "
Moussa had previously refused to say that he was disappointed with Obama , but he warned : " I am really afraid that we are about to see a failure . "
Under the 2003 " road map " Israel is required to freeze all settlement activity , a position initially supported by Obama .
Netanyahu's offer of " restraint " is coupled with an insistence on enabling " normal life " for 500,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
Israel refuses to treat the eastern half of the city , which it annexed immediately after its 1967 victory , as occupied territory , arguing that it is exempt from a freeze .
Ghassan al - Khatib , the head of the Palestinian government 's press office , said : " From our point of view and from the point of view of international law , and according to the road map , Israel has to first to stop the expansion of settlements in order to contribute to preparing the ground for meaningful peace negotiations . "
There were harsher comments from Nabil Abu Rudeineh , spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas : " The negotiations are in a state of paralysis , and the result of Israel 's intransigence and America 's backpedalling is that there is no hope of negotiations on the horizon . "
Abbas , the leader of the western - backed Fatah movement , is under heavy domestic pressure in advance of Palestinian elections due at the beginning of 2010 and sensitive to criticism from the Islamists of Hamas who control the Gaza Strip .
Israelis on the left joined in criticism of Clinton 's remarks .
" The secretary of state , I assume with the full support of the president , has turned around after 10 months of negotiating the precondition of freezing settlements , " said Akiva Eldar in the Haaretz newspaper .
Clinton is in Marrakech for the Forum for the Future , which joins civil society groups and the private sector with foreign ministers from the G8 and the Middle East to talk about democracy and conflict resolution .
Morocco is co-hosting the forum with Italy , which holds the G8 presidency .
Continuing waves of mass police operations in down town Athens set the pace for new era of repression in Greece
Everyone thought it was just a show of power - but it proved to be the Socialist government 's plan for " change " after 5 years of brutal right wing rule .
The police invasion of Exarcheia , the Athens alternative - radical hub , on the early hours of Friday 9 October was evaluated by most journalists , activists and veteran politicians as a power - show of the new government , in response to a limited solidarity attack against banks in the area just out of Exarcheia earlier the same day .
Minister of Public Order Mr Chrisochoidis , the notorious anti-terrorist mastermind of the last Pasok administration , appeared to many as just typically determined to show who is the new boss .
But the continuing waves of police invasion ( 3 by Friday 19:00 pm ) into an area which is commonly acknowledged as the most vibrant intellectual , student and political hub of the country , with hundreds of people stopped and checked , many manifold times in the same day , shops stormed , and locals humiliated by being made to kneel on the pavement and body - searched , has come to prove the new government 's self - professed " antiauthoritarianism " a bitter joke .
Pasok , the Panhellenic Socialist Movement , now in power has a long record of police brutality .
In its first 8 years of rule , the " democratisation of the police " was revealed as a sham with the execution of 15 year old anarchist Michalis Kaltezas in November 17 1985 during the usual protest marches commemorating the 1973 Polytechnic uprising .
The identification of Pasok with police rule at the time was reflected in a popular slogan about the chief of the Athens police : " Change cannot happen without Arkoudeas ; he is not a man , he is an idea ! " .
In the second round of Pasok rule from 1993 to 2004 , the Socialists gave away any remaining scruples by ordering the evacuation of the Polytechnic on November 17 1995 , breaking for the first time the academic asylumtime since the student massacre of 1973 , with 500 people arrested .
Also under the 1990s Pasok administration the Golden Dawn , the infamous neo -nazi organisation of thugs , was allowed to form a paramilitary unit and participate in the Serbian sacking of Srebrenica , and the consequent massacre of thousands of muslims .
The new Pasok administration under Papandreou the third ( son of Andreas Papandreou , founder of Pasok , and grandson of George Papandreou , the PM who led the British tanks against the people of Athens in December 1944 ) has assumed an antiauthoritarian gloss of postmodern proportions .
The PM has called his government " antiauthoritarians in power " whereas Mr Chrisochoidis has gone public today saying that he is good friend with many anarchists and agrees on many things with them - pointing out that he is against vandals not political groups .
Mr Chrisochoidis also claimed that from now on no police violence will be tolerated and any cop who brutalises citizens or has connections with the Golden Dawn will be immediately sacked .
These official announcements have received great media coverage but also the scorn of people whose memory is not too short to remember Mr Chrisochoidis 's 2002 chemical torture of Savas Xiros , the first arrested member of the urban guerrilla group November 17 .
Word came from the Oilers yesterday that Ales Hemsky has a torn labrum and is going to be undergoing surgery on his shoulder and will miss five to six months which means he should be back in time for the playoffs .
Sorry .
Black humour .
The straw that broke the camel 's back was a hit by Michal Handzus in the game a couple of nights ago against Los Angeles but both Ales Hemsky and Steve Tambellini made it clear that the problem had been ongoing and the problem needed to be fixed regardless .
The general mood around the team is that this is it , the Oilers are done and heading for the lottery .
After all , Hemsky really is capable of playing tough minutes to a draw or better more often than not , he 's the team 's best offensive player and the key cog on the power play .
Saying the impact will be " big " seems like an understatement .
In order to get a better idea of what impact this injury might have on the team going forward I decided to use a method called " With of Without You " which will look at the team 's goal differential when Hemsky has been in the lineup and when Hemsky has been out of the lineup over the last four seasons .
I would have preferred to use shots on goal with the score tied but did n't have the data at hand .
The results after the jump .
I was introduced to this method by a Gabe Desjardins article on Saku Koivu and he was introduced to the method by Tom Tango ( who used the method in his work on baseball ) .
Thanks very much to both of them .
Anyway , back to Hemsky .
These results are for the 2006 - 07 season through the 2008 - 09 season so far .
I decided not to use data from the 2005 - 06 season because ( 1 ) Hemsky played in 81 of the games that year and ( 2 ) that team was significantly better than the teams that followed it and I thought including that season would unfairly juice Hemsky 's numbers .
The analysis would be helped with a few more games of Hemsky out of the lineup but , as an Oiler fan , I 'm not about to get too upset at Hemsky for being too durable .
All of the goal differential numbers do not include shootout goals .
So here 's the data :
When I first looked at the " With Hemsky " numbers I was shocked at how bad they were .
I was then heartened somewhat after looking at the " Without Hemsky " numbers .
It 's not Hemsky that 's bad , it 's the Oilers !
It turns out that without Hemsky in the lineup both teams score less .
In the case of the opposition , they score a bit less while the Oilers score a lot less .
This was n't true to form yesterday but it seems that for the rest of the year Oiler fans can look forward to lower - scoring hockey games .
Whetever few voices of sanity remain , as every " expert " merely touts their book into the biggest bear market rally in history , need prominence .
TrimTabs ' Charles Biderman is among them .
In this most recent Bloomberg interview , Biderman takes on what amounts to inaccurate data releases by the BLS and BEA , and tries to make some sense out of them .
Biderman 's punchline : " Gravity usually works at some point . "
The only question is when .
Jazzed by the sense that the tide is finally turning their way , more than a thousand people interested in changing drug policies flooded into Albuquerque , New Mexico , last weekend for the 2009 International Drug Policy Reform Conference , hosted by the Drug Policy Alliance .
Police officers in suits mingled with aging hippies , politicians met with harm reductionists , research scientists chatted with attorneys , former prisoners huddled with state legislators , and marijuana legalizers mingled with drug treatment professionals -- all united by the belief that drug prohibition is a failed policy .

As DPA 's Ethan Nadelmann said before and repeated at the conference 's opening session : " We are the people who love drugs , we are the people who hate drugs , we are the people that do n't care about drugs , " but who do care about the Constitution and social justice .
" The wind is at our backs , " Nadelmann chortled , echoing and amplifying the sense of progress and optimism that pervaded the conference like never before .
For three days , conference - goers attended a veritable plethora of panels and breakout sessions , with topics ranging from the drug war in Mexico and South America to research on psychedelics , from implementing harm reduction policies in rural areas to legalizing marijuana , from how to organize for drug reform to what sort of treatment works , and from medical marijuana to prescription heroin .
It was almost too much .
At any given moment , several fascinating panels were going on , ensuring that at least some of them would be missed even by the most interested .
The Thursday afternoon time bloc , for example , had six panels : " Medical Marijuana Production and Distribution Systems , " " After Vienna : Prospects for UN and International Reform , " " Innovative Approaches to Sentencing Reform , " " Examining Gender in Drug Policy Reform , " " Artistic Interventions for Gang Involved Youth , " and " The Message is the Medium : Communications and Outreach Without Borders . "
The choices were n't any easier at the Friday morning breakout session , with panels including " Marijuana Messaging that Works , " " Fundraising in a Tough Economy , " " Congress , President Obama , and the Drug Czar , " " Zoned Out " ( about " drug - free zones " ) , " Psychedelic Research : Neuroscience and Ethnobotanical Roots , " " Opioid Overdose Prevention Workshop , " and " Border Perspectives : Alternatives to the 40 - Year - Old War on Drugs . "
People came from all over the United States -- predominantly from the East Coast -- as well as South Africa , Australia , Canada , Europe ( Denmark , England , France , Hungary , the Netherlands , Poland , Portugal , Scotland , and Switzerland ) , Latin America ( Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , and Mexico ) , and Asia ( Cambodia and Thailand ) .
Medical marijuana was one of the hot topics , and New Mexico , which has just authorized four dispensaries , was held up as a model by some panelists .
" If we had a system as clear as New Mexico's , we'd be in great shape , " said Alex Kreit , chair of a San Diego task force charged with developing regulations for dispensaries there .
" Our process has been deliberate , which you can also read as ' slow , ' " responded Steve Jenison , medical director of the state Department of Health 's Infectious Disease Bureau .
" But our process will be a very sustainable one .
We build a lot of consensus before we do anything . "
Jenison added that the New Mexico , which relies on state - regulated dispensaries , was less likely to result in diversion than more open models , such as California's .
" A not - for - profit being regulated by the state would be less likely to be a source of diversion to the illicit market , " Jenison said .
For ACLU Drug Policy Law Project attorney Allen Hopper , such tight regulation has an added benefit : it is less likely to excite the ire of the feds .
" The greater the degree of state involvement , the more the federal government is going to leave the state alone , " Hopper said .
At Friday 's plenary session , " Global Drug Prohibition : Costs , Consequences and Alternatives , " Australia 's Dr. Alex Wodak amused the audience by likening the drug war to " political Viagra " in that it " increases potency in elections . "
But he also made the more serious point that the US has exported its failed drug policy around the world , with deleterious consequences , especially for producer or transit states like Afghanistan , Bolivia , Colombia , Mexico , and Peru .
At that same session , former Mexican foreign minister Jorge Castaneda warned that Latin American countries feel constrained from making drug policy reforms because of the glowering presence of the US .
Drug reform is a " radioactive " political issue , he said , in explaining why it is either elder statesmen , such as former Brazilian President Cardoso or people like himself , " with no political future , " who raise the issue .
At a panel the following day , Castaneda made news by bluntly accusing the Mexican army of executing drug traffickers without trial .
( See related story here ) .
It was n't all listening to panels .
In the basement of the Albuquerque Convention Center , dozens of vendors showed off their wares , made their sales , and distributed their materials as attendees wandered through between sessions .
And for many attendees , it was as much a reunion as a conference , with many informal small group huddles taking place at the center and in local bars and restaurants and nearby hotels so activists could swap experiences and strategies and just say hello again .
The conference also saw at least two premieres .
On the first day of the conference , reporters and other interested parties repaired to a Convention Center conference room to see the US unveiling of the British Transform Drug Policy Foundation publication , After the War on Drugs : A Blueprint for Legalization , a how - to manual on how to get to drug reform 's promised land .
Transform executive director Danny Kushlick was joined by Jack Cole of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , Sanho Tree of the Institute for Policy Studies , Deborah Small of Break the Chains , and DPA 's Nadelmann as he laid out the case for moving beyond " what would it look like . "
" There 's never been a clear vision of a post - prohibition world , " said Kushlick .
" With this , we 've tried to reclaim drug policy from the drug warriors .
We want to make drug policy boring , " he said .
" We want not only harm reduction , but drama reduction , " he added , envisioning debates about restrictions on sales hours , zoning , and other dreary topics instead of bloody drug wars and mass incarceration .
" As a movement , we have failed to articulate the alternative , " said Tree .
" And that leaves us vulnerable to the fear of the unknown .
This report restores order to the anarchy .
Prohibition means we have given up on regulating drugs ; this report outlines some of the options for regulation . "
That was n't the only unveiling Thursday .
Later in the evening , Flex Your Rights held the first public showing of a near - final version of its new video , 10 Rules for Dealing with Police .
The screening of the self - explanatory successor to Flex Your Right 's 2003 " Busted " -- which enjoyed a larger budget and consequently higher production level -- played to a packed and enthusiastic house .
This highly useful examination of how not to get yourself busted is bound to equal if not exceed the break - out success of " Busted . " " 10 Rules " was one of a range of productions screened during a two - night conference film festival .
The conference ended Saturday evening with a plenary address by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson , who came out as a legalizer back in 2001 , and was welcomed with waves of applause before he ever opened his mouth .
" It makes no sense to spend the kind of money we spend as a society locking up people for using drugs and using the criminal justice system to solve the problem , " he said , throwing red meat to the crowd .
We 'll do it all again two years from now in Los Angeles .
See you there !
The instantaneous and shareable nature of the Internet is one of the things that separates it from other mediums .
Viral videos and Internet memes can take hold and spread quickly .
Thanks to social networking , the speed in which the latest phenomena can spread is lightning fast .
More and more frequently , Internet memes are making appearances in other more traditional media like TV and film .
With only two months left of 2009 , we thought we would look back at some of the biggest Internet memes of the year .
Most — if not all — of these memes have inspired spin -offs and secondary memes , and in the process , become a part of our Internet cultural history .
Did we miss any of your favorites ?
Let us know in the comments !
# 1 David After Dentist
One of the first big memes of 2009 was the YouTube video " David After Dentist . "
The story is exactly like it sounds .
Young David went to the dentist to get a tooth pulled and was treated with some pretty heavy sedatives .
Armed with a Flip Cam and a good sense of humor , David 's Dad decided to videotape the aftermath .
Watch here :
# 2 Susan Boyle
In April 2009 , 47 - year old Susan Boyle appeared on " Britain 's Got Talent " and mesmerized the audience ( and the judges ) with her jaw - droppingly awesome voice .
Once the video hit YouTube , the rest of the world took notice and a true phenomenon was born .
With an estimated 100 million views in the first few weeks , Boyle 's performance is one of the top Internet video phenomena of all time .
Sadly , we can't embed her fantastic debut performance from Les Miserables , but you can watch it here .
# 3 United Breaks Guitars
In 2008 , United Airlines broke Dave Carroll 's Taylor Guitar .
After battling with the airline for months and making no progress , Carroll decided to take action .
He wrote the song and shot the video " United Breaks Guitars " and released it on YouTube in mid 2009 .
The video earned more than 3 million views in just 10 days .
In August , Carroll released " United Breaks Guitars 2 , " but it failed to generate the same buzz as the original .
# 4 Three Wolf Moon T - Shirt
At the beginning of Summer 2009 , an interesting t- shirt appeared on Amazon.com .
Called " Three Wolf Moon , " the shirt featured an awesomely awful emblem of three wolves howling at the moon , the shirt garnered over - the - top reviews on Amazon.com , rating it as the best shirt ever and making outrageous claims about its power .
The shirt became a best - seller and the creators of the shirt are even shopping around a book based on the topic .
In an October episode of NBC's " The Office , " Dwight K. Schrute wears the shirt and ends up getting pretty lucky with the ladies .
# 5 Baby Dancing to Beyonce
This is one of our favorite memes of the year .
Featuring baby Cory from New Zealand ( then just 13 months old ) , this video became viral after the VMAs .
Little Cory dances to Beyonce 's " Single Ladies " with such a level of engrossment and with so much obvious enjoyment , how could it not be a huge hit ?
Watch :
#6 JK Wedding Dance
Jill and Kevin 's wedding dance is the rare Internet meme that has two waves of popularity .
When the video first hit the web in late July , the awesomely choreographed dance by the wedding party down the aisle during Jill and Kevin 's wedding became a huge hit , especially after being featured on the Today Show .
Then in October , NBC's " The Office " paid homage to the dance by re-creating it with cast members for Jim and Pam 's fictional TV wedding .
The result ?
The original video had a huge uptick in popularity ( probably aided by people who missed it the first time ) .
Another winner in this meme , embattled R&B star Chris Brown , who saw sales for his single " Forever " ( which is featured in both videos ) climb the charts after the video 's release .
# 7 Christian Bale ( Strong Language )
Even before February 2009 , there were rumors that all had not gone well on the set of " Terminator : Salvation . "
Then in February , someone leaked an audio recording of actor Christian Bale going off on a crew - member .
The audio took off online and in the mainstream press .
DJ RevoLucian created " Bale Out - RevoLucian 's Christian Bale Remix " from the audio and a NSFW meme within a meme was born .
Not to take anything away from Bale , but he still has nothing on David O. Russell ( link has very explicit language ) .
# 8 Balloon Boy
Two weeks ago , a helium filled weather balloon was launched in Colorado , supposedly with a 6 - year old boy trapped inside .
In under 24 - hours , the Internet went from shared bafflement , to fear for the boy 's safety , to relief that he was OK ( and hiding in a box the whole time ) , to questioning if the whole event was a hoax to full - blown Internet meme .
That 's breaking news to Internet in - joke in under 10 hours .
Amazing .
( Photo courtesy of ImaLetYouFinish.com )
A week later , the meme came full - Internet circle with the video " I 'm in a Box " ( a riff of " I 'm on a Boat " ) , which you can watch below ( note NSFW language ) :
# 9 Kanye West at the VMAs
We can all thank Kanye West for providing us so much endless entertainment .
After pulling an ODB and hijacking Taylor Swift 's acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs , a full - on meme was born .
The outburst gave MTV.com a record number of unique video views .
The barrage of parodies and jokes started almost instantaneously .
Even President Obama opined on Kanye 's behavior , calling him a " Jackass . "
We wo n't lie , we were a little obsessed with the Kanye - meme here at Mashable .
Unless something REALLY spectacular happens , this is sure to be the meme of 2009 .
If you missed the clip that started it all , watch it below :

So what did we miss ?
What memetastic event is your favorite ?
What do you think the next big meme will be about ( I 'd put money on puppies , kittens or babies — but that 's just me ) ?
Let us know !
[ _n3 o_ ] put together a nice external storage mod by fitting a 2.5 ″ drive into a broken Game Boy .
This mod fooled quite a few people because it appears that the device still plays games with the drive stuffed inside of it .
Sadly , this is not the case .
The reflective backing has been removed from the screen and replaced by a piece of paper with a graphic printed on it .
The LED from the hard drive was moved to the battery indicator for the Game Boy for added realism .
There is no build log for this project but [ _n3 o_ ] did give a short explanation of it in a forum post .
You can see two more pictures of the project after the break .
Update :
Take a look inside too !
The core driver of US prosperity has disappeared and no one has noticed .
Growth has been the central driver of the American economy ever since early settlers built up the East Coast and moved into the Appalachians ; by the middle of the nineteenth century , the California Gold Rush and the Transcontinental Railroad had finished the growth from coast to coast .
But it was much more than geographic growth .
The United States had become the world 's leading economy , a position it consolidated in the twentieth century as two World Wars devastated Europe .
Throughout this entire period , immigration helped to fuel expansion as new immigrants formed an economic underclass of unskilled laborers , acquired the skills to move into the middle class , and were replaced by still newer immigrants as growth continued .
Immigration became increasingly important for economic expansion in the United States ( and also in much of Europe ) as the native birthrate fell below the 2.1 % necessary for population replacement .
Growth continued into the twenty - first century , though the effects of economic globalization became increasingly evident : US companies systematically moved manufacturing operations overseas , while an emerging global market for intellectual work gradually drained many good - paying US jobs .
Then the bursting of the US housing bubble in 2008 brought first US and then global economic expansion to a screeching halt .
The housing bubble was caused by an artificial rise in house prices .
There was a parallel pressure on companies to expand , to grow their stock prices .
New companies were established and their values inflated as quickly as possible so that an Initial Public Offering would provide the founders a financial windfall without any real economic benefit .
For years , the cornerstone of many investment portfolios had been blue chip utility stocks , prized for their ability to provide steady income , year in and year out .
Turmoil in the utility markets and volatility in the overall markets replaced a reliance on steady income with a search for rapid capital gains .
So it was not only an overpriced housing market that collapsed but also an overpriced stock market .
The Dow Jones fell almost 50 % from May 2008 to March 2009 .
Economic stimulus actions have generally stabilized the economy ; growth is expected to be well over 2 % in 2010 , but one key indicator remains worryingly resistant to improvement : the jobless rate .
At the current growth rate , employment may not recover for a decade .
One underlying problem is that there is now a global competition for higher - paying jobs , so many of the jobs US workers lost will not come back .
More fundamentally , the US economy was a consumption economy and this was an underpinning of the entire global economy .
High unemployment and a new sense of economic wariness have significantly limited consumption , complicating the resurgence of not only the US economy but also the global economy .
US economic growth has depended on the continuing growth of the service sector .
Immigrants supplied the manpower necessary for this continuing growth , but now much of the growth of the service sector has moved overseas .
There are still many menial and unskilled jobs , but jobless skilled workers are very reluctant to take them - for good reason .
They do not provide a real living wage .
Immigrants still take them , even though they are becoming more difficult to find .
More importantly , they are no longer a stepping stone to a middle class life .
Instead , unskilled immigrants face being part of a permanent underclass .
They are no longer needed as a source of new semi-skilled and service workers because such workers are already in excess .
The artificial concentration of good paying jobs in the industrialized world in general and the United States in particular is gone .
The global leveling of the job field is also resulting in the global leveling of the population field : higher birth rates provide more mouths to feed without providing the employment opportunities to support them .
Now it is clear that lower birth rates are a prerequisite for increasing national wealth .
Global population dynamics have shifted dramatically .
Almost half the world is now below the replacement fertility rate - this applies to some 70 countries , including most of the industrialized world .
By 2020 , the global fertility rate will be below the replacement level ; world population will level off by mid-century .
Now the nation works hard to re-gain the economic growth seen as essential to prosperity .
The entire world looks for renewed US expansion to fuel renewed US consumption and thus renewed global expansion .
But this is not going to happen .
The key question is not how to maintain growth when the population stagnates , but rather how to maintain prosperity with a stable population .
The challenge is not how to re-ignite growth , but of how to maintain a high standard of living without it , how to create a more efficient society that , like the blue chip stocks of old , can continue on indefinitely with modest but steady profit .
A steady economy can still be a dynamic one , as companies put more emphasis on efficient and profitable operations rather then on steady growth .
Of course , some companies will inevitably grow and others decline .
Economies of scale will drive some size increase , though rising transportation costs ( both for fuels and driver wages ) will counter this to some extent .
But the economy as a whole needs to stabilize , to accept that growth will no longer be the core driver of prosperity .
Growth is gone .
Prosperity will now depend on constructing a viable steady state state .

Misidentified 2C - B-fly has contributed to at least two deaths and several hospitalizations in early October 2009 .
Because of the immediate nature of this issue , please be sure to pass this information to anyone who may come into contact with 2C - B - fly .
One confirmed death occurred in Denmark , another in San Jose , California .
Both followed the use of material sold as 2C - B - fly , acquired from the research chemical reseller Haupt - RC , but manufactured in China .
Both deaths and some hospitalizations were reportedly caused by a batch identified as " b1 " on the label .
Another U.S. death related to material purchased from a different reseller has been reported but not yet confirmed .
Based on details about the confirmed deaths and hospitalizations , especially dosage and duration , it was speculated that this material may be bromo - dragonfly , which is rough ten times more potent and has a longer duration .
An Erowid Center - sponsored analysis conducted in the U.S. also verified the material was bromo - dragonfly .
On October 3 , 2009 , Brian Sullivan died in California after ingesting 9 mg of purported 2C - B - fly .
His brother John and John 's girlfriend Lindsey were also present and also ingested the same material , John 10 mg and Lindsey 4 mg .
Brian was 18 years old and weighed 175 lbs .
He was not on any medication that his family was aware of , although he did have preexisting health problems .
According to his brother : Brian began having a difficult trip at two hours after ingestion .
At three and a half hours after ingestion he began having what appeared to be seizures but could have been strokes or a heart attack , or a combination of those .
911 was called and CPR was performed .
He died approximately four hours after ingestion .
John , who had taken 10 mg , experienced " intense gastrointestinal disturbances " and was still experiencing effects at 30 hours after ingestion .
He and Lindsey both reported extremely strong experiences and were both taken to the hospital in restraints after the paramedics / police arrived .
The material was ordered from Haupt - RC on September 29th and was received on October 3rd .
It has confirmed been that the material 's label included " b1 " on it .
This information has been provided to Erowid by another brother who was present during the event .
John 's girlfriend Lindsey submitted an experience report describing the incident A 23 - year - old man admitted himself to the hospital on October 10 , following increasingly strong effects from material ordered from Haupt - RC ( material 's packaging matched the one pictured above ) .
Experience report describing the incident On Friday Oct 9 , the Spanish harm reduction group Energy Control received a " 2C - B- fly " sample , which they analyzed using thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) .
A photo on the right ( click for full size ) shows the test TLC plate for the sample and several reference chemicals , singly and mixed , with Marquis reagent coloring .
The results suggested that the Haupt - RC sample ( " Sample " in the image ) could be bromo - dragonfly with another substance .
Analysis of the sample via GC / MS confirmed the TLC results and strongly indicated bromo - dragonfly along with several synthesis impurities .
( click image below , right for full size ) .
The sample , a " really thin " powder , came from someone in Spain who had acquired " 2C - B- fly " from Haupt - RC ( the product label included " b1 " on it ) .
After hearing about the Danish death related to this material , he preferred to wait for it to be analyzed by Energy Control before ingesting it .
A sample of " b1 " Haupt Research material represented as 2C - B - fly was tested by Drug Detection Laboratories via GC / MS on Oct 15 , 2009 on behalf of Erowid Center .
This material was Bromo - dragonfly , confirming the Energy Control results .
People who choose to use 2C - B - fly , or any research chemical , should becareful and should have a sober sitter present .
Please read the Research Chemical FAQ and be aware of the risks you are taking .
If you have experienced any side effects , health complications , or lasting effects from 2C - B - fly use , please submit them to our Experience Vaults ( while it is not required , including your email address permits Erowid to contact you privately with follow - up questions ) .
If you have personal , verifiable knowledge of a related death or hospitalization , please consider emailing sage at erowid.org with details .
Luis Armando Peña Soltren , accused of forcing Pan Am pilots to take him to Cuba , detained at JFK airport
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A man wanted for hijacking a plane leaving New York 40 years ago has been arrested after flying back there from Cuba .
Luis Armando Peña Soltren had remained a fugitive since the 24 November 1968 hijacking of a Pan Am flight bound for Puerto Rico .
The 66 - year - old was arrested at John F Kennedy international airport yesterday , authorities said .
Soltren is expected to be arraigned tomorrow in Manhattan .
" As the 1968 charges allege , he terrorised dozens of passengers when he and his cohorts wielded pistols and knives to hijack Pan American flight 281 , " said Preet Bharara , the US attorney for the district .
It was at JFK airport in 1968 that three men boarded the Pan Am flight and hijacked it , according to an indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan .
The flight , bound for San Juan , Puerto Rico , was diverted to Havana , Cuba .
Dozens of US flights were hijacked and diverted to Cuba in the 1960s by a mix of self - described radical leftists , fugitives seeking asylum on the Caribbean island and criminals scheming to extort money from the US government or airlines .
Court papers say Soltren and two others sneaked weapons and ammunition on to the flight in a nappy bag .
Two men , José Rafael Ríos Cruz and Miguel Castro , were arrested in the mid-1970s , and pleaded guilty .
A fourth man , described as a leader of the Puerto Rican Movement for Liberation , was accused of involvement but found not guilty .
Nowadays vampires are heart - throbs , monsters are neurotics , zombies are comic turns , serial killers are bores and aliens are cutie pies .
So what 's left to scare us ?
If the remarkable success of Paranormal Activity is anything to go by , the answer 's to be found in the spirit world .
We 're not talking about ghosts , who seem to have become almost as endearing as those other now threadbare bogeymen .
This film makes it clear that its own baleful spectre is no mere unquiet revenant , but a fully - fledged fiend .
Demons have an impressive record of delivering the spine - chilling goods .
Lots of people consider The Exorcist to be the most frightening film ever made .
However , like many other supernatural scarers , The Exorcist was able to tap into the residue of terror instilled in us over the centuries by the priestly guardians of our souls .
Paranormal Activity , on the other hand , has no truck with our Satanic heritage .
You might have expected its tormented protagonists to call in the Catholic church , what with that outfit 's unmatched expertise in onscreen exorcism .
This never occurs to them .
They , and the only qualified mentor they manage to summon up , maintain a ruthlessly secular attitude towards the unearthly peril confronting them .
So we 're dealing simply with a dislocated , disembodied entity defined and motivated solely by its own malevolence .
It does n't even try to be original .
Believe it or not , what seems universally considered to be the most terrifying big - screen apparition since 1973 relies on moving bunches of keys around work surfaces , opening doors which ought to be shut , switching lights on and off and even going bump in the night – literally .
Which raises a question : why is this thing so scary when so many of our other one - time hair - raisers have lost their moxie ?
The evidence points to an unsettling possibility – that we actually believe in poltergeists , in a way that we do n't believe in more physically tangible bogeymen .
About half of us seem prepared to tell pollsters that spirits do indeed exist , or at least might do .
But just try asking people who dismiss the idea as nonsense if they fancy playing with a Ouija board or spending the night in a supposedly haunted house .
Even those for whom alien abduction and mutant crustaceans hold no terrors can turn surprisingly chary .
Just why this should be the case in our supposedly sceptical age is far from clear .
Evolutionary theorists suggest that hypersensitivity to indeterminate threat may have helped our ancestors evade swift , guileful and deceptive predators .
All the same , we 've had plenty of time to get used to what are now readily available explanations for apparently paranormal experiences .
Perceptions do n't just reflect relays of environmental stimuli to networks of active brain cells .
Memory and emotion pollute the flow from an early stage .
Raw sensation is thus fighting a constant battle with internal inputs to shape cognitive awareness .
But many things can disrupt the balance between these two which prevails most of the time .
Sensory deprivation or overload , poisons , oxygen deprivation , hyperventilation , hypoglycemia , fever , pain , fasting , dehydration and social isolation can all trigger hallucinations .
So too , however , can less obvious influences .
A relationship has been established between the incidence of bereavement apparitions and global geomagnetic activity .
In the laboratory , the application of magnetic fields to the right hemisphere of the brain can evoke the sense that another being is present .
The whole point of the videotaping project in which Paranormal Activity 's hero engages is to get round such spoilsport information .
Sadly , convincing footage of ectoplasmic entities seems to turn up more often on cinema screens than on actual camcorder viewfinders .
Doubtless we 'll be seeing more of it .
Home video mocumentary spookery has indeed lighted upon a mysterious phenomenon .
The Blair Witch Project laid it bare , while Paranormal Activity was but an infant phantasm in a software programmer 's mind .
It 's that in this strange corner of movie - making , a tiny budget can generate wildly disproportionate box office revenues .
The big screen , we must therefore assume , will be further addling both hemispheres of a great many brains for a long while to come .

President Barack Obama is expected Friday to announce an end to the HIV Travel and Immigration Ban during a signing ceremony for the Ryan White HIV / AIDS Treatment Extension Act scheduled for 11:50 a.m. , according to a source at an agency that works closely with the Administration .
" My understanding was that this would be announced the same day as the Ryan White Act was signed into law , " said the source , who spoke to The Advocate on the condition of anonymity .
" The White House wanted to be out in front on this . "
The ban , first implemented in 1987 and codified into law by Congress in 1993 , prevented non-U.S. citizens who were HIV - positive from traveling or immigrating to the United States unless the Department of Homeland Security granted them a waiver .
Congress passed the policy reversal last summer under the
leadership of Sens. John Kerry ( D - MA ) and Gordon Smith ( R - OR ) and
Congresswoman Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) ; former President George W. Bush
signed it into law , but the Administration was unable to finalize the
change before his term ended .
The new regulation eliminates any travel and immigration restrictions that are tied to a person 's HIV status .
The Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) put the wheels of change in motion in late June by publishing the proposed regulation to the federal register , which triggered a 45 - day public comment period .
HHS has now sent the final change to the Office of Management and Budget for approval , but the source said HHS would not be able to fully implement the new regulation for another 60 days following the president 's announcement .
In the intervening months , the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has directed its officers to place holds on any decisions regarding green card applications that are based solely on an individual 's HIV status pending full implementation of the new rule .
Rachel B. Tiven , executive director of the LGBT lobby group Immigration Equality , welcomed the announcement .
“ At long last , people living with HIV will no longer be pointlessly barred from this country , ” Tiven said .
" Every day , Immigration Equality hears from individuals and families who have been separated because of the ban , with no benefit to the public health .
Now , those families can be reunited . "
Enactment of the Ryan White HIV / AIDS Treatment Extension
Act will fund critical HIV / AIDS treatment and some prevention programs through 2013 at about $ 2.5 billion annually , representing a 5 % increase for all sections of the act .
The program helps about 500,000 mostly low - income and uninsured people living with AIDS / HIV per year , according to the Government Accountability Office .
The Ryan White CARE
Act , named after an Indiana teenager who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion in 1984 , was originally passed in 1990 and has since been extended three times .
• New name will be used until the end of this season • Club admit naming rights plan was handled badly

Newcastle have confirmed that their stadium will be renamed " sportsdirect.com@StJames'ParkStadium " until the end of the season , according to BBC Newcastle .
The temporary rebranding follows a controversial announcement from the club 's under - pressure owner Mike Ashley that the ground 's naming rights would be offered to businesses in an attempt to raise funds .
The managing director Derek Llambias told the BBC : " We will showcase Sports Direct until the end of the season .
I 'm sure we 're going to get a sponsor in for next season . "
Llambias admitted that the way the plan to sell naming rights was put to fans could have been handled better , but said the decision was important for the club 's future .
" We could have worded it better , and that 's why we came out yesterday to explain what we 're trying to achieve , " he said .
" With the renaming it was always going to be whatever brand it was , at St James ' Park .
For the remainder of this season , we already have sportsdirect.com on the Gallowgate so we 'd like to take that branding through the rest of the stadium . "
Llambias said that any future naming deal would still include the phrase " @StJames ' Park " .
" In our reign , absolutely , it 's just adding to the name .
If this brings in a good chunk of money to the club , that goes straight to the team , so it 's a revenue we should look at . "
On June 8 , 1967 , US Navy intelligence ship USS Liberty was suddenly and brutally attacked on the high seas in international waters by the air and naval forces of Israel .
The Israeli forces attacked with full knowledge that this was an American ship and lied about it .
Survivors have been forbidden for 40 years to tell their story under oath to the American public .
This USS Liberty Memorial web site tells their story and is dedicated to the memory of the 34 brave men who died .
After surveilling USS Liberty for more than nine hours with almost hourly aircraft over flights and radar tracking , the air and naval forces of Israel attacked our ship in international waters without warning .
USS Liberty was identified as a US naval ship nine hours before the attack by Israeli reconnaissance aircraft and continuously tracked by Israeli radar and aircraft thereafter .
Sailing in international waters at less than five knots , with no offensive armament , our ship was not a military threat to anyone .
The Israeli forces attacked without warning and without attempting to contact us .
Thirty four Americans were killed in the attack and another 174 were wounded .
The ship , a $ 40 Million Dollar state of the art signals intelligence platform , was later declared unsalvageable and sold for scrap .
No one is completely sure when mankind started believing in the existence of ghosts .
It appears that many of concepts like the burials and funerals were early attempts to appease the spirits of the dead so they would n’t disturb the living .
1. Strange from the very beginning
This first known recorded true life accounts of ghosts were also two of the strangest .
Plutarch in the 1st century AD and Pliny in 50 AD detailed a couple of haunting spirits complete with chains , groans , and accusations of murder .
Plutarch told of a home in one community that so plagued the neighbors they shut up the dwelling , but Pliny had a longer tale .
He described a young scholar who agreed to take up residence in a home where a ghost was rumored to haunt .
The young man was a stalwart fellow who refused to be intimated by the dead .
He followed the chain rattling ghost about until he got the story of its murder out of it .
He dug under the floor where the ghost routinely ended its nightly ruminations and found a bony skeleton wrapped in chains proof of the story told by the ghostly presence .
Many people have remarked how similar Pliny ’s paranormal account is to modern day stories .

2. The Poor Sad Ghost of Catherine Howard
Some ghost stories are strange because they speak of a tragedy that never ends .
Some dead never find peace it seems and are doomed to experience their feelings of betrayal and terror in an endless loop forever .
The end for Catherine Howard really started right at the moment she seemed to be on the path to a bright new beginning .
Her uncle found her a place at Henry ’s court as the lady - waiting to the King ’s wife Queen Anne of Cleves .
Katherine was a beautiful , but poorly educated and not very bright a potential lethal combination at any court of that time .
She had already been molested by one of her few teachers and been the consort of an older man .
The best thing that could have happened to the young woman would have been to have been discovered by an up and coming young man looking for wife .
Unfortunately for Catherine it was the King ’s eye she caught instead .
Anne of Cleves was Henry ’s fourth and least favored wife .
The marriage was never consummate as the German born Anne was not attractive to the King .
The feeling was apparently mutual as Anne was terrified of provoking Henry ’s wrath and earning the same fate as Anne Boleyn .
Her family had the phrase “ God send me well to keep ” engraved around her wedding ring , and perhaps this worked for when the pretty Katherine arrived as her lady - in - waiting Anne was off the hook .
The writing was practically on the wall for Katherine as she was in fact the second cousin of Anne Boleyn the wife the King had behead for adultery among other charges , but the Boleyn family was happy to be back in the King ’s good graces once again as the romance heated up .
Anne of Cleves was offered an annulment which she took with good grace in public and no doubt with a sigh of relief in private .
This paved the way for the King ’s marriage to Katherine , but the situation was far different for this young woman than for her cousin .
While by all accounts Ann Boleyn and Henry had a passionate affair much time had passed since that union .
The King now was well passed stout and working on portly .
He had an ulcerated wound on his thigh that never completely healed and which often reeked .
It ’s possible that the annulment between Anne of Cleves and the King happened so quickly because Henry hoped Katherine was pregnant with his child , but that was never to be .
Repulsed by the King and without the smarts of predecessor Katherine not realizing her danger began an affair with Henry ’s favorite male courtier Thomas Culpeper .
She should have known better especially consider their meetings were arranged by Lady Rochford who was the widow of Anne Boleyn ’s brother George .
Blackmail started up against Katherine as the affair became known to many and she found herself having to find positions to appoint anyone to who might feel talkative .
It was n’t enough .
Catherine was accused , and while she felt the King ’s love for her and her youth would be enough to protect her she was very wrong .
Catherine was charged with treason and ordered to keep to her rooms .
She escaped the guards momentarily and fled down the hallway to the chapel where she knew the King was hearing Mass .
She screamed and cried for her husband so pitifully that almost everyone who heard her was moved to pity .
Almost all with the notable exception of the King , and the girl was stripped of her title and in the winter of 1541 both she and her lover were beheaded .
Their heads were placed on spikes atop the London Bridge and that should have been the end of it .
But the story does n’t end there .
Catherine ’s ghost has been seen repeatedly not at the sight of her execution , or hanging around the London Bridge looking for her lost head , but making that run for her life over and over .
She is seen as a young woman with long flowing hair still beautiful despite her obvious terror .
She runs screaming to the chapel and pleads with the King for forgiveness and mercy .
Just as he did all those generations ago Henry the Eighth remains unmoved by her plight .

3 . The house that haunted on command
Built in 1863 in the English village of Borley it seems to have been almost destined to be a haunted spot .
It was built on the site of a former monastery and such spots often hold surprising dark secrets .
The first sign of ghost trouble did n’t show up until around 1900 or so thorough and seemed to focus on more modern times .
The public found out about the Rectory from Harry Price and his Society for Psychical Research after they were called in to investigate .
For Price who was interested in getting the public interested in the scientific study of ghosts found a seemly endless number of stories to explore within the old Rectory .
According to legend when the spot had been a monastery a monk and a nun fell in love .
The young couple tried to elope , but they were caught .
The monk was hanged , but a worse fate was waiting for the nun .
She was bricked up alive and left to starve .
Her ghost was seen often and her spirit is the one Price believed was attempting to make contact .
According to accounts by Henry Price in his notes and later book on the subject she was the one who wailed , walked and wrote on the wall .
The Smith family who were living in the home at the time complained of smashed windows , furniture being moved , and the sound of bells ringing .
Eventually the strange goings on drove them from the rectory .
When the family of the Reverend Lionel Foyster moved in the weirdness continued and a flock of ghost hunters showed up to discover its secrets .
There were many séances through the years many featuring the spirit of a young woman who claimed to be the ghost of the nun .
Stranger still was yet to come when on one night in 1938 the ghost predicted the rectory would burn that very night .
It did n’t , but the building was destroyed by fire just over a year later .

4 . Ghosts get snapped
It makes sense that with the all the weirdness of ghostly goings on and with all the cameras folks have been lugging around for the past few generations that at least one person would get a convincing shot .
And someone did .
In the English town of Shropshire the Town Hall burned to the ground .
It was n’t the first time such a tragedy occurred in the area .
Long ago in 1677 fire had destroyed the wooden homes and buildings in the area when according to local legend a young girl named Jane Churm set fire to a thatched roof with a candle by accident .
Her ghost has been seen on many occasions in the area .
The Town Hall had been built in 1905 , so on that day in November of 1995 spectators watched in sadness as fire consumed the historic old building .
A local resident named Tony O’Rhailly snapped photos of the event and was surprised to find in one of the pictures a strange sight .
Framed in doorway of the burning building the figure of a little girl is plainly visible .

5 . Get your own
If you want your own ghost then according to many internet , television , and movie accounts the fastest way to get your own weird haunting is to get an Ouija Board .
Also known as a spirit board or talking board this is your very own gateway to scaring yourself silly .
The board was invented as a game by and sold by Parker Brothers , but thousands of people have claimed that whatever they called up using the device … decided to stay .
Do you have a story like that and interested to share it with people ?

Mauricio Fernández , miembro de una de las familias más ricas de México y político por vocación , abrió por la puerta de atrás un debate nacional que tiene a muchos alarmados .
El sábado pasado , al tomar posesión como alcalde del municipio San Pedro Garza García , en el estado norteño de Nuevo León , y considerado el más rico per cápita del país , reveló en su discurso que esa misma mañana , el miembro de uno de los cárteles de la droga más violentos que hace tiempo lo amenazó de muerte y era el principal secuestrador en esa zona , había sido ejecutado en la ciudad de México .
Como no había información pública sobre ese incidente sucedido a casi mil kilómetros de distancia , y Fernández había dicho en su mensaje político que enfrentaría al narcotráfico por encima de sus atribuciones , desató las especulaciones sobre si su mano estaba detrás de esa ejecución .
Fernández se sorprendió de que sus palabras se convirtieran en noticia de primera plana en los periódicos nacionales y que terminaran en las páginas de análisis .
Pero ¿qué podía esperar ?
Su revelación fue unas cuatro horas antes que siquiera se descubrieran los cadáveres , y con seis de antelación a que las autoridades identificaran los cuerpos .
La realidad estaba construida , en el contexto de la guerra contra el narcotráfico que tiene dividido al país .
La percepción es que el gobierno va perdiendo la guerra contra los cárteles de la droga por la espiral de violencia desatada a partir de que empezó su cruzada contra el narcotráfico .
El gobierno dice que la violencia tiene que ver , precisamente , con el éxito de su campaña contra los delincuentes .
Pero la sociedad se siente insegura y amenazada , y sus representantes más poderosos , como los empresarios , han venido dando muestras de hastío con el presidente Felipe Calderón y de creciente insatisfacción por la forma como está resolviendo el problema del narcotráfico .
La relación mecánica que se hizo en los medios de la revelación de Fernández y la ejecución de su enemigo no es , sin embargo , algo tomado a la ligera .
Desde el año pasado los grupos empresariales del país han venido discutiendo la posibilidad de armar sus propios ejércitos de la noche para enfrentar a los narcotraficantes , pues consideran que el Ejército Mexicano y las policías federales , no están pudiendo con ellos .
En una reunión privada que sostuvo Calderón con empresarios de Ciudad Juárez , la ciudad norte ña en el estado de Chihuahua que todos los días rompe su propio récord de ejecuciones , recibieron como respuesta a sus preocupaciones que si las cosas estaban mal , peores se iban a poner , y que hicieran como empresarios de otros estados , que estaban contratando escoltas y el gobierno les otorgaba permisos de portación de armas .
Los empresarios de Juárez se quedaron indignados .
La razón de la existencia de los gobiernos es proveer , precisamente , seguridad a sus ciudadanos .
Los mexicanos no sienten que el gobierno de Calderón esté cumpliendo con esa responsabilidad primaria , sin aceptar el discurso oficial de que poco más del 92 % de quienes han muerto están relacionados con el narcotráfico .
El país está en guerra , declarada por el gobierno , pero el gobierno se queja de que la guerra no está por todo el país .
Tiene razón , pero está equivocado .
La guerra nunca toca en forma clara el nervio central de un gobierno hasta que la pierde o está en camino de perderla .
Pero la guerra sí se ve en muchas otras ciudades importantes del país , que es el reclamo permanente de los empresarios , como los de Ciudad Juárez .
El desencuentro que hubo en aquella ciudad fronteriza con Estados Unidos , tuvo consecuencias colaterales .
A través de mensajes en Internet , un llamado Comando Ciudadano de Juárez convocó a los ciudadanos a formar un grupo armado y a asesinar cada 24 horas a un delincuente .
En enero apareció en las calles de esa ciudad un ejecutado que colocado un mensaje sobre el cuerpo que decía : " Esto es para quien continúe extorsionando " .
En junio , aunque por breve tiempo , estuvo en YouTube un video donde otro grupo , Empresarios Unidos - Escuadrón de la Muerte , incitaba a asesinar a delincuentes .
La justicia por propia mano .
Vigilantes , al mejor estilo de la impotencia ciudadana , como en estos días los medios sugieren que hizo Fernández .
Pero el alcalde de San Pedro Garza García está lejos de ser un hombre aislado del imaginario empresarial .
Hace algunos meses , otro grupo de empresarios , entre los cuales se encontraban algunos de los más ricos de México y el mundo , debatieron la posibilidad de contratar comandos extranjeros para cuidar sus intereses y empezar a actuar contra el narcotráfico en sus mismos términos y condiciones .
Los empresarios no sienten , como muchos mexicanos , que el gobierno esté haciendo lo mejor para resolver el problema de la delincuencia .
Algunas empresas tras evaluar el costo- beneficio de pagar extorsión a un cártel de drogas o incrementar sustancialmente la protección en sus rutas de distribución y comercialización , están pagando una cuota mensual a los narcotraficantes .
Algunos grandes consorcios se negaron a hacerlo y contrataron seguridad adicional , con lo cual sus costos se han elevado de manera significativa .
La impotencia es un sentir que cada vez se extiende más entre un mayor número de grupos sociales .
Las críticas a la forma como el gobierno encauzó su guerra contra el narcotráfico van ganando nuevos adeptos .
Entre los más visibles ya no están los estudiosos o los intelectuales que escriben en los periódicos , sino el propio ex presidente Vicente Fox y sus antiguos colaboradores , que pertenecen al mismo partido que Calderón , quienes son los primeros agoreros del desastre de la estrategia del gobierno .
Menos visibles son los empresarios , pero a la vez los únicos que están en condiciones de armar sus propios ejércitos y salir a la calle a matar narcotraficantes .
No hay evidencias sólidas de que esto ya esté sucediendo .
Las declaraciones de Fernández , que pertenece a una de las familias más ricas de México , tampoco prueban nada , cuando menos hasta ahora .
Pero de que hay muchas ganas de hacerlo , las hay .
They called it " the Barking cough " .
First it began like any other : a tickle in the chest and slight pain on breathing .
Then , within a matter of months , the sufferer was in agony , gasping for air and eventually suffocating to death as a vicious cancer attacked their lungs waiting for the final lingering , inevitable end which might not come for decades .
The legacy of the Cape Asbestos factory in Barking , east London , where asbestos - related cancers continue to kill scores of residents , is a deadly one .
Hundreds of people have died since the factory closed in 1968 .
The story of Barking 's " industrial killing machine " is a story repeated up and down the country where thousands of Britons continue to be blighted by their industrial past .
Exposure to asbestos is now the biggest killer in the British workforce , killing about 4,000 people every year – more than who die in traffic accidents .
The shocking figures are the grim legacy of the millions of tons of the dust shipped to Britain to make homes , schools , factories and offices fire resistant .
It was used in products from household fabrics to hairdryers .

Those most at risk are ordinary workers and their families .
Whether it was dockyard workers who unloaded the lethal cargoes , or those in the factories exposed to the fibres , or the carpenters , laggers , plumbers , electricians and shipyard workers who routinely used asbestos for insulation – all suffered .
So did the wives who washed the work overalls and the children who hugged their parents or played in the dust - coated streets .
The exposure to asbestos in Britain is largely historical but the death toll is alarmingly etched on our future .
Asbestos fibres can lie dormant on victims ' lungs for up to half a century ; deaths from asbestos in Britain will continue to rise until 2016 .
Nor is it confined to Britain .
The World Health Organisation says asbestos currently kills at least 90,000 workers every year .
One report estimated the asbestos cancer epidemic could claim anywhere between five and 10 million lives before it is banned worldwide and exposure ceases .
Asbestos was hailed as the " magic mineral " when its tough , flexible but fire - resistant qualities were realised , but for more than a century doctors and others have been warning of its dangers .
Asbestos dust was being inhaled into the lungs where it could lie unnoticed before causing crippling illnesses such lung cancer , asbestosis and mesothelioma which one medical professor has described as " perhaps the most terrible cancer known , in which the decline is the most cruel " .
For people such as those in Barking who have seen their neighbours , relatives and friends suffer this excruciatingly painful and distressing death , there can be little consolation when they discover the first signs of asbestos exposure on their own lungs .
These scars , known as pleural plaques , can be a warning that they too may develop one of the fatal cancers that inhaling the lethal fibres can result in .
On Wednesday , a meeting between MPs and government lawyers will determine if people suffering from pleural plaques can be paid the compensation that many believe they deserve .
For 21 years , sufferers of pleural plaques were compensated by their employers for the scars caused by exposure to the deadly fibres , but in 2007 this was overturned by a Law Lords ruling .
Politicians and medical experts accuse the Government of pandering to the insurance lobby and claim they are now ignoring crucial new medical evidence which reveals the physical and mental toll of pleural plaques .
In Dagenham Working Men 's club , up the road from the site of the Cape asbestos factory , members of the local GMB laggers ' branch gather for a beer to discuss the one deadly issue that continues to plague their members : asbestos .
Jimmy Parrish , branch chairman , has a list of 67 of their 300 or so members affected by asbestos - related disease since 1998 .
Many of them were diagnosed with pleural plaques and 30 are now dead .
" Hitler killed only one of my uncles , " said Parrish .
" Cape killed the rest . "

Jon Cruddas , MP for Dagenham , said the lack of compensation for pleural plaques sufferers was scandalous .
" If that amount of death occurred in any other profession it would be a national scandal , " he said .
" It 's a working - class disease and it does n't get the attention it should do : it 's a life sentence .
You 've got to think about the corporate interests of insurance companies and compare that with a lagger .
There 's no equivalent in the power game here .
The insurance industry says there 's no link between pleural plaques and fatal forms of asbestos disease , but figures from the GMB suggest otherwise .
" It 's extraordinary what 's going on in our area .
It 's an epidemic .
There 's barely a family that does n't have some experience of asbestos - related disease and it's going to get worse ; it 's not even at its peak yet . "
The Barking and Dagenham Asbestos Support Group describes the Cape factory at Barking as an " industrial killing machine " .
Between 1981 and 2005 , the number of men dying from the asbestos cancer mesothelioma in Barking reached 187 , making it the worst area of London for asbestos - related disease and in the top 10 for the UK .
It was not just workmen who suffered .
Barking has the highest rate of mesothelioma for women in the country , with 60 women dying from the disease between 1981 and 2005 .
But these official figures are just the start .
Since asbestos can lie dormant for up to 50 years , many people have long since left the area .
Geoffrey Tweedale , an asbestos industry expert , said : " No one knows the death toll , but it 's possibly in the thousands .
Cape never had to release their records . "
Although there were other sources of exposure in the area , Cape 's processing of the fibres was on a different scale .
The factory employed more than 10,000 people from the time it opened in 1913 to its closure in 1968 .
Cape insisted asbestos was harmless even after the factory in Barking closed .
Richard Gaze , former chief scientist for Cape Asbestos , defended its record throughout the 1970s until he died of mesothelioma himself , aged 65 , in 1982 .
Workers were told that drinking half a pint of milk would prevent illness and were left to toil in the thick dust with no masks .
Dust from the building spewed on to the streets from giant fans , leaving cotton wool - like wisps to settle on the streets .
The streets " looked like Christmas " , residents recall .
Children in Northbury School , which was adjacent to the factory , used to gather up this " snow " and throw it at each other .
Peter Williams of Field Fisher Waterhouse , solicitors specialising in asbestos disease , said , " I think Cape would have known that asbestos was highly dangerous .
From the people we 've spoken to that worked in the factory and lived in the surrounding area , no precautions were taken and no one from Cape ever mentioned it was dangerous . "
Today , the Hart 's Lane estate lies where the factory used to be .
The only visible sign of its industrial past is a road name – Cape Close – but the legacy has lasted far longer than anyone might have guessed .
Successive tests between 1997 and 2003 found asbestos dangerously near the surface in the soil of the estate .
Rita Ashdown , who died from mesothelioma in 2002 , was among the first to perish .
She insisted her exposure was from the 13 years she lived on the estate .
The council 's insurers paid her £ 40,000 compensation but denied responsibility .
Now Dennis Gaffney is dying from the same disease and believes he too was exposed after spending time on the estate in the 1970s .
A spokesman for Barking and Dagenham council said it had commissioned " extensive independent experts ' studies " of the Hart 's Lane estate , most recently in 2006 .
" The studies concluded that any risk to the health of the estate 's residents or visitors from asbestos is insignificant , " he said .
On Wednesday MPs and others will meet government lawyers to press for the controversial 2007 Lords decision on plaques to be challenged .
Andrew Dismore MP , who is attempting for a second time to get a bill through the House of Lords which would challenge the decision , said : " It 's a manifest injustice .
The law treats psychological injury differently from physical injury .
The insurers are obviously trying to minimise their loss and the Government also has a potential liability for some of these cases .
Come what may this issue has to be resolved . "
Those with pleural plaques are 1,000 times more likely to suffer from an asbestos - related cancer than the rest of the population , but a government - commissioned report which has been used to justify the continued lack of compensation for sufferers said that the risk of pleural plaques sufferers contracting lung cancer was " very small " .
Dr Robin Rudd , the country 's leading expert on asbestos - related disease , said the report had disregarded the latest evidence .
" It 's not a medical question , " said Dr Rudd .
" Jack Straw is just using medical evidence as a smoke screen .
The report missed the last 10 years of medical evidence . "
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said the House of Lords decision had raised " extremely complex and difficult issues which have required very careful consideration within Government " .
She added that the issues were still being actively considered " in order to be in a position to publish a final response as soon as possible " .
Cape claimed it was unaware of the dangers , but as early as 1898 , the chief inspector of factories in the UK reported that asbestos had " easily demonstrated " health risks .
In Barking itself , alarm bells sounded in 1929 when the medical officer of health wrote in his annual report : " Many people in Barking are suffering from diseases of the lungs due to the inhalation of asbestos dust . "
By 1945 , the medical officer wrote that asbestos was a " deadly and dangerous commodity " that should probably be banned .
A company spokesman said , " Cape has taken a very responsible approach to dealing with this issue , establishing an independent fund over two and a half years ago for the benefit of all claimants .
The scheme covers all types of disease , paying compensation to claimants where due . "
It was the ill - health of those living near the Barking factory that precipitated a nationwide shift in attitudes to using asbestos .
A 1965 report showed that there had been a spate of mesothelioma cases among residents living near the Cape factory .
The factory closed three years later , but its legacy will continue to be marked by graves .
Asbestos : Case studies ...
The man exposed from visits to the estate ( after the factory was gone )
Dennis Gaffney , 84 , is dying from mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos on the Hart 's Lane estate which was built on the site of the old Cape factory .
In the early 1970s , Dennis used to drive his wife Lily to see her mother , Lizzie Potter , four times a week after work .
Mrs Potter had just moved into a brand new house built on the estate where the factory had been .
Building work was still going on at the time and Dennis used to wait outside in his car with the windows down while his wife chatted to her mother .
" I had a new car and I did n't want to get involved in women 's talk , so I thought I 'd leave them to it , " explains Mr Gaffney .
Sometimes when he got bored he would walk around and watch what was going on with the builders .
It is now known that asbestos was not properly removed from the ground after the factory was shut down , but as Mr Gaffney wandered around the building site he had no idea of this .
" There must have been dust in the air because there was no other time I could have been exposed to asbestos , " said Mr Gaffney , who used to work in marketing .
" I 've had a biopsy and I 'm still uncomfortable on my chest , but they just tell me to keep taking paracetamol . "
The school boy whose ' snowball ' fights in the yard killed him
George Dickerson used to have " snowball " fights with the thick white dust that gathered in the sports fields of Northbury Infant School he had no idea that his game would prove deadly .
George , who spent his working life helping adults with learning difficulties , died from mesothelioma in 2006 aged 76 because his schoolyard was always showered in asbestos dust from the adjacent factory .
His daughter Jane said : " He used to tell us about huge extractor fans that churned chunks of asbestos dust on to the lane that led to the school sports field .
They used to collect it and bash it all together for snowball fights .
As soon as he was diagnosed he knew it was from playing in it as a child .
He was angry that nothing was done to protect local residents . "
The wife killed by her husband 's overalls ( and the family destroyed by dust )
Jacqueline Merritt spent years washing her husband Don 's overalls and shaking the dust off them .
Don had worked for Cape and his clothes were covered in asbestos .
In 2004 , she died from mesothelioma , aged 60 , and now her husband Don has pleural plaques on his lungs and worries he 'll go the same way .
Not only did he lose his wife to the deadly fibres , but his brother Fred and his brother - in - law Len Sturrock also died from asbestosis .
" Me and Jacky had three boys together and they all missed their mum when she died and still do .
My brother Fred worked with it for just eight weeks and he died 15 years ago .
Asbestos has had a massive effect on our family . "
The child killed by the hug he gave a family friend
Gordon Sanders , when he was still a schoolboy , used to get visits most days from his parents ' best friend , Jimmy Dows , on his way home from work at the Cape factory .
He loved kids , and when he came round , still in his dusty overalls , Gordon and his younger brother Philip would hug him and jump all over him .
After Jimmy left , Gordon 's mother would shake out the mat and leave newspaper to collect the dust .
In 2005 , Gordon , who was by then a primary school headteacher , died from mesothelioma , aged 57 .
Philip also died from lung cancer in 1988 , when he was 35 .
At Gordon 's inquest , the Coroner said that Philip 's death was most likely also related to exposure to the fibres .
Gordon 's wife Ethel said : " The kids would crawl all over Jimmy because he was such a nice bloke .
Nobody had any idea how bad the dust was .
It 's such a nasty disease .
It 's a feeling of gradually being suffocated .
Gordon felt robbed of his future life with us .
It seems so unjust that there was such a lack of regard for the health of people living in the area . "
The mother killed by a deadly housing estate
Rita Ashdown had no idea when she moved into her new home in 1972 that it would kill her .
The flat was on the Hart 's Lane estate , built on the site of the old Cape factory .
In 2002 she died from mesothelioma , aged 62 .
Her son , Eddie , said : " In 2001 , tests showed that there was asbestos just a foot under ground .
It was n't until she was diagnosed that we started to think how she could have got it .
We lived there for 13 years . "
The lagger who mixed Cape 's asbestos with his bare hands
Graham Taylor is living on borrowed time .
When the 61 - year - old was 15 , he worked for Cape for a year , mixing drums of asbestos with his bare hands and without a mask .
Four years ago he was frighteningly short of breath and saw a doctor .
He was quickly diagnosed with asbestosis , and told he had between two and five years left .
" When we 'd finish work we 'd look like we had jumped in bags of flour .
My lungs are turning to concrete .
I 've been handed a death sentence and Cape wanted to quibble about money . "
The family wiped out by asbestos
June Gibson 's mother , Amy West , and her aunt , Maud Raisbeck , died of asbestosis aged 43 and 28 in the 1920s and 30s after working in the Cape factory .
" The only compensation my mum got from Cape was an Italian marble gravestone , " June , 79 , said .
" She weighed four stone before she died . "
Now June , who never worked there herself , has shadows on her lung too .
The former pro-footballer who can hardly walk
Peter Bragger , 60 , was a semi- professional footballer and former captain of the England under - 18 team .
Now walking to the phone leaves him struggling for air .
He worked for Cape from 1964 as a lagger .
" I was first diagnosed with pleural plaques , but now I 've got asbestosis .
I 've had a lower lobectomy which removed part of my lung .
My life has been cut short . "
The asbestos researcher
Marjorie Wells's job during the Second World War was to work in the lab at the Barking factory checking which lengths of asbestos fibres gave the best finish .
Now 85 , she is dying of mesothelioma .
" There was dust everywhere , but it did n't worry me at all .
We just carried on with our normal lives afterwards , " said Marjorie .
" It was a shock when I found out that 's what was making me ill .
Now I 've got no energy at all . "
The female factory worker
Marian Lethbridge had trained as a children 's nurse , initially making only 15 shillings ( 75 p ) a week .
When she saw an advert for women to work in the Cape factory for £ 4 , she could n't get there quickly enough .
She worked there for only nine months , when she was 16 , but that was enough : she was spinning the asbestos fibres , and they gave her no protection .
Her husband , Ted Lethbridge , said : " At the end of the day they would get her to clean all the dust and she can remember it being so thick it hung off the light fittings .
You 've got to wonder why they were offering so much more money .
She died of mesothelioma in 1997 , when she was 69 , and she was in so much pain .
She said to me , ' Just let me die ; I do n't want any more . ' "
Deadly history : The ' magic mineral ' turns devasting killer
* Asbestos is dubbed the " magic mineral " after it is discovered that the rock minerals ' fibrous qualities provide heat - resistant material .
It is used in factories and homes .
The same qualities made it deadly to workers exposed to the fibres .
* In 1898 , UK factory inspectors first identified the " evil effects " of asbestos and its danger to workers ' health .
By 1955 a study reveals the clear lung - cancer risk .
It was not totally banned in the UK until 1999 , 101 years after the alarm was first raised .
* This week MPs will meet government lawyers about compensation for victims of the asbestos - related lung scarring , pleural plaques , which has not been available since the Law Lords controversially ruled against it in 2007 .
* As well as pleural plaques , exposure to asbestos fibre can result in three potentially fatal diseases : asbestos - related lung cancer , mesothelioma ( a deadly cancer that strangles the lungs and other internal organs ) and asbestosis ( a disease that attacks the lung tissues ) .
* The World Health Organisation estimates asbestos is currently killing 90,000 people a year worldwide .
One authoritative study predicts up to 10 million people will die because of it .
We wo n't know the true extent in the UK until 2016 when the death toll is expected to peak .

A small rural town in New Zealand has been forced to cancel one of the highlights on its social calendar - a rabbit - throwing contest .
About 400 people live in Waiau in the South Island .
This weekend the town will hold its annual pig hunt .
In previous years a ' rabbit throw ' has been organised for the local children , who compete to see how far they can hurl a dead bunny .
But the event is now off , after New Zealand 's equivalent of the RSPCA got wind of it .
Animal cruelty inspector Charles Cadwallader says throwing bunnies is sick .
" Do you throw your dead grandmother around for a joke at her funeral ? " he asked .
The organiser of the pig hunt , Jo Moriarty , says it is political correctness gone mad .
" You know , the children of the community here are fantastic , they love their animals , " he said .
New Zealand has more than 30 million wild rabbits .
The vice president of Google Search Product & user experience - Marissa Meyer has recently announced that Google will be permanently adding a sidebar to its search pages .
She thinks that the users of Google are unhappy with the same design of Google 's search interface .
So , they are now testing a few changes in the Google 's Search interface by adding a Sidebar on its left side and is going to soon visible to a small portion of users .
The sidebar will be consisting of some options to access content like Orkut , Google images , books , news , maps etc .
There will be another option which will remember the Search History Keyword for fast search .
This will be a great change in the history of internet as the Google Search Interface is changing which was untouched for many years and millions of users are quite habituated with its daily search interface .
Odierno : No Major Iraq Troop Withdrawals Before April
Created : November 18 , 2009 11:56 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Buried at the end of a New York Times piece is this rather significant declaration from Gen. Raymond Odierno , commander of U.S. troops in Iraq :
Gen . Ray Odierno , the commanding general of United States forces , said Wednesday that he was still hopeful elections would be held on time , but he added that the military could adapt if there was a delay .
“ What I believe I have is flexibility , ” he said , adding that significant reductions in troops were not scheduled until April or May .
April or May ?
That has real consequences for any escalation of troops in Afghanistan .
As I report today , there will be practically no undeployed available combat brigades if President Obama goes with a 30,000 - 40,000 troop increase .
It ’s not like you can just pluck a brigade from Iraq and send it to Afghanistan .
Soldiers get at least 12 months of so - called “ dwell time ” between deployments .
But Odierno ’s schedule means that combat brigades leaving Iraq wo n’t be until at least April 2011 for Afghanistan , which is a major issue for sustaining an escalation — not a temporary “ surge ” that lasts for one deployment — in that war , something Gen. Stanley McChrystal has suggested is necessary .
The combat mission in Iraq ends in August 2010 and Odierno has said troop levels will decline to 50,000 .
But he certainly is backloading the drawdown as much as possible .
Where ’s Gen. David Petraeus on this ?
As head of U.S. Central Command , he ’s both Odierno ’s boss and McChrystal ’s boss , and deconflicting the needs of both commanders is one of his primary responsibilities .
Hotel investment has always been boom and bust , but the most recent boom was off the charts ...
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows lodging investment as a percent of GDP since 1959 through Q2 2009 .
Lodging investment peaked in mid-2008 , but because of the length of time for hotel construction , there are many new hotels still coming online - at just the wrong time .
From the LA Times : Hotel defaults , foreclosures rise in California ( ht Ann )
... Statewide , more than 300 hotels were in foreclosure or default on their loans as of Sept. 30 -- a nearly fivefold increase since the start of the year , according to an industry report released Tuesday .
...
Most struggling hotels remain open , but industry experts believe many properties are likely to be closed down in the months ahead , even if they are not in foreclosure , because they are losing so much money .
...
" I have never seen so many lenders contemplating mothballing properties , " said Jim Butler , a hotel lawyer and chairman of the global hospitality group for Jeffer , Mangels , Butler & Marmaro .
" It can and it will get worse for the hotel industry . "
...
Statewide , 260 hotels were in default on their loans and 47 had been taken over by their lenders in foreclosure , the Atlas report said .
... a leading hotel consulting firm , Smith Travel Research , recently issued a report that predicted no significant improvement for the hotel industry until 2011 at the earliest .
" It 's going to be a lot worse than it is now , " said Bobby Bowers , senior vice president of Smith Travel Research .
... an increasing number of hotels have so little revenue that they can't even afford to pay their operating bills and payroll , not to mention servicing debt .
Owners of such hotels are increasingly handing the keys back to the lenders , and the problem is likely to get worse :
As many as 1 in 5 U.S. hotel loans may default through 2010 , UC Berkeley economist Kenneth Rosen said .
In some cases the lenders are simply locking up the properties ...
emphasis added
Not only is the recession impacting business and leisure travel , but there are just too many hotel rooms , and many more on the way .
You the Expert We set you a challenge to join our expert panel and answer questions from our readers on how to deal with your desktop , and mobile desktop , environment .
This week we 've got the first of what promises to be regular installments on this topic .
We welcome the first contribution from our resident reader experts , Adam Salisbury and Trevor Pott .
You can read their advice , along with advice from Intel and Freeform Dynamics , below .
The question this week is :
How can I manage remote users better , particularly roving users who are only connected to the network on a sporadic basis ?
Name : Adam Salisbury
Job Title : Infrastructure Support Engineer
Managing remote users has , and probably always will be , a major challenge to any business even with today ’s high speed home broadband offerings and ever improving secure remote access solutions .
While the challenges of managing dial - up sales users were limited remote access and support and limited access to regularly update the OS and installed applications , now there are more updates than ever and more demands for more of the resources previously confined to the corporate network .
It should go without saying that the key to successful remote user management is a rock solid , remote access system and there is huge range to choose from .
Invest in remote access tokens to authenticate your mobile workforce and develop and maintain a well thought out rules based access policy .
Resist the urge to merely adopt an ‘ Any , Any , All ’ policy no matter how secure you feel you are with your access tokens and SSL VPN .
You should also invest the time in developing good end - point checking too and make sure the corporate AV can get its updates in the wild if users are n’t connected to the corporate network .
Software update management software is another solid investment to maximise the efficiency and quality of service provided to your roaming workforce .
Keep them as fully updated as possible at all times to avoid diminishing performance , reliability and to maintain as secure a platform as possible .
Mobile users are those most likely to become a victim of an outbreak or vulnerability just by virtue of being mobile , hence as much should be done as possible to maintain their systems as they travel around and actively engage in a preventative maintenance strategy on the occasions they do grace the office with their presence .
Encrypt those notebooks .
This is an obvious but often overlooked security measure and not just by the SMBs of the world either , I ’ve worked for a “ five nines ” managed service provider who did n’t have a mobile worker encryption strategy .
Few encryption tools these days present the system with a tangible performance overhead , and more and more systems ship with SSDs , so that difference will narrow even further .
Go for a good product which incorporates full device control ; the ability to secure USB sticks and CDs and DVDs .
One of the biggest challenges for managing remote users is , or at least has been , how to keep data backups .
It is getting far easier to tunnel into the LAN and allow users access to network shares , intranets and CRM systems .
But the user with their last four years of work sat on the C : drive is still out there - as are the users carrying their own weight in email in PST files .
Having enough secure , accessible and available storage on tap for user backup can be costly but is it more costly that million - pound bid that got away after your top salesmen dropped his laptop ?
Review your group policy ( or equivalent ) ; too loose and you risk a horde of malware infected systems , perhaps even embarrassing or costly data leakage , but too restrictive and the service desk will be swamped as the mobile masses log cases for printer installations and firewall exceptions .
There are a myriad of solutions and configurations out there , some will work and some will be non-starters , find the ones that fit and embrace them .

If you have Intel® VPro™ technology systems you can start using a technology in the platform called Active Management Technology ( AMT ) .
AMT gives you a separate management engine in the platform which can communicate with your management console out of band from the main operating system .
This means you have remote management capabilities whether the OS is running or not - and even if the system is powered off .
There are several options .
A laptop still within the company environment ( firewall ) can be accessed and managed using AMT in the same way as a desktop client .
A laptop outside the company will again be picked up in the same way as a desktop and required maintenance tasks can be carried out the next time it accesses the company intranet .
The third situation is to use the VPro™ feature known as “ Fast Call for Help ” in which the user can hit a button on the laptop or use a special key combination to cause the management engine in the VPro™ system to “ call home ” for help from the company support desk .
Once the connection is made to the company management console , it can again be managed as if it was internal to the company .
The only difference is that the connection request was initiated by the client .
In particular this means remediation features such as Serial over LAN and IDE Redirection are available to help the support desk to diagnose and correct problems with the end users system .
If you do not have VPro™ systems in your laptop fleet – investigate the remote access solutions available , starting with windows remote desktop / remote assistance .
There are also third party products that will allow a support desk engineer to take control of a remote user system to diagnose and correct many problems .
See what options there are in the client build to provide localised diagnostic tools – such as separate maintenance partition on the disk .
This would help mitigate the worst case failure where a key OS file is damaged or for some reason a network connection cannot be made .

The Australian silence has unique features .
It affects our national life , the way we see the world , and the way we are manipulated by great power which speaks through an invisible government of propaganda that subdues and limits our political imagination and ensures we are always at war - against our own first people and those seeking refuge , or in someone else 's country .
Last July Kevin Rudd said : '' It 's important for us all to remember here in Australia that Afghanistan has been a training ground for terrorists worldwide , a training ground also for terrorists in South - East Asia , reminding us of the reasons that we are in the field of combat and reaffirming our resolve to remain committed to that cause . ''

There is no truth in this statement .
It is the equivalent of John Howard 's lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
Rudd was standing outside a church on a Sunday when he said this .
No reporter challenged him .
No one said : " Prime Minister , ' There is no war on terror .
It 's a hoax .
But there is a war of terror waged by governments , including the Australian Government , in our name . ' "
Over a century ago , Lord Curzon , viceroy of India , wrote : '' I confess that countries are pieces on a chessboard on which is being played out a great game for the domination of the world . "
Fin août , Jean - Marc Leclerc , journaliste au Figaro , tenait une « exclusivité » : un « rapport confidentiel qui prouve l’efficacité de la vidéosurveillance » , et démontrait l' » effet dissuasif des caméras sur la voie publique » :
Les conclusions du rapport dont Le Figaro a pris connaissance mettront - elles un terme à la polémique sur les dangers réels ou supposés des caméras sur la voie publique ?
A l’heure où le ministre de l ’Intérieur , Brice Hortefeux , promet d’en tripler le nombre , « de 20 000 à 60 000 d’ici à 2011 » , ce document témoigne , à tout le moins , que l’hôte de la place Beauvau avait pris quelque garantie avant de s’engager .
Le rapport a depuis été mis en ligne , et sa lecture prouve … l’inefficacité de la vidéosurveillance .
Le ministre avait pourtant et de fait pris « quelque garantie avant de s’engager » : le rapport ne visait en effet pas tant à vérifier l’efficacité de la vidéosurveillance qu’à … « mettre à disposition des collectivités locales des arguments propres à soutenir leur adhésion » , dans le cadre du « plan d’action ( qui ) vise à tripler le nombre de caméras sur la voie publique » , décidé par le ministère de l ’Intérieur , mais payé - en bonne partie- par nos impôts locaux .
Décryptage d’une ( grosse ) manipulation ( voir aussi la carte des villes sous vidéosurveillance que je vous propose de compléter , sur LePost .
fr , qui publie également une version courte de mon papier , Efficace , la vidéosurveillance ?
Le rapport qui nous mène en bateau… ) .
Le rapport nous apprend ainsi que les crimes et délits chutent deux fois plus vite dans les villes équipées que dans celles qui ne le sont pas , et que les agressions , qui ont progressé de 40 % depuis l’an 2000 , n’y ont augmenté « que » de 24,1 % .
Autrement dit , ça ne baisse pas : ça augmente moins …
On y lit également qu ' » en dessous d’une caméra pour 2000 habitants , les agressions contre les personnes progressent plus vite ( + 44,8 % ) que dans les villes qui n’ont aucun équipement ( + 40,5 % ) ».
Le nombre d’agressions progresse donc plus vite dans les villes modérément vidéosurveillées que dans celles qui ne le sont pas : on voudrait démontrer l’inefficacité de la vidéosurveillance qu’on ne s’y prendrait pas autrement .
On y découvre aussi que la délinquance générale baisse moins quand il y a plus d’une caméra pour 1000 habitants que lorsqu’il y a une caméra pour 1000 à 2000 habitants .
Autrement dit : plus il y a de caméras , moins la délinquance baisse …
Le Figaro notait également que « contrairement à un préjugé véhiculé jusqu ’au Parti socialiste , « l ’effet plumeau , c’est - à- dire un déplacement de la délinquance vers les zones non couvertes , ne semble pas avéré » . ».
Il eut été plus juste de préciser , comme le fait le rapport , que « 48 % des commissariats estiment qu’il est nul , 52 % estiment qu’il existe , mais ne sont pas en mesure de l’évaluer ».
Enfin , l’efficacité de la vidéosurveillance ne diffère guère lorsque des agents sont payés pour surveiller , en temps réel , les écrans de contrôle , que lorsque personne ne les regarde …
Quant à l’effet dissuasif , « pour ce qui concerne la délinquance générale , les taux d’élucidation progressent aussi bien dans les zones avec ou sans vidéoprotection »… mais restent inférieurs dans les villes vidéosurveillées que dans celles qui ne le sont pas , comme en témoigne ce tableau , qui montre que le taux d’élucidation est meilleur - et progresse plus vite - dans les villes qui n’ont pas de caméras que dans celles qui sont vidéosurveillées :
Un rapport « commandé »
Pour mieux comprendre ce pour quoi il est possible de faire dire à ce « Rapport sur l’efficacité de la vidéoprotection » le contraire des conclusions auxquelles il est arrivé , commençons donc par la lettre de « mission relative à l’évolution de la vidéoprotection » , envoyée en février dernier par le ministre de l’intérieur au président du « comité de pilotage stratégique pour le développement de la vidéoprotection » :
Le développement de la vidéoprotection est une priorité du Ministre .
C’est pourquoi le plan d’action mis en place vise à tripler le nombre de caméras sur la voie publique .
Afin de permettre aux collectivités locales gestionnaires de l’espace public de se lancer dans cette stratégie dynamique , il convient de mettre à disposition ( … ) des arguments propres à soutenir leur adhésion .
Dans cet esprit , il est nécessaire ( … ) d’évaluer et de quantifier l’efficacité de la vidéoprotection .
Ce qui , traduit par les auteurs du rapport , donne donc ce rapport sur « l’efficacité de la vidéoprotection » , mais dont l’objectif n’est pas de savoir si la vidéosurveillance est efficace , ou non , mais de démontrer que le ministre a raison de vouloir tripler le nombre de caméras .
Un peu comme si un industriel du médicament demandait à ses salariés d’évaluer l’efficacité de ses produits , afin d’en vendre trois fois plus qu’auparavant .
Le président du « comité de développement de la vidéoprotection » ayant décidé de ne pas participé à la rédaction du rapport , « afin de permettre une évaluation indépendante de l’efficacité de la vidéoprotection » ( sic ) , celle - ci a été confiée à l ’Inspection générale de la police nationale ( IGPN ) , l’Inspection technique de la gendarmerie nationale ( ITGN ) et l’Inspection générale de l’Administration ( IGA ) , « services au dessus de tout soupçon » qualifiés par le Figaro d' » incorruptibles de l’administration ».
De fait , l’IGPN et l’IGTN sont plus connus sous le sobriquet de « boeufs carottes » , « polices des polices » directement rattachées aux directions générale de la police et de la gendarmerie .
Quant à l’IGA , elle est composée d’énarques « placés sous l’autorité directe du ministre de l’intérieur » .
En terme d’indépendance , c’est tout bon : difficile de trouver fonctionnaires ayant autant leurs doigts rivés sur la couture du pantalon .
Le ministère de l’intérieur s’étant illustré , ces dernières années , par un certain nombre de mises au placard de hauts fonctionnaires ayant eu l’outrecuidance , entre autres et par exemple , de ne pas suffisamment surveiller la villa de Christian Clavier , les conclusions de l’étude ne pouvaient que « fournir des arguments propres à soutenir l’adhésion » en matière de « vidéoprotection ».
A ce titre , on notera que si le terme de « vidéoprotection » est utilisé 184 fois , celui de « vidéosurveillance » , lui , n’apparaît qu’une seule fois , en conclusion :
La présence de caméras dans les lieux publics s’est banalisée et elle est entrée dans les mentalités .
La perception du caractère « liberticide » de la vidéosurveillance s’est estompé au profit de la vidéoprotection qui rassure les habitants des zones concernées et lutte contre le sentiment d’insécurité .
Du grand Shadock
Le rapport , en tant que tel , est relativement incompréhensible pour quelqu ’un qui ne maîtrise pas , sur le bout des doigts , les subtilités de la statistique policière .
J’ai donc contacté trois spécialistes de la question , qui tous pointent du doigt la « lettre de mission » , et le fait qu’il ne repose que sur les seuls témoignages de policiers , gendarmes , élus et responsables locaux chargés de la sécurité - et sans qu’aucun universitaire , sociologue ou spécialiste de la question n’ait été auditionné .
Un « oubli » d’autant moins étonnant lorsqu’on sait que lorsqu’ils sont interrogés par des sociologues , les policiers estiment que globalement , la vidéosurveillance … ne marche pas
Tanguy Le Goff est sociologue à l’Institut d’aménagement d’Ile de France .
Constatant que les promoteurs de la vidéosurveillance n’avaient de cesse de déclarer que « l’efficacité de la vidéosurveillance n’est plus à démontrer » , alors qu’aucun étude n’avait été effectuée , il a compilé , l’an passé , le tout premier « Etat des lieux des évaluations menées en France et à l’étranger « , qui concluait à l’inefficacité relative de la vidéosurveillance :
On ne peut pas entrer dans la polémique des chiffres : les périodes ne sont pas les mêmes , le rapport mêle petites , moyennes et grandes villes , HLM et zones commerciales , centre villes et moyens de transport publics … et compare des choses qui ne sont pas comparables .
De plus , il faudrait au minimum isoler les autres facteurs qui entrent en ligne de compte : renforcement ( ou non ) de la police , présence ( ou non ) d’une police municipale , de quartiers défavorisés , de zones commerciales , etc .
En l’état , il est impossible de réussir à identifier l’effet propre de la vidéosurveillance : la méthodologie est fausse , ou alors les délinquants n’agissent pas , en France , comme ils agissent dans les autres pays …
Avec Eric Heilmann , maître de conférences à l ’Université Louis Pasteur de Strasbourg , et autre grand spécialiste français de la vidéosurveillance , Tanguy Le Goff vient de publier un décryptage du rapport du ministère de l ’Intérieur , Vidéosurveillance : un rapport qui ne prouve rien .
Après avoir détaillé les manquements aux règles méthodologiques élémentaires de toute étude de ce type , ils s’étonnent de voir qu’en France , la vidéosurveillance aurait permis de contenir les atteintes aux personnes , un « résultat d’autant plus remarquable qu’il contredit ceux auxquels sont parvenus les quelques quarante études réalisées à l’étranger depuis une quinzaine d’années » , pour qui , et paradoxalement , l’efficacité de la vidéosurveillance se mesure à l’augmentation du nombre d’agressions constatées :
Les études étrangères montrent que la vidéosurveillance , si elle est bien gérée , a tendance à faire augmenter le nombre d’atteintes aux personnes dans les statistiques policières .
Les auteurs de ce type de faits ne cherchant pas à se cacher , nombre d’entre - eux résultant d’actes impulsifs , ces faits qui pouvaient passer inaperçus auparavant sont un peu mieux repérés .
Si la vidéosurveillance n’a pas d’effet inhibiteur sur les atteintes aux personnes , leur baisse peut donc révéler en réalité l’inefficacité du dispositif .
Or , le rapport commandé par Brice Hortefeux avance qu’en France la vidéosurveillance contribue , a contrario des études internationales , à enrayer les atteintes aux personnes …
Laurent Bonelli est quant à lui maître de conférences en science politique à Nanterre , et auteur en 2001 de « La Machine à punir .
Pratiques et discours sécuritaires » et , en 2008 , de « La France a peur .
Une histoire sociale de l’insécurité » :
Corrélation n’est pas causalité , c’est la base de l’analyse scientifique ; or là , ça peut monter ou baisser pour des raisons qui n’ont rien à voir avec la vidéosurveillance .
D’autre part , les statistiques dites « de la délinquance » reflètent bien plus l’activité des forces de l’ordre et leurs priorités qu’un état réel de la criminalité dans le pays .
Or , rien n’est plus fluctuant que ces priorités en fonction des injonctions politiques du moment .
En l’occurence , l’objectif affiché par le ministère est de réduire les effectifs de la police de 12 000 fonctionnaires à l’horizon 2012 , et le développement de la vidéosurveillance - financée par des partenariats publics - privés et par les collectivités territoriales plus que par le gouvernement - permet de déplacer le problème et d’apporter une réponse technique , voire « magique » , aux craintes exprimées par les élus locaux , et leurs administrés .
Journaliste , Noé Le Blanc est pour sa part l’auteur de plusieurs articles de référence sur les études universitaires et indépendantes faites au sujet de la vidéosurveillance .
C’est du grand Shadock , imputable au fait que les chiffres du rapport mélangent tout et n’importe quoi : quel sens cela a -t - il de vouloir mesurer l’efficacité de la vidéosurveillance sur la « délinquance générale » , qui regroupe tout aussi bien les vols à la tire que la violence conjugale , les infractions économiques et le non-respect du droit du travail ?
Et si l’on s’intéresse aux types de délit où les systèmes de vidéosurveillance peuvent a priori faire montre d’efficacité , on découvre que l’on serait moins agressé dans les villes non vidéosurveillées que dans celles où on l’est un peu , que les caméras que personne ne regarde produisent tout autant d’effet que celles qui sont regardées , et que “ l’amélioration du taux d’élucidation est sensiblement équivalente ” dans les villes équipées que dans celles qui ne le sont pas…
Enfin , une observation résume à elle seule l’apport quasi-nul des caméras aux investigations : 6 personnes « mises en cause » ( ce qui ne veut pas dire condamnées ) par brigade de gendarmerie et par an grâce aux caméras , soit moins d’une « mise en cause » par caméra et par an …
En résumé , si le rapport prouve bien une chose , c’est qu’il est compliqué de mesurer , mais encore plus de « prouver » , l’efficacité de la vidéosurveillance .
Les auteurs du rapport sont d’ailleurs conscients des limites de leurs exercices .
Ainsi , en introduction de leur rapport , ils reconnaissent eux - mêmes que :
L’impact exclusif de la vidéoprotection est difficile à isoler dans un environnement mouvant et dans lequel elle n’est qu’un outil au service des municipalités et des forces de l’ordre .
La comparaison de ville à ville est délicate compte tenu de l’hétérogénéité des situations : nature et étendue des zones vidéoprotégées , typologie de la délinquance , organisation des forces de l’ordre , implication des municipalités au travers des polices municipales ou de politiques de prévention , évolution des qualifications pénales de certains faits , etc. , tous phénomènes qui peuvent interagir et ne facilitent pas la mesure de la seule efficacité des dispositifs installés .
Après n’en avoir pas moins cherché à démontrer l’efficacité de a vidéosurveillance , ils concluent leur rapport sur une note guère plus optimiste : « malgré un travail important des services de police et de gendarmerie pour permettre à la mission de réaliser cette étude , force est de constater que les outils d’évaluation mis en place localement sont encore trop parcellaires » , alors même , précisent - ils également , que « les équipements de vidéoprotection représentent des coûts d’investissement et de fonctionnement élevés »… qu’ils n’ont pas été en mesure de quantifier .
Depuis , Brice Hortefeux a divulgué la liste des 75 villes à équiper en priorité , afin que la France puisse enfin tripler le nombre de caméras de vidéosurveillance et atteindre l’objectif affiché de « de 20 000 à 60 000 d’ici à 2011 » .
François Fillon , dans la foulée , a annoncé qu’il doublait le budget dédié à la vidéosurveillance , qui passera de 10 - 12 millions à 20 millions d’euros en 2010 .
A noter que Jean - Marc Leclerc , l’auteur de l’article du Figaro en question , est également membre du « Groupe de contrôle des fichiers de police et de gendarmerie » du ministère de l ’Intérieur , au sujet duquel il avait également écrit des articles … sans préciser qu’il en faisait partie .
MaJ : en août 2011 , la Documentation française a mis en ligne un Rapport complémentaire sur l’efficacité de la vidéoprotection , datant de novembre 2010 , qui prend acte de plusieurs des critiques effectuées à son sujet , mais qui n’y répond que très partiellement .
J ’y reviendrai .

CLAWSON , Mich . �
Police said a woman threatened her husband with a 7 - inch knife after he threw away her bottle of vodka as she slept in their suburban Detroit home .
Clawson police Lt. Scott Sarvello told The Daily Tribune of Royal
Oak the man returned home from work Sunday night to find his wife sleeping with a bottle of vodka .
He threw away the bottle .
Sarvello said the 34 - year - old woman woke up , argued with her husband , went back to sleep , then got up again and grabbed a knife from the kitchen to force him to get her vodka or give her the car keys .
Police said the man held her at bay with a chair while he called 911 .
She was arrested and found to have a blood - alcohol level of 0.23 percent .
She was arraigned Tuesday on a felony charge of assault with a dangerous weapon .
For about 10,000 years , our climate on Earth has been stable .
Remarkably stable , in fact .
Since the end of the last ice age , we humans have spent 400 generations taking advantage of this stability to build our civilisation .
We have had warm periods and little ice ages ; but the changes have been small .
We have always known pretty much when it will rain , what the temperature will be each summer and winter , and how high the rivers will flow .
This benign climate is arguably the main reason why our species has been able to progress .
Why , within 400 generations , we have gone from the scattered tribes of spear - carriers and fire - raisers who emerged from their caves at the end of the ice age to become the first farmers , metallurgists , urbanists , industrialists and now the seven billion inhabitants of a digitised , globalised world .
Our massively complex society relies on the ability to plant crops knowing that they will grow , and build cities and infrastructure in places that wo n't be flooded by incoming tides or washed away by torrential rains .
Without these certainties , Homo sapiens would still be living in caves .
When they fail even briefly – during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , say , or in Cumbria just last month – we know the consequences .
What if these certainties failed more , or even most , of the time ?
We are more vulnerable than we think .
Global leaders need to think about this lack of certainty as they gather in Copenhagen to discuss what to do about climate change .
For , as we fill the atmosphere with heat - trapping greenhouse gases , the blunt truth is that the good times are over .
That era of climate stability is coming to an end .
In some ways , it is remarkable how far today 's politicians have come in addressing what seems destined to be the defining global problem of the 21st century .
Seventeen years ago , at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro , their predecessors signed the UN climate change convention that promised to prevent " dangerous climate change " .
That led to the Kyoto protocol in 1997 – a rather feeble first step to fulfilling that promise .
But now , in Copenhagen , they may finally agree on a definition of that term " dangerous " , when they discuss halting global warming at 2C .
Many now realise that the fossil fuels which have powered our world through two centuries of unprecedented growth in both population and wealth have to be largely phased out within the next half century .
In the 17 years since the Rio meeting , scientists ' understanding of what climate change could do to us has moved on too .
At every step , the science becomes more worrying : our move away from a world of stable climate will not be gradual , it could be sudden and violent .
Runaway warming
The reassuringly smooth lines on the graphs produced by climate modellers may not , as the sceptics have argued , be how things turn out .
The problem is that things may not be less dramatic than the models predict .
They may instead be a great deal worse .
The talk now in the climate labs — in the tea rooms and , yes , in their private emails — is of tipping points and runaway warming .
The fear is that beyond 2C or so , warming and rising sea levels may be impossible to halt .
Even if we cut our emissions to zero .
The concerns are many .
Some studies suggest that the acceleration of melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica could soon destabilise their great ice sheets — causing sea levels to rise by several metres over a few decades .
Other research shows that frozen methane ( a potent greenhouse gas ) may bubble up out of the melting Siberian permafrost in volumes that would raise global temperatures by several degrees .
And that melting ice could interrupt the north Atlantic ocean circulation , which would alter global weather patterns and ultimately switch off the Asian monsoon season . -
Alarmist ?
Well , these are not firm predictions right now , just concerns .
Racing tipsters among the scientists say the odds might be five - to - one or even ten - to - one against some of these potential disasters .
The often repeated question is : would you get into a plane if someone told you there was a ten - to - one chance it would crash ?
Of course you would n't .
So why take that chance with the planet ?
And here is perhaps the most persuasive evidence that they are right to be worried .
It 's happened before .
Nature has a track record on tipping points .
Before the long balmy era we have enjoyed over the past 10,000 years , climate was often much more tempestuous .
The climate system does not generally do gradual change .
It does big jumps based on tipping points .
Take events during the final few centuries of the last ice age .
We now know that , as ice sheets collapsed , sea levels rose 20 metres – enough to drown much of eastern England — in less than 400 years .
That is an average of 20 times faster than now .
The ice sheets collapsed because the climate warmed quickly .
Around then , average temperatures in much of the northern hemisphere rose by around 10C within a decade .
Researchers can measure that change in the bubbles of ice left behind in ice cores in Greenland .
Before that , temperatures had lurched in the other direction .
Research published just last month shows that some 12,800 years ago , the world plunged into a thousand - year deep freeze in a single year , with average temperatures crashing by 16C .
Those were violent times .
They could happen again .
Forces within our control
How did such changes come about ?
They were started by slow and subtle shifts in the orbit of the Earth that changed the amount and distribution of radiation reaching us from the sun .
But this small effect was amplified by events on Earth — apparent tipping points in the climate system .
First , there were sudden movements of hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into and out of the atmosphere .
During warming , the gas burped into the atmosphere from natural reservoirs , or " carbon sinks " , such as permafrost and the oceans .
And it rapidly left again during cooling .
Second , there were rapid changes in the ocean circulation system , switching the Gulf stream on and off .
Exactly how the planetary wobbles and the carbon dioxide movements and the ocean changes fitted together is far from clear .
But they did so to devastating effect .
And what is unnerving today is that the key element , the trigger for the sudden change , appears to have been carbon dioxide .
The very gas we are busy pumping into the air at the rate of 30bn tonnes a year , mostly by burning fossil fuels .
Even nature would find hard to match that rate .
Our carbon - based fuels — coal , oil and natural gas — are the fossilised remains of swamp vegetation , buried over hundreds of millions of years .
Every year we burn what nature laid down over a million years .
So when sceptics tell me not to worry about climate change , I do n't buy it .
We are interfering with major geological forces .
Carbon dioxide is the planet 's thermostat .
Nature has flicked the carbon switch before .
Now we are flicking the switch again .
We are interfering with the planet 's life support systems .
And , whatever happens to nature , it is our own highly complex interconnected society , built on a lucky period of stable climate during a tiny sliver of planetary time , that looks most at risk .
That 's the bad news .
But here is the good news .
It does n't have to be like this .
We are still in charge of our own destiny .
We have the technology to end our dangerous dependence on carbon - based fuels .
We can take our pick of alternative energy sources : wind and solar ; geothermal ; tides and waves ; nuclear if we must .
And we have the technology to use dramatically less energy , too .
Kicking the carbon habit need not be expensive — small change compared to the price of bailing out the banks .
It would be a lot easier to arrange if we changed our lifestyles to ones based on quality of life rather than consumption , measured by a happiness index rather than GDP .
But the hair shirt is not the critical technology .
And the real issue is whether we have the political will to make the change .
Lesson from history
The best news is that , like nature , our society itself has tipping points .
And some of them are positive .
Look at how we gave up smoking in bars and restaurants .
Five years ago , I would not have believed it could happen so easily and painlessly .
Or how half a century ago , we banished the great smogs .
After the Great Smog of 1952 , which left around 10,000 dead , industrialists said two things .
First : " It 's only nature , we 've always had smogs , what 's the big deal ? "
And second : " Anyway , the problem is far too expensive to deal with . "
That , albeit on a much bigger scale , is the task the world faces in Copenhagen .
To cry " enough " .
To cross our own tipping point and decide to embrace a future carbon - free world .
Can we reach our tipping point before nature reaches one of its tipping points ?
That is , probably , unknowable right now .
But we should know a great deal more about our chances before the month is out .

November 11 , 2009
Kevin Prosen explains why New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg does n't have much to celebrate about his re-election in last week 's vote .
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG can formally claim victory in New York City 's mayoral election , but the reality is that the election was a repudiation of the mayor and his agenda for the city .
Despite polls predicting a landslide for Bloomberg , his margin of victory was only 5 percentage points .
He won 100,000 fewer votes than in 2005 , and only one in four eligible voters went to the polls .
The mass abstention and closer - than - expected outcome shows that despite Bloomberg 's high approval ratings and millions spent on the campaign , voters are deeply alienated by his influence - peddling and his anti-democratic manipulation of the City Council to extend term limits , which allowed for him to run for a third term in the first place .
With a net worth upwards of $ 20 billion , Bloomberg is the wealthiest man in New York City and the 8th richest American .
According to the New York Times , he has spent more of his personal wealth in pursuit of public office than anybody else in American history .
For this re-election campaign alone , he 's estimated to have spent over $ 100 million .
By contrast , his main rival Bill Thompson spent about $ 6 million .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
THE $ 100 million figure does n't include the various ways in which Bloomberg uses his wealth and philanthropy to win support among disparate parts of the city 's population .
According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy , Bloomberg is the leading individual donor in the U.S. at $ 235 million in 2008 .
The money was given to causes ranging from flashy public art installations to donations for small community organizations and churches .
As a result , many prominent Black ministers supported the mayor in exchange for access and funding .
For example , Rev. Calvin O. Butts III of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem endorsed Bloomberg over his longtime friend Bill Thompson .
In addition to more than $ 1 million in private donations from Bloomberg to the Abyssinian Church , the church and its non-profits have received more than $ 7 million dollars in city contracts , according to the New York Times .
Other prominent ministers have been given posts on important city development boards or received funding for their own projects .
The Thompson campaign complained to the Times that many Black religious leaders were reluctant to publicly endorse Thompson , for fear of alienating the mayor .
Even Barack Obama endorsed Bill Thompson under his breath , referring through a spokesman for support for " the Democratic nominee " and not even mentioning Thompson by name .
In the past , Obama has praised Bloomberg 's " extraordinary leadership . "
After treating the mayor to a " private breakfast " before his big speech on financial reform last year , Obama joked to the press , " The reason I bought breakfast is because I expected payback .
I 'm no dummy . "
The Thompson campaign made a point of referring to " Republican " Mike Bloomberg , despite the fact that his current political ties are just as close to the corporate wing of the Democratic Party .
Having hosted the Republican National Convention in New York in 2004 and publicly endorsed George W. Bush for re-election that year , Bloomberg put his finger to the wind after the 2006 midterm elections that drove the Republicans out of control of Congress , and calculated that the Republican " brand " was losing its cache .
He officially left the party in 2007 , though he used the Republican ballot line in 2009 .
Bloomberg received endorsements from prominent Democratic leaders like Al Gore , who praised his environmental record , and Newark Mayor Cory Booker .
Liberal celebrities like Matt Damon and U2 have endorsed Bloomberg ; Bono went so far as to praise the mayor from the stage at U2's recent Madison Square Garden concert .
Further , he hired Hillary Clinton 's communications director Howard Wolfson as his campaign spokesperson .
Wolfson tried to tone down the mayor 's elitist airs and sell him as more of a " regular guy " ( changing " Michael " to the presumably more folksy " Mike " ) .
Bloomberg is a liberal on social issues , occasionally speaking more forcefully on questions like abortion than establishment Democrats , with language like : " Reproductive choice is a fundamental human right , and we can never take it for granted ... [ O ] n this issue , you 're either with us or against us . "
That earned him the endorsement of NARAL Pro-Choice New York .
Further , prominent activists in the LGBT movement like David Mixner and Lt. Dan Choi have endorsed Bloomberg because of his call for marriage equality for New York .
A self - described independent , Bloomberg brands himself as " post- partisan , " " non-ideological , " and " pragmatic , " but this is merely a superficial justification for his opportunistic politics , oriented on the pursuit of power and influence .
Despite opposing term - limit extensions as recently as 2005 , Bloomberg conveniently changed his mind as his second term drew to a close , and pushed an extension of term limits in New York City through the City Council , which extended its own term limits in the process .
In doing so , he circumvented the will of the voters in a 1993 voter initiative that supported two - term limits and a 1996 referendum that was decisively in favor of maintaining the limits .
A judge threw out a complaint by two members of the City Council arguing that there was an illegal conflict of interest in elected officials voting on whether or not to extend their own terms in office .
This , more than any other single act of the mayor 's , fostered the resentment behind the low voter turnout and the narrow election , with people coming to the conclusion that Bloomberg was able to simply buy the mayor 's office .
BLOOMBERG CLAIMS that because of his business background , he is uniquely capable of managing New York City in the context of the current financial crisis -- and from Wall Street 's perspective this is true .
As head of the financial data giant Bloomberg LP , his fortunes are intimately connected to the very sectors of finance that caused the current economic crisis .
According to a recent article in Forbes magazine , 90 percent of Bloomberg 's profits come from subscriptions to their financial information system , an indispensable tool for the hedge funds , investment banks and other purveyors of obscure financial commodities .
However , because of the current recession , thousands of Bloomberg subscriptions have been canceled .
The collapse of Lehman Brothers alone wiped out 1 percent of Bloomberg 's subscription , or " installation " base .
As the Forbes article continued :
" Bloomberg is brilliant at catering to the masters of the universe .
But it tied its fate to the hardest - hit sectors of Wall Street , " says an industry analyst who closely follows the company and refuses to be identified for fear of losing access to their data .
" Bloomberg 's sales have massively slowed down , " he says , estimating the company is averaging a loss of 1,000 " installs " a month .
Thus , Bloomberg 's fortune is directly tied to the financial and real estate speculation that caused the most recent economic bubble -- and that has wreaked so much damage in New York through aggressive gentrification .
Low - income housing in the city has been disappearing , replaced by expensive condominiums for affluent professionals .
Over 16,000 housing units have been pushed out of rent - stabilization since 2005 .
One example of the kind of real estate development recently is the fate of the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village housing complexes .
Three years ago , mega - developers Tishman Speyer and Blackrock Realty paid $ 5.4 billion for the property , the largest real estate deal in history .
Both complexes have long been made up of rent - stabilized housing for low - and middle - income workers .
In order to make the deal profitable , these people had to be pushed out and replaced with high - income professionals .
Last spring , an appellate court ruled that the development 's new landlords illegally raised rents after receiving tax breaks for providing rent - subsidized housing .
After the collapse of the financial markets and massive layoffs on Wall Street , effective demand for luxury housing has slowed .
The current rental rolls at Stuyvesant Town put its value at less than half of what was paid for it , and the landlords are in danger of defaulting on their loans .
Then there 's the question of schools .
Bloomberg has , perhaps more than any other issue , claimed to be a leader on education .
Under his administration , the old Board of Education was disbanded and replaced by a system of mayoral control , headed by corporate tool Joel Klein as chancellor .
The Bloomberg - Klein administration has imposed a data - driven corporate model oriented on accountability for teachers based on student performance on standardized tests .
In step with the priorities of the Obama administration 's Race to the Top program , Klein 's project is to weaken and eventually do away with teacher seniority and tenure , and implement a union - busting merit pay system to reward teachers whose students score highly on standardized tests .
Klein and Bloomberg have also aggressively pushed privatization of public schooling through charter schools -- currently , they pressuring Albany to lift caps on charter schools , another criterion to qualify for federal Race to the Top grants , and have vowed to open 100 more charters during their tenure .
The powerful United Federation of Teachers ( UFT ) , one of New York 's most influential unions with 200,000 members , has been particularly cowardly in standing up to this attack .
Union leaders have been pliant on the issue of charter schools ( the UFT actually runs two of its own charter school campuses in the city ) and standardized testing .
UFT officials claim that mayoral control is popular with the public , and therefore can't be opposed .
Instead of using the union 's massive resources to wage a public campaign against the most destructive aspects of Bloomberg 's agenda and educate the public around charters , testing and mayoral control , union leaders like Randi Weingarten and Michael Mulgrew have accepted the basic framework of Bloomberg and Klein 's project , and played the role of intermediaries , selling concessions to members in exchange for small trade - offs .
The union 's contract expired on October 31 , and as of yet , no agreement has been reached .
Despite the support of the entire establishment of New York City and his own lavish spending on the campaign , Michael Bloomberg barely squeaked back into office .
Building on the sentiment that led to this unexpected victory -- growing anger around unemployment , budget cuts , rising rents and more -- is the key to building a movement from below that can challenge Bloomberg 's corporate agenda for New York .
So far , Google 's Music service is only available in the US .
Search giant Google has entered the online music market with a new service for finding and buying music online .
OneBox is an alliance with music sites Lala and MySpace - owned iLike .
The US - only service allows people to search using song titles , artists or using snippets of lyrics and will also stream sought - after tracks .
Mark Mulligan , an analyst at research firm Forrester , said the service may offer a compelling alternative to illegal file - sharing .
" Apple can do little about iPod owners downloading from BitTorrent , " he said in a blog post .
" But Google on the other hand can . "
BitTorrent software is widely used to trade music and movies .
" Just imagine if when a consumer searches for a song , alongside all of those Torrent results is a heavily integrated Google music offering . "
When users search using OneBox a pop-up widget powered by iLike or Lala offers to play the entire song .
A MySpace box allows people to buy MP3s of the tracks and also highlights music videos and other information , such as upcoming concerts by the artists .
According to Google , the words " music " and " lyrics " are among the top 10 search terms of all time .
" At Google , we see millions of music - related queries every day , " said the company 's vice president of search Marissa Mayer at the launch in Los Angeles .
" It is clear to us that for our users music holds a very special and particular place . "
Apple currently dominates the online music market with around 70 % of worldwide sales .
In Europe , firms such as Spotify are also beginning to gain popularity .
The free music - streaming service , which launched in 2008 , now has more than two million users in the UK , and more than six million across Europe .
The new Google collaboration will hope to emulate the success of these services .
The firm already offer free downloads of licensed music tracks in China and has said it was now trying to find partners in other countries to take the new music model international .

LONDON , U.K. —
Iran ’s opposition movement showed it may have staying power Wednesday as thousands of opposition protesters took to the streets alongside a regime - backed demonstration marking the 30th anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran .
A multitude of security forces and plainclothes militias cracked down violently on the protesters , shooting tear gas and leading baton charges throughout central Tehran .
Students defied government warnings and the forced closure of some universities to gather at Tehran and Sharif universities , the Iranian capital ’s main campuses .
Riot police closed down the city center and assaulted groups wherever they gathered .
Grainy videos streaming out of the Iranian capital on YouTube and Facebook showed gas mask - wearing demonstrators jumping over trash fires as they fled from security forces .
Injured members of the public were carried to side streets and parking lots to be treated .
Other alleys were transformed into temporary detention centers for demonstrators who were detained by riot police who sallied forth to disperse protesters .
“ I have been amazed by the steadfastness of the protesters and their bravery , ” said James Spencer , a Middle East expert specializing in defence and security issues .
“ The regime is weak , they ’ve been unable to stop the protests using the current level of force and , as with the Shah , do n’t dare increase the level of violence too much for fear that the IRGC [ Revolutionary Guards ] will refuse . ”
One demonstrator freshly returned from the streets described how she disguised herself from traffic cameras used to identify protesters by wearing sunglasses and a gas mask .
Golnaz , 23 , described how she shouted anti-regime slogans with her boyfriend , and both were hit by tear gas and struck with batons before seeking refuge in a nearby house .
“ I lost my mother and another friend while a guard attacked my boyfriend , striking him on the shoulder with a baton and smashing the door ’s glass on his head , ” she recounted , in an email from Tehran .
“ He managed to escape inside ( the house ) however . ”
Once inside the house , they sat with a number of other protesters in terrified silence .
“ There were several harsh knocks on the door but no one dared to open it so they left , ” Golnaz recounted .
“ In between there was the sound of shooting but I ’m not sure if they shot anyone .
Then there was the sound of female shrieking so we looked from the window and saw this girl with no scarf , messed up and hysterical as if she had been beaten .
She was walking shocked and constantly screaming . ”
Opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi was attacked by pro-regime plainclothes militiamen , according to some reports that also said he was targeted with tear gas .
One picture shows him without his cleric ’s turban and sporting a red cut on his forehead .
In another video , he emerges from the sunroof of his car to rapturous applause by his supporters .
There were no sightings of Mir-Hossein Mousavi who has maintained a lower profile in recent weeks as calls for his arrest and trial increased .
“ It will continue to organize , subvert official commemorations , and press against the prevailing conditions , ” said Spencer .
“ As every year passes , the Neo-Revolutionaries lose demographic weight . ”
Iran ’s Green Movement has also been called the revolt of the third generation of the 1979 Iranian Revolution .
Some 70 percent of Iranians are under 30 years old and have memory neither of the Shah nor of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the founder of the Islamic Republic who passed away in 1989 .
On the streets of Tehran , demonstrators shouted slogans questioning whether U.S. President Barack Obama is “ with us or with them , ” in a criticism of the recent nuclear deal offered the Islamic Republic .
But they also read Obama ’s message commemorating the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in which he urged the Iranian government to consider “ what kind of future it is for ” as a sign of his support .
“ The world continues to bear witness to ( the Iranian peoples ’ ) call for justice and their courageous pursuit of universal rights , ” Obama said .
Despite demonizing the West , mandating the teaching of Arabic at school and closing down universities during the Cultural Revolution of 1980 - 83 , the authorities have failed to stem the tide of Westernization .
Unlike the Shah ’s era , Western culture is now piped into Iranian households both from illegal satellite dishes and through the internet .
“ We should n't get carried away , ” said Spencer , referring to suggestions that if Iran ’s revolutionaries are successful , they will usher in a pro-Western regime .
“ They ’re Iranians and want their own Iranian republic , which will probably continue in a similar line to the mullahs , just on a nationalist rather than Islamist line . ”

I am extremely happy that I made the right choice in selecting Insign to design my flat .
It proved to be the one - stop - shop for all my interior designing requirements such as carpentry , electrical , painting and more .
Their ideas on designs were both original and impressive .
They used the best quality available and maintained everything as per our agreement .
The delivery was ahead of the schedule and I have n’t seen such a dedicated workforce before .
Overall it has been a very pleasant experience .
I ’m revisiting Super Mario 64 as part of Super Mario 3D All - Stars and it really strikes me how much the game ’s strictness and punishment get in the way of what makes it great , and in particular the way it treats learning challenges as though they were mastery challenges .
To me , Mario 64 is a colorful toybox that invites exploration .
It ’s at its best when imparting a real sense of discovery , presenting the player with a series of shiny toys and allowing the player to experiment and discover new ways to play with them .
And it ’s at its worst when it ’s slapping the toys out of your hand because you are playing with them wrong .
As I wrote in my review , as you progress it ’s increasingly “ the case that a single mistake kills Mario , which ejects you from the level completely and requires you to carefully make your way back to where you were before you can experiment any further . ”
( And unlike the Virtual Console on the Wii U , in 3D All - Stars there are no save states available to guard against this - one way in which this release is actually a step back . )
I find myself much less interested in , say , scouring levels for all eight red coins if I ’m likely to die while looking for number six and then have to collect the first five all over again .
That kind of thing is what got me to put the game down when I played it before .
I like the exploration by itself , and I can handle a tough skill challenge , but when the skill challenge interrupts the exploration - when I ca n’t experiment or practice because I keep getting kicked out of the level - that ’s when I just get frustrated .
So I ’m trying something different this time : I ’m using a guide .
Not for every star , but for any where I die at least twice trying to figure it out .
That means that for stars where the fun exploration is unhindered by punishment , that experience can remain intact .
And stars that are just difficult without requiring exploration are also fine .
But for stars where there ’s a punishing skill challenge interfering with the exploration , I just skip the exploration part and take it as a skill challenge .
If it were up to me , I ’d turn off the punishment instead of the exploration for those mixed cases .
I ’m pretty confident I ’d enjoy this game more if Mario could n’t die .
But I ’ll take what I can get , and this might be enough that I ’ll actually defeat Bowser this time .
Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs , pondering a future in politics , is trying to wipe away his image as an enemy of Latino immigrants by positioning himself as a champion of that fast - growing ethnic bloc .
Mr. Dobbs , who left the network last week , has said in recent days that he is considering a third - party run for a New Jersey Senate seat in 2012 , or possibly for president .
Polls show voters unhappy with both parties , and strategists believe Mr. Dobbs could tap populist anger over economy issues just as Ross Perot did in the 1990s .

PHILADELPHIA  Christopher
Hall stepped tentatively through the entranceway of City Hall Courtroom 676 and took his place among dozens of others confronting foreclosure purgatory .
His hopes all but extinguished , he fully expected the morning to end with a final indignity :
He would sign over the deed to his house  his grandfather ’s two - story row house ; the only house in which he had ever lived ; the house where he had raised three children .
“ This is devastating , ” he said last month as he sat in the gallery awaiting his hearing .
“ This is my childhood home .
I grew up there .
My mother passed away there .
My grandfather passed away there .
All of my memories are there . ”
A union roofer , Mr. Hall , 42 , had not worked since August 2008 , when the contractor that employed him as a foreman went broke and laid off more than 40 people .
He had not made a mortgage payment in more than a year , and his lender , Bank of America , was threatening to auction off his house through the sheriff ’s office .
In most American cities , that probably would have been the end of the story : another home turned into distressed bank inventory by the national foreclosure crisis .
But in Philadelphia , under a program begun last year to try to keep people in their homes , Mr. Hall entered the courtroom with a reasonable chance of hanging on .
On the same day that we found out that motor vehicle output added 1.7 % to economic growth in the third quarter – the largest contribution to quarterly growth in over a decade – Edmunds.com has released a faulty analysis suggesting that the Cash for Clunkers program had no meaningful impact on our economy or on overall auto sales .
This is the latest of several critical “ analyses ” of the Cash for Clunkers program from Edmunds.com , which appear designed to grab headlines and get coverage on cable TV .
Like many of their previous attempts , this latest claim does n’t withstand even basic scrutiny .
The Edmunds analysis is based on two implausible assumptions :
1. The Edmunds ’ analysis rests on the assumption that the market for cars that did n’t qualify for Cash for Clunkers was completely unaffected by this program .
In other words , all the other cars were being sold on Mars , while the rest of the country was caught up in the excitement of the Cash for Clunkers program .
This analysis ignores not only the price impacts that a program like Cash for Clunkers has on the rest of the vehicle market , but the reports from across the country that people were drawn into dealerships by the Cash for Clunkers program and ended up buying cars even though their old car was not eligible for the program .
This faulty assumption leads Edmunds to a conclusion that is at odds with many independent analyses : Edmunds assumption that more than 80 % of the payback from Cash for Clunkers would occur in 2009 is n't how many mainstream analyses , including Moody 's and IHS Global Insight approach the problem ( see pages 5 and 15 of this CEA report [ PDF ] ) .
In fact , Deutsche Bank recently concluded that “ The important takeaway from recent sales trends is that it suggests that there has been minimal ' payback ' for the U.S. government ’s ' cash for clunkers ' program . ”
2. Edmunds also ignores the beneficial impact that the program will have on 4th Quarter GDP because automakers have ramped up their production to rebuild their depleted inventories .
Major automakers including GM , Ford , Honda and Chrysler all increased their production through the end of the year as a result of this program , which will help boost growth beyond the third quarter .
The actions of private market participants , who would not increase production if they did n’t think demand for their product would be there through the end of the year , is a far better indicator of market dynamics – and one that Edmunds.com conveniently ignores .
Most importantly , this program is helping boost our economy and create jobs now when we need it most .
In a comprehensive report , the Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the Cash for Clunkers will create 70,000 jobs in the second half of 2009 .
The strength of recent auto sales data suggest that , if anything , this projection underestimates the actual impact of the program .
CEA ’s analysis is transparent and comprehensive , laying out all of its assumptions for the public to understand .
Edmunds.com , on the other hand , is promoting a bombastic press release without any public access to their underlying analysis .
So put on your space suit and compare the two approaches yourself :
An arbitrator has awarded a woman nearly $ 3 m ( £ 1.8 m ) to settle her claims that she was raped in Iraq by a US state department employee in 2005 while working for a former Halliburton subsidiary .
Court records filed this week show Tracy Barker was awarded $ 2.93 m to settle her claim against military contractor KBR .
Barker had sued Houston - based Halliburton and its former KBR subsidiary in May 2007 , alleging she was sexually attacked while working as a civilian contractor in Basra , Iraq .
The Associated Press does n't usually identify those who report they were sexually assaulted , but Barker made her identity public in her lawsuit .
A Boatload of Trouble
Ever since the end of the war in the summer of 2006 between Israel and the radical Lebanese Shiite organization , Hezbollah , there has been a major effort on the part of Hezbollah to rearm , especially with offensive weapons such as rockets and medium - range missiles .
The organization has also rebuilt its bunker and defensive positions in southern Lebanon , despite the presence of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) , which expanded following the 2006 war to its current size of 12,425 troops from 30 countries .
In sheer numbers , this international force is much larger than the one I personally observed in southern Lebanon on numerous extended visits earlier this decade , when my own country of Sweden was actively participating in UNIFIL ’s mission .
Yet the sad fact is that today , notwithstanding its greatly increased size and strengthened mandate , UNIFIL has consistently failed to hinder Hezbollah from regaining its position as the only serious political and military player in southern Lebanon .
The organization has even been unable to stop continued shipments of arms to Hezbollah , despite UNIFIL ’s explicit U.N. mandate against them .
These arms shipments come mainly from Hezbollah ’s leading backer , Iran .
Since long before the 2006 war , the bulk of the weapons and munitions came overland through Syria — where they were flown in from Iran — but there have been attempts to smuggle weapons into Lebanon by sea as well .
Accordingly , it came as no great surprise last Wednesday when the Israeli navy seized an Antigua - flagged ship outside Cyprus carrying almost 400 tons of weapons originating out of an Iranian port and bound for Hezbollah , via Syria .
The cargo is considerably larger than anything previously intercepted , demonstrating the degree to which Hezbollah , and to a lesser extent Hamas in Gaza , is being resupplied by their main backer , Iran .
The shipment , of course , contravenes recent U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibiting Iran ’s arms exports and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 , which ended the 2006 Israel - Hezbollah war .
The seized weapons — including offensive ones such as Katyushas , intended to target noncombatants — show , yet again , the failure of the international community to come to grips with Hezbollah and its intent to disrupt any peace process with Israel .
This incident also shows Hezbollah ’s continuing dominance of Lebanon ’s domestic political scene .
Since the 2006 war , there has been a long series of failures in confronting Lebanon ’s truly divisive political issues , particularly the problem of militant Islamism .
Hezbollah has been able to call the shots in Lebanese politics , hindering any attempts to put together a new government unless it restores Hezbollah ’s decisive influence and reverses the movement ’s electoral loss last June .
The organization has also been able to keep the conflict with Israel alive and simmering , though avoiding any dramatic new escalation thus far .
The repercussions of the 2006 war continues to weaken liberal and democratic forces in the region , which are essential for any peace - building process to succeed .
Hezbollah ’s drive to rearm for another round with Israel endangers regional stability and has had a paralyzing effect on Lebanese democracy .
On the regional level , the 2006 war and Israel ’s Operation Cast Lead against Hamas last winter have put " armed struggle " back on the agenda .
Hezbollah continues to proclaim the 2006 war as a victory .
By tying this war to other " victories " for Islamist forces , such as the May 2000 Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese security zone and the August 2005 withdrawal from Gaza , Hezbollah and its Iranian patrons maintain the fiction that armed struggle is alive and well , and should be used as a means to defeat Israel .
This lends some popular credence to the notion that there is no need to get involved in complicated and drawn - out negotiations with uncertain outcomes .
One can get results , or so Hezbollah claims , only by taking on and defeating Israel on the battlefield .
If a sufficient number of other Arab actors adopt that self - destructive analysis , the stage will be set for many more armed conflagrations that could envelop the region for many years to come .
The seizure of the weapons cargo marks a small dent in the military buildup of Hezbollah .
But it amounts to no more than a temporary nuisance for the organization , unless the international community gets serious about implementing the resolutions that stopped the 2006 war in the first place .
As of the time of writing , there is no sign of that happening .

One often hears opponents of clean energy say that renewable sources are too expensive ; they ca n’t get by without subsidies ; they ca n’t compete in a “ free market . ”
One of the many reasons this is a daffy argument is that there is no such thing as a free market , certainly not in energy .
Existing energy sources , fossil fuels , have benefited from a century of subsidies and supporting infrastructure — and are still subsidized lavishly relative to their scrappy little competitors .
This is a point enviros often make , but a new report from the Environmental Law Institute and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars puts some teeth in it .
“ Estimating U.S. Government Subsidies to Energy Sources : 2002 - 2008 ” makes a fairly simple point , captured in this graphic :
Environmental Law Institute
As you can see , fossil fuels received the vast bulk of federal subsidies during 2002 - 2008 .
This is true in terms of direct spending , but especially true in terms of tax breaks .
Conservatives , of course , do n’t want to acknowledge that tax breaks are subsidies .
They want to call them “ incentives ” and accuse anyone who proposes repealing them of “ raising taxes . ”
It happened during the debates over the 2007 energy bill — a version that would have rolled back some oil industry tax breaks was filibustered to death by Republicans under the guise of fighting “ new taxes . ”
Industry takes the same line .
Jack Gerard , head of the American Petroleum Institute , is outraged anyone would call into question his precious subsidies incentives .
Based on his statement , his defense is that , well , taxpayers get a good bargain for all those subsidies !
Expect that battle to heat up soon .
As Steve Kretzmann reported on Grist last week , a leaked letter ( PDF ) from an Obama advisor to the other members of the G20 reveals that the administration plans to push for elimination of fossil fuel subsidies .
Says the letter : “ The G - 20 should commit to take the lead in eliminating non-needs based fossil fuel and electricity subsidies and to provide technical assistance to non-G20 countries taking steps to reduce fossil fuel and electricity subsidies . ”
Obama reinforced the point yesterday in his speech before the UN , in which he said , “ Later this week , I will work with my colleagues at the G20 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies so that we can better address our climate challenge . ”
We ’ll see how that goes .
A few stray notes
This report is actually quite conservative .
It did not include any number of things that could be considered indirect or implicit subsidies .
It did n’t include military spending to defend oil in the Middle East , spending on the electricity grid , or transportation spending .
Those things do n’t go exclusively to fossil fuels , but if there was a way of including the share that goes to fossil fuels , the fossil subsidy number would go way , way up .
Infrastructure spending has more or less exclusively supported fossil fuels for decades now .
While the main thrust of the report is the predominance of fossil fuel subsidies , obviously another lesson is that corn ethanol receives subsidies wildly out of proportion to its usefulness .
But we already knew that .
The report also did n’t include nuclear power — would be very curious to see where it ended up .
In his speech Obama touted his work with the World Bank to finance clean energy , but it ’s worth noting that the World Bank is still heavily funding dirty energy projects .
Obama needs to lean on them .
The only disagreement between Al Gore and Exxon Mobil is who gets to sink the teeth in first
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , November 3 , 2009
A common charge leveled against global warming skeptics is that they are on the payroll of transnational oil companies , when in fact the opposite is true , oil companies are amongst the biggest promoters of climate change propaganda , emphasized recently by Exxon Mobil ’s call for a global carbon tax .
According to Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson , the cap and trade nightmare being primed for passage in the Senate does n’t go far enough – Tillerson wants a direct tax on carbon dioxide emissions , essentially a tax on breathing since we all exhale this life - giving gas .
In a speech last month , Tillerson brazenly called out the cap and trade agenda for what it was , an effort to impose a carbon tax camouflaged only by a slick sales pitch and deceptive rhetoric .
“ It is easier and more politically expedient to support a cap - and - trade approach , because the public will never figure out where it is hitting them , ” said Tillerson .
“ They will just know they hurt somewhere in their pocketbook , ” he added , pointing out that he disagreed with this convoluted method of introducing a carbon tax , arguing instead that it would be more successful to openly propose a straight carbon tax .
Tillerson firmly expressed Exxon ’s support for climate change alarmists in stating , “ I firmly believe it is not too late for Congress to consider a carbon tax as the better policy approach for addressing the risks of climate change . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Exxon ’s push for a carbon tax was restated last week by its vice president for public affairs Ken Cohen , who told a conference call that he wants a climate policy that creates “ certainty and predictability , which is why we advocate a carbon tax . ”
Exxon Mobil and their ilk are not concerned about a carbon tax eating into their profits because they know they wo n’t have to pay it – the tab will be picked up by the ignorant taxpayer at the fuel pump at an inflated cost which if anything will hand the transnational oil cartels an even bigger cut .
Ideologically , Al Gore and Exxon Mobil are on exactly the same page – the only difference between the oil companies and global warming alarmists is the squabble over who will get to sink their teeth into the taxpayer and reap the dividends of the climate change scam .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Whereas parasites like Al Gore and Maurice Strong , the people who own the very carbon trading systems they claim will save the earth from CO2 emissions , want to enrich themselves to the tune of billions under a cap and trade scheme where they take a percentage of each transaction , the oil companies want to bypass this completely by simply imposing a direct CO2 tax .
The consequence for the taxpayer under either scenario will be exactly the same , and the profits under both schemes would go towards filling the coffers of the global government that will enforce the whole scam .
Emphasizing again that oil companies are firmly behind the idea of man-made climate change and the introduction of a CO2 tax , in 2007 the Trilateral Commission , one of the three pillars of the new world order in alliance with Bilderberg and the CFR , met in near secrecy to formulate policy on how best they could exploit global warming fearmongering to ratchet up taxes and control over how westerners live their lives .
At the confab , European Chairman of the Trilateral Commission , Bilderberger and chairman of British Petroleum Peter Sutherland , gave a speech to his elitist cohorts in which he issued a “ Universal battle cry arose for the world to address “ global warming ” with a single voice . ”
Echoing this sentiment was General Lord Guthrie , director of N.M. Rothschild & Sons , member of the House of Lords and former chief of the Defense Staff in London , who urged the Trilateral power - brokers to “ Address the global climate crisis with a single voice , and impose rules that apply worldwide . ”
Rules that no doubt will benefit the Rothschild family empire due to their personal ownership of a huge chunk of the carbon trading market .
Allegations that skeptics of the man-made explanation behind global warming are somehow doing the bidding of the elite are laughable in the face of the fact that Rothschild operatives and the very chairman of British Petroleum are the ones orchestrating an elitist plan to exploit global warming fears in order to achieve political objectives .
During the 2007 meeting , elitists along with oil industry kingpins called for imposing a $ 1 dollar per gallon tax at the fuel pump under the justification of fighting pollution and climate change .
Globalists love global warming .
Oil industry kingpins , Bilderbergers and Rothschild minions have all put their weight behind it .
This is a fraud conceived , nurtured and promulgated by elite , and to castigate individuals for merely questioning the motives behind climate change fearmongering by accusing them of being mouthpieces for the establishment is a complete reversal of the truth .
Claims by climate change alarmists that “ deniers ” are all funded by oil companies is yet another crudely contrived hoax .
In reality , oil companies are the most vocal proponents of man-made climate change and the most aggressive in pushing to tax CO2 emissions .
The clips below , taken from Alex Jones ’ new documentary Fall Of The Republic , expose how Al Gore serves as the front man for the global carbon tax cap and trade scheme , which is designed to bankrupt the United States and drastically lower the living standards of the American people , while introducing nightmare levels of regulation and bureaucracy into their everyday lives .

In an effort to make graphene more useful in electronics applications , Kansas State University engineers made a golden discovery -- gold " snowflakes " on graphene .
Vikas Berry is a K - State assistant professor of chemical engineering who works with graphene , a carbon material only a single atom thick and discovered just five years ago .
To functionalize graphene with gold -- thus controlling its electronics properties -- Berry and Kabeer Jasuja , a K - State doctoral student in chemical engineering , imbedded gold on graphene .
To do this , the engineers placed the graphene oxide sheets in a gold ion solution that had a growth catalyst .
Here , the atomically thick sheets swim and bathe in a pool of chemicals .
" Graphene - derivatives act like swimming molecular carpets when in solution and exhibit fascinating physiochemical behavior , " Berry said .
" If we change the surface functionality or the concentration , we can control their properties . "
They found that rather than distributing itself evenly over graphene , the gold formed islands on the sheets ' surfaces .
They named these islands snowflake - shaped gold nanostars , or SFGNs .
" So we started exploring how these gold nanostars are formed , " Berry said .
" We found out that nanostars with no surface functionality are rather challenging to produce by other chemical processes .
We can control the size of these nanostars and have characterized the mechanism of nucleation and growth of these nanostructures .
It 's similar to the mechanism that forms real snowflakes . "
Berry said the presence of graphene is critical for the formation of the gold nanostars .
" If graphene is absent , the gold would clump together and settle down as big chunks , " he said .
" But the graphene helps in stabilizing the gold .
This makes the nanostars more useful for electronic applications . "

In July , Jasuja and Berry published their work in the journal ACS - Nano .
The discovery of these gold " snowflakes " on graphene shows promise for biological devices as well as
electronics .
Berry is attaching DNA to these gold islands to make DNA sensors .
He is joined by Nihar Mohanty , a doctoral student in chemical engineering , and undergraduate researcher Ashvin Nagaraja , a senior in electrical engineering .
Nagaraja is a 2004 Manhattan High School graduate .
Berry said graphene - gold based DNA sensors will have enhanced sensitivity .
Chemically reducing graphene oxide to obtain graphene requires harsh chemicals that destroy the DNA .
" Now we can use the harsh chemicals on graphene oxide imbedded with gold to obtain graphene with gold islands .
Then we can use these gold islands to functionalize DNA . "
Berry also is using graphene in conjunction with microwaves .
He and Jasuja are " cooking " the graphene sheets as another way to produce particles on the material 's surface .
advertisement
Some of Berry 's other graphene research involves using the modified graphene sheets to compartmentalize a coagulating solution , thus stabilizing it .
His group has recently used hydrides to reduce graphene oxide to produce reduced graphene oxide in the matter of a few seconds .
The graphene produced in this way can remain stable in the solution for several days .
Further results will shortly appear in the journal Small
Discovered only five years ago , graphene has captured the attention of a large number of researchers who are studying its exceptional electrical , mechanical and optical properties , Berry said .
His research group is among the few studying the material 's interfacial properties and biological applications .
" We 're entering a new era , " Berry said .
" From the zero - dimensional or one - dimensional molecular or polymer solutions , we are now venturing into the two - dimensional graphene solutions , which have fascinating new properties . "

I 've been worrying lately about what happens when we finally achieve a taboo - free , totally unrestrained society , without any barriers , boundaries , insecurities , or oppressions .
Will people still read and write fiction ?
Or will the perfection of our new world sap away our impulse to create , leaving us lazy , diffident , and uninspired ?
Does censorship and oppression in society drive us to take greater risks and give us the fuel to make masterpieces ?
Can art only be defined by the evils that direct it ?
If every truth is acceptable merely by virtue of being true , then how will people learn to lie anymore ?
Does no more oppression mean no more fiction ?
The truth about censorship is that censors care more about art than regular people .
They are more affected by language and its conflicts , and they lead their lives on the bleeding edge between annihilation and redemption by the artificial .
What they read matters .
What they hear matters .
What they see matters .
Censors are the last aesthetes : their world is one where beauty , filth , and sensation are the most important impulses to both revere and deny .
In many ways , a dutiful and psychotic censor is the ideal audience .
They can still be shocked .
They are analyzing your work for deeper meanings and reading " under the surface " for subversive allegory .
For a censor to declare a work of art dangerous and to destroy it is the ultimate declaration of love .
There is no need to fear censorship or oppression anymore , because with the advent of the " Information Age , " it is almost impossible to remove anything .
The opposite problem is true : we lose important works in the glut and overload of unskillful pornography .
There are no more barriers to entry for publishing , recording , or illustrating .
Now , the only apotheosis is to be hated .
Creators must embrace and welcome censorship these days , courting detractors just as ardently as they cultivate allies .
It is time to admit that censorship is not categorically bad ; that it actually highlights the [ deleted ] it is most trying to [ deleted ] .
Censorship is like medicine for a blemish that makes the blemish glow bright red .
And the medicine always runs out before the blemish heals .
Censorship makes innocent things into monsters !
Careful deletion can make craven songs of shy longing into bold statements of demand and desire !
Careful deletion can turn morose and meandering sonic explorations into crass chronicles of torrid assignation !

Careful deletion can reveal the deeper truth behind " safe " ardour !

Militants continued Monday to exact a price on Pakistan for the government ’s ongoing offensive against the Taliban near the Afghan border , killing 35 people in a suicide bombing attack on military personnel and civilian workers lined up at a bank to get their monthly wages and pension checks .
The midmorning blast in the city of Rawalpindi , just a few hundred yards from the Pakistani army ’s sprawling headquarters , was followed by another suicide bombing at a highway checkpoint outside the eastern city of Lahore that injured at least 15 people .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack .
The incidents followed a relentless surge in militant violence across Pakistan last month as the government launched its long - awaited military operation to crush the local Taliban in its stronghold in rugged , largely lawless South Waziristan .
Nearly 300 people were killed in those attacks .
The ongoing violence led the United Nations to announce Monday that it was suspending long - term development efforts in the country ’s northwest and pulling out some of its non-Pakistani staff members .

Pakistani military commanders say that the offensive in South Waziristan continues to make significant progress as it hems in Taliban and Uzbek militants from three directions .
Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Monday that 12 militants had been killed in the previous 24 hours , and troops had recovered five truckloads of militant arms and explosives and destroyed two sites where roadside bombs were being made .
However , with no end in sight to the battle in South Waziristan , militant retaliatory strikes on major Pakistani cities have taken a devastating toll on everyday life in the Muslim nation of 180 million .
Many private schools in Islamabad , the capital , have been shuttered for two weeks while administrators struggle to shore up security at their buildings .
Last week , the northwestern city of Peshawar was rocked by a car bombing at a market that killed 118 people and injured at least 200 .
The attack occurred at a bazaar filled with fabric stores and cosmetics shops , and many of the casualties were women and children .
“ Our forces are fighting to get rid of the terrorists , whether it ’s in Waziristan or Islamabad , ” Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said Monday at a news conference in the capital .
“ This is not a small group , and these are not simple criminals .
But we are fighting them . ”

Pakistani militants have broadened their array of targets in recent weeks .
Schools across the country were shut down last month after two suicide bombers attacked a college campus in Islamabad , killing six people .
On Oct. 9 , another bustling market in Peshawar was hit by a suicide attack that killed 53 people .
The target Monday appeared to be the active and retired military officials who line up each month at a branch of the National Bank of Pakistan to pick up their pension checks and wages .
The bomber drove up on a motorcycle and detonated explosives while people waited in line , said Rao Iqbal , deputy inspector general for the Rawalpindi police .
At least 80 people were standing outside the bank when the blast occurred , witnesses said .

“ I was inside when the blast hit and the windows of the bank came crashing in , ” said Muhammad Rafiq , 30 , a Pakistani army official who was picking up his monthly wages .
“ When I came outside , there were dead and injured lying all over the street .
This war on terrorism is making it difficult for us to live .
We ca n’t even go outside . ”
The indiscriminate nature of the recent attacks was cited by U.N. officials as one of the primary reasons why the organization was suspending its long - term aid work in the northwest , which includes Pakistan ’s volatile tribal areas as well as the Swat Valley , where troops fought to regain control of the region from Taliban militants over the summer .
The United Nations has lost 11 staff members in militant attacks in Pakistan this year .
The latest deaths occurred Oct. 5 , when a suicide bomber dressed in a paramilitary uniform walked into the lobby of the World Food Program office in Islamabad and killed five workers .
The U.N. move applies to aid programs slated to last five years or longer .
In a statement , the organization said it would limit its work to humanitarian relief , emergency and security efforts and “ any other essential operations as advised by the secretary - general . ”
U.N. workers who remain in the country will be given additional security .

In the attack outside Lahore , two attackers wearing explosives - laden jackets were confronted by police at a checkpoint on a highway to the city , police said .
The militants jumped out of their car , ran toward police and detonated their explosives , said Lahore Police Chief Pervez Rathore .
Two of the police officers at the checkpoint were critically injured , he said .
When police inspected the car , they found about 26 pounds of explosives hidden in containers of milk and wheat .

Feed the World
As a retired farmer , I know that the information in “ Grassoline at the Pump , ” by George W. Huber and Bruce E. Dale , about agricultural residues is false in a most dangerous way .
There is NO extra residue from the corn harvest .
Sure , you can take it away and use it to create fuel .
But that residue is desperately needed right where it fell , to renew the soil .
All of it and more are needed to sustain our already low organic matter levels created by years of plowing and other unsustainable agricultural practices .
Soil can and does “ die , ” and then it is unable to produce food .
Energy creation is important , but so is our ability to feed the world .
Camille Florence Coers
Charlotte , N.C .
THE AUTHORS REPLY : Biofuels researchers are striving to improve soil fertility as much as possible during biofuels production .
Fortunately , there are ways to remove crop residues for use as biofuels while increasing soil fertility .
For example , the organic matter can be balanced by reduced tillage practices ; by double cropping , where two crop varieties are planted in succession in the same growing season ; and by the use of cover crops that replenish the soil .
The Dale lab Web site ( www.everythingbiomass.org) details some of our work showing how such practices can provide both biofuels and fertile soil .
Your July cover story could not be timelier as oil prices remain volatile .
The types of fuels envisioned by “ Grassoline ” have great potential for aircraft usage .
Several U.S. carriers , including Continental Airlines , have conducted successful test flights using alternative fuels , but significant hurdles remain before these can be certified for commercial use .
It is critical that we support further research and development for alternative jet fuels .

As an admirer of the Skeptic column , I find it unfortunate that Michael Shermer ’s opus 100 , “ I Want to Believe , ” contains what I believe is a serious fault .
Shermer cites negative results of tests of the power of prayer to heal .
What if God simply declines to cooperate with our tests of His existence ?
Shermer asks what existed before our universe began .
Why should we assume that God did not exist before our universe or before all universes ?
I have never seen a scientific test that can prove or disprove God ’s existence .
In scientific terms , Shermer is correct ; the null hypothesis is no argument .
In religious terms , faith is everything .
In my opinion , separation of church and science is as important as separation of church and state .
Scientists who want to prove scientifically that God does not act in our lives play into the hands of religious spokespeople who want to prove that God controls our lives .

The Vision Thing
In “ Origins of the Left and Right Brain , ” Peter F. MacNeilage , Lesley J. Rogers and Giorgio Vallortigara mention Rogers ’s experiments involving keeping a hen ’s eggs in darkness so the right eye is not stimulated and consequently the left hemisphere does not develop normally .
In humans information from the left visual field of each eye is processed in the right hemisphere , and vice versa .
Is this not the case with chickens , or does this fact cast doubt on Rogers ’s conclusions ?
George F. Feissner
Cortland , N.Y .
THE AUTHORS REPLY :
The projections from eye to brain are different in birds and humans .
In birds each eye projects virtually entirely to the opposite hemisphere , whereas in humans the left side of the visual world relative to the point where the eyes are fixating projects to the right side of the eye and then to the same side of the brain , and vice versa .
This difference is irrelevant to the point we made about the relative efficiency of lateralized and unlateralized bird brains .
It was simply that when lateralization does not develop , unlateralized birds are less efficient at concurrent feeding and predator evasion .
Do n’t Do as I Say
“ The Science of Bubbles and Busts , ” by Gary Stix , delves into the psychology of the marketplace , which makes for an interesting article .
But by focusing on the behavior of small individual investors , it completely misses the largest contributions to the bubble .
Propping up real estate with artificially low interest rates and bogus appraisals , institutionalized accounting fraud within corporate America , easy rating of securities as “ AAA , ” highly leveraged derivatives gambling , swaps in excess of target companies ’ net worth followed by selling those targets short , suspect trading programs such as PRIMEX , and a deliberately paralyzed regulatory community all contributed more to the fleecing of workers ’ 401Ks than the herd mentality .
Fraudsters were merely taking advantage of those human traits .

Benoît Mandelbrot has been very vocal on the faulty assumptions that are regularly employed in economics .
I contend , however , that it is actually the false belief in determinism that is at fault .
And the illusion of predictability afforded by the deterministic view is every bit as potent as the money illusion .
Jonathan J. Dickau

Anyone who has lived in the southwestern part of the U.S. for any length of time over the past few decades will surely appreciate how grave the situation has become for some Americans when considering that the ranks of day laborers standing on street corners in the morning are no longer restricted to recent immigrants and illegal aliens .
It should be clear to even the most casual observer that the biggest busts have occurred in parts of the country where the biggest booms once flourished - that would be California , Nevada , and Arizona - where tales of woe are now spreading as fast as home prices rose back in the first half of the decade .
The poll to the right from a recent story in the Las Vegas Sun ( hat tip EU ) reflects the current state of affairs for 551 people in and around Sin City where many are now hoping that the wave of foreclosure sales - homes that once sold for $ 300,000 now flying off the shelf at around $ 100,000 - will somehow revive the city 's economy to its mid-decade glory .
At this point , they 'd probably be happy with simply getting back to a slightly larger fraction of the activity that was seen in the Nevada desert four or five years ago , economic statistics produced during those halcyon days likely to be seen only in history books for many , many years to come .
Anyway , it seems that the Smiths and the Joneses are joining the Rodriguezes and the Hernandezes outside of Home Depots .
To wit :
The new faces of day labor
U.S. citizens are joining immigrants in store parking lots
It sounds like a George Lopez joke .
“ Times are so bad that I saw an Anglo day laborer standing outside Home Depot the other day . ”
Except it ’s true .
In the latest sign of the Las Vegas Valley ’s economic free fall , U.S. citizens are starting to show up in the early mornings outside home improvement stores and plant nurseries across the Las Vegas Valley , jostling with illegal immigrants for a shot at a few hours of work .
Experts say the slow - starting but seemingly inexorable trend is occurring nationwide .
“ It ’s the equivalent of selling apples in the Great Depression , ” said Harley Shaiken , chairman of the Center for Latin American studies at the University of California , Berkeley .
But it is not only a sign of the times , they add .
If the numbers of citizens among the day laborers in cities across the country continue to grow , it ’s likely to increase the ire of followers of TV host Lou Dobbs and others who will see illegal immigrants as stealing food off the tables of the nation ’s native - born or naturalized poor .
The whole thing is worth a look , the plight of " americanos " such as 50 - year old Ken Buchanan ( pictured above ) does n't appear to be all that uncommon around the country with the trend expected to continue for some time .
Opponents of health care reform periodically argue that legislation is unnecessary because anybody can get medical assistance through the emergency room — or that those who get in trouble have only themselves for blame by not buying insurance .
My Sunday column tells the story of John Brodniak , a young man who had insurance with his job , but lost both when he developed a benign tumor in his brain .
Read his story and see if you still think the need for universal coverage is n’t urgent .
His story seems to me the best rebuttal of the skeptics .
Of course , my column does n’t get into the issue of costs .
They are a real issue , for universal health care is expensive .
But as I ’ve noted the annual cost of health reform and the annual cost of our Afghan deployment is about the same — except the former is paid for , while the latter is n’t .
( And the Senate bill , in particular , does begin to address cost control . )
It ’s ultimately a question of priorities , and every other industrialized country has found the resources to pay for universal health coverage , so it ’s difficult to imagine that the United States is too poor to do so .
Read the column and post your thoughts .
UPDATE : Several readers have asked how they can help or if there is a fund to help John .
There is n’t any such fund , but with John and Esther ’s permission I ’m posting their mailing address : John and Esther Brodniak , 770 W Main St. , Sheridan , OR 97378 .
UPDATE 2 : A couple of surgeons in Oregon have offered to help John without charge .
It looks as if things will work out .
UPDATE 3 : Several readers are asking about a Michelle Malkin account claiming that John was already receiving treatment at OHSU .
That ’s incorrect .
John had one appointment at OHSU .
He says he was told to give up , that they could not help him , and he was despairing when he told me about it .
A doctor at OHSU gave me the same account : John had seen one doctor once .
And after seven months he still was n’t getting treatment or help managing pain .
In any case , he says that after the column appeared , he suddenly got a series of phone calls from OHSU saying that they wanted to see him and could address his needs after all .
It now appears that he will get treated , and other doctors are also offering him assistance .
I came across a cute video about game theory .
The video is about an experiment where children are asked to share a pile of chocolate coins .
The twist to is they had to follow the rules of the ultimatum game .
Specifically , here is how the game worked .
One child got to offer a split of the chocolate ( “ 9 pieces for me , 1 for you ”  ) .
Then , the other child could either accept the split and take the candy .
Or , she could reject the split and both would go home empty - handed .
What should happen ?
Game theory predicts the proposer has the advantage .
In theory , the second player –the one hearing the proposal–should be favorable to most offers .
The reason is that rejecting an proposal leads to a zero payout .
It is better to get something rather than nothing , so the second player is likely to accept most offers even if she ends up with little .
Consequently , the proposer can make almost any offer and will make one that gives him most of the chocolate .
In effect , the proposer can make an ultimatum which the second player will find hard to refuse .
Of course , the game does not always works so smoothly in practice .
How do the children play this game ?
.

* I am in the dark about the show .
I would be very grateful to anyone that can identify the source of this show / experiment .
My video transcription
Narrator :
In this experiment , seven and eight year olds are sharing a stash of ten chocolate coins .
One child decides on how they are split , and they can offer as many or as few coins as they like .
Children in experiment : [ offer various splits from one to three coins ]
Narrator :
At first they keep more for themselves .
But there is a catch .
It is the other child who gets to decide if the split is fair .
If not , they can refuse the offer .
And then , both children have to go away empty - handed .
Will they get away with it ?
Children in experiment : [ almost all reject small offers ]
Child 1 : What do you mean [ you reject ] ?
That means you do n’t get any chocolate !
Child 2 : I do n’t care .
It ’s already too little .
Narrator : Almost all of the children reject the smaller share , preferring to have nothing at all .
It may seem strange , but it is not .
By going without themselves , they are punishing their partner who loses even more chocolate .
And they are not going to forget that in a hurry .
Look what happens when the experiment is repeated .
Children in experiment : [ most offer nearly even split ]
Narrator : Now , with a fairer split , what will the response be ?
Children in experiment : [ most accept nearly even split ]
Narrator :
The children are happy to accept .
It is not difficult to see why we have evolved this way .
If we react instinctively against people who cheat , they will think twice before trying it again .
And it has left us all with a taste of fairness .
This video raises many interesting questions .
Here are a few thoughts that came across my mind :
What game are we playing ?
In the first round , many of the children give small offers which are rejected .
This comes as a surprise to many of the proposers .
Why might this happen ?
It appears the receiver of the offer gets almost no satisfaction from the pittance of an offering .
Instead the receiver gets joy from rejecting the offer and punishing .
The lesson ?
The children are playing a larger game .
The ultimatum game is not wrong , per se , but it is obvious the children are not playing it .
They are instead playing the game of “ I want candy , but if you are not fair I will be more than happy to punish you . ”
And it is the very fact that they change the game that alters the outcome .
Repeated play changes the game
Repeated games can have very different outcomes from one - shot games .
In a one - shot ultimatum , one would fully expect low offers to be accepted .
But not so in a repeated game .
In this experiment , the children likely do better by rejecting the offer in the first game and getting an even split in the second ( netting say 5 chips ) than they would have been by accepting two sets of low offers ( netting say 2 chips ) .
Fairness is very important in division
It is not always easy to say what is fair .
But it is often the case we know what is unfair .
Fair division is a topic that comes up time and again , in splitting bills , determining homeowner fees , and even in eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches .
The children are obviously concerned with a fair split which affects the outcome and prevents the offerer from making unreasonable ultimatums .
Discussion questions
1 . How might the game change if the children played with other foods like vegetables or slices of pizza ?
Or money ?
2 . Do you think the children knew the game would be repeated ?
3 . Would the outcome be different if the children switched partners between the first and second games ?
4 . How would the game be different if the recipient could give a counter - offer ?
[ this is sometimes called the double ultimatum game ]
5. Comment on how this experiment is similar to the song “ Before He Cheats ” by Carrie Underwood [ video on youtube ]
6 . Offers to the ultimatum game vary worldwide .

The following is an email exchange I received from a concerned friend of a woman whose husband is divorcing her and citing the information on A Shrink for Men as a reason to end the relationship .
I decided to open this dialog to my readers because there is important information to be gleaned from it .
I ’d also like to know your thoughts .
What are your thoughts on couple ’s counseling before divorce ?
I have a friend whose husband ( soon to be ex ) refuses to go see a counselor with her , siting many of the articles on your web site as his reasons .
It seems to me that if he has really done nothing wrong as he says , he should go to at least 1 session with her before throwing in the towel .
He simply quotes you , saying there can be no closure with a narcissistic / borderline woman , so there is no point .
Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated , as I hate to see my wonderful friend ’s marriage fall apart because he found a blog he can relate to .
Thanks ,
Lois
Hi Lois ,
If a couple has decided to divorce the only reason I can see going to couples counseling is if children are involved .
In which case , the couple would have a session or two re : how to tell the children and so a therapist can explain what parental alienation is and , in no uncertain terms , that neither parent should trash the other in front of the children .
Couples therapy is n’t supposed to be used to assign blame or to coerce someone into remaining in a relationship .
When you write , “ if he has really done nothing wrong as he says , he should go to at least 1 session with her before throwing in the towel ” it sounds as if he ’s on trial and that his claims of emotional abuse are n’t to be believed .
Would you encourage a female friend who was being abused by her husband to go to therapy before “ throwing in the towel ? ”
He ’s the one who lived with the woman .
I do n’t know who this man is , but if that ’s his experience , it ’s his experience and he should n’t have to prove it to a therapist , to you or to anyone else .
If your friend truly does have the issues I write about , then it does n’t matter what her husband has or has n’t done .
He could ’ve been the kindest , sweetest man in the world and she still would ’ve dumped on him .
If this is the case , I can see why he would n’t want to go to therapy to become the marital scapegoat again .
Kind Regards ,
Dr Tara
In rereading Lois ’ first email , I neglected to mention in my response that my blog is not the cause of her friend ’s divorce , but her friend ’s abuse of her husband .
I nearly missed that twister - roo .
Very subtle mis-assignment of blame .
Hat ’s off , Lois .
Have you ever wondered why he can relate to my blog ?
Here ’s Lois ’s reply three days later .
My guess is that she had to consult “ her friend ” for a pow - wow :
Thanks for the quick response .
The only problem I see with the advice on your website is that so many men could claim some of these personality traits applied to their wife / GF at certain points .
What woman does n’t go a little “ crazy ” now and then ?
If you say a normal woman does n’t , then you ’re not living in reality .
It ’s almost like you ’ve created this fabulous brand and are selling your product to these men without them realizing that they are being controlled by yet another woman .
I think the woman you describe on your website is actually a small percentage of the women all these men claim have npd / bpd .
It would be interesting for you to write about the possiblilities of some men using this as an easy way out .
What easier way to not have to deal with the repercussions of divorce than to simply say , “ She ’s crazy , there can be no closure , so I ca n’t even discuss this with her further . ”
I guess I ’m so bothered by all of this because I ’m watching your advice in action .
My friend is a good , nice person .
She deals with anxiety issues and can have some pretty bad pms moments , but overall she is great ( she is like a sister to me so I ’ve seen her at her best and worst . ) .
Her husband is a good , nice man that deals with some anxiety issues and addiction issues ( he is most recently being prescribed to 40 + mg of Adderall a day– having been prescribed to this before I know how it can make you feel by the end of the day ) .
She questioned his abilities to own his own business which was probably a serious blow to his manhood and he has never been the same ( she supported him while he was starting a business ; he had already abandoned one business and decided to try this one out ) .
They immediately separated and he has since taken to quoting your advice when she tries to talk about anything with him .
Your advice seems to have gotten in the wrong hands !
No where do you talk about the fact that this can happen .
It seems that a good dr. would lay this all out for her patient .
Unless they are more like customers and what customer is going to come back if they ’re not hearing what they want to hear .
I ’m not sure if this is the case with you , but you need to realize that these are real people ’s lives you ’re playing with , and it ’s frightening to think of the damage you are doing .
This website is a great resource for men involved with npd / bpd women - definitely .
I ’m just inclined to believe that it is a small percentage of women that actually have this disorder .
Can you honestly say you ’ve never had a “ crazy bitch ” moment in your life ?
In my opinion , maybe you should n’t look at marriage as so disposable .
Thanks again for your time , Lois
Here is my open reply to Lois :
Hi Lois ,
Let me address your most recent email point - by - point .
1 . The only problem I see with the advice on your website is that so many men could claim some of these personality traits applied to their wife / GF at certain points .
What woman does n’t go a little “ crazy ” now and then ?
Actually , this is n’t the only problem you have with my advice as you go onto cite many more .
If you have at all bothered to read my site , you ’ll notice I ’m very clear that these behaviors are n’t isolated , one - time incidents .
They ’re a pervasive and consistent established pattern of behavior demonstrated across time .
Furthermore , most healthy non-abusive women do not go “ a little crazy now and then ” like NPD / BPD women do .
No one ’s perfect , but having a bad day is n’t on the same par as being emotionally abusive .
Having a bad day is n’t the norm and an adult acknowledges that he or she was out of line , does n’t blame their partner and tries their damnedest not to behave like that again .
2 . It ’s almost like you ’ve created this fabulous brand and are selling your product to these men without them realizing that they are being controlled by yet another woman .
First , I do n’t get paid to produce this website .
I write it in my spare time and it ’s free of charge .
Second , just because your friend ’s husband recognized his wife ’s behavior as abusive through the information I provide ( which is documented on many other websites and publications , but usually directed toward female targets of abuse ) does n’t mean he ’s being controlled by yet another woman .
It just means that your friend is losing her ability to control her soon - to - be ex-husband and he ’s making choices for himself .
There ’s a difference .
I ca n’t make anyone do anything nor would I even try to do so .
I believe in empowering through education .
This means encouraging an individual to gather as much information as possible to make the best informed decisions .
Additionally , I do n’t go out trawling for readers .
They find my website by searching the Internet for explanations for their wives ’ or girlfriends ’ behaviors .
3 . It would be interesting for you to write about the possibilities of some men using this as an easy way out .
What easier way to not have to deal with the repercussions of divorce than to simply say , “ She ’s crazy , there can be no closure , so I ca n’t even discuss this with her further . ”
Divorce is never an easy way out , especially if you ’re in an emotionally abusive relationship .
Prolonged abuse disorients a person , causes you to doubt yourself and your judgment and completely strips you of your self - confidence .
Ending this kind of relationship is often painfully difficult because when the abuser senses she ’s losing control , she ratchets up the abuse and bombards her target , for example , by enlisting her friends and family to interfere in the process .
4 . My friend is a good , nice person .
She deals with anxiety issues and can have some pretty bad pms moments , but overall she is great .
. . PMS or Narcissistic rage episode ?
Anxiety issues or borderline insecurity riddled accusations ?
Po - ta - to — Po -tah - to .
To - ma - to — To - mah - to .
PMS is not an excuse to take your rage and anxiety out on another person .
Unless she has pre-menstrual psychosis , in which case she should be hospitalized .
5 . Her husband is a good , nice man that deals with some anxiety issues and addiction issues ( he is most recently being prescribed to 40 + mg of Adderall a day .
. .
I assume a licensed Medical Doctor is prescribing him Adderall for attentional deficits and not because he ’s addicted to crank .
How do you arrive at the conclusion this is an “ addiction ? ”
6 . She questioned his abilities to own his own business which was probably a serious blow to his manhood and he has never been the same ( she supported him while he was starting a business .
. .
So which is it ?
Did she undermine his confidence and belittle him or support him ?
You ca n’t do both simultaneously .
How do you define “ support ? ” Financial ?
Emotional ?
Do you mean your friend had to work while her husband was starting a business ?
If so , that ’s not going above and beyond .
That ’s what a well - functioning couple does for one another .
7 . They immediately separated and he has since taken to quoting your advice when she tries to talk about anything with him .
Your advice seems to have gotten in the wrong hands !
No where do you talk about the fact that this can happen .
Separation and divorce does n’t usually happen out of the blue .
There ’s typically a build - up of hurt and frustration .
However , for many women with BPD / NPD , it does seem to happen “ all of a sudden ” because they do not have the capacity for introspection nor the ability to hold themselves accountable .
As for my advice “ getting into the wrong hands , ” I ’m sure it happens .
Just like it happens when emotionally abusive NPD / BPD women find sites for female targets of abuse and use the information therein to attack and abuse their husbands or boyfriends and justify their bad behavior .
It works both ways and I can’t control this .
8 . You need to realize that these are real people ’s lives you ’re playing with , and it ’s frightening to think of the damage you are doing .
Again , I do n’t force anyone to do anything .
I offer information and options .
Instead , you might want to consider the damage women with NPD / BPD do to the people in their lives .
It ’s very real and , contrary to your beliefs , it happens far more often than you think .
For every man who shares his experiences on this website there are thousands more out there suffering in silence .
9 . This website is a great resource for men involved with npd / bpd women - definitely .
I ’m just inclined to believe that it is a small percentage of women that actually have this disorder .
Can you honestly say you ’ve never had a “ crazy bitch ” moment in your life ?
Thanks for the backhanded compliment , Lois .
As previously noted , the statistics indicate that the gender ratio of abuse in a relationship is about a 50 - 50 split .
Why is this so hard for you to accept ?
Would it cause you to have to look at your own behavior in relationships ?
Also previously noted , everyone overreacts from time to time and says or does things that they regret .
However , these moments are out of character and infrequent , not the norm .
When I have a bad day , I do n’t go crazy .
I maintain control over my emotions and insecurities by thinking them through rather than lashing out at others .
On the rare occasion when I become inpatient or short - tempered , I recognize my behavior as hurtful and out of line almost immediately , get myself in check , acknowledge what I ’ve done , apologize and then make the effort not to do it again .
However , this is n’t about me .
You ’re writing to me for your friend .
10 .
In my opinion , maybe you should n’t look at marriage as so disposable .
Nowhere do I state that marriage is disposable .
I take marriage just as seriously as I take abuse .
Emotionally or physically abusing your spouse is a deal - breaker .
It breaks the most fundamental marriage vows to love , honor and respect .
I would argue that emotionally abusive women view marriage and their partners as disposable because they certainly treat them like garbage .
Instead of focusing on helping your friend try to keep her husband in a marriage he clearly no longer wants , perhaps you can help her think through how she arrived to this outcome , so that she does n’t replay it in future relationships .
Best ,

Washington ( CNN ) --
Nearly two years into the recession , opinion about which political party is responsible for the severe economic downturn is shifting , according to a new national poll .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Friday morning indicates that 38 percent of the public blames Republicans for the country 's current economic problems .
In May , 53 percent blamed the GOP .
According to the poll , 27 percent now blame the Democrats for the recession , up 6 points from May , and 27 percent now say both parties are responsible .
" The bad news for the Democrats is that the number of Americans who hold the GOP exclusively responsible for the recession has been steadily falling by about two to three points per month , " said Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
" At that rate , only a handful of voters will blame the economy on the Republicans by the time next year 's midterm elections roll around .. "
Thirty - six percent of people questioned said that President Obama 's policies have improved economic conditions , with 28 percent feeling that the president 's programs have made things worse , and 35 percent saying what he 's done has had no effect on the economy .
One reason for that , Holland said , may be the growing federal budget deficit :
Two - thirds say that the government should balance the budget even in a time of war and recession .
The survey indicates that only 18 percent said the economic conditions in the country today are good , down 3 points from August .
Eighty - two percent said economic conditions are poor .
" Some economic indicators may suggest that the economy has turned the corner -- but try telling that to the American people , " Holland said .
The number of Americans who said the economy is in good shape -- a number that grew steadily through the spring and summer -- has now stalled , with fewer than one in five expressing a positive view of current conditions .
More than eight in 10 say that economic conditions are in poor shape , with 43 percent calling them very poor .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted November 13 - 15 , with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .

This is what I hate having to explain to my relatives and friends abroad in Europe about politics in the US .
We know that global warming is a fact .
We know that our actions , if they did n't cause global warming , definitely exacerbate it .
We know that we must reduce our dependency on oil , for both ecological and political / strategic reasons .
And yet , what we are able to do is hampered so predictably by the Republican party :
The Politco , acting as a mouthpiece for the Republican Party ?
Say it is n't so !
Can you imagine how much further we'd get in this country if we did n't have so many idiots in office ?
by Alex Ross
The New Yorker , February 16 and 23 , 2004
This essay was republished as the first chapter of my book Listen To This .
For more information , go here .
I hate “ classical music ” : not the thing but the name .
It traps a tenaciously living art in a theme park of the past .
It cancels out the possibility that music in the spirit of Beethoven could still be created today .
It banishes into limbo the work of thousands of active composers who have to explain to otherwise well - informed people what it is they do for a living .
The phrase is a masterpiece of negative publicity , a tour de force of anti-hype .
I wish there were another name .
I envy jazz people who speak simply of “ the music . ”
Some jazz aficionados also call their art “ America ’s classical music , ” and I propose a trade : they can have “ classical , ” I ’ll take “ the music . ”
For at least a century , the music has been captive to a cult of mediocre élitism that tries to manufacture self - esteem by clutching at empty formulas of intellectual superiority .
Consider some of the rival names in circulation : “ art ” music , “ serious ” music , “ great ” music , “ good ” music .
Yes , the music can be great and serious ; but greatness and seriousness are not its defining characteristics .
It can also be stupid , vulgar , and insane .
Music is too personal a medium to support an absolute hierarchy of values .
The best music is music that persuades us that there is no other music in the world .
This morning , for me , it was Sibelius ’s Fifth ; late last night , Dylan ’s “ Sad - Eyed Lady of the Lowlands ” ; tomorrow , it may be something entirely new .
I ca n’t rank my favorite music any more than I can rank my memories .
Yet some discerning souls believe that the music should be marketed as a luxury good , one that supplants an inferior popular product .
They say , in effect , “ The music you love is trash .
Listen instead to our great , arty music . ”
They gesture toward the heavens , but they speak the language of high - end real estate .
They are making little headway with the unconverted because they have forgotten to define the music as something worth loving .
If it is worth loving , it must be great ; no more need be said .
When people hear “ classical , ” they think “ dead . ”
The music is described in terms of its distance from the present , its resistance to the mass — what it is not .
You see magazines with listings for Popular Music in one section and for Classical Music in another , so that the latter becomes , by implication , Unpopular Music .
No wonder that stories of its imminent demise are so commonplace .
The Web site ArtsJournal features a media file with the deliberately ridiculous name Death of Classical Music Archive , whose articles recycle a familiar litany of problems : record companies are curtailing their classical divisions ; orchestras are facing deficits ; the music is barely taught in public schools , almost invisible on television , ignored or mocked by Hollywood .
But the same story could have been written ten years ago or twenty .
If this be death , the record is skipping .
A complete version of the Death of Classical Music Archive would go back to the fourteenth century , when the sensuous melodies of ars nova were thought to signal the end of civilization .
The classical audience is assumed to be a moribund crowd of the old , the white , the rich , and the bored .
Statistics provided by the National Endowment for the Arts suggest that the situation is not quite so dire .
Yes , the audience is older than that for any other art — the median age is forty - nine — but it is not the wealthiest .
Musicals , plays , ballet , and museums all get larger slices of the $ 50,000 - or - more income pie ( as does the ESPN channel , for that matter ) .
If you want to see an in - your - face , Swiss - bank - account display of wealth , go look at the millionaires sitting in the skyboxes at a Billy Joel show , if security lets you .
Nor is the classical audience aging any faster than the rest of America .
The music may not be a juggernaut , but it is a major world .
American orchestras sell around thirty million tickets each year .
Brilliant new talents are thronging the scene ; the musicians of the august Berlin Philharmonic are , on average , a generation younger than the Rolling Stones .
The music is always dying , ever - ending .
It is an ageless diva on a non -stop farewell tour , coming around for one absolutely final appearance .
It is hard to name because it never really existed to begin with — not in the sense that it stemmed from a single time or place .
It has no genealogy , no ethnicity : leading composers of today hail from China , Estonia , Argentina , Queens .
The music is simply whatever composers create — a long string of written - down works to which various performing traditions have become attached .
It encompasses the high , the low , empire , underground , dance , prayer , silence , noise .
Composers are genius parasites ; they feed voraciously on the song matter of their time in order to engender something new .
They have gone through a rough stretch in the past hundred years , facing external obstacles ( Hitler and Stalin were amateur music critics ) as well as problems of their own invention ( “ Why does n’t anyone like our beautiful twelve - tone music ? ” ) .
But they may be on the verge of an improbable renaissance , and the music may take a form that no one today would recognize .
For now , it is like the “ sunken cathedral ” that Debussy depicts in one of his Preludes — a city that chants beneath the waves .
II .
The critic Greg Sandow recently wrote in his online journal that we partisans of the classical need to speak more from the heart about what the music means .
He admits that it ’s easier to analyze his ardor than to express it .
The music does not lend itself to the same generational storytelling as , say , “ Sgt. Pepper . ”
There may be kids out there who lost their virginity during Brahms ’s D - Minor Piano Concerto , but they do n’t want to tell the story and you do n’t want to hear it .
The music attracts the reticent fraction of the population .
It is an art of grand gestures and vast dimensions that plays to mobs of the quiet and the shy .
It is a paradise for passive - aggressives , sublimation addicts , and other relics of the Freudian world .
Which may explain why it has a hard time expressing itself in the time of Dr. Phil .
I am a thirty - six - year - old white American male who first started listening to popular music at the age of twenty .
In retrospect , this seems strange ; perhaps “ freakish ” is not too strong a word .
Yet it seemed natural at the time .
I feel as though I grew up not during the seventies and eighties but during the thirties and forties , the decades of my parents ’ youth .
They came of age in the great American middlebrow era , when the music had a much different place in the culture than it does today .
In those years , in what now seems like a surreal dream world , millions listened as Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony on national radio .
Walter Damrosch explained the classics to schoolchildren , singing ditties to help them remember the themes .
( My mother remembers one of them : “ This is / The sympho-nee / That Schubert wrote but never fi-nished . . . ” ) NBC would broadcast Ohio State vs. Indiana one afternoon , a recital by Lotte Lehmann the next .
In my house , it was the Boston Symphony broadcast followed by the Redskins game .
I was unaware of a yawning gap between the two .
Early on , I reached for my parents ’ record collection , which was well stocked with artifacts of the Golden Age .
I listened to Toscanini ’s Brahms , Koussevitzky ’s Sibelius , the Budapest Quartet .
The look and feel of the records were inseparable from the sound they made .
They said so much to me that for a long time I had no curiosity about other music .
There was Otto Klemperer ’s Zeppelin - like , slow - motion account of “ The St. Matthew Passion , ” with nightmare - spawning art by the Master of Delft .
Toscanini ’s fierce recordings were decorated with Robert Hupka ’s snapshots of the Maestro in motion , his face registering every emotion between ecstasy and disgust .
Mozart ’s Divertimento in E - Flat featured the famous portrait in which the composer looks down at the world in sorrow , like a general surveying a hopeless battle .
While listening , I read along in the liner notes , which were generally written in the over - the - top everyman - orator style that Orson Welles parodied brilliantly in “ Citizen Kane .
” Tchaikovsky ’s Violin Concerto , for example , was said to be “ melancholy , sometimes progressing to abysmal depths . ”
None of this made sense at the time ; I had no acquaintance with melancholy , let alone abysmal depths .
What mattered was the exaggerated swoop of the thought , which roughly matched the pattern of the sound .
The first music that I loved to the point of distraction was Beethoven ’s “ Eroica ” Symphony .
My parents had a disk of Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic — one of a series of Music - Appreciation Records put out by the Book - of - the - Month Club .
A companion record provided Bernstein ’s analysis of the symphony , a road map to its forty - five - minute sprawl .
I now had names for the shapes that I perceived .
( The conductor ’s “ Joy of Music ” and “ Infinite Variety of Music ” remain the best introductory books of their kind . )
Bernstein drew attention to something that happens about ten seconds in — a C - sharp that unexpectedly sounds against the plain E - flat - major harmony .
“ There has been a stab of intrusive otherness , ” he said , cryptically but seductively , in his nicotine baritone .
Over and over , I listened to this note of otherness .
I bought a score and deciphered the notation .
I learned some time - beating gestures from Max Rudolf ’s conducting manual .
I held my family hostage in the living room as I led the record player in a searingly intense performance of the “ Eroica . ”
Did Lenny get a little carried away when he called that soft C - sharp in the cellos a “ shock , ” a “ wrench , ” a “ stab ” ?
If you were to play the “ Eroica ” for a fourteen - year - old hip - hop scholar versed in the works of Eminem and 50 Cent , he might find it shockingly boring at best .
No one is slicing up his wife or getting shot nine times .
But I would submit to my young gangsta interlocutor that those artists are relatively shocking — relative to the social norms of their day .
Although the “ Eroica ” ceased to be controversial in the these - crazy - kids - today sense around 1830 , within the “ classical ” frame it has continued to deliver its surprises right on cue .
Seven bars of E - flat major , then the C - sharp that hovers for a moment before disappearing : it is like a speaker stepping up to a microphone , launching into the first words of a grand oration , and then faltering , as if he had just remembered something from childhood or seen a sinister face in the crowd .
I do n’t identify with the listener who responds to the “ Eroica ” by saying , “ Ah , civilization . ”
That was n’t what Beethoven wanted : his intention was to shake the European mind .
I do n’t listen to music to be civilized ; sometimes , I listen precisely to escape the ordered world .
What I love about the “ Eroica ” is the way it manages to have it all , uniting Romanticism and Enlightenment , civilization and revolution , brain and body , order and chaos .
It knows which way you think the music is going and veers triumphantly in the wrong direction .
The Danish composer Carl Nielsen once wrote a monologue for the spirit of Music , in which he or she or it says , “ I love the vast surface of silence ; and it is my chief delight to break it . ”
Around the time I got stabbed by Beethoven ’s C - sharp , I began trying to write music myself .
My career as a composer lasted from the age of eight to the age of twenty .
I lacked both genius and talent .
My spiral - bound manuscript book includes an ambitious program of future compositions : thirty piano sonatas , twelve violin sonatas , various symphonies , concertos , fantasias , and funeral marches , most of them in the key of D minor .
Scattered ideas for these works appear in the following pages , but they do n’t go anywhere , which was the story of my life as a composer .
Still , I treasure the observation of one of my college teachers , who wrote on the final page of my end - of - term submission that I had created a “ most interesting and slightly peculiar sonatina . ”
I put down my pen and withdrew into silence , like Sibelius in Järvenpää .
My inability to finish anything , much less anything good , left me with a profound respect for this impossible mode of making a living .
Composition at its most intense is a rebellion against reality .
No one except the very young demands new music , and even when we are young the gates of inattention crash down quickly .
Composers manufacture a product that is universally deemed superfluous — at least until their music enters public consciousness , at which point people begin to say that they could not live without it .
For more than a century , the repertory has consisted largely of music by dead composers .
Yet half of those on the American Symphony Orchestra League ’s top - ten most - performed list — Mahler , Strauss , Ravel , Shostakovich , Prokofiev — had n’t been born when the first draft of the repertory got written .
Throughout my teens , I took piano lessons from a man named Denning Barnes .
He also taught me composition , music history , and the art of listening .
He was a wiry man with tangled hair , whose tweed jackets emitted an odd smell that was neither pleasant nor unpleasant , just odd .
He was intimate with Beethoven , Schubert , and Chopin , and he also loved twentieth - century music .
Scriabin , Bartók , and Berg were three favorites .
He opened another door for me , in a wall that I never knew existed .
His own music , as far as I can remember , was rambunctious , jazzy , a little nuts .
One day he pounded out one of the variations in Beethoven ’s final piano sonata and said that it was an anticipation of boogie - woogie .
I had no idea what boogie - woogie was , but I was excited by the idea that Beethoven had anticipated it .
The marble - bust Beethoven of my childhood suddenly became an eagle - eyed sentinel on the ramparts of sound , spying nameless entities on the horizon .
“ Boogie - woogie ” was a creature out of Bernstein ’s serious - fun world , and Mr. Barnes was my private Bernstein .
There was not a snobbish bone in his body ; he was a skeleton of enthusiasm , a fifteen - dollar - an - hour guerrilla fighter for the music he loved .
He died of a brain tumor in 1989 .
The last time I saw him , we played a hair - raising version of Schubert ’s Fantasia in F Minor for four hands .
It was full of wrong notes , most of them at my end of the keyboard , but it felt great and made a mighty noise , and to this day I have never been able to tolerate any other performance of the work , not even Britten and Richter ’s .
By high school , a terrible truth had dawned : I was the only person my age who liked this stuff .
Actually , there were other classical nerds at my school , but we were too diffident to form a posse .
Several “ normal ” friends dragged me to a showing of “ Pink Floyd — The Wall , ” after which I conceded that one passage sounded Mahlerian .
Only in college did my musical fortress finally crumble .
I spent most of my days and nights at the campus radio station , where I had a show and helped organize the classical contingent .
I fanatically patrolled the boundaries of the classical broadcasting day , refusing to surrender even fifteen minutes of “ Chamber Music Masterworks ” and the like .
At 10 p.m. , the schedule switched from classical to punk , and only punk of the most recondite kind .
Once a record sold more than a few hundred copies , it was kicked off the playlist .
The d.j.s liked to start their sets with the shrillest , crudest songs in order to scandalize the classical crowd .
I tried to one - up them by ending my show with squalls of Xenakis .
They hit back with Sinatra singing “ Only the Lonely . ”
Once , they followed up my heartfelt tribute to Herbert von Karajan with Skrewdriver ’s rousing neo -Nazi anthem “ Prisoner of Peace ” : “ Free Rudolf Hess / How long can they keep him there ?
We can only guess . ”
Touché .
The thing about these cerebral punk rockers is that they were easily the most interesting people I ’d ever met .
Between painstakingly researched tributes to Mission of Burma and the Butthole Surfers , they composed undergraduate theses on fourth - century Roman fortifications and the liberal thought of Lionel Trilling .
I began hanging around in the studio after my show was over , suppressing an instinctive fear of their sticker - covered leather jackets and multicolored hair .
I informed them , as Mr. Barnes would have done , that Schoenberg had anticipated all of this .
And I began listening to new things .
The first two rock records I bought were Pere Ubu’s “ Terminal Tower ” compilation and Sonic Youth ’s “ Daydream Nation . ”
I crept from underground rock to alternative rock and finally to the full - out commercial kind .
Soon I was astounding my friends with pronouncements like “ ‘ Highway 61 Revisited ’ is a pretty good album , ” or “ The White Album is a masterpiece . ”
I abandoned the notion of classical superiority , which led to a crisis of faith : if the music was n’t great and serious and high and mighty , what was it ?
For a little while , living in Northern California after college , I thought of giving up on the music altogether .
I sold off a lot of my CDs , including all my copies of the symphonies of Arnold Bax , in order to pay for more Pere Ubu and Sonic Youth .
I cut my hair short , wore angry T - shirts , and started hanging out at the Berkeley punk club 924 Gilman Street .
I became a fan of a band called Blatz , which was about as far from Bax as I could get .
( Their big hit was “ Fuk Shit Up . ” )
Fortunately , no one needed to point out to my face that I was in the wrong place .
It is a strange American dream , this notion that music can give you a new personality , a new class , even a new race .
The out - of - body experience is thrilling as long as it lasts , but most people are eventually deposited back at the point where they started , and they may begin to hate the music for lying to them .
When I went back to the classical ghetto , I chose to accept its limitations .
I realized that , despite the outward decrepitude of the culture , there was still a bright flame within .
It occurred to me that if I could somehow get from Brahms to Blatz , others could go the same route in the opposite direction .
I have always wanted to talk about classical music as if it were popular music and popular music as if it were classical .
For many , popular music is the soundtrack of raging adolescence , while the other kind chimes in during the long twilight of maturity .
For me , it ’s the reverse .
Listening to the “ Eroica ” reconnects me with a kind of childlike energy , a happy ferocity about the world .
Since I came to pop music late , I invest it with more adult feeling .
To me , it ’s penetrating , knowing , full of microscopic shades of truth about the way things really are .
Dylan ’s “ Blood on the Tracks ” anatomizes a doomed relationship with a saturnine clarity that a canonical work such as “ Die Schöne Müllerin ” ca n’t match .
( Listening recently to Ian Bostridge sing the Schubert cycle , I had the thought that the protagonist might never have spoken to the miller girl for whose sake he drowns himself .
How classical of him . )
If I were in a perverse mood , I ’d say that the “ Eroica ” is the raw , thuggish thing — a blast of ego and id — whereas a song like Radiohead ’s “ Everything in Its Right Place ” is all cool adult irony .
The idea that life is flowing along with unsettling smoothness , the dark C - sharpness of the world sensed but not confirmed , is a resigned sort of sentiment that Beethoven probably never even felt , much less communicated .
What I refuse to accept is that one kind of music soothes the mind and another kind soothes the soul .
Depends on whose mind , whose soul .
On my iPod I ’ve been listening to the new Missy Elliott song “ Wake Up . ”
It ’s an austere hip - hop track with a political edge .
Something about the music sets off my classical radar .
There are , effectively , only three notes , free - floating and ambiguous .
The song begins with a clip of a voice shouting “ Wake up ! ”
The voice rises up a tritone , and that interval determines the notes .
The idea of generating music from the singsong of speech is ancient , but “ Wake Up ” reminds me in particular of two minimalist pieces by Steve Reich , “ It ’s Gonna Rain ” and “ Come Out . ”
Both use tapes of impassioned black voices to create seething electronic soundscapes .
Whether Elliott and her producer , Timbaland , have listened to Reich is beside the point .
( If you say , “ Of course they have n’t , ” ask yourself what makes you so certain . )
The song works much like Reich ’s compositions , building a world from a sliver of sound .
It ’s almost manic and obsessive enough to be classical music .
III .
The fatal phrase came into circulation late in the game .
From Monteverdi to Beethoven , modern music was the only music , bartered about in a marketplace that resembled modern pop culture .
Concerts were eclectic hootenannies in which opera arias collided with chunks of sonatas .
Barrel - organ grinders carried the best - known arias out into the streets , where they were blended with folk tunes .
Concerts in pre-classical America were a stylistic free - for - all , a mirror of the country ’s mixed - up nature .
Walt Whitman mobilized grand opera as a metaphor for democracy ; the voices of his favorite singers were integral to the swelling sound of his “ barbaric yawp . ”
In Europe , the past began to overwhelm the present just after 1800 .
Johann Nikolaus Forkel ’s 1802 biography of Bach , one of the first major books devoted to a dead composer , may be the founding document of the classical mentality .
All the earmarks are there : the longing for lost worlds , the adulation of a single godlike entity , the horror of the present .
Bach was “ the first classic that ever was , or perhaps ever will be , ” Forkel proclaimed .
“ If the art is to remain an art and not to be degraded into a mere idle amusement , more use must be made of classical works than has been done for some time . ”
By “ idle amusement ” Forkel had in mind the prattling of Italian opera ; his biography is addressed to “ patriotic admirers of true musical art , ” namely the German .
The notion that the music of Forkel ’s time was teetering toward extinction is , of course , amusing in retrospect ; in the summer of 1802 , Beethoven began work on the “ Eroica . ”
Scholars eventually defined the Classical Era as Viennese music of the late eighteenth century , especially Mozart and Haydn , who , in their day , had been racy , modern figures .
The word was nonsense from the outset .
The rise of “ classical music ” mirrored the rise of the commercial middle class , which employed Beethoven as an escalator to the social heights .
Concert halls grew quiet and reserved , habits and attire formal .
Improvisation was phased out ; the score became sacred .
Audiences were discouraged from applauding while the music was going on — it had been the custom to clap after a good tune or a dazzling solo — or between movements .
Patrons of the Wagner festival in Bayreuth proved notoriously militant in the suppression of applause .
At an early performance of “ Parsifal , ” listeners hissed an unmusical vulgarian who yelled out “ Bravo ! ” after the Flower Maidens scene .
The troublemaker had reason to feel embarrassed ; he had written the opera .
The Wagnerians were taking Wagner more seriously than he took himself — an alarming development .
Composers liked the fact that listeners were quieting down ; the subtle shock of a C - sharp would n’t register if the crowd were chattering away .
Even so , the emergence of a self - styled élite audience had limited appeal for the likes of Beethoven and Verdi , who did not come from that world .
The nineteenth - century masters were , most of them , monstrous egomaniacs , but they were not snobs .
Verdi wrote for the masses , and he scandalously proclaimed the box office the only barometer of success .
Wagner , surrounded by luxury , royalty , and extreme pretension , nonetheless railed against the emergence of a “ classical ” repertory , for which he blamed the Jews .
His nauseating anti-Semitism went hand in hand with a sometimes deeply charming populism .
In a letter to Liszt , he raged against the “ monumental character ” of the music of his time , the “ clinging and sticking to the past . ”
Another letter demanded , “ Kinder ! macht Neues !
Neues ! , und abermals Neues ! ” Ezra Pound condensed this thought as “ Make it new . ”
Unfortunately , the European bourgeoisie , having made a demigod of Beethoven , began losing interest in even the most vital living composers .
In 1859 , a critic wrote , “ New works do not succeed in Leipzig .
Again at the fourteenth Gewandhaus concert a composition was borne to its grave . ”
The crazy modern music in question was Brahms ’s First Piano Concerto .
By 1870 , seventy - five per cent of works in the Gewandhaus repertory were by dead composers .
The fetishizing of the past had a degrading effect on composers ’ morale .
They began to doubt their ability to please this implacable audience , which seemed prepared to reject their wares no matter what style they wrote in .
If no one cares , composers reasoned , we might as well write for connoisseurs — or for each other .
This was the mentality that gave birth to the phenomenon of Arnold Schoenberg .
The relationship between composer and public became a vicious circle ; the more the composer asserted independence , the more the public clung to the past .
A critic who attended the première of the “ Eroica ” saw the impasse coming : “ Music could quickly come to such a point , that everyone who is not precisely familiar with the rules and difficulties of the art would find absolutely no enjoyment in it . ”
The American middle class carried the worship of the classics to a necrophiliac extreme .
Lawrence Levine , in his book “ Highbrow / Lowbrow , ” gives a devastating portrait of the country ’s musical culture at the turn of the twentieth century .
It was a world that abhorred virtuosity , extravagance , anything that smacked of entertainment .
Orchestras dedicated themselves to “ the great works of the great composers greatly performed , the best and profoundest art , these and these alone , ” in the redundant words of the conductor Theodore Thomas , who was the founder of the modern American orchestra .
Early in his career , Thomas tried to attract the masses , conducting in parks and beer gardens .
Later , he decided that the working classes could never appreciate greatly great great music like Beethoven’s .
He was a marvellous conductor , by all accounts , but his infatuation with “ cultivated persons ” set a bad precedent .
Within a decade or two , American symphonic culture was so ossified that progressive spirits were calling for change .
“ America is saddled , hag - ridden , with culture , ” the critic - composer Arthur Farwell wrote in 1911 .
“ There is a conventionalism , a cynicism , a self - consciousness , in symphony concert , recital , and opera . ” Daniel Gregory Mason , a maverick Columbia professor , similarly attacked the “ prestige - hypnotized ” plutocrats who ran the New York Philharmonic .
He found more excitement at open - air concerts at Lewisohn Stadium , in Harlem , where the audience freely expressed its enthusiasm .
Mason delightedly quoted a notice that read , “ We would respectfully request that the audience refrain from throwing mats . ”
His sentiment still rings true — concerts would be better if there were more throwing of mats .
In the nineteen - thirties , Farwell ’s populist philosophy took root .
A generation of composers , conductors , and broadcasters embraced the idea of “ music for all . ”
The storied middlebrow age began .
David Sarnoff , the head of NBC , had a vision of Toscanini conducting for a vast public , and the public duly materialized .
The first broadcast day of CBS featured an American opera : “ The King ’s Henchman , ” by Deems Taylor .
Hollywood studios hired composers such as Korngold , Copland , and Herrmann and pursued the modernist giants Schoenberg and Stravinsky ( both of whom asked for too much money ) .
F.D.R. funded a Federal Music Project that in two and a half years entertained ninety - five million people ; there were concerts in delinquent - boys ’ homes and rural Oklahoma towns .
A Boston reporter pictured one Federal opera performance as a storming of the Bastille : “ Drivers , chauffeurs , and footmen were occupying the seats of the master and the madame at 83 cents a chair . ”
Perhaps the boldest forward leap was the invention of a hybrid music combining European tradition and new popular forms .
Duke Ellington wrote symphonic jazz for Carnegie Hall ; his “ Black , Brown , and Beige ” was heard there in 1943 .
Morton Gould and Leonard Bernstein wrote for orchestra , jazz ensemble , and Broadway without worrying about the ranking of each .
The ultimate phenomenon was George Gershwin , who rose through Tin Pan Alley and then through the orchestral world , transforming America ’s idea of what a composer was .
For all his Jazz Age glamour , some part of Gershwin remained a lonely classical kid — the hard - practicing pianist who had filled scrapbooks with concert programs from Cooper Union and Wanamaker ’s Auditorium .
In Vienna , in 1928 , Gershwin met his idol , Alban Berg , who had the Kolisch Quartet play him the “ Lyric Suite . ”
Gershwin then sat down at the piano , but hesitated , wondering aloud whether he was worthy of the occasion .
“ Mr. Gershwin , ” Berg said sternly , “ music is music . ”
The middlebrow utopia sputtered out quickly , and for a variety of reasons .
Federally funded arts projects fell victim to a classic American culture war — the Republicans versus the New Deal — for which fanatics on both the left and the right were to blame .
Orchestras that had flourished on radio foundered on television .
( No one wants to get that close to oboists . )
But the real problem was with the competition .
Jazz was satisfying a hunger for popular art that in previous eras only classical composers had been able to satisfy .
Ellington and Mingus were pulling off the same synthetic feat that Mozart and Verdi had accomplished before them ; they were picking up pieces of every form of available music — African - American , Latin , Gypsy , Debussy , operetta — and transforming them through the force of their personalities .
Lately , I have been reading the young intellectuals who embraced jazz in the twenties , and I recognize their urge to join the party .
Carl Van Vechten , the notorious author of “ Nigger Heaven , ” started out as a music critic for the Times ; he witnessed “ The Rite of Spring ” and embraced Stravinsky as a savior .
Then his attention began to wander .
He found more life and truth in ragtime , Tin Pan Alley , and , eventually , blues and jazz .
In a 1917 article for Vanity Fair , he predicted that Tin Pan Alley songwriters were likely to be considered “ the true grandfathers of the Great American Composer of the year 2001 . ”
For young African - American music mavens , the disenchantment was more bitter and more personal .
Some were children of a middle class that had taken to heart Dvorák ’s 1893 prophecy of a great age of Negro music .
The likes of James Weldon Johnson awaited the black Beethoven who would write the music of God ’s trombones .
Soon enough , these aspiring violinists , pianists , and composers came up against a wall of racism .
Only in popular music could they make a living .
Many — Fletcher Henderson , for example — turned to jazz .
The twenties saw a huge change in music ’s social function .
Classical music had given the middle class aristocratic airs ; now popular music helped the middle class to feel down and dirty .
There is American musical history in one brutally simplistic sentence .
I recently watched a silly 1934 movie entitled “ Murder at the Vanities , ” which seemed to sum up the genre wars of the era .
It is set behind the scenes of a Ziegfeld - style variety show , one of whose numbers features a performer , dressed vaguely as Franz Liszt , who plays the Second Hungarian Rhapsody .
Duke Ellington and his band keep popping up behind the scenes , throwing in insolent riffs .
Eventually , they drive away the effete classical musicians and play a takeoff called “ Ebony Rhapsody ” : “ It ’s got those licks , it ’s got those tricks / That Mr. Liszt would never recognize . ”
Liszt comes back with a submachine gun and mows down the band .
The metaphor was n’t so far off the mark .
Although many in the classical world were fulsome in their praise of jazz — Ernest Ansermet lobbed the word “ genius ” at Sidney Bechet — others fired verbal machine guns in an effort to slay the upstart .
Daniel Gregory Mason , the man who wanted more throwing of mats , was one of the worst offenders , calling jazz a “ sick moment in the progress of the human soul . ”
The contempt flowed both ways .
The culture of jazz , at least in its white precincts , was much affected by that inverse snobbery which endlessly congratulates itself on escaping the élite .
( The singer in “ Murder at the Vanities ” brags of finding a rhythm that Liszt , of all people , could never comprehend : what a snob . )
Classical music became a foil against which popular musicians could assert their earthy cool .
Composers , in turn , were irritated by the suggestion that they constituted some sort of moneyed behemoth .
They were the ones who were feeling bulldozed by the power of cash .
Such was the complaint made by Lawrence Gilman , of the Tribune , after Paul Whiteman and his Palais Royal Orchestra played “ Rhapsody in Blue ” at Aeolian Hall .
Gilman did n’t like the “ Rhapsody , ” but what really incensed him was Whiteman ’s suggestion that jazz was an underdog fighting against symphony snobs .
“ It is the Palais Royalists who represent the conservative , reactionary , respectable elements in the music of today , ” Gilman wrote .
“ They are the aristocrats , the Top Dogs , of contemporary music .
They are the Shining Ones , the commanders of huge salaries , the friends of Royalty . ”
The facts back Gilman up .
By the late twenties , Gershwin was making at least a hundred thousand dollars a year .
In 1938 , Copland , the best - regarded composer of American concert music , had $ 6.93 in his checking account .
All music becomes classical music in the end .
Reading the histories of other genres , I often get a warm sense of déjà vu .
The story of jazz , for example , seems to recapitulate classical history at high speed .
First , the youth - rebellion period : Satchmo and the Duke and Bix and Jelly Roll teach a generation to lose itself in the music .
Second , the era of bourgeois grandeur : the high - class swing band parallels the Romantic orchestra .
Stage 3 : artists rebel against the bourgeois image , echoing the classical modernist revolution , sometimes by direct citation ( Charlie Parker works the opening notes of “ The Rite of Spring ” into “ Salt Peanuts ” ) .
Stage 4 : free jazz marks the point at which the vanguard loses touch with the mass and becomes a self - contained avant - garde .
Stage 5 : a period of retrenchment .
Wynton Marsalis ’s attempt to launch a traditionalist jazz revival parallels the neo-Romantic music of many late - twentieth - century composers .
But this effort comes too late to restore the art to the popular mainstream .
Jazz recordings sell about the same as classical recordings , three per cent of the market .
The same progression worms its way through rock and roll .
What were my hyper - educated punk - rock friends but Stage 3 high modernists , rebelling against the bloated Romanticism of Stage 2 stadium rock ?
Right now , there seems to be a lot of Stage 5 classicism going on in what remains of rock and roll .
The Strokes , the Hives , the Vines , the Stills , the Thrills , and so on hark back to some lost pure moment of the sixties or seventies .
Their names are all variations on the Kinks .
Many of them use old instruments , old amplifiers , old soundboards .
One rocker was recently quoted as saying , “ I intentionally wo n’t use something I have n’t heard before . ” Macht Neues , kids !
So far , hip - hop has proved resistant to this kind of classicizing cycle , but you never know .
It is just a short step from old school to the Second Viennese School .
The original classical is left in an interesting limbo .
It has a chance to be liberated from the social clichés that currently pin it down .
It is no longer the one form carrying the burden of the past .
Moreover , it has the advantage of being able to sustain constant reinterpretation , to renew itself with each repetition .
The best kind of classical performance is never a retreat into the past but rather an intensification of the present .
When you hear a great orchestra perform Beethoven ’s “ Eroica , ” it is n’t like a rock band trying to mimic the Beatles — it is like the Beatles re-incarnated .
The mistake that apostles of the classical have always made is to have joined their love of the past to a dislike of the present .
The music has other ideas : it hates the past and wants to escape .
IV .
I have seen the future , and it is called Shuffle — the setting on the iPod that skips randomly from one track to another .
I ’ve transferred about a thousand songs , works , and sonic events from my CD collection to my computer and on to the MP3 player .
There is something thrilling about setting the player on Shuffle and letting it decide what to play next .
Sometimes its choices are a touch delirious — I had to veto an attempt to forge a link between György Kurtág and Oasis — but the little machine often goes crashing through barriers of style in ways that change how I listen .
For example , it recently made a segue from the furious crescendo of “ The Dance of the Earth , ” ending Part I of “ The Rite of Spring , ” right into the hot jam of Louis Armstrong ’s “ West End Blues . ”
The first became a gigantic upbeat to the other .
For a second , I felt that I was at some madly fashionable party at Carl Van Vechten’s .
On the iPod , music is freed from all fatuous self - definitions and delusions of significance .
There are no record jackets depicting bombastic Alpine scenes or celebrity conductors with a family resemblance to Rudolf Hess .
Instead , music is music .
It seems to me that a lot of younger listeners think the way the iPod thinks .
They are no longer so invested in a single genre , one that promises to mold their being or save the world .
This gives the life - style disaster called “ classical music ” more of a chance .
Although the music is far from attaining any sort of countercultural cachet , it is no longer a plausible target for teen rebellion , given that all the parents listen to the Eagles .
( A colleague pointed out to me that the movie “ School of Rock ” pictures a private school where classical music is forced down students ’ throats .
The closing credits do n’t specify which alternate universe this is set in . )
Committed rock fans are likely to know a fair amount about twentieth - century composition , especially the avant - garde .
Mavens of electronic dance music list among their heroes Stockhausen , Terry Riley , and , especially , Steve Reich , who avoids the temptation to sue his less inventive admirers .
Mark Prendergast ’s book “ The Ambient Century , ” a history of the new electronic genres , begins , startlingly enough , with Gustav Mahler .
The new buzzword in progressive circles is “ post - classical . ”
The phrase was coined by the writer Joseph Horowitz , and it neatly expresses exasperation with the C word without jettisoning it .
It also hints that life will go on even if monuments of the old classical empire falter .
The scholar Robert Fink is even predicting a Richard Strauss - style “ death and transfiguration . ”
Post - classical composers are writing music heavily influenced by minimalism and its electronic spawn , but they are still immersed in the complexity of composition .
They just do n’t need to advertise an entire course of study on the surface of a work .
Likewise , new generations of musicians are dropping the mask of Olympian detachment ( silent , stone - faced musician walks onstage and begins to play ) .
They ’ve started mothballing the tuxedo , explaining the music from the stage , using lighting and backdrops to produce a mildly theatrical experience .
They are finding allies in the “ popular ” world , some of whom care less about record sales than the average star violinist .
The London Sinfonietta , for example , will be playing a program next month of Aphex Twin , Jamie Lidell , and other sonic scientists from the Warp Records label , pairing their work with the constructions of Reich and Cage .
The borders between “ popular ” and “ classical ” are becoming creatively blurred , and only the Johann Forkels in each camp see a problem .
The strange thing about the music in America today is that large numbers of people seem aware of it , curious about it , even mildly knowledgeable about it , but they do not go to concerts .
The people who try to market orchestras have a name for these annoying phantoms : they are “ culturally aware non-attenders , ” to quote a recent article in the magazine Symphony .
I know the type ; most of my friends are case studies .
They know the principal names and periods of musical history : they know what Nietzsche said about Wagner , they can pick Schoenberg and Stravinsky out of a lineup , they own Glenn Gould ’s “ Goldberg Variations ” and some Mahler and perhaps a CD of Arvo Pärt .
They follow all the other arts — they go to gallery shows , read new novels , see art films .
Yet they have never paid money for a classical concert .
They almost make a point of their ignorance .
“ I do n’t know a thing about Beethoven , ” they say , which is not what they would say if the subject were Henry James or Stanley Kubrick .
This is one area where even sophisticates wrap themselves in the all - American anti-intellectual flag .
It ’s not all their fault : centuries of classical intolerance have gone into the creation of the culturally aware non-attender .
When I tell people what I do for a living , I see the same look again and again — a flinching sideways glance , as if they were about to be reprimanded for not knowing about C - sharps .
After this comes the serene declaration of ignorance .
The old culture war is fought and lost before I say a word .
I ’m imagining myself on the other side — as a thirty - six - year - old pop fan who wants to try something different .
On a lark , I buy a record of Otto Klemperer conducting the “ Eroica , ” picking this one because Klemperer is the father of Colonel Klink , on “ Hogan ’s Heroes . ”
I hear two impressive loud chords , then something that the liner notes allege is a “ truly heroic ” theme .
It sounds kind of feeble , lopsided , waltz - like .
My mind drifts .
A few days later , I try again .
This time , I hear some attractive adolescent grandeur , barbaric yawps here and there .
The rest is mechanical , remote .
But each time I go back I map out a little more of the imaginary world .
I invent stories for each thing as it happens .
Big chords , hero standing backstage , a troubling thought , hero orating over loudspeakers , some ideas for songs that do n’t catch on , a man or woman pleading , hero shouts back , tension , anger , conspiracies — assassination attempt ?
The nervous splendor of it all gets under my skin .
I go to a bookstore and look at the classical shelf , which seems to have more books for Idiots and Dummies than any other section .
I read Bernstein ’s essay in “ The Infinite Variety of Music , ” coördinate some of the examples with the music , read fun stories of the composer screaming about Napoleon , and go back and listen again .
Sometime after the tenth listen , the music becomes my own ; I know what ’s around almost every corner and I exult in knowing .
It ’s as if I could predict the news .
I am now enough of a fan that I buy a twenty - five - dollar ticket to hear a famous orchestra play the “ Eroica ” live .
It is not a very heroic experience .
I feel dispirited from the moment I walk in the hall .
My black jeans draw disapproving glances from men who seem to be modelling the Johnny Carson collection .
I look around dubiously at the twenty shades of beige in which the hall is decorated .
The music starts , but I find it hard to think of Beethoven ’s detestation of all tyranny over the human mind when the man next to me is a dead ringer for my dentist .
The assassination sequence in the first movement is less exciting when the musicians have no emotion on their faces .
I cough ; a thin man , reading a dog - eared score , glares at me .
When the movement is about a minute from ending , an ancient woman creeps slowly up the aisle , a look of enormous dissatisfaction on her face , followed at a few paces by a blank - faced husband .
Finally , three grand chords to finish , which the composer obviously intended to set off a roar of applause .
I start to clap , but the man with the score glares again .
One does not applaud in the midst of greatly great great music , even if the composer wants one to !
Coughing , squirming , whispering , the crowd visibly suppresses its urge to express pleasure .
It ’s like mass anal retention .
The slow tread of the Funeral March , or Marcia funebre , as everyone insists on calling it , begins .
I start to feel that my newfound respect for the music is dragging along behind the hearse .
But I stay with it .
For the duration of the Marcia , I try to disregard the audience and concentrate on the music .
It strikes me that what I ’m hearing is an entirely natural phenomenon , nothing more than the vibrations of creaky old instruments reverberating around a boxlike hall .
Each scrape of a bow translates into a strand of sound ; what I see is what I hear .
So when the cellos and basses make the floor tremble with their big deep note in the middle of the march ( what Bernstein calls the “ wham ! ” ) the force of the moment is purely physical .
Amplifiers are for sissies , I ’m starting to think .
The orchestra is n’t playing with the same cowed intensity as Klemperer ’s heroes , but the tone is warmer and deeper and rounder than on the CD .
I make my peace with the stiffness of the scene by thinking of it as a cool frame for a hot event .
Perhaps this is how it has to be : Beethoven needs a passive audience as a foil .
To my left , a sleeping dentist ; to my right , an angry aesthete ; and , in front of me , the funeral march that rises to a fugal fury , and breaks down into softly sobbing memories of themes , and then gives way to an entirely new mood — hard - driving , laughing , lurching , a little drunk .
Two centuries ago , Beethoven bent over the manuscript of the “ Eroica ” and struck out Napoleon ’s name .
It is often said that he made himself the protagonist of the work instead .
Indeed , he engendered an archetype — the rebel artist hero — that modern artists are still recycling .
I wonder , though , if Beethoven ’s gesture meant what people think it did .
Perhaps he was freeing his music from a too specific interpretation , from his own preoccupations .
He was setting his symphony adrift , as a message in a bottle .
He could hardly have imagined it travelling two hundred years , through the dark heart of the twentieth century and into the pulverizing electronic age .
But he knew it would go far , and he did not weigh it down .
There was now a torn , blank space on the title page .
The symphony became a fragmentary , unfinished thing , and unfinished it remains .
It becomes whole again only in the mind and soul of someone listening for the first time , and listening again .
The hero is you .
My list of ten suggested classical recordings .
Back to Alex Ross : The Rest Is Noise
Lawmakers in the House voted 220 to 215 on Saturday night to approve a sweeping overhaul of the nation 's health care system .
Only one Republican voted for the bill , and 39 Democrats opposed it , including 24 members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition .
An overwhelming majority of the Democratic lawmakers who opposed the bill — 31 of the 39 — represent districts that were won by Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , in the 2008 presidential election , and a third of them were freshmen .
Nearly all of the fourteen freshmen Democrats who voted “ no ” represent districts that were previously Republican and are considered vulnerable in 2010 .
Geographically , 22 lawmakers from southern states formed the largest opposition bloc .
Below are details on the Democrats that opposed the health care legislation in the House .
Since its discovery a quarter century ago , the DNA fingerprint has been hailed as a pivotal tool in solving crimes and exonerating those wrongly convicted .
But as it celebrates its 25th anniversary , the question of how DNA evidence is being used and how samples are being extracted , have come under fire from civil rights activists and many criminal justice experts .
Proposition 69 , passed in 2004 , made California one of now 21 states that require DNA sampling for some arrestees .
This voter - approved initiative mandated that this extend to all felony arrestees by Jan. 1 , 2009 — and the legal backlash has already begun .
Earlier this month the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California ( ACLU - NC ) filed a lawsuit against the state of California charging that the statute on DNA collection violates search and seizure laws under the Fourth Amendment , and due process under the 14th Amendment .
The ACLU ’s lawsuit has fueled the debate over the limits and scope of DNA sampling even as its use is accelerating .
In August 2007 , eight states required DNA samples from some arrestees .
That number has continued to rise , jumping 50 percent — from 14 states to 21 — just this year .
In April the federal government began taking samples from suspects arrested on federal crimes , and will also collect DNA from detained undocumented immigrants .
On one side are those who argue , like the lawyers in the ACLU case , that collecting samples from anyone merely arrested for a crime violates fundamental civil rights .
On the other side are those pushing for continued expansion of the database , championed as the foundation of crime prevention in the 21st century .
The FBI , which administers the National DNA Index , says that more than 94,000 cases have been aided through its database network .
Law enforcement agencies have long collected personal data from those arrested , ranging from photographs and home addresses to fingerprints .
But until recently , DNA evidence has only been collected from the most violent offenders .
“ People who are doing nothing more than exercising free speech right are finding themselves with their DNA on government databases , ” said Michael Risher , lead attorney on the ACLU case .
Risher is concerned about the “ incremental , uni- directional ” push towards expanding criminal DNA databases by including those never convicted of or charged with any crime .
The founder of DNA fingerprinting , British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys , expressed concern this year over law enforcement ’s expansion of the United Kingdom ’s database after the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the U.K. ’s retention of biological samples and DNA profiles of people suspected but not convicted of offenses “ failed to strike a fair balance between the competing public and private interests . ”
It is the lack of public discourse on the subject that concerns Marina Ortega , associate director of Generations Ahead , an Oakland - based group that works towards expanding the public debate on genetic technologies and promoting policies protecting human rights .
“ Most of what ’s happening is happening between scientists and lobbyists , ” said Ortega .
“ The technology is moving much faster than society ’s ability to understand it . ”
Risher said he does not oppose the extraction of DNA samples wholesale , just the increasingly broad expansion of the law .
“ DNA evidence is a fantastic tool in the criminal justice system , but like any tool , you have to be careful to use it wisely . ”
Lily Haskell is a plaintiff in the ACLU ’s case .
She was arrested in March at a protest on the sixth anniversary of the Iraq War , but ultimately was never charged with anything .
By law she was forced to give a DNA sample .
“ When my DNA was asked for , I asked to speak to an attorney and was told I would get a misdemeanor for not providing DNA , even if I did n’t provide it on the basis of wanting to talk with lawyer , ” said Haskell .
When collection laws first started to expand , a lot of people resisted giving up their DNA samples , said Bicka Barlow , deputy public defender in San Francisco .
“ They solved that problem by changing the law and making it a crime to resist giving DNA , ” she said .
The original 1989 DNA collection law in California established a databank and required only people convicted of murder or felony sex offenses to provide DNA samples .
By 2008 , the law required adults arrested for a registrable sex offense , murder or voluntary manslaughter — or for attempting one of these crimes — to provide samples to law enforcement officers .
While part of the 2004 initiative , the expansion of the law to all felony arrests under Proposition 69 was not implemented until 2009 .
A result of the new laws , said Ortega , is that databases are rapidly expanding and changing in composition .
“ Previously , DNA databases were used to identify the most violent of people , ” she said .
“ But when you ’re putting people in there for writing bad checks or possessing drugs , you are diminishing returns , ” said Ortega .
The database in California is administered by the state Department of Justice whose central laboratory is the Jan Bashinski DNA Laboratory in Richmond .
There are 17 local laboratories and five additional Bureau of Forensic Sciences labs within the state ’s DNA Databank Program .
San Francisco ’s lab is the police crime lab .
According to California ’s DNA Databank Quarterly Report , 73,797 DNA submissions were added to the database in the first quarter of 2009 , compared to 34,897 in the final quarter prior to the statute taking effect — an increase of 111 percent .
The 236,970 profile submissions in the first nine months of 2009 already exceeds the roughly 200,000 from last year .
And amongst these samples , legal experts argued , there are errors .
With so many samples it is inevitable that there will be mistakes , said Risher , citing a cross-contamination at a state - run Sacramento lab where DNA discovered on a cigarette matched the profile of a sexual assault victim from another case .
Cross-contamination occurred when the sample from the cigarette was processed close to the victim ’s vaginal sample .
“ Everybody thinks DNA is this gold standard , but it ’s still just as susceptible to human error , ” said Ortega .
“ Inevitably there are humans interacting with this sensitive material .
That allows room for error . ”
Another possible source of error is actually the improvement in crime lab technology .
“ When you start talking about crimes in a public place , combined with increasing sensitivity of DNA equipment , it raises the possibility that you can find DNA at a scene for someone that had nothing to do with the crime , ” said Risher .
Errors do occur , said Michael Rushford , president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation .
But the positives far outweigh the negatives .
“ The pressure needs to be on doing this right and doing this well , ” he said .
Supporters of the expansion of DNA collection point to its role in exonerating more than 200 wrongfully convicted people and convicting thousands of criminals who otherwise may never have been caught .
The expansion of the databases is a good thing , said Rushford .
“ The more DNA evidence in the database , the better , ” said Rushford .
“ I would be happy to give my own sample . ”
Rushford said that he sees no difference between DNA samples and the other data that police gather from a suspect upon arrest .
“ When someone is arrested for a crime and booked , even if they are Mother Teresa , they take fingerprints , photographs , etc .
They accumulate a whole slew of personal information , ” said Rushford .
“ I do n’t know why anyone would want to inhibit such a valuable tool to exonerate the innocent and convict the guilty . ”
The San Francisco District Attorney ’s Office said it has found DNA databases to be an important tool in resolving cold cases .
“ We support expanded resources for labs to analyze DNA and assist law enforcement in resolving violent crimes , ” said Brian Buckelew , assistant district attorney .
In Orange County , the Office of the District Attorney has decided that DNA evidence is so valuable that they are willing to cut a deal with suspects .
Beginning last year , the office began a program that allows most non-violent misdemeanor offenders the option of dismissal in exchange for a DNA sample to bolster their local database .
As of June 2009 , the California Department of Justice boasted 9,907 investigations aided through the state database , whose total number of profiles , 1.35 million , is the third largest database in the world .
Recent court rulings provide no bellwether as to the likely success of the ACLU ’s lawsuit against the state .
In 2006 , the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that the state law authorizing DNA sampling from those who have been charged but not convicted of crimes violates defendants ’
Fourth Amendment rights .
On Sept. 30 , however , an Indiana appeals court ruled that police do n’t need to obtain a search warrant before forcing someone to submit a DNA sample .
Neither state requires samples be taken for all felony arrests like California .
The ACLU is hoping to file a motion for preliminary injunction in their case within the next few weeks .
The court will hear the case about a month after filing , said Risher .
The law is moving in the direction that eventually everyone will be in a database , said Ortega , who would prefer a broader public debate on the utility of a database including many people never charged of any crime .
­ “ I think in 10 years , if not sooner , every baby ’s blood will be taken at birth and their DNA will go into that database , ” said Rushford .
“ It ’s kind of Big Brother , but I think we ’re already there . ”
The smell of death hung on the air like a molding drapery .
Her closed eyes stared at me echoing the question " why " as droplets of blood dripped down her face to become absorbed by the spreading red carpet of sand .
Her death was not natural ; she was brutally slaughtered in the night by machete - wielding poachers .
I had almost concluded my morning beach survey when I found her corpse , rolled onto its side , flippers hacked off , neck slit , and her plastron ( underside ) slit open leaving a meter - long gaping cavity .
The poachers were obviously skilled ; they had been selective , removing her liver and reproductive organs containing the mature eggs , as well as those in the process of development .
Unlike most cases of poaching where the turtle is left alive and the eggs are taken during or after the nesting process this turtle had been slaughtered to obtain the oil which can be extracted from the liver .
The use of this oil for medicinal purposes and lighting had appeared to locally be on the decline , although this butchered turtle ’s remains seemed to indicate otherwise .
The sheer brutality of the crime shook me to the core as I stood on the beach shortly after sunrise .
Why would someone brutally murder a defenseless living creature as majestic as a 6 foot long turtle ?
Could it really be solely to obtain the eggs , which are considered to be an aphrodisiac due to the length of time that sea turtles copulate ( upwards of four hours ) ?
Was it a demonstration of dominance , or perhaps a morbid ritual considering one of the flippers had been taken from the grisly scene ?
The entire situation did n’t seem to make sense .
After all , surely the poachers know that these turtles nest up to seven times each season , returning every few years , and by killing them they are robbing themselves of the proverbial " goose who laid the golden egg " .
Yet tragically , on a regional if not local level , this is a far from isolated occurrence , and only one of a myriad of natural and anthropogenic threats which plague the sea turtle .
Marine turtles are one of the last remaining groups of " living dinosaurs " ; they are reptiles that have evolved approximately 200 million years ago and survived quite well on their own until modern times .
However , without a concerted and coordinated effort by conservation groups , legislature , the fishing industry , and local communities these ancient reptiles may be well on their way towards extinction .
Humans and other animals have predated sea turtles and their eggs throughout history without precipitating the drastic drop fall in population numbers that currently confronts researchers .
Broadly there are two types of threats to marine turtles and their eggs : natural and anthropogenic .
An example of a natural threat is the Frigate bird who swoops from the sky to attack baby hatchlings as they leave their nest on the beach and hurry towards the sea .
This bird is considered a natural predator because it is not a foreign species introduced by humans .
Developing that concept further , not all animals are natural predators .
Pigs , goats , rats , and dogs were introduced , both intentionally and accidentally , by whalers and pirates to the Galapagos Islands in the 17th century .
Introduced animals such as these pose serious threats to hatchling success , which over time will determine the population size of sexually mature turtles .
Unfortunately , these feral animals can be very elusive on large islands necessitating heavily coordinated and astronomically expensive extermination programs such as the Galapagos National Park ’s Project Isabella .
Because these animals were introduced by humans they are considered anthropogenically - related threats .
Human induced pressures , such as introduced species , are the predominant cause of turtle mortality .
Sadly , there are a multitude of such threats many equally dangerous and often more prevalent .
Anthropogenic threats can be considered either intentional or unintentional .
An example of an unintentional or indirect threat would be the problem of artificial lighting due to coastal development .
Artificial lighting emanates from various sources including hotels , cars , tennis courts , restaurants , homes , and beachgoers .
This photo pollution is a serious problem because it disorientates nesting females .
These artificial light sources can also be lethal by confusing hatchlings who naturally orientate themselves using the light of the open ocean .
Another indirect threat has arisen with the advent of high - speed pleasure boats .
These boats frequent the same shallow waters as the nesting turtles and collisions frequently occur .
Turtles are often found with large lacerations that run the length of their carapace .
One study showed that 80 % of East Pacific green turtle deaths around San Diego , California were the result of boat collisions .
The effects of commercial fishing , while for the most part still considered indirect , are the greatest threat to juvenile and adult sea turtle survival .
The fishing practices considered to be most destructive is trawling , long line fishing , drift - netting , hunting for lobster , and the use of gill nets .
Most often the turtle becomes entangled in the fishing gear and dies as a result of suffocation .
Another problem arises from long line pelagic fishing .
This is when buoyed fishing lines , often many miles long , are laid out from which smaller baited lines descend into the water column .
Pelagic fishing is an indiscriminate killer ; thousands of species , including many species of sea turtles , have wound up in its lines .
Some turtles , such as the leatherbacks , are attracted to the chemical light sticks that are attached to the lines possibly confusing them for bioluminescent jellyfish .
Others such as the olive ridley , green , and loggerhead will eat the bait and become hooked .
These baited turtles are often simply cut free from the lines with the hooks still remaining .
These embedded hooks can tear the esophagus , as well as the stomach , and intestines , leading to injury and death .
Other threats that plague the marine turtle include pollution from oil spills , toxic waste , excessive nutrient loading , and marine debris .
Unfortunately the previous indirect threats are likely the hardest to combat because they are so widespread globally .
Marine pollution is omnipresent , and to effectively stem is a Herculean task .
Although clearly lethal , the direct threats to turtles are not considered to be as detrimental to global population levels .
Each of the seven species of marine turtles has been exploited by mankind for various purposes throughout history .
Until recently , sea turtles were a reliable source of fresh meat for transoceanic travelers .
They were used as housing material by tribes in Mexico .
The shell plates , also known as scutes , have been used as both jewelry and money in various cultures ( until recently Gucci still made tortoise - shell eyeglasses ) .
As aforementioned , their eggs are still consumed due to their being purportedly aphrodisiacs .
And finally , they are slaughtered for the oil that can be extracted from their livers .
Yet it is not only these directly exploitative processes that are further endangering the marine turtles .
Sadly and ironically , pressures from " ecotourism " are threatening the turtles as well .
Snorkelers and SCUBA divers often approach too close to the turtles , and even attempt to ride them while they are feeding and sleeping .
This can seriously disturb the animal and dissuade it from returning to a potentially important nesting or foraging site .
Other problems related to " ecotourism " stem from the side of the tour operators which ( ab ) use the same snorkeling / diving locations by bringing in upwards of 15 boats every day of the year .
Other ill - conceived ecotours allow the tourists to hold hatchlings who have been picked up on their way to sea .
Excessive handling of hatchlings is detrimental as it causes stress and an excess expenditure of energy that is vital to survival in the first few months .
Unlike the omnipresent indirect threats , some of the following pressures are slowly starting to be mitigated in some areas due to intense efforts on behalf of conservationists and legislatures .
As is true with many cases of conservation , education is often the most important first step whether it is of traditional communities , the general public , industry , or legislature .
Much of this education has been disseminated as a result of community conservation projects .
In the northwestern Costa Rican town of Ostional a natural phenomenon occurs monthly in which up to 30,000 turtles attempt to nest within a few days .
Because the later arriving turtles will inevitably dig up and destroy the eggs already laid by the turtles of the previous nights a management plan was developed .
Villagers could collect eggs within the first 48 hours , and then decide to use or sell them through their own collective .
This type of management has been beneficial on various levels .
As a result of the publicity generated by this novel management scheme a turtle ecotourism program has developed where tourists pay local guides to watch the turtles nest .
This when combined with the sale of eggs has proved to be an economical boon for the town , leading to the creation of a new school and hospital .
Also the cooperative has set up a nightly patrol which has stopped the wanton poaching of eggs , and insures that they are only collected during the first two days of the arribada .
In addition , the fact that the cooperative is empowered as the managing body hopefully ensures the project will continue .
The sum of all of this has been that the local and greater public of Costa Rica is now more aware of the sea turtle and the importance of its nesting beaches .
That does not mean that education is effortless and economic incentives are panaceas .
On the Caribbean island of Grenada it is legal to hunt all marine turtles except the leatherback .
While turtle - watching " ecotours " are starting to arise and could develop into a new market , impetus from local communities is needed to make these programs successful and sustainable .
One of the reasons these programs need to benefit the community is that the exploitation of sea turtles will not stop until it is publicly perceived to be more beneficial to conserve them than to kill them .
This is not an easy process and requires a lot of time and effort .
Many if not the majority of poachers are older people who grew up poaching and the practice has been a tradition in their families for generations .
Breaking such historical traditions is important if the next generation is to grow up educated about the ecological value of sea turtles .
Education has also taken the form of research which has led to technological development and new legislation .
These combined have greatly reduced turtle mortality rates .
For example , the National Academy of Sciences estimated that as many as 50,000 loggerheads and 5,000 critically endangered Kemp ’s ridleys were drowning yearly in shrimp trawls in U.S. waters .
This led to the development of the TED ( Turtle Excluder Device ) .
This device is installed into trawl nets and guides large animals out of the net that would otherwise be caught .
The design is not perceived as detrimental by the fishing industry as it prevents shrimp from escaping .
In 1994 , federal law mandated that these units be used on all shrimp boats in U.S waters regardless of their country of origin .
The TED has been very successful decreasing the number of turtles caught by as much as 97 % .
The problem has been enforcing that they are used on boats .
Research has also led to various conventions that are intended to help conserve the turtles and their habitat .
Some of these include the Convention on International trade in Endangered Species CITES , the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species , the International ban on Pelagic Drift - Net fishing , and the Inter - American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles .
In theory these treaties and conventions should benefit the sea turtle , but the extent to which that is the case is up for debate .
Clearly some legislation is better than none .
Types of legislation that have certainly been beneficial are laws that create marine sanctuaries .
For example , in 1990 the U.S Congress established the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge of the coast of Florida .
This refuge is approximately twenty miles long and is one of the most important nesting sites of loggerhead turtles .
Such protection of key nesting and foraging sites is necessary to maintain healthy populations .
What lays on the horizon for the various species of marine turtles ?
Will they become extinct as a result of the myriad threats facing them , or will the ardent effort of an international movement be able to stymie their decline .
Unfortunately , only the future will elucidate the answer to this question .
However , the present is always the key , and every turtle that can be saved from a drift net or machete by one of a variety of forces is another success story .
And for that turtle I found slaughtered on the beach hopefully her death will not be in vain , at least I will never forget it .

Angel :
The funny thing is , none of them ever get the joke ...
OH NO NOW MY GIRLFRIEND WILL BE MAD HI KELLY
When did global warming turn into a forced reli gion ?
My daughter came home from school re cently with a spring in her step and a song on her lips .
With no foreshadowing — or time to call an exorcist — out came this chilling refrain :
” . . .
You can hear the warning — GLOBAL WARMING . . . ”
By the time her father and I removed our jaws from the floor , we had learned that :
A ) All the kids had been coerced into singing this catchy ditty , which we called “ The Warming Song , ” at a concert for parents .
B ) Further song lyrics scolded selfish adults ( that would be us ) for polluting our planet and causing a warming scourge that would , in no short order , kill all the polar bears and threaten the birds and bees .
C ) There was no deprogramming session on the menu .
And no arguing allowed .
The international “ Climategate ” scandal is now moving into its third week .
And reaction from folks on the scientific and political left — or is that redundant ? — who treat global warming as a cult in which naysayers must be crushed has been depressing :
Total denial .
The scandal began when someone hacked into the server at the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , England , and uncovered a cache of messages between leading warming gurus .
These e-mails revealed guys deeply frustrated by planetary temperatures that , stubbornly , had refused to rise in some time .
Were they afraid of losing their scientific juice ?
Or their funding ?
So , as the e-mails prove , the scientists did something about it .
They cooked the books to exaggerate global warming .
Of course !
How can you scare the bejeezus out of little kids and small animals if you ca n’t make the mercury move a millimeter ?
Simple .
You lie .
But while one rival scientist predicted the shocking revelations would blast a “ mushroom cloud ” over theories of climate change , that has not come to pass .
The Obama administration ’s “ climate adviser , ” Carol Browner , totally ignored the smoking e-mails , and attributed the scandal to “ a very small group of people who continue to say this is n’t a real problem , that we do n’t need to do anything . ”
“ What am I going to do ? ” asked Browner .
“ Side with the couple of naysayers out there , or the 2,500 scientists ? ” — who ’ve drunk the Kool - Aid .
“ I ’m sticking with the 2,500 scientists . ”
No less an authority than The New York Times sought to explain away the most damning e-mail , sent by scientist Phil Jones , who said he employed a “ trick ” to make temps appear higher than they were .
The paper quoted Dr. Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University as saying he often used the word “ trick ” to refer to a good way to solve a problem .
“ And not something secret . ”
Is anyone home ?
Our children are on the front lines of the warming hysteria , a place where “ experts ” from Al Gore to the president leave no room for dissent or even the slightest skepticism , despite claims that are no more provable than the Earth is flat .
Children were the targets of a book co-written by the producer of Al Gore ’s star - making vehicle , “ An Inconvenient Truth ” — a fantastical view of global warming that should have been called a fiction , not a documentary .
Producer Laurie David told Publisher ’s
Weekly that she wrote the kids ’ book , “ Down - to - Earth Guide to Global Warming , ” because “ kids also are the Number 1 influence on their parents , so if you want to reach the parents , go to the kids . ”
She knows of which she speaks .
It may come to pass that global warming is real .
Or not .
But your children wo n’t get the truth from Al Gore , the president or the scientific community .
Or sadly , from school .
Neither will you .
‘ Net ’ result sure beats a nut revolt
After years of legal combat that rivals the days of the Roman forum , the state ’s highest court has given a hearty go - ahead to the Nets basketball arena in Brooklyn .
Finally !
Sanity reigns in a borough where people will protest sunny days and rainbows if given the chance .
The Court of Appeals says the small knot of resisters who ’ve refused to sell their properties to developer Bruce Ratner — at handsome profits , I might add — can be displaced by eminent domain .
This is good news to the many New Yorkers who will win jobs and affordable homes , and bad news only to the selfish handful who ’d refused to let their neighbors get a shot at prosperity .
Smack in the middle of some of the richest real estate in the city sits Atlantic Yards , a spot so blighted , it ’s an outrage nothing has been built there in 40 years .
Now , there ’s a chance .
Even better , big entertainment dollars will be sucked back into New York from New Jersey , where the Nets currently play .
It ’s a win -win situation .
Bring it on !
SWEEP THIS HUMAN TRASH OFF THE STREETS
This holiday miracle comes with a steep price that no child should have to pay .
Beautiful , 15 - year - old Vada Vasquez is recovering nicely from a bullet that tore through her brain — the latest victim of streets run by thugs with no supervision , armed with illegal guns that are more plentiful than textbooks .
Vada is awake and has been moved from a Bronx hospital to a rehab center .
Yet the stray bullet fired , allegedly , by 16 - year - old Carvett Gentles tore through a portion of her brain that affects speech .
Her recovery will be arduous .
Fortunately , she is young .
This holiday season , and all year long , police must enforce gun laws .
But that ’s just a start .
Controversial stop - and - frisk practices work .
Use them .
And if children like Gentles are not in school — and his relatives admitted the boy was a no - show — it is the duty of cops , truant officers and , especially , the parents to demand they get where they belong .
That ’s in a classroom .
Or a reform school .
Or a military school .
Get these budding monsters off the streets .
This ca n’t go on .
Mike ’s vote buy a bit filthy - rich
stood on a street corner and handed a few bucks to every man and woman who voted for him , he still would have been re-elected .
But we ’d be a little better off .
Instead , he squandered a shameful $ 102 million from his own wallet to narrowly eke out a third term .
That does n’t even include the bonuses to staffers , which typically run 100 grand apiece .
Imagine if you had a fraction of that money to pay your ever - rising taxes .
You might not feel as if Bloomberg got away with the swindle of the century .

The recently revived idea of creating a government - run health plan to compete with private insurers may reinforce the impression that President Obama and his allies in Congress are standing tall against those corporate fat cats who delight in denying lifesaving care to children and old ladies .
But Obama and the insurers still see eye to eye on a central element of his health care agenda : the requirement that every American obtain medical coverage .
It 's obvious why the insurers like this idea .
What industry would n't welcome a law that forces everyone to buy its product ?
But the insurers also argue that a mandate will help control costs , and the president agrees .
Judging from the experience in Massachusetts , which imposed its own insurance requirement in 2006 , they 're both wrong .
Because he wants to show that an insurance mandate is fair as well as fiscally wise , Obama focuses on uninsured Americans who skip out on their medical bills , leaving policyholders and taxpayers with the tab .
" Such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money , " he said in a speech last month .
Perhaps so , but it 's not very much money .
In a 2008 Health Affairs article , George Mason University economist Jack Hadley and three co-authors calculate that " uncompensated care represents 2.2 percent of health spending in 2008 . "
Obama came closer to explaining the real motivation for the insurance mandate when he said that " unless everybody does their part , many of the insurance reforms we seek — especially requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions — just can't be achieved . "
He worries that insuring older , sicker people will be prohibitively expensive unless the young and healthy are forced to subsidize them .
The insurers are more forthright on this point , warning that insufficient penalties for failing to buy insurance will result in " adverse selection , " fueling the rise in premiums .
Yet the penalties in Massachusetts are faster and heftier than the ones proposed in the bills Congress is considering , and the state continues to experience rapid health care inflation .
Since 2006 , Michael Tanner notes in a recent Cato Institute paper , health insurance premiums in Massachusetts have risen by 8 percent to 12 percent a year , almost double the national average .
During the same period , total medical spending has increased by 28 percent .
The cost of subsidizing coverage through the state 's Commonwealth Care program is expected to hit $ 880 million next year , 20 percent more than originally projected .
There are several reasons why mandatory insurance , contrary to Obama 's promises , has been accompanied by rapidly escalating costs .
First , when you subsidize something , people tend to consume more of it .
Total spending is therefore bound to be higher , whether it 's covered through direct taxes or through the indirect tax of forcing people to pay for insurance they do n't want .
Second , despite stricter penalties , Massachusetts seems to be experiencing adverse selection .
Tanner notes that , while the share of residents without insurance has shrunk from about 10 percent to about 5 percent , the proportion of uninsured people in the 18 - to - 25 age group has increased from 30 percent to 35 percent , indicating that " the young ( and presumably more healthy ) are less likely to comply with the mandate . "
Third , requiring people to buy insurance entails defining the minimum level of coverage , which necessarily makes insurance more expensive than it would otherwise be .
In effect , the government prohibits the cheapest insurance plans , the ones with the highest deductibles and the least generous benefits .
Defining one minimum medical package for the entire country , thereby inviting every health care interest to descend upon Capitol Hill and lobby for inclusion , will compound the inflation caused by state requirements .
Cato's Michael Cannon warns that such a federal standard could force 100 million Americans into more expensive plans while effectively banning the money - saving combination of high - deductible insurance and health savings accounts .
The upshot is a phenomenon we have seen many times before : Instead of protecting us from big business , big government buys it off with our money .

Video : Helicopter senses surroundings
The helicopter in this video may weigh only 30 grams , but it carries a compass and motion sensors , can change course and warn fellow craft of obstacles it bumps into , and could even carry a small camera .
It can also resist what might be called a King Kong attack – if swatted out of the air the tiny craft soon recovers and takes off again .
It was developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley in Moffett Field , California .
It would make a great toy , but the team ’s intentions are deadly serious .
They aim to fly squadrons of “ Sensorfly ” craft that coordinate with each other to explore indoor environments – for instance , to check out buildings after a natural disaster .
The robots are built by adding custom processors , sensors and software to rotors and motors from an off - the - shelf toy helicopter .
Each prototype costs only about $ 200 to build , says Pei Zhang , an electrical engineer working on the project with graduate student Aveek Purohit .
Bumping along
Indoor flight requires a craft to be small , light and able to negotiate walls and other obstacles .
“ Reality bites you a lot more indoors , ” says Zhang .
But Sensorfly is too small to carry the technology it would need to look for and plan around obstacles .
Instead it uses simpler strategies to survive .
Advertisement
Each robot carries a radio , accelerometer , compass and gyroscope .
Thanks to the accelerometers it notices if it bumps into something , then backs off and warns fellow copters nearby of the obstacle ’s approximate location .
Any time two or more of the helicopters are within radio range , they form an improvised data network to share information .
Their design is “ passively stable ” : as long as the twin rotors are spinning , the craft will hover in place .
Its shape is such that if it is knocked to the ground , the craft need only keep trying and it should be able to get airborne again .
Squadrons of the craft connect with each other using radio .
They pass information between themselves and back to a controller , and use the time delay on the radio signals to track their relative positions .
Team work
The current prototypes can carry only 5 grams of cargo , but that is enough for a small camera or microphone , says Zhang .
The networked helicopters are the most lightweight mobile sensor network to date , he says .
However , Kamran Mohseni , who with colleagues at the University of Colorado in Boulder developed a pack of small planes able to collect and share data , points out that the Carnegie Mellon group need to work on their flight times to prove the benefits of their approach .
At present they can only sustain flight for 5 minutes .
Zhang says he expects better batteries to extend that .
Sensorfly was presented at the Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems in Berkeley , California , earlier this month .

Anybody vaguely familiar with Anne McCaffrey 's beloved Pern series knows her books are packed with psychic dragon sex .
But Pern is n't the only alien planet with sexy dragons .
Why is there so much dragon - related sexuality in science fiction and fantasy ?
Advertisement
Though there are probably precedents for the dragon sex fetish in the pages of kinky horror pulp Weird Tales , I think it 's safe to say the phenomenon was popularized by McCaffrey and her Pern novels .
These books , published starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the present , focus on a civilization of humans who evolved from the crew of a spaceship of colonists who landed on planet Pern .
Using biotechnology , the humans genetically modify the local firelizards to be giant , flying steeds that the " renewable air force " rides .
The genemodded dragons also have psychic links with their riders , which forms when the dragons are hatched and select humans " impress " themselves onto the creatures .
Dragonriders are n't warriors ; they are protectors .
Pern experiences a seasonal weather pattern called " threadfall , " where deadly spores from a neighboring star fall to the planet , destroying everything in their paths .
Unless , of course , the dragons can zoom around and burn the threads before they hit the ground .
Guided by their trusty humans , the dragons protect all the people of Pern from the terrible thread .

They also have sex .
And when dragons have sex , their riders - in constant psychic connection with their mounts - have sex too .
This means a lot of " whoa I did n't want to have sex with you but now that our dragons are having sex damn let 's do it " kinds of stuff .
In addition , the most common types of dragons , the blues and greens , only get impressed by gay boys ( and occasionally straight girls ) .
So : Lots of gay psychic dragon sex .
This strange scenario has meant that Pern 's large and talkative fandom has spent many years debating the sexuality of dragons in discussion forums and at conventions like the Weyrfest at Dragon * Con .

In her infamous essay on Pern 's renewable airforce , McCaffrey responded to fan speculation by talking a little about how dragon / human sexuality works :
In the Beginning of Dragonriders of Pern™ , females rode green or gold .
Males rode blue , brown or bronze .
( I made it easier for myself in the beginning by remembering that Boys impressed Brown , Bronze or Blue , and Girls impressed Gold and Green . )
Since greens are females and tend to be ' loving ' , they mated with any dragon they fancied .
When not enough girls elected to stand on the Hatching Grounds after the first disastrous Plague , males with feminine personalities Impressed green dragons .
Blue riders , not to mince words , tended to be gay with masculine temperaments .
Browns , who were not so inclined to mate with a green 's rider , made an arrangement so that two pairs of riders were involved in a green 's mating .
The dragons act in the way they were bio-genetically designed . . .
While the main and most important application of the [ telepathy - enhancing substance ]
Mentasynth was to increase mental function and innate empathy in the ' dragons , ' a secondary use was to allow the newly hatched young dragon recognize the most suitable symbiotic partner .
At hatching , the dragon recognizes by the sweat pheromones the appropriate sexual partner .
Therefore the dragonet , just out of its shell , would approach only the male or female candidates exuding the proper pheromones for its basic sex type .
The green dragons are particularly sensitive not only to the mental empathy of possible candidates but also to pheromones .

McCaffrey 's dragon sex scenario is probably the most highly developed in the world of science fiction , but it 's not an aberration .
Jane Yolen 's young adult Dragon
Pit series explores the dragon reproductive cycle in great detail , and the psychic human - dragon bond does involve romance .
Similarly , Christopher Paolini's Inheritance series explores dragon sexuality and romance .
Main character Eragon 's dragon Saphira is the last female dragon alive , so the issue of mating and reproduction is unavoidable for her .
There is even a psychic dragon sex subplot in the recent Captain Marvel Annihilation series .
Several years ago , dragon sex became one of the most hotly - debated topics at the book - oriented World Fantasy Convention when a publisher handed out excerpts of Janine Cross ' Touched by Venom , the first book in her intense , harrowing Dragon Temple Saga .
The excerpt , which describes a dragon - keepers ' ritual on an alien planet , includes a scene where young adepts are beaten with dragon - venom laced whips .
Because the venom has aphrodisiac properties , the result is a bizarre parade where young dragon - keepers are marched through the streets covered in blood and brandishing giant erections .
Unfortunately , it was n't the greatest excerpt to hand out :
Con-goers found it laughable when they read it outside the context of the rest of the series , which is about a peasant revolt in an oppressive monarchy .
Advertisement
So why does dragon sex inspire such passionate debate ?
Why , indeed , does dragon sex even happen at all in science fiction ?
There is one obvious answer , which is that dragons represent sex because they are enormous , fiery , beautiful , uncontrollable creatures of fantasy .
The urge to have sex is one of those giant , burning desires that is particularly difficult to slay .
It 's also an urge that is fueled by our fantasies .
So there 's a kind of no - duh analysis of dragon sex , which is nevertheless true , that says simply that dragons are metaphors for sexual desire .
This certainly explains the zillions of pages of Otherkin slashfic on the internet .
Advertisement
But of course everything is always more complicated than that .
Advertisement
Let 's consider the role that dragon sex plays in books like Yolen 's series or Pern - both of which have large young adult audiences .
In his book Killing Monsters , comic book writer Gerard Jones talks about why kids are drawn to stories about monsters .
He says it 's because kids identify with what it 's like to exist in a world ruled by the whims of giant creatures and megapowerful humanoids .
Though Jones focuses on why kids like to watch monsters engage in violence , I think a similar thing might be said for why young adults might also be fascinated by giant creatures having sex .
Sex belongs to the exotic world of adults .
It 's something that young adults are aware of , possibly in internet - enhanced detail , but it 's also not something most of them are experiencing firsthand .
So it makes a certain amount of sense that young people might identify with characters for whom sex is something they 're connected to mentally , via the acts of creatures more powerful than themselves .
Philip Pullman explores this idea in young adult trilogy His Dark Materials too .
When his young adult characters finally have sex at the end of the series , they begin by petting each other 's animal daemons .
These daemons follow every person around , acting as external representations of their feelings and desires .
The same way McCaffrey 's characters sometimes express the sexual feelings of their dragons .
In both cases , the smaller creatures act out the desires of larger ones .
Advertisement
Dragons are a simple metaphor for sexual desire , and they may also evoke the way young adults feel about sex .
But those assertions still do n't entirely explain way dragons function in the venom cock scenario from Janine Cross ' Dragon Temple Saga .
I would suggest that the dragons in Cross ' novels are something like the worms in Dune .
Cross ' dragons do n't have much of a psychic connection to their riders - they are more like animals , and so to the extent that they communicate telepathically it 's not much of a conversation .
Not only do these dragons provide a drug that fuels a thriving black market economy ( like Spice but less useful ) , but their eggs are a major source of nourishment to the people of the kingdom .
And the fastest way to get around is by riding a flying dragon .
So dragons are a cornerstone of the kingdom 's economy , crucial for food and transport .
That 's why Cross depicts dragons as being hoarded by the ultra-rich .
A major part of the peasant revolt involves redistributing access to the dragons .
Advertisement
Cross is doing something tricky with her dragon sex .
She 's talking about those uncontrollable , giant forces that I mentioned earlier in connection with Jones ' book .
But instead of her dragons standing in for adult sexual relationships , they stand in for the often - abusive relationships between aristocrats and peasants .
She uses weird scenes of these dragons jabbing their venom - laced tongues deep inside our heroine 's special spot to show us how peasants are debased by their aristocratic overlords .
At the same time , the peasants are made complicit in their degradation because they crave the high they get from the dragon venom .
So Cross ' dragons stand in for the overwhelming desire people have for power over each other .
Power that gives them the right to enslave , rape , and rule over other people .
Advertisement
Of course , sometimes a dragon is just a dragon .
But dragons and sex often go together in science fiction because it's an inherently metaphorical genre .
SF stories about fantastical monsters are often fables that contain messages about our own world .
A perfect alloy of beauty and violence , the dragon is an enduring figure for the power of sexual desire - and for the way power often finds its most brutal expression in sexual acts .

The Motorola Droid was launched less than a week ago but we ’re already eying a December 11th OTA update that will cure a defined list of software issues .
Defined by who , you ask ?
Verizon Wireless themselves .
An anonymous tipster has sent us an internal 5 - page document detailing problems with the Droid , something they claim was furnished to all Verizon Tech Support reps .
The tipster claims a December 11th OTA update will fix the problems .
Before we get to the details I would like to make 2 points :
Do n’t be irritated that there are so many problems , instead be grateful that Verizon / Motorola / Google are meticulously tracking all of the known issues and working hard to release an OTA fix for them .
Pretty amazing that we ’re able to get such a quick turn around time in the first place .
If an OTA update comes on December 11th that would be pretty impressive indeed .
The only reason that so many problems exist is that your phone has so many capabilities .
If all it did was call people … it would work flawlessly .
With more features come more areas for potential bugs .
And there are a LOT of features in Android .
I ’m not so much concerned with the bugs as much as how they are addressed and if the documents below are any indication … these folks are really on the ball .
And here you go :
Notice the last page of the document details camera auto - focus problem with a targeted resolution date of December 11th but just above that we see bluetooth issues with a target resolution date of January 2010 – we ’re not sure if there will there be 2 updates in 2 months or if their target date is just THAT flimsy – but either way it ’s apparent SOMETHING is coming down the pike .

Harkin on Lieberman …
“ [ Lieberman ] still wants to be a part of the Democratic Party although he is a registered independent , ” Harkin said .
“ He wants to caucus with us and , of course , he enjoys his chairmanship of the [ Homeland Security ] committee because of the indulgence of the Democratic Caucus .
So , I ’m sure all of those things will cross his mind before the final vote . ”
As the nights draw in , a small band of mischief - makers prepare for an annual night of mayhem .
Mischief
Night is their chance to let loose and cause a little bit of chaos .
Depending on where you live , it lands sometime around Halloween and Bonfire Night .
And opinions vary on whether it is a chance for harmless fun or an excuse for anti-social behaviour .
Like many native traditions , its exact origins are unknown , but Mischief Night is thought to date from the 1700s when a custom of Lawless Hours or Days prevailed in Britain .
" These were times when normal laws were suspended and tricks could be played ranging from throwing cabbage stalks at people , to the swapping of shopkeeper 's signs and gates , " says Simon Costin , Director of the Museum of British Folklore .
Go back to the 1950s it was largely an age of innocence .
So the sorts of pranks were the kind of things that make modern people smile
It was not until the 1830s that Mischief Night itself appears on the record , held on 30 April .
Today , however , it is an autumnal occasion .
Some are adamant it is 4 November , while for others it will always be the night before Halloween .
Many believe this discrepancy lies in its connection to Halloween , which was held over several days after Britain switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1752 .
" We removed 11 days to adjust , which means some places observed the old dates for things like Christmas and Halloween and some observed the new , " says Professor Stephen Sayers of Leeds Metropolitan University .
" Halloween , Bonfire Night , trick or treating and Mischief Night are all part and parcel of what used to be one festival . "
Since the 1950s , Mischief Night appears to have died out in all areas of the UK except northern England , and it is not at all clear why .
What is known is that it was exported to the United States , and recently re-imported as trick or treat , now popular across the UK .
" It may well be that the North has disconnected from the South which has been far more in tune with modernity , " says Mr Sayers .
" We tend to think of Britain as all behaving as if it's one thing , but there are vast sections that still observe old customs that have largely died out elsewhere . "
Some of the more traditional pranks might have disappeared , but there is no evidence that Mischief Night itself is going the same way .
Online chat rooms prove it is alive and well .
" Put peanut butter under the door handles of people 's cars so they 'll get it all in their fingers , " suggests one mischief - maker .
Such is the resilience of pranksters that some police forces put on extra patrols .
The crackdown has become a week - long operation because what started as one night of minor mayhem has morphed into a week or so of mayhem .
" Arrests go up around Mischief Night , we get a bit of a spike around those 10 days , " says Ch Insp Mark Khan from North Yorkshire Police .
" The catalyst seems to be as soon as the clocks fall back , obviously it gets darker earlier and kids are out . "
Some believe we are becoming less tolerant of what is essentially harmless fun , but others think it is becoming more vicious .
Traditionally mischief - makers stole gates or knocked on doors then ran away .
" Go back to the 1950s , it was largely an age of innocence , " says Mr Sayers .
" So the sorts of pranks were the kind of things that make modern people smile . "
Nowadays , you are more likely to be covered in batter or have a firework pushed through the letterbox .
So at this time of year , supermarkets ban the sale of flour and eggs to under - 16s .
And , contrary to the popular belief that on Mischief Night you are immune from prosecution , police will take action .
" They commit some kind of criminal damage or public order offence , and the next thing is they 're in trouble with the law and they get some kind of caution , " says Ch Insp Khan .
Some argue Mischief Night is a necessary evil .
It allows people to experiment with behaviour that would normally be socially unacceptable .
Social psychologists call it " psycho- social moratoria . "
" It means a time when the normal rules do n't apply , " says Mr Sayers .
" A good example would be the office Christmas party , where all the guzzlings and flirtations you can get away with to an extent .
Try that in the middle of June and you would be shown the door . "
It could be that Mischief Night allows people the opportunity to thumb their nose at authority in a way that is socially controlled , he adds .
So , far from being discouraged , some argue Mischief Night should be embraced .
" We [ humans ] are a set of contradictions sometimes charged with passion , sometimes charged with a darker nature that we need to express in some way , " says Mr Sayers .
" Anyone can be aggressive , but it 's skilled to be aggressive in a way that is socially acceptable and physically and morally and spiritually uplifting and , most of all , good fun . "
There has been a surprise change in Queensland 's Budget position , with the 2008 - 09 year ending in surplus .
The State Government had been predicting that last financial year would end with a $ 574 million deficit .
But Treasurer Andrew Fraser has told Parliament the surplus is $ 35 million .
He says that is mainly because of some technical additions to the bottom line and has not been driven by a sudden turnaround in revenue .
The economy grew by 0.8 per cent last year in an improvement on the 0.5 per cent growth predicted in the Budget .
Mr Fraser told the House the two reports " lay out in black and white the carnage visited upon us by the global financial crisis " .
" There can be no denying the fact that the nation - leading building program locked in by this Government helped the Queensland economy stay above the line , " he said .
" [ However ] Mr Speaker , [ while ] it 's important to emphasise that this surplus result is a substantial improvement - and a welcome one - it is does not mean that Queensland has defeated the global recession and victory can be declared . "
But Opposition treasury spokesman Tim Nicholls says the figures also show growing debt .
" Today 's tabled report on state finances shows that Labor has delivered the worst net debt position since figures have been kept in Queensland , " he said .
" Will the Treasurer now admit that debt is in Labor 's DNA . "
Queensland Council of Unions ( QCU ) spokesman Ron Monaghan says the surplus should put the Government 's privatisation plan in question .
" On my calculations that 's a $ 600 million turnaround in less than six months , " he said .
" I think this shows that the Government should rethink asset sales .
" I believe that the times that asset sales were thought about were different .
" These figures are proving that .
It does n't mean that we 're out of the woods , but it does show that times are changing and that plans laid only six to nine months ago should be revised and looked at in the light of those figures . "
KABUL , Afghanistan 
A week after two American soldiers disappeared in northwest Afghanistan , the body of one of them has been found by a military dive team , a NATO spokesman said Wednesday .
The two men disappeared while trying to recover supplies that had fallen into a river in Badghis Province on Nov. 4 , news agencies reported .
Shortly after the soldiers were reported missing , a Taliban spokesman said that militants had recovered the bodies of two drowned foreign soldiers .
It was broadly assumed that the bodies were those of the missing soldiers .
The recovery of the body of one soldier , identified by family members on a Facebook page as Benjamin Sherman , throws the Taliban claim into question .
It was unclear how the military dive team located the soldier , or exactly where his body was found .
The NATO - led International Security Assistance Force said it continued to search for the other missing soldier .
All the comforts of home .

TV star and political commentator Chuck Norris has voiced concerns that the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen , beginning December 7 , represents an attempt to further an agenda to create a “ one world order ” at the expense of national sovereignty .
“ I really think he is going over there to try to create a one world order . ”
Norris said of president Obama during an appearance on the Fox News show Your World with Neil Cavuto .
“ My big worry is the fact is that we as a nation , if we start having to be obligated to other countries , ” Norris said .
“ In this conference , they ’re going to try to take our money and send it to third - world countries because of , since we spend so much oil and these other countries have suffered , then we ’re going to give our money to these third - world countries . ” he continued .
“ Neil , we have people here starving in our own country , ” Norris said .
“ You know , my foundation , I have families , who are making $ 9,000 a year – the kids I ’m teaching .
Why are n’t we trying to help the poverty in our own country ? ”
[ efoods ]
Norris echoed concerns recently highlighted by the British government ’s former science adviser , Lord Christopher Monckton , who stated that the real purpose of the conference is to use global warming hype as a pretext to lay the foundation for a one - world government .
Norris added that the conference was less about saving the planet and more about lining the pockets of globalist elites .
“ I do n’t believe that , ” Norris commented .
“ First of all , I do n’t think China is going to go for this .
I do n’t believe India is going to go for this .
… [ China ] is not going to change .
The thing is , for them to say , ‘ United States , you change , but we ’re not going to change , so you clean up your country , but we ’re going to , you know , keep polluting our part of the country .
You know , it ’s ludicrous .
It really is . ”
“ You know Al Gore became a hundred million dollar millionaire , you know , from the global bomboggle .
I do n’t really , I do n’t believe it for a second .
I think it ’s a big con game that they ’re doing . ”
Norris said .
Norris has previously critically spoken out on the issues of Obamacare and the Federal Reserve .

A Quiz Designed to Give You Fitts ( Turkish translation available at http://idefter.com/sayfa/fitts-yasasi-kucuk-bir-test.)
So you think you are an interaction designer ?
Not if you cannot answer all the following questions quickly and with authority .
If you 're not an interaction designer , but you know one or you are thinking of hiring one slip them just the questions , and see how well they do .
I 've used variations of this quiz for years during the interview process to good effect .
These questions and answers assume that you have total control over all screen real estate , the OS , etc .
Just pretend you are chief designer for Microsoft or Apple .
If you are new to matters Fitts , take the quiz before looking at the text the follows anyway .
The answers are going to thoroughly teach the principles involved , but taking your best shot at the quiz first will make clear to you what assumptions you have been using in the past .
You can then measure those assumptions against the answers that follow .
And do n't feel bad with your initial results :
The overwhelming majority of people , even those that have been involved with computers for years , do poorly on their first time around .
The good news is that they do great on the retake , and many have found this the most valuable single article on this website , immediately and permanently applicable to their future design work .
The Quiz
You may want to read through all the questions ( but not the answers ! ) once just to get the " lay of the land . "
Then , go back and answer them .
And you really do have to answer them .
This is not a quiz that lends itself to looking at a question and saying ,  Oh , yeah , sure .
I know that one ,  and scanning on down .
You have to actually articulate the answer .
( Otherwise , you are considered to have gotten it wrong . )
No tricks are hiding within .
This is all straight business .
However , the answers may seem counter - intuitive or counter - experiential , so apparent " obviousness " might not suffice .
Microsoft Toolbars offer the user the option of displaying a label below each tool .
Name at least one reason why labeled tools can be accessed faster .
( Assume , for this , that the user knows the tool and does not need the label just simply to identify the tool . )
You have a palette of tools in a graphics application that consists of a matrix of 16x16 - pixel icons laid out as a 2x8 array that lies along the left - hand edge of the screen .
Without moving the array from the left - hand side of the screen or changing the size of the icons , what steps can you take to decrease the time necessary to access the average tool ?
A right - handed user is known to be within 10 pixels of the exact center of a large , 1600 X 1200 screen .
You will place a single - pixel target on the screen that the user must point to exactly .
List the five pixel locations on the screen that the user can access fastest .
For extra credit , list them in order from fastest to slowest access .
Microsoft offers a Taskbar which can be oriented along the top , side or bottom of the screen , enabling users to get to hidden windows and applications .
This Taskbar may either be hidden or constantly displayed .
Describe at least two reasons why the method of triggering an auto - hidden Microsoft Taskbar is grossly inefficient .
Explain why a Macintosh pull - down menu can be accessed at least five times faster than a typical Windows pull - down menu .
For extra credit , suggest at least two reasons why Microsoft made such an apparently stupid decision .
What is the bottleneck in hierarchical menus and what techniques could make that bottleneck less of a problem ?
Name at least one advantage circular popup menus have over standard , linear popup menus .
What can you do to linear popup menus to better balance access time for all items ?
The industrial designers let loose on the Mac have screwed up most of the keyboards by cutting their function keys in half so the total depth of the keyboard was reduced by half a key .
Why was this incredibly stupid ?
What do the primary solutions to all these questions have in common ?
If you cant answer the last question , you are going to have all kinds of trouble with the rest .
You arent alone , of course , as evidence abounds that no one at Microsoft and fewer and fewer people at Apple could answer these questions .
Microsoft sort of has an excuse .
They claimed from the beginning that a visual interface with the mouse and all that junk is inferior to a keyboard interface .
They might have looked foolish if they had ever really tried to build a real GUI .
By consistently sabotaging the visual interface , they have avoided such embarrassment .
What has happened at Apple is a little more mysterious .
The industrial - design blunders are expected .
Apples outside industrial designers have always hovered between cluelessness and hostility when it came to human factors .
However , lately , Apple has been doing some pretty stupid stuff in - house , too .
Like turning the rapid - access Labels menu into a hierarchical , slowing it down by five or ten times .
The Answers Let 's start out with a preview of the answer to question 10 , Fitts ' law , since all the others revolve around it .
From First Principles of Design : Fitts ' Law :
The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target .
This little bit of obviousness is so often ignored , I sometimes wonder if it is on purpose .
Usually , though , it is merely a leading indicator of overall ignorance , amplified by superstition and unsullied by facts or study .
Fortunately , readers of AskTog , being as tenacious as they are perspicacious , either know exactly what Fitts '
Law is or will before they go to bed tonight .
Fitts ' Law ( properly spelled " Fitts's , " per the rules of American English , though rarely done so ) is simple , absolute , and immutable .
Let 's see how it pertains to the questions : Question 1 Microsoft
Toolbars offer the user the option of displaying a label below each tool .
Name at least one reason why labeled tools can be accessed faster .
( Assume , for this , that the user knows the tool and does not need the label just simply to identify the tool . )
Here are two answers .
You may have more .
The label becomes part of the target .
The target is therefore bigger .
Bigger targets , all else being equal , can always be acccessed faster .
Fitts ' Law .
When labels are not used , the tool icons crowd together .
At first glance , it might appear advantageous to crowd the icons together , since it results in less distance among targets .
However , the task here is not to hop from target to target .
Instead , the point of origin when a user decides to access the toolbar will usually be somewhere in the content region , away from all the targets .
When the icons are spread apart , users have a " buffer zone " between icons , where an incorrect acquisition will result in no action .
When the targets are crowded together , however , the user has more chance to initiate an unwanted action .
To avoid this possibility , non-label users learn to slow way down .
( Do n't bother to ask them whether they 've slowed down .
They 'll tell you it sped them up .
Only the stopwatch knows for sure . )
Another way to make the targets bigger , of course , is to always choose large icons , rather than small .
Pity the " power - user " with the 4x4 - pixel icons who thinks he 's going faster .
Question 2
You have a palette of tools in a graphics application that consists of a matrix of 16x16 - pixel icons laid out as a 2x8 array that lies along the left - hand edge of the screen .
Without moving the array from the left - hand side of the screen or changing the size of the icons , what steps can you take to decrease the time necessary to access the average tool ?
Two separate steps may be necessary to average tool access time .
Both are important .
Change the array to 1X16 , so all the tools lie along the edge of the screen .
Ensure that the user can click on the very first row of pixels along the edge of the screen to select a tool .
There should be no buffer zone .
This second step is vital , and is so often ignored .
Remember that Fitts '
Law states that access time is a function of distance and target size .
If the target size is larger , then the time is reduced .
It is reduced for a simple reason : the user need not slow down when approaching the target for fear of overshooting .
Now consider the screen edge .
How deep is the target ?
If it were really only the one pixel it appears , it would be very hard to hit .
However , the screen edge is , for all practical purposes , infinitely deep .
It does n't matter how fast that mouse is going when it hits the screen edge , that pointer absolutely will not overshoot .
Having to hit a pixel two pixels in from the screen edge takes much longer than hitting the edge itself .
Use that edge .
It is your friend .
Question 3
A right - handed user is known to be within 10 pixels of the exact center of a large , 1600 X 1200 screen .
You will place a single - pixel target on the screen that the user must stop upon and point to exactly .
List the five pixel locations on the screen that the user can access fastest .
For extra credit , list them in order from fastest to slowest access .
No , this is not a trick question .
And the first part should be immediately answerable by any interaction designer .
The extra credit question is not quite as simple .
But first , the locations of the five " magic pixels " :
The prime pixel is located at the current location of the mouse pointer .
Popup menus make use of this pixel , showing up relative to the mouse pointer , no matter where the user may have moved it .
This pixel requires zero travel and is , in effect , an infinitely large target you just can't miss it .
The other four pixels are located , on average , as far away from the mouse pointer as you can get .
Their distance , however , is more than made up for by their target size , which is infinite in two dimensions .
These magic pixels are the four corners of the screen .
Throw the mouse in any direction you desire and the odds are overwhelming that if you threw it with enough velocity , it will end up in one of those four corners .
This presupposes a properly designed acceleration function for the mouse .
The key to the extra credit question is in the user 's right - handedness .
A right - handed user can access , in order of increasing difficulty , and starting with the point already mentioned :
The pixel immediately at the current cursor location : Click the mouse and you 're done .
The bottom - right corner .
The top - left corner .
The top - right corner .
The bottom - left corner .
If you hold the mouse in your right hand and move the mouse , using just your wrist and hand , in the four different directions , you will see how the mechanics of your arm leads to this .
The answers for a left handed person are , of course , reversed .
These differences are relatively small compared to the power of the " magic pixels . "
All four corners should be used and used well .
Question 4 : Microsoft offers a Taskbar which can be oriented along the top , side or bottom of the screen , enabling users to get to hidden windows and applications .
This Taskbar may either be hidden or constantly displayed .
Describe at least two reasons why the method of triggering an auto - hidden Microsoft Taskbar is grossly inefficient .
Now these should have started getting easier .
Screen edges are prime real estate .
You do n't waste an entire edge that could be housing a couple of dozen different fast - access icons just for one object , the Taskbar .
The auto - hidden Taskbar is entirely too easy to display by accident .
Users are constantly triggering it when trying to access something that is close to , but not at , the edge .
The Taskbar would not have any of these problems , yet be even quicker to get to if it were located at any one of four corners of the display .
Throw the mouse up and to the left , for example , and you 'll have a taskbar displayed .
Fast access without the false triggering .
Question 5 Explain why a Macintosh pull - down menu can be accessed at least five times faster than a typical Windows pull - down menu .
For extra credit , suggest at least two reasons why Microsoft made such an apparently stupid decision .
Microsoft , Sun , and others have made the decision to mount the menu bar on the window , rather than at the top of the display , as Apple did .
They made this decision for at least two reasons :
Apple claimed copyright and patent rights on the Apple menu bar Everyone else assumed that moving the menu bar closer to the user , by putting it at the top of the window , would speed things up .
Phalanxes of lawyers have discussed point 1 .
Let 's deal with point two .
The Apple menu bar is a lot faster than menu bars in windows .
Why ?
Because , since the menu bar lies on a screen edge , it has an infinite height .
As a result , Mac users can just throw their mice toward the top of the screen with the assurance that it will never penetrate and disappear .
Unless , of course , I 'm testing them at the time .
I did a test at Apple where I mounted one monitor on top of another , with the menu bar at the top of the lower display .
The only way the user could get to the top monitor was by passing through the menu bar enroute .
I then gave users the task of repeatedly accessing menu bar items .
When they first started out , they penetrated into the upper screen by around nine inches on average , just because their mouse velocity was so high .
Then they learned they had to slow down and really aim for the menu .
By the time they adjusted , their menu-access times became so ponderously slow , they took around the same time as the average Windows user .
The other " advantage " usually ascribed to a menu bar at the top of each window is that users always know where to look for the items pertaining to the task they are carrying out .
This is silly .
Users may do various tasks within a given window , and the menu items may change .
Not only that , but a great many perverse applications exist , particularly in the Sun world , where the menu bar you need to access is not even in the window in which you are working !
That is truly bizarre and mind - bending .
Microsoft applications are beginning to offer the possibility , in full - screen mode , of a menu bar at the top of the display .
Try this out in Word or Excel .
It is much faster .
Microsoft 's general cluelessness has never been so amply displayed , however , as it is in Microsoft Visual Studio , which has a menu bar at the top of the screen with a one - pixel barrier between the screentop and the menu .
Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory .
Question 6
What is the bottleneck in hierarchical menus and what techniques could make that bottleneck less of a problem ?
The bottleneck is the passage between the first - level menu and the second - level menu .
Users first slide the mouse pointer down to the category menu item .
Then , they must carefully slide the mouse directly across ( horizontally ) in order to move the pointer into the secondary menu .
The engineer who originally designed hierarchicals apparently had his forearm mounted on a track so that he could move it perfectly in a horizontal direction without any vertical component .
Most of us , however , have our forarms mounted on a pivot we like to call our elbow .
That means that moving our hand describes an arc , rather than a straight line .
Demanding that pivoted people move a mouse pointer along in a straight line horizontally is just wrong .
We are naturally going to slip downward even as we try to slide sideways .
When we are not allowed to slip downward , the menu we 're after is going to slam shut just before we get there .
The Windows folks tried to overcome the pivot problem with a hack :
If they see the user move down into range of the next item on the primary menu , they do n't instantly close the second - level menu .
Instead , they leave it open for around a half second , so , if users are really quick , they can be inaccurate but still get into the second - level menu before it slams shut .
Unfortunately , people 's reactions to heightened chance of error is to slow down , rather than speed up , a well - established phenomenon .
Therefore , few users will ever figure out that moving faster could solve their problem .
Microsoft 's solution is exactly wrong .
When I specified the Mac hierarchical menu algorthm in the mid-'80s , I called for a buffer zone shaped like a < , so that users could make an increasingly - greater error as they neared the hierarchical without fear of jumping to an unwanted menu .
As long as the user 's pointer was moving a few pixels over for every one down , on average , the menu stayed open , no matter how slow they moved .
( Cancelling was still really easy ; just deliberately move up or down . )
Apple hierarchicals were still less efficient than single level menus , because of the added target , but at least they were less challenging than the average video game .
Sadly , the NeXT folks , when coming to Apple , copied Windows , rather than the Mac , in designing the hierarchical menu interface for OSX .
Today 's Mac hierarchicals are just as difficult to use as those of Windows .
Fitts ' law is not just about target size and distance ; it 's also about the number of targets .
The more targets , all else being equal , the longer the task will take .
Hierarchicals automatically add one extra target .
Making it difficult to enter a second - level menu adds an additional target , the second - level menu itself .
With my hierarchicals on the pre-OSX Macs , in most cases , the user did not even have to think about targetting the second - level menu .
The menu opened , and the user simply aimed for the desired item .
The only time the user had to consider the second - level menu separately was when there were so many items in the menu that the one the user was after was way up or way down the list , out of range of the allowable pivot for entry .
Even then , users would typically arc along a more radical curve to reach their items in a single motion , rather than breaking things down into the jerky Etch - A - Sketch types of moves users typically make with today 's hierarchicals .
When designing a user 's required motions , reduce the number of motions needed along with both distance and required precision for each motion , then consider how your proposed scheme maps onto a human 's ability to make those motions .
Question 7
Name at least one advantage circular popup menus have over standard , linear popup menus .
With the options displayed around you in a circle , you need only move a pixel or two to enter the " slice of pie " you want .
Less travel , good target size .
Good design .
They have a second advantage of feeding not only distance , but direction information into your motor memory .
As long as the options are few enough , you will soon learn to move your mouse up and to the left to print , down and to the right to fax , etc .
In fact , once these simple gestures are learned , you need n't even display the menu anymore , unless the user hesitates long enough to indicate they may be unsure .
( This was borne out during the course of the Fabrik project at Apple in the late 1980s . )
Question 8
What can you do to linear popup menus to better balance access time for all items ?
You can " Fittsize " them by making those items farther away from the mouse pointer larger .
They need not literally be larger , since the user is not having any trouble seeing the farther items .
Instead , the mapping of mouse - to - screen could be such that , as the user pulls further down the menu , more movement of the mouse is necessary to get a corresponding movement of the pointer .
In effect , you are decoupling the behavioral map of the screen from the visual map .
Other decoupling tricks include setting up local gravity , so that once a mouse pointer gets near the target , it is drawn to the target .
Barriers can be erected , so that once the mouse enters an object , it is difficult for it to pass through to the other side .
This can be frustrating .
Having a pressure - sensitive mouse that could " push through " if pushed down upon would enable the user either to be caught by the object or to flee to the territory beyond .
Reader Victor Zambrano has suggested another technique that will reduce acquisition time : Center the child menu , so that no item is more than total items / 2 away from the mouse . , as illustrated by Victor below :
