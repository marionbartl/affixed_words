BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Investigators in the northwest Chinese province of Shaanxi have found a radioactive device that was lost earlier this week when a cement plant was dismantled , the official Xinhua news agency said .
The lead ball containing Caesium - 137 , part of a nuclear scale used to make precise measurements , was lost on Monday as workers disassembled the Qinling Cement Co in Tongchuan , Shaanxi province , Xinhua said .
Investigators , suspecting the ball had been mistakenly sold as scrap metal , found on Friday that it had indeed been melted in a smelter at a local steel plant , Xinhua said .
Technicians were now cleaning the contaminated smelter , it said .
Caesium - 137 is an extremely toxic radioactive isotope formed through nuclear fission .
It can cause cancer years after it is inhaled , eaten or absorbed into the body .
Previous cases of radioactive caesium - 137 entering the scrap metal supply from improperly recycled sensors have occurred in Brazil and Spain .
Qinling Cement ’s 53 - year - old production facilities were dismantled after the plant failed to meet environmental protection standards , Xinhua said .
In concept , the human immune system has the power to destroy cancer cells with great specificity .
Therefore , cancer vaccines , like vaccines against influenza or other diseases , offer the hope of enticing the immune system to recognize proteins found on the surface of cancerous cells .
The reality , however , is that the immune system rarely takes the bait that these vaccines offer , and that other approaches to stimulating anti-cancer immunity are needed .
Now , researchers at Fox Chase Cancer Center , in collaboration with colleagues at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center , have shown that an engineered antibody called DTA - 1 led to rejection of 50 to 60 percent of tumors in a mouse model of melanoma .
The antibody allows the immune system to overcome its natural reluctance to attack tumor cells , the researchers say .
" Despite the promise of cancer vaccines , it has become clear that a vaccine alone wo n't necessarily generate an effective immune response , in large part due to suppressive elements within the tumor , " says the project 's lead researcher Adam D. Cohen , M.D. , an oncologist at Fox Chase .
" Here we show that we can use DTA - 1 to impair regulatory T cells , in effect waking the immune system to the presence of a cancer . "
Cohen presented his findings at the 100th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research , in Denver , Colorado .
DTA - 1 is an antibody designed to stimulate the glucocorticoid - induced tumor necrosis factor receptor ( GITR ) , a protein found on the surface of many T cells , including the regulatory T cells that suppress immune function and the effector T cells that help carry out an immune response .
DTA - 1 was developed by Shimon Sakaguchi , M.D. , Ph.D. , at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences in Kyoto , Japan .
According to Cohen , their studies show that DTA - 1 helps the immune system overcome its natural reluctance to attack tumor cells that it would otherwise have thought of as part of the body .
" Of course , we would n't want to completely shut down the immune system 's ability to differentiate its own cells , which can lead to autoimmune disease , " Cohen says .
" Our findings suggest , however , that DTA - 1 can temporarily and focally skew the ratio between regulatory and effector T cells in our favor . "
According to Cohen , their findings provide further support for the continued development of GITR - targeting antibodies , either alone or in combination with cancer vaccines , as an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating cancer .
Funding for this research comes from grants from the National Cancer Institute , the Charles A. Dana Foundation , the American Society of Clinical Oncology , and philanthropic funds from Swim Across America .
The Department of Homeland Security and police forces label anyone who they disagree with - or who disagrees with government policies - as " terrorists " .
Do n't believe me ?
Well , according to a law school professor , pursuant to the Military Commissions Act , " Anyone who ... speaks out against the government 's policies could be declared an ' unlawful enemy combatant ' and imprisoned indefinitely .
That includes American citizens . "
And according to an FBI memo , peace protesters are being labeled as " terrorists " .
Indeed , police have been terrorizing children , little old ladies and other " dangerous " people who attempted to peacefully protest .
And a 2003 FBI memo describes protesters ' use of videotaping as an " intimidation " technique , even though - as the ACLU points out - " Most mainstream demonstrators often use videotape during protests to document law enforcement activity and , more importantly , deter police from acting outside the law . "
The FBI appears to be objecting to the use of cameras to document unlawful behavior by law enforcement itself .
And the Internet has been labeled as a breeding ground for terrorists , with anyone who questions the government 's versions of history being especially equated with terrorists .
Now , the state of Missouri has labeled as terrorists current Congressman Ron Paul and his supporters , former Congressman Bob Barr , libertarians in general , anyone who holds gold , and a host of other people .
In other words , anyone who disagrees with the " acceptable " way of looking at things is a terrorist .
How is this different from Stalin or Mao 's use of labels such as " enemy of the state " ?
Sorry I have n’t been around much lately , but I am right in the middle of basketball season here in Indiana , and with coaching and all the other activities that go along with it has kept me extremely busy .
But there is a light at the end of the tunnel , this is my last year and hopefully we can go out with a bang , we are currently 7 - 1 and rated third in the state polls and this team has the talent to win it all but of course pulling it all off is a tough thing to do .
But it will all be over in March and then I can seriously devote all my free time to photography .
BTW … This is a shot from the Townsend area of the Smokies that I shot last fall , hope you enjoy it .
Internet chatter foreshadowed the deadly outbreak of listeriosis a month before the first reports of death from the food - borne bacteria surfaced in Canada , a new analysis shows .
Who was searching for information about the disease and why , remain a mystery .
But researchers say Google searches for the term " listeriosis " demonstrated a possible signal of the outbreak linked to the death of 20 Canadians before the official announcement was made in Canada .
The public was officially told on Aug. 20 , 2008 that a listeriosis outbreak had killed one person and had sickened 16 others .
But researchers from the University of Ottawa and Harvard Medical School found peak searching for the term " listeriosis " spiked beginning in mid to late July , " nearly a month before the declaration of the public outbreak , " the team reports in an article released Thursday by the Canadian Medical Association Journal .
The term " listeriosis " is more technical than listeria .
And peak searching for the word coincided with cases as they were occurring , as was confirmed later , and not with public announcements .
" In comparison , a massive increase in searching for the word ' Listeria ' coincided perfectly with news media attention , " write the authors .
Last summer 's deadly outbreak was traced to ready - to - eat meats produced at a Maple Leaf Foods plant in Toronto .
The company found listeria building up " deep inside " two slicing machines as the most likely source .
The Internet is " revolutionizing " how intelligence about epidemics and outbreaks is gathered , write Dr. Kumanan Wilson , of the Ottawa Health Research Institute and John Brownstein of Children 's Hospital Boston .
It 's also making it more difficult for countries to hide or to suppress the full extent of an outbreak .
" There 's all this massive amount of information that is being posted through a variety of different channels on the web — blogs , chat rooms , news media — sources that come outside of traditional public health , " says Brownstein .
The Montreal native is co-creator of HealthMap , a real - time , web - crawling system that pulls from more than 20,000 sources every hour for information on new and ongoing infectious disease outbreaks .
In November , Google launched Google Flu trends , which estimates how many people have a flu - like illness , based on the day 's tally of flu - related search queries .
Health Canada 's Global Public Health Intelligence Network identified the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province in China as early as November 2002 — more than two months before the World Health Organization published details on the cases .
" In the case of listeriosis , as soon as the outbreak was announced we saw people in Canada searching for the word " listeria ' , " Brownstein says .
" That 's not surprising .
The media drives a lot of people 's search habits on the web . "
But searching for the more technical term " listeriosis " began about a month before the public announcement , " and peaked a couple of weeks before . "
" We do know it was n't just in one location , what we can see is that it was in a few different places in the country , so it was n't like someone who was doing their PhD thesis alone caused the spike , " says Wilson , Canada Research Chair at the University of Ottawa and Ottawa Health Research Institute .
A 31 year - old chimp named Santino , who resides in Stockholm ’s Furuvik Zoo , is generating a flurry of excitement in the scientific community because he has demonstrated the ability to consciously plot and execute plans .
While scientists have known for decades that chimps are clever creatures , Santino has forced them to re-evaluate their baseline concerning primates .
Biologists at the zoo watched Santino one morning as he collected rocks and various pieces of debris before the zoo opened , then stored them in a hidden but strategic spot .
Just after noon , Santino moved to his stash of rocks and began hurling them at visitors standing across the moat .
“ These observations convincingly show that our fellow apes do consider the future in a very complex way , ” Lund University doctoral student Mathias Osvath , told the Associated Press .
“ It implies that they have a highly developed consciousness , including lifelike mental simulations of potential events . ”
Santino managed hit a few of his targets , but did not seriously injure anyone ; and his ability to plot and carry out a plan stands to shake the foundations of the animal kingdom as we know it .
A debate is now raging over whether Santino is just an exceptional genius within his species , or if all primates have the potential to be that smart .
Only time will tell , so be nice to the primates you meet .
By closely monitoring people with disrupted sleep patterns , researchers have documented the metabolic disarray produced by working at night and sleeping during the day .
As soon as their circadian rhythms became separated from a day - night cycle , test subjects ' levels of key metabolic hormones went haywire — the most compelling evidence yet that shift work is n't just an inconvenience , but an occupational hazard .
" Normally , the body clock prepares the body for certain activities at a certain time of day , " said study co-author Frank Scheer , a Harvard Medical School neuroscientist .
" But when it 's out of synchronization , it does n't prepare it properly . "
For years , scientists have known that people who work night shifts — about 15 million people in the United States — are unusually prone to heart disease , bone fractures , cancer , diabetes and obesity .
The patterns were initially explained as a function of poor nutrition and low exercise , but night workers do n't necessarily live less healthy lives than their day shift counterparts .
Risks remained high even when lifestyle was removed from the equation .
That left hypotheses about links between biological clocks and metabolic hormone regulation .
Studies on animals suggest a connection , but relatively little research has been conducted on people engaged in shift work .
The latest findings , published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , chart a clear path from work - sleep cycles to metabolic disregulation to disease .
" It 's an excellent study , " said University of Chicago endocrinologist Eve Van Cauter , who was not involved in the research .
" It 's groundbreaking in some ways . "
To create circadian disruption , Scheer 's team put test subjects on a
28 - hour cycle for eight days , each day waking them four hours later than on the previous day .
The researchers took hourly blood samples when test subjects were awake , and monitored their blood pressure , heart rate , body temperature and oxygen consumption around the clock .
The subjects ' bodies soon produced less leptin , a hormone secreted from fatty tissue that signals a body to stop eating by triggering feelings of satiety .
They experienced increases in blood glucose and insulin , which are linked to diabetes .
Levels of cortisol , a hormone released during periods of stress and linked to nearly every disorder in which night work has been implicated , shot up .
Test subjects ' blood pressure also rose .
" The surprising finding for us is that even so brief a misalignment caused quite impressive changes , " said Scheer .
Night shift workers often attempt to keep semi-normal hours on their off days , said Scheer , preventing their circadian rhythms from ever becoming settled .
Van Couter added that even a small exposure to daylight while commuting could continually re-set their biological clocks .
Scientists are not yet certain how circadian rhythms regulate metabolism , said Van Cauter , but animal studies have found circadian machinery in the hypothalamus — a brain structure linking the nervous and endocrine systems — and other parts of the body , including the glucose - regulating pancreas and leptin - releasing fatty tissue .
But Scheer cautioned that the experiment only approximated shift work .
" The future question is whether changes in these mechanisms would be maintained after chronic exposure and observed in a more lifelike situation , " he said .
" Our study was highly controlled and mechanistic .
Now it 's time to do something less controlled and more realistic . "
If the findings are replicated , researchers will try to find therapies capable of restoring metabolic order .
The best therapy of all , said Van Cauter , would be a permanent move to night work .
" That 's better than shifting between day and night work constantly , " she said , " but very few people want to always be a night worker . "

The BBC's Christian Fraser is the first British journalist to enter Gaza independently since the Israeli offensive began .
Israel is continuing to deny foreign journalists unsupervised access to the Strip .
He sent this report from Rafah , southern Gaza , which he entered from Egypt .
Nineteen days we had waited to cross into Rafah .
For three weeks we had watched the injured come through the crossing and thunderous explosions on the other side .
At last we were being allowed in to report it - independently .
Rafah has been pounded through this conflict .
The Israelis are targeting smuggling tunnels that extend beneath the perimeter wall .
Around 40,000 people who lived close to it are now homeless .
Five thousand of them are sheltering in three UN schools , so many of them are children .
Frightened children
They were pleased to see me .
Pleased to see anyone from the outside world .
" What 's your name , what 's your name , " they scream .
They are sleeping 25 to a classroom .
The desks have been piled high in a corner .
They share four mattresses and on this day a cabbage for their evening meal .
We met Mahmoud who was carrying his seven - month - old son Mohammed .
They are from Shaboura camp .
Ten days ago Mahmoud dug his son out of the rubble of his house , miraculously unscathed .
Now he hugs him close .
" I tell the children stories at night , " he says .
" I pull them all close to me , try to calm them .
I tell them they are not going to die .
That the bombing is all over . "
There are fathers all over Gaza working similar distractions .
Our host , Ahmed Adwan , told me that every time a bomb falls near his house , he dances for his three - year - old daughter .
She now thinks it is a game .
Waiting it out
But it is no laughing matter .
The psychological strain is huge and showing on the faces of the people we meet .
The jets fly over the house continually .
No -one sleeps .
No -one knows where the next bomb will fall .
There is not a moment 's peace .
Conversation is constantly interrupted by the roar of the Israeli jets overhead .
We have seen their " surgical " air strikes .
There is no doubt the Israelis have tried hard to hit their targets accurately .
The police station opposite the UN warehouse is now just a crater .
But there are plenty of bomb sites where there is extensive collateral damage .
It is no wonder there have been so many civilian casualties .
In the house in which we are staying the windows are all left open , in case the pressure from one of the blasts should blow the glass out .
Ahmed smoked 20 cigarettes a day before this conflict started .
" Now I smoke two and half packets every day , " he said .
" I am nervous all the time .
I worry for my family . "
His friend , Abu Moustafa , was forced to leave his house at the border over two weeks ago .
He is now living with relatives .
" I am a refugee twice over , " he says .
" My father lost his home to the Israelis in 1948 .
He was from Yebna village .
Now we are homeless again .
" My house is still standing but it is damaged .
" They have been bombing the area since the 28th .
There were 21 of us in the house that night .
I have n't seen my neighbours since .
There is no social interaction at the moment .
" It 's too dangerous to travel about town so we sit and we wait and we wait . "
Shattered economy The Palestinians of Rafah tell me the tunnels were their lifeline .
They say very few weapons came under the wall .
And now the tunnels are destroyed , they worry the shortages will become more acute .
" There is food but there is a chronic shortage of even the most basic commodities , " said Ahmed .
" Wheat flour , sugar , lentils , rice and prices have rocketed .
Everything is so much more expensive .
There are no shekels in Gaza , only dollars .
" The Uuwra employees here only got 50 % of their salaries last month because there is such a shortage of money in the strip .
" I can't draw out money from the bank .
My brother sends me cash from Egypt via people who return through the crossing . "
Fuel is another commodity that is more expensive .
Three weeks ago diesel was one shekel ( $ 0.26 ) a litre , now it is more than four .
" How are we going to get fuel if they do n't re-open the crossings ? " asked Ahmed .
" We have been living under siege for 18 months .
We do n't trust Israel to provide for us .
We are lacking so many things the West takes for granted .
Animal feed .
" They never talk about it but what are we supposed to feed our chickens and cows ?
That 's why the price of meat and poultry has risen so fast . "
In short , the economy of Gaza and Rafah is shattered - much like its people .
" We hope there will be a truce , " said Abu Moustafa .
" But how long will it last ?
If the international community continues to turn a blind eye to the injustices we suffer then we will never break this vicious circle .
We want peace too .
Who wants to live like this ? "

The former bosses of the two biggest UK casualties of the banking crisis have apologised " profoundly and unreservedly " for their banks ' failure .
Former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin told MPs on the Treasury Committee he " could not be more sorry " for what had happened .
The former bank chiefs also said the bonus culture had contributed to the crisis and needed to be reviewed .
But Sir Fred said if bankers felt they were not paid enough , they would leave .
Sir Tom McKillop , former RBS chairman , also admitted that his bank 's much - criticised purchase of Dutch rival ABN Amro had been a " big mistake " .
See how much bank bosses earned in 2007
The former bosses , along with other bankers , have been criticised for taking huge bonuses from banks that later had to rely on taxpayer money to survive .
Separately , the Tories demanded an urgent inquiry into claims that one of Gordon Brown 's key advisers , Sir James Crosby , sacked HBOS executive Paul Moore , who warned about excessive risk taking .
Sir James , who was HBOS ' chief executive at the time and is now the deputy head of the Financial Services Authority , allegedly sacked Mr Moore in 2005 after he warned the bank 's board about its potentially dangerous " sales culture " .
SIR FRED GOODWIN
Former chief executive , RBS , 50 Salary : £ 1.3 m plus £ 2.9 m performance bonus ( 2007 ) Born and raised in Paisley , near Glasgow Resignation announced in October 2008
AS IT HAPPENED : Bankers grilled by MPs RBS to cut 2,300 jobs
The MPs began Tuesday 's hearings by asking the former bosses about the bonuses they received in 2008 .
Sir Fred Goodwin said he had taken no bonus that year , but that he had taken home a salary of £ 1.46 m .
Andy Hornby , former chief executive of HBOS , said he had also not taken a a bonus last year , and that he had never taken any bonus in the form of cash .
" I have never received one single penny in cash bonus , " he said , referring to his time not only as boss of HBOS but also his time on the board .
Instead , he said , he had taken his bonuses in the form of shares .
" I have lost considerably more money than I have been paid , " he said , referring to falls in the value of shares that he had been given as bonuses .
Sir Fred Goodwin added he had lost around £ 5 m on the value of his shares in 2007 , although he stressed that he was not complaining .
Bonus culture Mr Hornby conceded that the culture , where bankers can receive many times their salary in cash bonuses , did need to be looked at .
SIR TOM MCKILLOP Former chairman , Royal Bank of Scotland , 65 Salary : £ 750,000 ( 2007 ) Resignation announced in October 2008
Read Robert Peston 's blog Read Nick Robinson 's blog " The bonus system has proved to be wrong .
Substantial cash bonuses do not reward the right kind of behaviour , " he said .
Sir Tom McKillop agreed that a fundamental review of remuneration was needed .
But when asked whether the bonus culture encouraged excessive risk taking and had exacerbated the banking crisis , Sir Fred Goodwin argued that traders had been trading within set limits , and had simply been doing " what they were authorised to do " .
It is " hard to say that remuneration was a cause [ of the bank 's problems ] , " he said .
Huge losses Sir Fred oversaw a number of acquisitions that made Edinburgh - based RBS one of the world 's biggest banks .
ANDY HORNBY Former chief executive , HBOS , 42 Salary : £ 1.93 m , including bonus and benefits ( 2007 ) Joined HBOS from Asda in 1999 Resignation announced in October 2008
But his £ 10bn deal to buy Dutch rival ABN Amro late in 2007 is now seen as ill - timed and a deal too far in light of RBS 's inability to survive the credit crunch without a massive injection of government funds .
Sir
Tom admitted to the committee that the deal to buy ABN was " a big mistake " .
" We bought it at the top of the market and anything we paid was an error .
We are sorry we bought ABN Amro , " he said .
Sir Fred said it was a " bad decision and certainly mistimed . "
He said the size of RBS , together with its lack of cash following the ABN Amro , made it particularly susceptible to the credit crunch .
RBS is now nearly 70 % - owned by the taxpayer after a government rescue package was put in place at the end of last year .
No easy ride
The ex-bosses of HBOS also admitted mistakes .
When pushed , Lord Stevenson , former chairman of HBOS , said the mistake the bank made was a failure to predict the credit crunch , which effectively froze access to new funds .
LORD STEVENSON
Former chairman HBOS Salary : £ 821,000 including benefits ( 2007 ) Resignation announced in October 2008 " The fundamental mistake of HBOS was the failure to predict the wholesale collapse of the wholesale markets , " he said .
The MPs asked why a HBOS group risk manager was sacked in 2005 for raising questions about the levels of risk the bank was taking on .
Lord Stevenson would not be drawn on the specifics of the sacking , simply saying that it had been subject to an independent investigation .
But Mr Hornby stressed that an over - reliance on wholesale capital markets for funding was indeed the root cause of the problem .
" We were over - exposed to wholesale funding , " he said .
Banks use the wholesale markets to raise cash - effectively borrowing money from other financial institutions .
When this funding dried up as a result of the credit crunch , the bank was left high and dry , he and Lord Stevenson argued .
HBOS was rescued by Lloyds and the merged group is now more than 40 % - owned by the government .
The bosses still in place at the helm of Britain 's leading banks will appear before the Treasury Committee on Wednesday .

[ TYPES / announce ] EPTCS , a new open access proceedings series
With this email , we are launching Electronic Proceedings in Theoretic Computer Science ( EPTCS ) a new international refereed open access venue for the rapid electronic publication of the proceedings of workshops and conferences , and of festschrifts , etc , in the general area of theoretical computer science , broadly construed .
We do not charge authors or event organisers for electronic publication in EPTCS in any way .
If hard - copies of proceedings are desired , event organisers have the choice of organising the printing themselves or taking advantage of a standard contract we will make with a printing house .
Copyright on all papers is retained by the author , and full - text electronic access to all papers is freely available , without any need for registration or subscription .
Permanent archival of EPTCS publications is ensured by organising EPTCS as an overlay of the Computing Research Repository ( CoRR ) : see arXiv.org .
The content of EPTCS will be indexed by DBLP .
Only original papers will be considered for publication in EPTCS : manuscripts are accepted for review by an EPTCS conference or workshop with the understanding that the same work has not been published , nor is presently submitted , elsewhere .
However , full versions of extended abstracts published in EPTCS , or substantial revisions , may later be published elsewhere .
The submission and refereeing process is handled entirely by the organisation of the conference , workshop or festschrift to which the paper is submitted .
Our editorial board carefully selects which workshops and conferences can be trusted to select scientific papers of quality only , and only those events will be granted a contract to fill a volume of EPTCS .
Our editorial board consists of : Luca Aceto Rob van Glabbeek Gordon Plotkin Rajeev Alur Lane A. Hemaspaandra Vladimiro Sassone Krzysztof R. Apt Matthew Hennessy Robert H. Sloan Lars Arge Bartek Klin Wolfgang Thomas Ran Canetti Evangelos Kranakis Irek Ulidowski Luca Cardelli Shay Kutten Dorothea Wagner Rocco De Nicola Nancy Lynch Martin Wirsing Jose ' Luiz Fiadeiro Aart Middeldorp Moti Yung Wan Fokkink Benjamin Pierce Further information can be found on our website : http://eptcs.org/.

Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning John Harrison Intel Corporation , Portland , Oregon
The sheer complexity of computer systems has meant that automated reasoning , i.e. the ability of computers to perform logical inference , has become a vital component of program construction and of programming language design .
This book meets the demand for a self - contained and broad - based account of the concepts , the machinery and the use of automated reasoning .
The mathematical logic foundations are described in conjunction with practical application , all with the minimum of prerequisites .
The approach is constructive , concrete and algorithmic : a key feature is that methods are described with reference to actual implementations ( for which code is supplied ) that readers can use , modify and experiment with .
This book is ideally suited for those seeking a one - stop source for the general area of automated reasoning .
It can be used as a reference , or as a place to learn the fundamentals , either in conjunction with advanced courses or for self study .
• One stop reference that is broad - based and self - contained • Constructive approach that enables topics to be discussed algorithmically ; implementation of these algorithms provided as code •
Can be used as a reference , or as a place to learn the fundamentals , either in conjunction with advanced courses or for self study

I remember the year I tried to grow tomatoes .
I dug a new bed until my hands blistered .
I mixed dried manure and peat into hard clay , planted seedlings and used soft cloth to tie the vines to stakes so as not to cut into the delicate stems .
By the end of summer I harvested about three tomatoes , the most expensive vegetables I 've ever eaten .
This year maybe I 'll give it one more try , in a far sunnier spot .
( There 's one lesson learned the hard way . )
It seems to be what everyone else is doing .

Demand for vegetable seeds is up about 22 percent over last year , says George Ball , chairman and chief executive of the Burpee seed company .
" That 's astounding , " Ball said in a phone interview .
It follows a similar jump that happened last year , but he said they had thought that increase was only a blip in demand .
Remember the Great Salsa Scare of 2008 , when e-coli threatened America 's favorite tomato / cilantro combo ?
The National Gardening Association says about 19 percent more households plan to grow their own fruits , vegetables and herbs this year .
And more than half the people they surveyed said they were doing it to save money on food .
Indeed , it does n't appear to be just a generalized outbreak of green thumb fever .
Sales of flower seeds are flat to down , according to a number of retailers I spoke with .
Times surely are tough if people have quit growing flowers .
In the Washington area it 's safe to plant seeds outdoors after about the third week of April , according to Walt Yates , a spokesman for Park Seed Co .
But avid gardeners are already getting seeds started indoors .
( Take a look at this calendar of other gardening tasks by month . )
Seed retailers are cultivating ( groan ) the Victory Garden trend , of course .
Burpee is pushing its Money Garden which it says has enough seed to grow $ 650 worth of beans , lettuce , peppers , carrots , sugar snap peas and tomatoes , all on a tenth of an acre .
Before you get started , though , check out the cool Kitchen Garden Planner online tool from Gardener 's Supply Co. Maybe if I had that I would n't have wasted all my effort on three piddly tomatoes .
Usually , when you 're talking about how landscaping adds value to a home , you 're talking about flowers , trees and other greenery chosen for looks -- in other words , curb appeal .
Vegetable gardens traditionally are tucked out back .
But perhaps in these times a healthy stand of home - grown spinach is a selling point ?
Are you contemplating a food garden ?
Do you have tips to share with others who might be considering such an addition ?
Tell us about it .
Paul Rand ’s Final Logo Part 2
Doug Evans +
Partners
It was all quite surreal .
Both meeting Doug Evans and being in the presence of a trove of Paul Rand work , yet not being at the Yale archives .
Doug and I had traded emails for the better part of two years , several of which he was not on the same continent as me and this was the first time we stood face - to - face .
We were to meet at 7 am on a workday at his storage locker in Lower Manhattan .
It was in the middle of New York ’s 10 straight days of rain which came in October .
It was pouring and I was late and lost .
I decided to walk one block east after standing on a corner getting wet even under an awning , and I found it .
Doug already had a bakers ’ rack wheeled out of the 5 ’ X 10 ’ space but the rest was filled with boxes stacked to the ceiling .
We were looking for a single sheet of paper .
Fueled by a combination of history and simple pride , Doug and I were driven to find Paul Rand ’s original sketch of the Servador logo .
Doug knew it existed .
I just hoped .
Two weeks earlier , I had posted an article highlighting what we believed was Paul Rand ’s final logo for a company called Servador .
Well , not only had it come into question that it was Rand ’s final logo , but that he had even designed it at all .
I believe we moved some scuba gear out of the way .
A few lamps .
Two leopard statues .
Maybe they were dogs .
A 3 ’ X 4 ’ original silk - screened poster autographed by Rand .
The signs were good .
There was a bunch of other stuff but it was the three or four file boxes which had my focus .
Finally , we reached them .
Doug found the Servador sketch almost immediately .
I have to say , his files were surprisingly well organized considering the hodgepodge of collectibles in the locker and Doug ’s Einsten - like hair .
The sketch was perfect and exactly what we wanted .
We had actual proof that Rand designed the Servador logo .
There was more though .
For the next half hour , sketch after sketch of logos emerged along with faxes , computer printouts , doodles , personal letters , and sketches of posters and book covers .
In addition to those covering Servador , we found material on American Express , Sears , USSB , NPR , Enron , and Computer Impressions ( One of three companies of Doug ’s for which Paul Rand designed a logo ) .
There was a world of design history there , never before seen by most of the profession , never by Steve Heller and possibly Marion Rand .
Maybe no one other than Paul Rand , Doug Evans and their clients had seen this work .
We were moving quickly .
I was trying to take in and absorb the work knowing that once it passed my eyes , I would probably not have the chance to see much of it again , at least not the originals .
I found myself staring , almost paralyzed at times looking at faded pencil drawings only to be pressed by Doug to keep focused .
We also found a file for Doug Evans +
Partners ,
Doug ’s consulting firm , loaded with sketches and back - and - forth from Paul and Doug .
The process was similar to Rand ’s other late work .
Rand would do all of the sketching and Doug would produce the work on the computer .
There were many faxes and what was surprising to both of us was that the dates showed that the work was actually done after Servador , and in fact was done right before Rand passed .
As quickly as we had unloaded the space , we repacked the locker and headed for a copy store .
As I rushed and fumbled to make copies , Doug raced to his apartment to wash up and pack as he was in New York for less than 24 hours .
He picked me up before I was really finished , and then we drove to Steve Heller ’s office in Midtown and showed him the sketches .
Heller confirmed the autheticity of the Servador logo and commented on Speak Up regarding Doug Evans +
Partners , Rand ’s actual final logo .
Heller wrote that Rand ’s final logo “ was , in fact , designed for Doug Evans ’ consulting firm and was fine - tuned by Rand while he was in his hospital bed . ”
Heller went on , “ I do recall him telling me on the phone that he was working on a logo days before he passed . ”
After Heller ’s confirmation , I went to work and Doug drove straight to Connecticut to share the work with Marion Rand and to leave it with her .
She in turn has passed the work to the Yale Archives where she believes it belongs .
Paul Rand ’s actual final logo was for Doug Evans +
Partners .
Below are the sketches and final designs .
Enjoy .

April 27 , 2009
The current media frenzy concerning Obama 's coming release of more information on U.S. torture between 2000 and 2005 is a political storm conveniently kept out of context .
There are two aspects to the context that are missing .
First , this is not new information and well before current events erupted into the news , the case has been made all along that the Bush administration in general � Bush and Cheney , their political advisors and legal representatives � are all complicit in contravening the Geneva Conventions on torture and the treatment of prisoners of war .
Secondly , terror and torture go hand in glove , the two are fully related and have been used by the U.S. and its proxies in many different contexts around the world � and are still doing so as Obama has put an end to torture at Guantanamo , but has not denied renditions to friendly torturers elsewhere .
The spin-doctors in the White House are no longer allowing the use of the term " war on terror " although the facts of the war have not changed .
As the global war on whatever or the long war on whomever continues , the abuses associated with terror and torture will continue to spread .
The initiator of terror of course is the occupier of foreign territories creating the obvious wish on the part of the indigenous populations for the occupier to go home , currently involving most of the Middle East from Israel / Palestine through to Pakistan .
This has happened throughout history , ancient and modern , from the Crusades and the Mongol hordes through the genocide of native populations in the Americas to the more modern terrors of a highly developed technological warfare that readily conquers " enemies " as defined by the political elites for a variety of reasons from religious zealotry to political zealotry , frequently one and the same thing , seen most evidently in the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan� .
and Pakistan ?
Put in simpler terms , the U.S. uses terror , the U.S. uses torture , its allies and compatriots use terror , use torture , and as the U.S. expands it war frontiers further into Pakistan , so will the edges of terror and torture expand .
Power and Control Torture is ultimately about power and control .
It ranges from the pure brutality of physical torture often described in many of the wars for suppression of indigenous control in Central America to the more ' refined � torture currently used to break down a prisoner�s psychological persona without leaving the physical scars of the less sophisticated forms of torture .
Torture is used to create terror , to create a population that is subservient and easily controlled by the very fear , the terror that it spreads .
In turn , as terror and torture strips away the thin layers of civilization that control man�s baser instincts , terror and torture become devices used by the combatants on both sides .
As the most powerful country in the world , the U.S. role in abrogating human rights and crimes against humanity have a powerful effect elsewhere in the world .
" The actions of the United States have also made it more difficult to criticize the violations of international law by other countries , most notably Israel . "
What occurred at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo and Bagram airbase " bear more than a passing resemblance " with the " testimonies of Palestinians released from Israeli prisons . "
( 1 ) As expressed shortly after Abu Ghraib , " the powerful often turn to torture in times of crisis not because it works but because it salves their fears and insecurities with the psychic balm of empowerment . "
Even though torture does not do what it is purported to do , provide useful information , " a plea to torture one terrorist with a ticking bomb becomes the rationale for insecure leaders to win the right to torture someone , anyone , to assuage the uncertainties of rule and empower themselves for dominion . "
( 2 ) Obama I have no sympathy � and perhaps a seed of disdain - for Obama�s current problems on the political front with his inheritance of the Bush legacy of torture .
If the world is to look forward with " hope " for " change " it needs to start at home .
Simply releasing more information will provide neither hope nor change .
If Obama wishes to be more than a man of wonderful sounding phrases , he will have to do what is correct by international law and arrange whatever is necessary under U.S. law to investigate and prosecute those involved with the torture � not just the low level people , those " following orders " , but the ones in the executive and legislative branches who formed the concept and provided the legal okay for it , contrary to international laws .
From readings of international law , Obama himself becomes guilty of torture as anyone who is complicit with aiding and abetting torture becomes guilty of the crime .
If he refuses to act , then under international standards , Obama becomes guilty of the crime .
Unfortunately the U.S. is one of the most contradictory countries when it comes to upholding laws , always telling others that they need to be transparent , open , democratic , but when it suits its own purposes it relies on ignoring , abrogating , or denying international law .
Guilty Until Proven Innocent Phillippe Sands work " Torture Team " examines one particular case related to Guantanamo and arrives at the clear conclusion that there is good case for prosecuting Bush , Cheney , Feith , Haynes , Gonzales , Yoo , Bybee and others from this case in itself .
( 3 ) Others included in this list are the medical workers , physicians and psychologists , who supported those actually applying the torture .
Within its own internal laws the U.S. has provided immunity from prosecution under the Military Commissions
Act as it " Gives US officials immunity from prosecution for torturing detainees that were captured before the end of 2005 by US military and CIA . "
( 4 ) Sands adds , " Legislation creating such an immunity would allow the crime to be covered up : it was almost an admission that a crime had occurred . "
( 5 ) That immunity , however arguable under U.S. law , does not extend outside the U.S. : " Under the principle of universal jurisdiction , any country may prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by anyone anywhere . "
( 6 ) Alfred McCoy in " A Question of Torture � CIA Interrogation From the Cold War to the War on Terror " examines the history of torture up to the days of Abu Ghraib .
He starts by stating " five intertwined aspects of its perverse psychology " , the fifth of which needs to be restated strongly today : " �a nation that sanctions torture in defiance of its democratic principles pays a terrible price .
For nearly two millennia , the practice has been identified with tyrants and empires .
For the past two centuries , its repudiation has been synonymous with the humanist ideals of the Enlightenment and democracy .
When any modern state tortures even a few victims , the stigma compromises its majesty and corrupts its integrity .
Its officials must spin an ever more complex web of lies that , in the end , weakens the bonds of trust and the rule of law that are the sine qua non of a democracy . "
( 7 ) For Obama to avoid complicity , for Obama to not be seen as opposing basic human rights , for Obama to avoid being labelled an ineffective orator , he needs to act on the information that is at hand and proceed with some form of investigation that has the power it needs to fully complete its legal tasks .
For the U.S. to not be seen as it has for the past decade as a country that trammels other people�s international rights , the people of the U.S. , and their elected representatives , need to support that investigation .
Canadian Complicity Canada is a minor player on the world political scene , increasingly seen as nothing more than a U.S. puppet , a minion succouring favour , trying to be one of the big boys on the global stage by supporting the Bush doctrine , even after Bush is gone .
The Canadian government under Harper has supported the U.S. in Afghanistan and currently on into Pakistan without considering the context of who started the great mujahideen warriors in the first place ( the U.S. CIA and Pakistani ISI ) and why they are now fighting them in Central Asia ( gas , oil , containment of China and Russia ) .
This complicity extends to torture .
The case of Maher Arar is a relatively well - known extradition case that the government aided in .
More recently , now that Guantanamo is being shut down , a Canadian citizen Omar Khadr is being denied entry back into Canada even though the Federal Court has said it should be allowed .
One of the government�s arguments is that Khadr needs to be processed through the U.S. legal system ( hmm�see above ) even though under international law he could be tried here in Canada .
While Harper wishes to appear tough on terrorism , he is only making himself complicit in the illegal practices utilized by the U.S. at Guantanamo , soon perhaps to be sanctioned by Obama as well .
The Canadian pretender to the throne , whom I do not always agree with , appears to understand the situation more clearly than Harper .
Michael Ignatieff states , " �even in emergency , even if some liberties must be suspended , a constitutional state must remain answerable to the higher law , a set of standards that protect foundational commitments to the dignity of every person . "
( 8 ) Terror�s Answer Terror is an act of aggression .
It is part and parcel of the nature of warfare , and is a particular conjoint of unilateral pre-emptive warfare .
The answer to terror is twofold .
First the initiating countries , those that are doing the invading , manipulating , coercive activities , need to stop .
The second is that terror used in response to terror cannot be stopped by war , but needs to be stopped by international police work and the upholding of international law internally and internationally by all parties .
For Canada , hopefully Harper will see the last of his controlling reign in the next election and equally hopefully , Ignatieff can stand up his own beliefs in human rights extending beyond state legalities .
Obama needs to act in his own back yard and ignore his own state legalities of the Military Commissions Act , or terror will continue regardless of any war label applied to U.S. actions .
If it cannot be contained and brought to justice in the U.S. it will not happen internationally .

This is a brief history of RPG design in terms of general style .
Many authors have portrayed RPG design as being evolutionary .
For example , Greg Porter outlines four generations of RPGs in his article " Where We've Been , Where We 're Going " from Inter * Action # 1 .
This projects the common view that RPGs have become more " sophisticated " over the three decades since Dungeons & Dragons was introduced .
This is fundamentally a technological view of RPG design .
In contrast , I wish to look at the development of RPGs as an artistic history -- where there are trends which may die out , or classic fashions which may revive .
Typically art is characterized by having " movements " rather than " generations " .
This avoids the implication that there is some evolutionary improvement , which may not be the case .
My concern is that perspective on back - and - forth changes may be overlooked from evolutionary thinking .
Also , a vital piece of game design which is often overlooked is the model for adventures .
For example , early D&D was defined by the keyed dungeon map and room descriptions .
This is a vastly different view of play from , say , 1990 's published adventures for Torg -- which detail a series of acts and scenes for play .
The model for adventures has changes alongside mechanics , and is far more important for play than the type of dice rolled .
I would distinguish nine major movements in RPG design .
Of course , the same disclaimers apply to these as to any other artistic categories .
Many games wo n't fit into any of these movements , and many games will only partly fit .
I see these movements as influences , rather than rigidly defined categories .
The categories I see are :
D&D , Melee , et al .
Call of Cthulhu , Pendragon , et al .
RoleMaster , HârnMaster , et al .
Toon , Marvel Superheroes , et al .
GURPS and its imitators .
Star Wars , Feng Shui , et al .
Vampire : The Masquerade , et al .
Amber Diceless , Everway , et al .
D&D3 / D20 , Rune , et al .
Generalizing and relating these movements together .
Influential systems by year .
1975 - 1980 : Explorational Wargames
There is no doubt that role - playing games in general originated from Dungeons & Dragons .
The early games were clearly related to wargames , but with a twist .
There was an explorational component , expressed as keyed maps fully known only to the GM .
This map - based approach to adventure was vital to how adventures were conceived .
It is worth noting that this is a very player - driven approach in many ways , compared with later story - oriented adventures .
While it is expected that the players stay within the bounds of the underground complex , the pace and direction of the actions is generally controlled by the players .
Especially with a published module , the GM 's function becomes almost marginal -- revealing the contents of the keyed description for that map location , and rolling for monsters .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1973 : Dungeons & Dragons ( TSR )
1975 : En Garde ( GDW ) , Tunnels & Trolls ( FB )
1977 : Melee ( Metagaming )
1978 : Gamma World ( TSR )
1980 : Dragonquest ( SPI )
1978 - 1988 : Literary Simplicity
Certainly in reaction to the wargame - like approach of D&D , a more literary approach to role - playing came at first from Chaosium .
It made a number of games from literary adaptations .
For Chaosium , the rules were based on a percentile skill - based system originally developed for RuneQuest ( RQ ) .
However , later revisions of the core system came to be known as Basic Roleplaying ( BRP ) , and were generally simpler than RQ .
BRP 's approach had a few key ideas :
A simple system which tried to be transparent .
Personality mechanics tailored to genre , such as CoC's Sanity and Pendragon 's Virtues .
More literary genres , with more emphasis on setting and culture rather than violence .
Investigatory adventures , where play revealed a back - story of some sort .
A typical adventure would have described locations , but more importantly would have clues through which the PCs could uncover the history of the current situation .
Doing so would quickly lead to the resolution of the adventure .
RuneQuest
RuneQuest
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1978 : RuneQuest ( Chaosium )
1981 : Call of Cthulhu ( Chaosium ) , Stormbringer ( Chaosium )
1983 : Ringworld ( Chaosium )
1985 : Pendragon ( Chaosium ) , Skyrealms of Jorune ( Skyrealms Publishing )
1987 : Ars Magica ( Lion Rampant )
1988 : Space : 1889 ( GDW )
Space : 1889
Traveller 2300
Twilight 2000
Space : 1889
1980 - 1988 : Rules - Heavy Worlds
The eighties began with a move towards more extensive rules sets .
The key system which began the trend was Iron Crown Enterprise 's Rolemaster , which came out as a series of rules modules .
This also took some inspiration from RuneQuest -- but whereas BRP simplified the RuneQuest rules , Rolemaster added more detail and complexity .
Stylistically , this was a move towards a more gritty , naturalist type of game .
Where D&D modules were about isolated dungeons , these modules were about regions of the world .
One can see this clearly in the product lines for Space Opera , Middle Earth Role - Playing , Twilight 2000 , and HârnMaster .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1978 : RuneQuest ( Chaosium )
1980 : Rolemaster ( ICE ) , Space Opera ( FGU )
1981 : Aftermath ( FGU )
1983 : Powers and Perils ( Avalon Hill )
1984 : Middle Earth Roleplaying ( ICE ) , Twilight 2000 ( GDW )
1986 : HârnMaster ( Columbia ) , Phoenix Command ( Leading Edge ) , Space Master ( ICE ) , Traveller 2300 ( GDW )
1984 -1993 : Comical Rules-lite
The competing trend in the eighties was the emergence of truly rules - lite systems -- certainly in part in reaction to the heavy rule sets .
This was kicked off in 1984 with Steve Jackson Games ' Toon and TSR's Marvel Superheroes .
Hallmarks include :
A focus on beginning players .
This includes a very quick and easy introductory guide , along with components for use in play ( like Marvel 's character cards , maps , and counters ) .
Simple and colorful mechanics .
Comical genres , in the sense of naturally illustrated through comics or cartoons .
This is explicit in Marvel , Toon , and Prince Valiant -- but true for the rest as well .
Paranoia 's tone is set by the darkly humorous comics and tag lines in the rulebook .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1984 : Adventures of Indiana Jones ( TSR ) , Chill ( Pacesetter ) , Marvel Superheroes ( TSR ) , Paranoia ( WEG ) , Toon ( SJG )
1986 : Ghostbusters ( WEG )
1987 : Teenagers from Outer Space ( RTG )
1988 : Macho Women With Guns ( BTRC )
1989 : Prince Valiant ( Chaosium )
1993 : Amazing Engine ( TSR )
Prince Valiant
Amazing Engine
1986 - Present : Universal Problem - Solving
Steve Jackson Games grabbed a solid central market share with its game GURPS .
While Chaosium had tried a similar approach with Worlds of Wonder in 1982 , it was half - hearted at best .
In many ways , this trend is the natural extension of the " Rules - Heavy Worlds " movement .
It was impractical to develop and test a new complex rule set for each setting , so the rules were developed separately .
Nearly all RPG companies developed their own house system , and many publish it in a " universal " form at some point .
But besides being universal , there were other elements that GURPS emphasized .
True to the rules - heavy predecessors , there is a focus on world background -- but little focus on matching genre conventions of the stories .
GURPS also developed an emphasis on real - world research and history .
Sourcebooks and adventures tended to be well - researched and literate .
But whereas the " Literary Simplicity " movement had adventures which revealed a genre - tinged backstory , GURPS adventures tend to be about skillful problem - solving .
This is more than tactical combat , often hinging on unravelling a mystery and / or completing a series of non -combat tasks like retrieving an item , sabotaging a plan , and so forth .
GURPS adapted the open point - based character creation of Hero Games ' " Champions " .
This introduced a distinct aesthetic of character modeling into system design -- conceiving a character independent of system and then trying to build it within the system .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1986 : GURPS ( SJG )
1989 : The HERO System ( Hero )
1990 : CORPS ( BTRC )
1996 : The D6 System ( WEG )
1999 : Simply Roleplaying ( Microtactix )
2002 : The Action ! System ( GRG ) , EABA ( BTRC )
2003 : Silhouette CORE Rules ( DP9 ) , Tri-Stat DX Core System ( GoO )
1987 - Present : Fast Cinematic Action
In the late eighties , as the rules - heavy and rules - light trends competed , there were two key transitional systems : West End Games ' Star Wars ( 1987 ) and FASA 's Shadowrun ( 1989 ) .
Both of these were mechanically innovative , popularizing and elaborating the dice pool concept .
But they also represented a shift in genre and flavor .
They were colorful and action - packed , and they introduced the concept of character templates .
Perhaps more importantly , these games began to take movies -- and in particular action movies -- as a very strict model .
Published adventures began to appear which were organized into a sequence of " scenes " , often divided into " acts " .
Each scene had a location , often with boxed text to be read .
This was highly influential even among older games .
For example , many 2nd edition AD&D adventures had a similar structure .
What is distinct about the cinematic trend is that dice pools tended to be abandoned .
The mechanics varied , but the emphasis was on finding a fast - resolving but still exciting mechanic to handle the cinematic combats .
The style of play emphasized speeding through any sort of slow - moving parts to get on with the next scene .
This is epitomized in the approach of Feng Shui .
Broadly speaking , key qualities are :
Character Templates :
These are not classes , but closer to quick ready - to - use pregenerated characters .
The emphasis is on speeding through character creation to get to the action .
: These are not classes , but closer to quick ready - to - use pregenerated characters .

Fast Resolution :
There is a focus on making combat quick to resolve , rather than tactically challenging or balanced .

: Adventures are broken down into scenes , each of which has a specific dramatic purpose .
Cinematic Influence : Games were very specifically patterned after various subgenres of action movies .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1987 : Star Wars ( WEG )
1989 : Shadowrun ( FASA )
1990 : Torg ( WEG )
1993 : Earthdawn ( FASA )
1994 : Masterbook ( WEG )
1996 : Feng Shui ( Daedalus ) , Deadlands ( PEG )
1997 : Champions : The New Millenium ( RTG )
1998 : Hercules & Xena ( WEG )
1999 : 7th Sea ( AEG )
2002 : Buffy the Vampire Slayer ( Eden )
1991 - Present : Dark Storytelling
A parallel and related trend was the one set by White Wolf 's Vampire : The Masquerade ( 1991 ) .
It was enormously popular among players and influential among designers .
It solidified the trend towards dice pools started by Star Wars and Shadowrun -- and that soon became the most popular approach of the nineties .
More important was its change in tone , layout , and approach .
Key features of Vampire were :
Whereas cinematic action tended to focus on speed of resolution , storytelling games tend to use dice themselves as a means of flavor .
White
Wolf dice pools mean viscerally handling numbers of dice and counting out successes .
In Nomine used its " d666 " approach .
used its " d666 " approach .
" Splats " :
These are groupings which are chosen as part of character creation , such as vampire clans .
They are first and foremost in - game social and cultural groups -- a basis for character identity .
They may or may not be mechanically significant as classes .
: These are groupings which are chosen as part of character creation , such as vampire clans .

They may or may not be mechanically significant as classes .
Adventures , from what I have seen , have a chapter and / or scene breakdown .
However , rather than action set - pieces , the emphasis is on mood - setting .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1991 : Vampire : The Masquerade ( WW )
1992 : Werewolf : The Apocalypse ( WW )
1993 : Mage : The Ascension ( WW ) , Kult ( Metropolis )
1994 : Immortal : The Invisible War ( Precedence ) , Nephilim ( Chaosium )
1994 : Changeling : The Dreaming ( WW )
1996 : Fading Suns ( Holistic ) , Witchcraft ( Myrmidon )
1997 : Legend of the Five Rings ( AEG ) , In Nomine ( SJG )
1998 : Warlock : Dark Spiral ( Black Gate ) , Tribe 8 ( DP9 )
An interesting offshoot of this trend has been the success of European translations / adaptations .
These include Chaosium 's translation of " Nephilim " from French , Metropolis ' translation of the Swedish game " Kult " , and SJG 's adaptation of the French game " In Nomine " .
1991 - Present : Diceless Fantasy
Diceless was undoubtably kicked off by Eric Wujcik 's Amber Diceless Role- playing ( 1991 ) .
However , the influence is more than just a lack of randomizers .
It was also a shift to a more rules - lite , GM - moderated approach .
Stats are reduced to just a handful ( like Amber 's four ) .
The trend also includes a shift towards a more dream - like fantasy quality of stories , which seems suited to the less mechanical approach -- like the surreal Burroughs - esque Over the Edge , the baroque fantasy of Castle Falkenstein , or the interdimensional visionary worlds of Everway .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
1991 : Amber Diceless ( Phage )
1992 : Over the Edge ( Atlas )
1993 : Theatrix ( Backstage )
1994 : Castle Falkenstein ( RTG )
1995 : Everway ( WotC )
1998 : Dragonlance : The Fifth Age ( TSR )
1999 : Nobilis ( Pharos )
2000 - Present : Crunchy Challenge
The new millennium has seen a revival of the explicitly crunchy , tactical approach which largely died out in the eighties .
The center of this by far has been the success of WotC's 3rd edition D&D and the " D20 " system .
There is renewed attention paid to game balance and tactical depth , and a revival of the explorational approach of original D&D .
I see this largely as a reaction against the limitations of the linear story - oriented approaches of both the " Fast Cinematic Action " and the " Dark Storytelling " movements .
There is also reaction against the neglect of game balance in favor of speed and / or mood .
Notable RPGs influenced by this movement include :
2000 : D&D 3rd edition ( WotC )
2001 : Exalted ( WW ) , Hackmaster ( Kenzer ) , Rune ( Atlas ) , Wheel of Time ( WotC )
2002 : The HERO System ( 5th ed ) , Silver Age Sentinels ( GoO )
Conclusions
Among these nine movements , we can generalize further .
From the original exploration wargame approach , the early 80's saw a divergence into more serious world - based rules - heavy and more comical rules - lite .
These essentially merged in the 90's after " Vampire : The Masquerade " , with rules - heavy mechanics succeeding though combined with a serious dramatic approach .
The pendulum seems to be swinging back in 2000 with the success of D&D3 , however .
While the problem of " railroaded " adventures is old news to many role - players , it seems clear that the industry is still struggling with finding a solution to it .
How do you provide effective support for running adventures without laying out a plot to follow ?
During the 90's , the approach of providing maps and background had all but disappeared in favor of chapter - by - chapter or scene - by - scene plots .
With the revival success of D&D , though , this may be reconsidered .

A few weeks ago David Miani asked how to write concise queries over a data type .
The answer is certainly generic programming , a technique that I feel is underused in the Haskell community .
I suggested David look at Uniplate , but he found greater success with SYB .
Sean Leather gave a solution using EMGM .
One of the advantages of Uniplate is conciseness , so I decided to tackle the same problem and compare .
A full description of the task , including data type definitions , is at Sean 's blog .
From a data type representing structured files ( tables , headings , paragraphs ) find a heading with a particular name then within that heading find a paragraph starting with " Description " .
The rest of this post contains solutions using Uniplate , EMGM ( taken from Sean ) and SYB ( from David ) .
The SYB solution is slightly different from the EMGM or Uniplate solutions , but they all do roughly the same generic operations .
It is entirely possible that the EMGM / SYB solutions could be improved , but that is a job for other people .
The Uniplate solution is : The code can be read as : I find this code to be a clear , concise and simple description of the problem .
The thought process to come up with the solution was as follows :
You want to search , or perform a query .
The first question is whether this is a deep ( all nodes ) or shallow ( just the children ) query - David does n't say but the example seems to imply deep .
If it 's deep use .
Operations are combined with a list comprehension that finds an element , check it has the necessary properties ( the name ) , then performs more operations .
The result is the code you see above .
Sean 's solution can be found at his blog
This solution is n't bad , but is more verbose than the Uniplate solution .
Perhaps it could be rewritten with list comprehensions ?
It seems thatis similar to - although I am not sure .
David 's SYB solution can be found here along with another solution using different combinators .
The relative merits of each solution are highly subjective , but I believe the Uniplate solution is concise .
The Uniplate solution is a simple translation of the problem , without any clever steps , so hopefully other users ( who did n't write the library ! ) will be able to achieve similar results .
The Uniplate solution required only one function from the Uniplate library , so has a small learning curve .
Even if you do n't choose Uniplate , generic programming techniques are very useful , and can make your code concise and robust .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- U.S. store sales showed a smaller - than - expected decline in February after an unexpected surge in January that was bigger than originally reported , according to a government report Thursday .
The Commerce Department said total retail sales fell 0.1 % last month , compared with January 's revised increase of 1.8 % .
January 's increase was originally reported at 1 % .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had been expecting a decrease of 0.5 % for February .
This second month of better - than - expected sales results prompted one retail expert to say he was " hopeful " that the six - month stretch of monthly sales declines was " moderating " and could reverse before the end of the year .
" We have changed our thinking based on these numbers , " said Scott Hoyt , senior director of consumer economics with Moody 's Economy.com .
Hoyt said the surprisingly strong sales numbers both in January and in February 's core sales , which exclude auto purchases , was due to lower - income consumers having more money in their pockets as a result of government actions .
" There was a significant increase in payments to Social Security , and welfare and food stamp payments in January , " said Hoyt , adding that this factor combined with a reduction in tax payments was boosting household budgets .
" There will be another bump to household cash from the government over the course of spring and into summer .
That could spur spending again , " he said .
But another analyst was less optimistic .
" It [ retail sales increase ] is highly unlikely to last given the latest downdraft in consumers ' confidence and the continued pressure on incomes as payrolls collapse , " Ian Shepherson , chief U.S. Economist with High Frequency Economics , wrote in a report Thursday .
" It looks to us like little more than a temporary , though welcome , rebound , " he said .
The overall monthly sales number was dragged down by a 4.9 % drop in auto sales and a 4.3 % decline in sales of auto parts .
Sales excluding autos and auto parts increased 0.7 % , compared to a revised 1.6 % rise in January .
The measure had originally shown a 0.9 % increase for January .
Economists had forecast a decrease of 0.1 % for February sales , excluding auto purchases , according to Briefing.com .
The government report showed sales rose across retail categories , including a 2.8 % gain clothing purchases , a 0.7 % increases in furniture sales and a 1.1 % increase in purchases at department stores .
Gasoline station sales jumped 3.4 % , boosted by rising gas prices at the pump .
Editors ' Note : Jere Keys is a long - time community activist , most recently working with Out & Equal Workplace Advocates , but is now an aspiring lawyer living in Cincinnati and blogging at Blind Prophecy .
Barry Floore is a nursing student and community rabble - rouser who has been running QueerCincinnati.com , Cincinnati's most prolific LGBT - focused blog , since August 2007 .
This much is known : during the early morning hours of March 6 , in the neighborhood surrounding the University of Cincinnati campus , two young men were beaten , apparently for no other reason but that one of the victims was gay .
In the wake of the attack , UC students and residents of Cincinnati have taken to the streets in protest over the attack and the ineffectiveness of state and local hate crime legislation .
In many cities , a story like this would have been all over the evening news , but Cincinnati is not especially known for its welcoming attitude toward LGBT people .
While the violent attack was unjust in and of itself , the really disturbing part of this particular incident was how the local community only learned of this attack slowly , due in a very large part to what many of us see as a lack of concern by the police and mainstream media over " just another assault . "
In an email sent to university students on March 18 , UC Police Department Captain Karen Patterson described the attack .
" The victims were walking home when one of the victims stopped to talk to the suspects , who were friends from high school .
Upon hearing that the other victim was a homosexual , the suspects became aggressive and attacked both individuals . "
Sadly , our information about the attack and the condition of the victims is limited because both the UC Police Department and the local mainstream media have seemed reluctant to inform the public about this crime .
Before the police released any information about the attack to the student community at the University of Cincinnati , and before any local news station gave a report on the alleged crimes , the crime first came to the attention of local activists when it was included as a minor point in a fundraising email from the Human Rights Campaign .
Confused about how such a detail might make its way into a fundraising letter but not onto the nightly news , Barry Floore of QueerCincinnati.com began gathering information with the assistance of other local bloggers and students at the University of Cincinnati .
Jamie Royce of the blog Stuff Queer People Need to Know and Donald Caster of Cincinnati Blog have searched court records to identify the alleged perpetrators of the attack as 19 - year - old Ethan Kirkwood and 20 - year - old Matthew Kafagolis .
Kirkwood 's identification has been confirmed by a local news desk summarizing Kirkwood 's arraignment as " Kirkwood attacked a man for being homosexual .
Kirkwood then punched and kicked a friend of the victim who was trying to defend him . "
Both Kirkwood and Kafagolis have been charged with felonious assault , although other news sources suggest that police are still in search of the suspects and the email report from Captain Patterson references three , not two , suspects .
If there is a third attacker , he has not been identified to the community nor is there word on what charges , if any , he may be facing .
Kirkwood faces a grand jury on March 20 and Kafagolis on March 23 .
The victims of this attack have asked that their names not be published , but reportedly are doing well following the assault .
It 's only since the case caught the attention of local queer bloggers that information has begun to become forthcoming .
Both the UCPD and the local mainstream media have seemed reluctant to inform the public about this crime until they were virtually forced to action .
Floore contacted local news stations asking why there was no coverage .
He writes :
A snoop inside of one of the news offices gave us this heads up on why it has not been covered : neither have been charged with a hate crime , and , therefore , reporting it as such would be illegal .
...
Hence , it 's " just another assault . "
Although Cincinnati has passed hate crime legislation inclusive of sexual orientation ( but not gender identity ) , it appears to only be applicable in misdemeanor offenses , meanwhile Ohio state law does n't include any hate crime legislation that recognizes sexual orientation or gender identity as suspect classes .
Needless to say , confusion reigns .
Why does n't the local hate crime enhancement apply in what seems an obvious case of bias - motivated crime ?
What good does a city - wide ordinance do if the bulk of the criminal code is set at the state level ?
Why has n't Ohio joined with the majority of other states ( 32 ) who recognize sexual orientation in the hate crime provisions or the growing number ( 11 ) who recognize gender identity ?
Regardless , the dismissal of the case as " just another assault " when all the available information clearly indicates that sexual orientation was the primary motivating cause of this attack is insulting and indicative of the local media 's disinterest in covering queer issues .
As all of us know , the media has never been shy to report a story ( if it suits their audience ) by saying , " news tonight of an attack that some are saying should be considered a hate crime because the victim was attacked for being gay . "
No legal conundrum there , plus a chance to scoop up some ratings by bringing on the controversy around whether or not Ohio should pass a hate crimes bill .
Only after bloggers like Floore and Royce began their investigations , and several UC students complained to the administration , the UC Police Department finally sent out an email to students about the attack .
Asks Royce :
And let 's see , the assaults happened on March 6 , and 12 days later they are just now getting around to telling us ?
And this was only after an outcry from several students to the administration that something actually got sent out ( because they send out notices via e-mail about all major crime on UC property and around UC to students ) .
Royce also wonders why the charges against the men do n't include an additional misdemeanor of criminal intimidation , which would be included under the local city - wide hate crime code .
In response to the apparent lack of concern , several UC students who recently launched the Cincinnati Guerilla Queer Bar project called for a protest at the location of the alleged crime .
Some ____( watch Barry 's twitter feed for the # ) people , including students and neighborhood community members , turned out to raise their voices against the silence and the apparent ineffectiveness of our hate crime laws .
It may have taken police and local media 12 days to acknowledge the attack , by utilizing the online tools of the past year 's revitalized grassroots activism , such as Facebook , Twitter , blogs and email , organizers were able to organize a protest in less than 48 hours .
The persistence of local queer bloggers and the local community have finally shamed the mainstream media into acknowledging the crime and tonight 's protest will only help to draw attention to the lack of statewide hate crime laws .
If there is ever a lesson to be learned from physical attacks we receive simply because of our sexual orientation or gender identity , in this case , the lesson is that we cannot rely on police and media to draw attention to the violence we endure .
Throughout many parts of the country , we are still on our own to raise our voices and make our fight heard .

" Did you see that fag ? " local writer / blogger and photographer , Montgomery Maxton and I heard as we walked away from the protest .
" Dude , they 're gay . "
Monty and I walked up to the protest on the corner of Clifton and Calhoun around 5:10 pm as yet unsure of the outcome .
Both of us admitted that , though potentially powerful , the ability of social media sources like Facebook and local bloggers was sometimes unpredictable .
The e-mail had circulated a dozen times in the last 24 hours , us local bloggers were getting hits from Google searches of the incident right and left , four Facebook mass mailings had gone out , and there had more than a few text bombs from friends and acquaintances .
That said , this was an event planned in less than 24 hours with almost no logistical no -how or consultation with local organizations , the city , or the police .
And it was being driven by social media .
" This could go either way , " was our two - man consensus .
We needed a pitstop for coffee on the way , and we dropped in a coffee shop .
We were among family from the moment we entered the door .
People were talking about the protest , asking the local barista if he was going -- " I get off at 6:15 , " he said , " I hope it 's still going on .
I 'll text you . "
I jumped into the conversation .
Around the corner , the crowd was growing alongside a smaller anti-war protest .
The media was there .
We counted three , possibly four , television news stations , and I was approached by two local newspapers for interviews .
Some people , mistakenly , believed it was my baby and I had organized it simply because I had promoted it .
By the time the rally started walking , which is technically illegal without a parade permit but the local police said and did nothing except move alongside the crowd , there were well over 200 people there .
The average age ?
Probably around 21 , yet there were notable locals involved .
Representatives from PFLAG , the Gay and Lesbian Community Center , and a few local rights group popped in , some with signs , to show their support .
When we made it to the corner of Clifton Avenue and Martin Luther King , Jr. , we took up an entire street corner .
Montgomery and I , noting that this would go on much longer than 6:30 pm decided we would make our graceful exit .
It could have gone either way .
It could have been violent , but it turned out peaceful .
It could have been a real downer , but it turned out to be thrilling .
It could have been dead , but it turned out to be busy .
There could have been counterprotesters , hate mongers , pie throwers , aggressive attackers ... there could have been anything .
But there was n't .
There was only a crowd of 250 or so gay people , mostly students , asking that people recognize a hate crime occurred , and that it was important that we remember that violence against LGBT folk still exists .
Cars honked , people joined , and couples pulled over to ask insightful , intelligent questions and show their support .
In an age where we are inundated with media and social connections , I am proud of my little community did more than post angry comments on my blog and curse the name of the attackers .
And the commentary of the young guys who called us all fags as we walked away -- Montgomery and I pulled aside to let them pass -- tells us one thing : there 's a lot more work to be done .
There 's room , I think , for the hard work as well as the rallies and the Facebooking .
It all matters ; it is all equal .
Congratulations , Cincinnati , you always have the capability to amaze me .
Thank you for honking , and thank you for cheering .

Japanese singer and dancer Reni Mimura makes her second local debut to a small concert that was mostly promoted by word - of - mouth .
She is dressed in a frilly maid costume , carries around a pink stuffed poodle , and wears a pair of bunny ears on her head .
Her set list is a combination of fan - requested anime theme songs , Reni ’s self - picked cover songs , and her own original songs .
Video screens around the venue show clips of the anime movie Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind – a personal favorite of the singer – and the whole front section of the audience is filled with camcorders and digital cameras as the fans actively try to capture the concert on film .
While this setup might seem a little unusual for a small pop concert , it ’s all because she ’s singing in the Akihabara - style , which is famous for its connection to anime , anime fans , and a type of geek appeal described by the fans as moé .
And because of their pretty faces , cute costumes , and non-threatening personalities , the moé Akihabara j- idols are to these nerdish otaku men what the Jonas Brothers are for American tween girls .
That is why when Reni goes onto the stage , the small otaku audience gets onto their feet , applaud loudly , and then enthusiastically clap along as Reni sings her first anime theme song of the evening .
But this is n’t Akihabara – it is n’t Japan – and most of the audience are n’t even Japanese .
We ’re in a small karaoke bar in the east side of New York City , which is being rented out the first Sunday of each month to serve as Reni ’s personal venue .
But for the American otaku in the audience , this is probably the closest they ’ll ever get to seeing a cute j - idol perform like this .
Fortunately for them , this idol is now local , and she ’s planning on sticking around in New York for quite some time .
So who exactly is Reni ?
Where did she come from and how did she end up in New York City ?
I sat down for an interview with this singer in Bryant Park one Sunday while the nearby Kinokuniya bookstore held an “ Anime Day ” full of activities .
But as an interviewer , it was very hard to get all the details .
Like a proper J-idol , her personal life becomes overshadowed by a perky on - stage personality .
So I tried my best to peel through the mystery to figure out the story behind this singer .
One thing is for certain , and that is that Reni is a genuine Japanese idol .
Coming from the Yamaguchi Prefecture , she began taking dance lessons at the age of 7 .
“ If I ask my parents why I ever got into dancing at such a young age , they would tell me that it was because I would n’t stop begging them to let me dance .
So they enrolled me in a class just to shut me up , ” she jokes .
But as she got older , she realized that she would need to do more for her career .
“ At that particular point in my life , it would be almost impossible to sell tickets and make a living if all I did was dance , so I had to take on new areas of entertainment . ”
She joined the Seinenza Theater Company in Tokyo where she studied the method and art of acting .
During one stage production , a crew member suggested that the actors create their own music for the show , and they ended up forming a band out of this .
“ That ’s when I started singing , ” she goes on , “ We recorded a demo tape onto a MiniDisc and sent it out to producers and band contests . ”
In 2005 , one contest selected Reni ’s band out of 1,000 submissions to come in for a “ Battle of the Bands ” live performance .
“ I noticed that backstage and in the bathroom , I was the only one of the other seven singers still practicing up until the last minute , ” she recalls .
“ I think that is what gave us the advantage . ”
Her band won the contest , and Reni got her first record deal because of it .
“ Dance , J - pop , rock … we went with many types of music .
We produced 10 different songs with the professional producer after winning the contest . ”
She released her first single , a gritty rock song called “ Bitch ” , in summer of 2006 , and then began touring around Tokyo before finally settling into the otaku epicenter known as Akihabara .
The variety of Reni ’s musical talents are evident in her karaoke bar concert as she picked different types of songs and switched up her vocal ranges for each one .
After the cute and childish opening song , Reni goes in a much different direction by singing the theme song to “ Cutie Honey ” as perform by Kumi Koda .
Reni ’s sweet - as - sugar voice turns low and seductive , and her dancing imitates Koda ’s sexy choreography .
She also improvises a little when she strokes the curtains on the back of the stage with her fingertips .
Not particularly the most moé - like behavior for a j - idol to show , but the predominantly male audience did n’t seem to hold it against her .
But if her career has shown that she has the talent to do all types of music , what made her shed the sexy image and settle on the moé Akihabara style that she ’s performing with now ?
I think that the timing was just right for her to go moé .
There was a bit of an Akihabara renaissance at the time because of the Densha Otoko phenomenon and the “ Otaku Boom ” that came of it .
“ At the time , we had open streets in Akiba , and that ’s when the moé girls really started to shine . ”
It was a great opportunity for her to launch a career .
But Reni has a more philosophical take on it .
“ There ’s a very nurturing healing power that comes with the Akihabara culture .
I want to nurture the anime fans , and in return , I want to be nurtured by them .
There ’s a feeling of safety in it .
I also feel that it ’s a way for a woman to be a woman – all cutesy and dolled up – because that ’s something that men cannot do . ”
I think Reni really demonstrated this nurturing power around the midpoint of her karaoke bar concert .
She played a game of Janken ( “ Rock - paper - scissors ” ) with the audience , which was a part of her act in Akihabara .
The two winners of the game got to join her on stage , where she called them her “ Heroes ” and asked them to join her in singing the theme song to “ My Neighbor Totoro . ”
“ Totoro , Totoro , ” sings the one shy otaku to her left when Reni points the microphone towards him .
“ Totoro , Totoro , ” follows up the other shy otaku to her right .
Arm -in - arm with Reni , the two dudes looked completely petrified and ready to faint from all the attention .
And yet the idol was able to subdue their nerves enough to get them to sing the silly children ’s song .
She even had one of them hold her pink poodle and blow bubbles for her .
While the actual details are unknown , Reni moved to New York City about eight months ago .
“ While the world is going through some tough times , ” she explains , “ I wanted to bring the nurturing healing powers of the Akihabara moé culture to America . ”
She intends to completely relaunch her career as a j - idol in New York , and to the best of her knowledge , she would be the first moé idol to be doing so outside of Japan .
She did her first karaoke bar concert just two months ago .
So how exactly are the American otaku compared to the Japanese fans ?
“ Americans are much more … open about cosplaying and anime , ” she politely answers and gestures to the activity on the other end of Bryant Park .
“ You ’d never see something like that in Japan , we ’re much more held back . ”
The cosplayers who were at the Kinokuniya event had left the store and were gathering at the park .
They danced , yelled , goofed around … all the typical hyperactive behavior you ’d see at an anime con .
Yet Reni seemed fascinated to see these cosplaying fans doing this in a popular New York City park on a Sunday afternoon , and she ’d watch them while I talked to her translator .
Reni and her management team are trying their best to get a grasp on the American fan community .
Reni writes her own blog in Japanese , which her team then translate into English and post into an English - specific Blogspot account .
She writes about anything , such as preparing for her next show , describing odd things she sees around the city , picking out her next costume , or declaring her love of Chinatown bread and ice cream on a warm day .
She refers to her fans as “ friends ” and talks about “ making friends ” whenever she goes out to promote her next show .
She even has a MySpace account where she streams a music video filmed in New York last month .
She can sing with a wide vocal range .
She can dance different styles .
She knows how to work a crowd .
But on top of all of that , and probably what ’s most important for a j - idol , Reni is also very easy on the eyes .
For our interview , I suggested she come in costume to promote her show at the Kinokuniya event .
Reni clearly stood out among the densely pack crowd of fans and cosplayers in the store , and she turned many heads as people walked by .
During our interview , a crowd of onlookers waited on the side to talk and take photos of her as soon as I was done with my questions .
And many of my male friends , from a teenager to a much older “ professional ” man , turned towards me to get more info on her , particularly if she had a boyfriend or not … (>_ >)
They all became clearly interested in Reni , and they have n’t even heard her sing a single note yet .
Her appearance at Kinokuniya alone landed her a gig performing at the Japan Society ’s KRAZY Cosplay Party this Saturday and the expressed interests from local convention runners for appearances during this summer ’s convention season .
I can already tell that this moé appeal is going to make Reni a star among the local otaku community , maybe even beyond New York .
We need a J-idol .
It ’s a niche that clearly exists , and Reni fills that niche perfectly .
She just needs to be discovered by those potential fans who have yet to discover her .
But once she gets them , they will stick around , as I ’m sure that the fans who attended that karaoke bar concert with me in March will return for the next concert in April .
When Reni leaves the stage after her final song of her concert , the audience does n’t even budge . ” Moé ! Moé ! Moé ! ”
An entire crowd of Americans in a bar in New York City , loudly chanting this Japanese word in unison like otaku in Akihabara .
“ Moé ! Moé ! Moé ! ”
But Reni does n’t make us wait for long as she quickly comes out for her encore .
“ This song does n’t really have any meaning for me , ” she tells everyone in English .
“ I ’m just going to sing it because I think it ’s cute ! ”

Computing Thoughts
Programming as Typing
by Bruce Eckel
July 6 , 2006
Summary
How can we see the problems that we face when building software through new eyes ?
Advertisement
( This started as a reply to John Camara in the previous blog entry , then took on a life of its own . )
I believe by now it is safe to assume that the majority of software developers and managers of software projects have come to accept the importance of testing so I feel it 's unnecessary to comment on testing .
I 've learned not to trust the fact that there 's a lot of noise about something .
It usually does n't correlate to reality .
A friend works for a company that 's just now learning about unit testing , and apparently testing in general .
I 've consulted with companies where testing is still a new thing .
My guess is that the majority of software developers have not yet accepted the importance of testing , and that it 's only the noisemakers on the leading edge who have been learning and talking about it , and thus giving the impression that it 's now well accepted .
Another example of noise vs. reality : people are always saying that there are still more COBOL and FORTRAN programmers out there than any other kind .
But when was the last time you saw one , much less talked to one ?
By that metric , they do n't exist .
But apparently there are tons of them .
Now as important as it may be to have a second pair of eyes on a problem I feel it's not the most important benefit of code reviews .
I feel that code reviews provide a means of mentoring each other .
Yes , it 's one thing to show my examples and talk about how you would , in theory , use a particular language feature properly .
But when you work with code that someone actually have a vested interest in , then it becomes real and important .
( I create toy examples in books out of necessity only ) .
I think that the more abstract the concept , the more important it is to work with a project that people are actually trying to build , to take it out of the realm of ideas .
For example , when teaching OO design ( which is more abstract than programming ) , I encourage people to bring their own designs , so we can work on them together .
This not only brings the importance up , but it also makes better use of the training or consulting time , because people can actually gain forward motion on their projects .
This form of mentoring is likely to be the only form of mentoring that the majority of developers experience these days .
After all , mentoring has lost most , if not all , priority in these sad times of ever decreasing costs at all costs .
We have simply forgotten how important it is to pass collective experiences from generation to generation .
This may come from ( perceived ) efficiency considerations .
Mentoring on a regular basis may appear to be just a cost for a project -- interference with getting things done .
Whereas carving out a week for training between projects is a discrete chunk of time , you do it and you 're done and then people can get back to slinging code as fast as they can .
Or any number of other scenarios .
I think the problem is that while many programmers understand that programming happens in the mind , and the code itself is just an artifact of the process , outside the field , the code looks like it's what you 're doing .
( An understandable perception , since the code is the core deliverable ) .
So if it 's about the code and not the mental process behind the code , it makes sense that you would do whatever you can to produce the code as fast and as cheaply as possible , and to discard anything that appears to hinder the creation of code .
From this follows the logical ideas that coding is typing , so you want to see people typing all the time , and that 10 people can type faster than one person so if you can hire ten Indians cheaper than one US programmer , you 're going to get a lot more typing done , so you 'll get big economic leverage .
In reality , study after study indicates that success comes from who you hire .
This suggests that programming is not a mass - production activity where programmers are replaceable components .
I think a good analogy is writing a novel .
Suppose you want to create a Stephen King novel ( I 'm not much of a fan , but this is exactly the kind of book that publishers stay up nights trying to figure out how to mass produce ) .
You could say , " A book is made up of words , and words are created by typing , so to create a book we need to get a bunch of people typing .
The more people we can get typing , the faster we 'll create a book .
And the cheaper the typist , the cheaper it will be to create books . "
It 's hard to argue with that logic .
After all , a book is made up of words .
And words are created by typing , etc .
But anyone who reads novels knows that there must be a fundamental flaw in the logic , because there are authors whom you like and others whom you can't stand .
The choice of words and the structure of the book is what makes the difference , and that is based on the person writing the book .
We know you can't replace one author with 10 lesser writers and get anything like what the author could produce , or anything you 'd want to read .
Another example is a house .
Like software , it 's comprised of subsystems that fit together .
Like software , you have a bunch of people working on it , and it 's even true that some of those people are replaceable .
It does n't really matter who is nailing up the wallboard .
But you really notice the design of the house , and you notice how well it was put together , and those things are determined by the architect and the builder .
I 've been struggling with this general problem for a long time .
That is , the " logical " arguments that are very hard to refute , like " software is created by typing . "
True on the surface , but not really the essence of the issue .
But if you keep the argument on those terms , you can't really get anywhere , because the logic is irrefutable .
Even if that logic completely misses the real issue .
This is probably why I keep fighting with the static - dynamic language debate , because it has the same feel to me .
You can come up with all kinds of reasons that static checking is a good thing , until you have an experience programming in a dynamic language where you are vastly more productive than with a static language .
But that experience defies the logic used to back up the reasoning behind static languages .
Here 's another one .
I believe that " details matter , " and that noise really does wear you down ( studies show that noise makes you tired ) .
What I 'm talking about here is visual and complexity noise .
So I was disappointed when , for example , Ruby turned out to have begin and end statements , and that it uses " new " to create objects .
These are all noise artifacts from previous languages , required to support their compilers .
If your language creates all objects on the heap , you do n't need to say " new " to distinguish between heap and stack objects ( like you do in C++ , which was mindlessly mimicked by Java ) .
And everyone always indents their code , so you can use indentation to establish scope .
Besides the fact that I 'm justifying the design minimalism of Python here , when I put these ideas out I will probably get a lot of perfectly reasonable rationalizations about why this is the best way of doing things .
And without questioning the fundamental principles upon which those arguments are founded , those arguments will be pretty airtight , even if they really come down to " I 'm used to that and I do n't want to think differently about it . "
Java has always required a lot of extra typing .
But the fact that Eclipse and other IDEs generate code for you seems to justify enormous amounts of visual noise , and for those in the midst of it , that 's OK , and even desirable .
" It 's clearer because it 's more explicit " ( Python even has a maxim " Explicit is better than implicit " ) .
This is even taken to extremes with the idea , supported by a surprising number of folks , that every class should have an associated interface , which to my mind makes the code far more complicated and confusing .
Which IMO costs money , because everyone who works with that code must wade through all those extra layers of complication .
All of this detail costs time and money , even if you have a tool generating a lot of code for you .
But if you 're in the middle of it , it 's all you can see and it makes sense because it seems to work .
And of course , if you compare one Java project to another , you are n't questioning the cost of using the language .
In contrast , when I teach OO design , my favorite approach is to ( A ) work on a project that the client is actually working on and ( B ) move quickly through the design process and model the result in a dynamic language ( Python is what I know best ) .
In most cases , the client does n't know Python , but that does n't matter .
We still very quickly get a model of the system up and running , and in the process we discover problems that our initial design pass did n't see .
So because of the speed and agility of a dynamic language , design issues appear early and quickly and we can refine the design before recasting it in a heavyweight language .
And I would argue that if the initial code is done in the heavyweight language instead , then ( A ) There is resistance to putting the design into code because it is much more work intensive ; it is n't a lightweight activity , and ( B ) There is resistance to making changes to the design for the same reason .
And yet , I will probably get any number of perfectly reasonable arguments to the effect that this approach does n't make sense .
I usually find that these arguments are not based on experience , but on logic that follows from fundamental assumptions about the world of programming .
It may not even be possible to prove things logically when it comes to programming .
So many of the conclusions that we draw this way appear to be wrong .
This is what I like about the book " Peopleware , " and also " Software Conflict 2.0 " that I 'm now reading .
These books point out places where we operate based on what seems perfectly logical , and yet is wrong ( one of my favorite studies in " Peopleware " shows that , of all forms of estimation , the most productive approach is when no estimate at all is made ) .
The story that I heard about the Greek Natural Philosophers ( what we call physicists today ) is that they were more interested in the arguments about how something worked than they were about how that thing actually worked .
So they did n't drop small and large stones in order to find out if one fell faster than they other , they argued based on their assumptions .
It seems to me that we 're in the same situation when we try to argue about programming .
A large part of the Enlightenment came from the move to the scientific method , which seems like a small , simple step but turned out to be very big , and to have a very big impact .
To wit , you can argue about how you think something will happen , but then you have to go out and actually do the experiment .
If the experiment disagrees with your argument , then you have to change your argument and try another experiment .
The key is in doing the experiment , and in paying attention to the results , rather than starting with belief and trying to wrestle the world into line with that belief .
Even after some 500 years , human society is still trying to come to terms with the age of reason .
I think the essence of what the agilists are doing is a perfect analogy to the discovery of the scientific method .
Instead of making stuff up -- and if you look back at all the " solutions " we 've invented to solve software complexity problems , that 's primarily what they are -- you do an experiment and see what happens .
And if the experiment denies the arguments you 've used in the past , you can't discard the results of the experiment .
You have to change something about your argument .
Of course , you are n't forced to change your argument .
But even if it does n't happen overnight , those that look at the experiments and realize that something is different than the way they thought it was , those people will move past you and forge into new territory .
Territory that your company may not be able to enter if they refuse to change their ideas .

How to Add Simple Permissions into Your Simple App. Also , Thoughtbot Rules !
Last week , in a few hours , I whipped together flightcontrolled.com for Flight Control , a super fun iPhone game .
The site allows users to upload screenshots of their high scores .
I thought I would provide a few details here as some may find it interesting .
It is a pretty straightforward and simple site , but it did need a few permissions .
I wanted users to be able to update their own profile , scores and photos , but not anyone else ’s .
On top of that , I , as an admin , should be able to update anything on the site .
I ’m sure there is a better way , but this is what I did and it is working just fine .
Add admin to users
I added an admin boolean to the users table .
You may or may not know this , but Active Record adds handy boolean methods for all your columns .
For example , if the user model has an email column and an admin column , you can do the following .
user = User.new user.email ?
# => false user.email = 'foobar@foobar.com ' user.email ?
# => true user.admin ? # => false user.admin = true user.admin ? # => true
Simple permissions module
Next up , I created a module called permissions , that looks something like this :
module Permissions def changeable_by ?( other_user ) return false if other_user.nil ?
user == other_user || other_user.admin?
end end
I put this in app / concerns / and added that directory to the load path , but it will work just fine in lib / .
Mixin the permission module
Then in the user , score and photo models , I just include that permission module .
class Score < ActiveRecord :: Base include Permissions end class Photo < ActiveRecord :: Base include Permissions end class User < ActiveRecord :: Base include Permissions end
Add checks in controllers / views
Now , in the view I can check if a user has permission before showing the edit and delete links .
<%- if score.changeable_by?( current_user ) -%> < li class=" actions " > <%= link_to ' Edit ' , edit_score_url ( score ) %> <%= link_to ' Delete ' , score , : method => : delete %> </li > <%- end -%>
And in the controller , I can do the same .
class ScoresController < ApplicationController before_filter :authorize , :only => [ : edit , :update , : destroy ] private def authorize unless @score.changeable_by ?( current_user ) render : text => ' Unauthorized ' , : status => : unauthorized end end end
Macro for model tests
I did n’t forget about testing either .
I created a quick macro for shoulda like this ( also uses factory girl and matchy ) :
class ActiveSupport :: TestCase def self.should_have_permissions( factory ) should " know who has permission to change it " do object = Factory ( factory ) admin = Factory ( : admin ) other_user = Factory ( : user ) object.changeable_by ?( other_user ) . should be ( false ) object.changeable_by?( object.user ) .should be( true ) object.changeable_by ?( admin ) .should be(true ) object.changeable_by ?( nil ) . should be( false ) end end end
Which I can then call from my various model tests :
class ScoreTest < ActiveSupport :: TestCase should _have_permissions : score end
Looking at it now , I probably could just infer the score factory as I ’m in the ScoreTest , but for whatever reason , I did n’t go that far .
A sprinkle of controller tests
I also did something like the following to test the controllers :
class ScoresControllerTest < ActionController :: TestCase context " A regular user " do setup do @user = Factory ( : email_confirmed_user ) sign_in_as @user end context " on GET to : edit " do context " for own score " do setup do @score = Factory ( : score , : user => @user ) get :edit , :id => @score.id end should_respond_with : success end context " for another user 's score " do setup do @score = Factory ( : score ) get :edit , :id => @score.id end should_respond_with : unauthorized end end end context " An admin user " do setup do @admin = Factory ( : admin ) sign_in_as @admin end context " on GET to : edit " do context " for own score " do setup do @score = Factory ( : score , : user => @admin ) get :edit , :id => @score.id end should_respond_with : success end context " for another user 's score " do setup do @score = Factory ( : score ) get :edit , :id => @score.id end should _respond_with : success end end end end
Summary of Tools
I should call flightcontrolled , the thoughtbot project as I used several of their awesome tools .
I used clearance for authentication , shoulda and factory girl for testing , and paperclip for file uploads .
This was the first project that I used factory girl on and I really like it .
Again , I did n’t get the fuss until I used it , and then I was like “ Oooooh !
Sweet ! ” .
One of the cool things about paperclip is you can pass straight up convert options to imagemagick .
Flight Control is a game that is played horizontally , so I knew all screenshots would need to be rotated 270 degress .
I just added the following convert options ( along with strip ) to the paperclip call :
has_attached_file :image , : styles => { : thumb => ' 100 > ' , : full => ' 480 > '} , :default_style => :full , :convert_options => {:all => '- rotate 270 - strip'}
Conclusion
You do n’t need some fancy plugin or a lot of code to add some basic permissions into your application .
A simple module can go a long way .
Also , start using Thoughtbot ’s projects .
I ’m really impressed with the developer tools they have created thus far .

Implement jQuery ’s hover ( ) Method in MooTools
j Query offers a quick event shortcut method called hover that accepts two functions that represent mouseover and mouseout actions .
Here 's how to implement that for MooTools Elements .
The MooTools JavaScript
/* hover ! */ Element.implement ( { ' hover ' : function ( fn1 , fn2 ) { return this .
addEvents ({ ' mouseenter ' : function (e ) { fn1.attempt(e , this ) ; } , ' mouseleave ' : function ( e ) { fn2.attempt(e , this ) ; } } ) } } ) ;
We implement hover ( ) which accepts to functions ; one will be called on mouseenter and the other on the mouseleave event .
Each function is passed the corresponding event .
The Usage
/* fade in and out on hover event */ $ ( ' hover - me ' ) .hover ( function ( e ) { this .
fade ( ' out ' ) ; } , function ( e ) { this .
fade ( 'in ' ) ; } ) ;
This simple example usage makes use of element fading .

Extreme Politics covers the rise of new “ free nationalism ” in Europe and what it means :
Nationalists donâ€™t want to just change laws â€ ” they want an entirely different type of civilization .
We havenâ€™t heard much from them since 1945 , since nationalist groups have been the province of mostly violent losers with a few disaffected intellectuals , but now nationalism seems to be coming back .
Because it was marginalized , and because people who take on the world with losing â€œbut correctâ€ causes are idolized by those who did not adapt to the current social order , nationalist movements have been cross-associated with hate groups , with few nationalist movements escaping the epithets , violence , anti-Semitism and similar brouhaha within their ranks .
However , that is changing , as nationalist movements make alliances with Zionists and vice - versa and nationalist movements grow across Europe as they drop violent orthodoxy for a coherent vision of an organic society that is both cultured , green â€ ” and monocultural .
Nationalism : ethnic identity is important
Commentary from Penetrate blog pretty much says what you need to know about this movement in opposition to Globalism and Ecocide , even if it ’s not politically acceptable quite yet :
Nationalism is no longer a political calling , but a flavor .
Other parties are going to start incorporating it soon .
It ’s also losing its marginalized status as people realize it ’s necessary for Israel and probably Europe to survive as distinct ethnic - cultural groups .
I think it ’s interesting , this globalism trap we ’re in .
Globalism exists to bring liberty and equality and fraternity to us all .
In order to do that , it must smash borders , culture , local laws , etc. so that we have a utilitarian world society .
This empowers both freedom and consumerism , but it also requires that the individual have more power than the state but be able to use the surrounding society to escape direct confrontation with means of production .
It ’s an unstable balance .
Nationalism is one solution .
The Deep Ecologists hint at a localized kind of nationalism , as in “ I am from the Black Forest area ” not “ I am from Germany , ” where per blood and soil people would identify with their local community and see themselves as stewards of the land .
I like this idea , as I like the deep ecology idea of restructuring society so we have higher values than commerce , individualism , self - pleasure and entertainment .

So every five or ten years , you should move it onto a different format , like from VHS tape to DVD .
And that 's fine , but then DVD is already obsolete , there 's Blu-ray , and so what 's going to happen in another 10 years ?
Making lots of backups is good advice , and on different formats , different places ; consider paper as an archival medium .
Some paper we have has lasted thousands of years .
If Moses had gotten the Ten Commandments on a floppy disk , it would never have made it to today .
DP : What about Internet backup services ?
DS : Oh , the Internet -- is that still around ?
[ CHUCKLES ]
Keeping it on the Web is also not a really great strategy .
A very large photo site just went out of business , and they gave people , I think , a month 's notice to say , " We 've run out of money , get your photos off the site and put them somewhere . "
Web sites are fine for sharing , but in terms of preserving your data , I would n't recommend it .
DP : So let 's say people do n't do this 10 - year migration .
What 's the worst case ?
DS : The damage depends on the importance of the information in the first place .
Personally , I find family stuff to be the single most important stuff that I care about .
It is your memory .
And when you lose your memory , you lose your personality , you lose who you are .
And that 's why it 's very troublesome that we 're taking all these wonderful pictures and movies , but not thinking about how long they 're going to last .
DP : Well , who should be ?
I mean , should this be a government project ?
Should there be some company stockpiling machines in the salt mines ?
Whose job is this ?
DS : It 's really nobody 's job , sadly .
Technology is often just thrown over the wall , and the long - term consequences are not thought through .
The computer industry is one of planned obsolescence .
And if you do n't upgrade , you start to fall behind the envelope .
You know , your kids send you a video and you can't watch it , because you do n't have an upgraded operating system , or your computer is too slow .
There are all these pressures to get you to replace your computer every three to five years .
DP : Can you give me a couple examples of some of the offbeat technologies that people at one point embraced and thought was the latest and greatest ?
About three months ago , Loretta Alkalay , a retired Florida resident , wanted to get a new HDTV .
So she decided to give the CompUSA near her home a try .
Yes , CompUSA .
The once - bankrupt electronics retailer is making a comeback , with about 30 new CompUSA stores nationwide and a new strategy that includes aggressive prices , remodeled stores , improved lighting and in - store web access for comparison shopping .
" We have invented this idea of retail 2.0 , " says Gilbert Fiorentino , chief executive of the Technology Products Group at Systemax , now parent company of CompUSA .
Fiorentino is also the founder of TigerDirect , a web only electronics retailer and another subsidiary of
Systemax .
" Every screen in every CompUSA store is now connected to the internet and making buying a richer experience for customers , " he says .
It was price that brought Alkalay the store .
She wound up buying a 32 - inch flat panel TV for $ 200 – a real steal , she says .
" I had never heard of the brand .
But given the price and size , I thought this is a great bargain , " says Alkalay .
Once part of the big three electronics retail stores in the country , CompUSA filed for bankruptcy two years ago .
It was not alone : High overheads and the inability to compete with low online prices forced companies such as Circuit City and Ritz Camera into bankruptcy , too .
Meanwhile , online players such as Amazon , Buy.com and NewEgg have been growing .
But after a reorganization and a buyout in January last year by Systemax , a major electronics retailer , CompUSA is back in business .
The in - store web access may be the biggest gamble , since it raises the possibility that you might use a CompUSA floor model to find a better deal on Amazon.com for the very computer you 're using to get that information .
Say you are in a CompUSA store trying to decide if that big plasma TV is the one you want .
Just tap the keyboard in front of the screen and go online to check out the specs and reviews an even the recommended mounting brackets .
There 's also custom information for that particular store , such as how many are in stock .
" We do the same thing with laptops , desktops and monitors , " says Fiorentino .
" We are using tech to change the retail experience for the customer and giving them access to all the information on the internet anytime they want during the buying process . "
And there are no restrictions .
Users can surf the internet , check their Facebook or even Twitter if they want , says Fiorentino .
It may sound like a small change but it is quite different from how Best Buy , Office Depot or other brick - and - mortar stores display information to their customers , says Doug Fleener , president of retail consulting firm Dynamic Experiences and former director of retail for Bose .
“ It ’s an untested concept , ” says Fleener .
“ We will have to see if customers like to spend their time gathering information while shopping rather than doing it at home . ”
Systemax 's Tiger Direct online shopping site has benefited first hand from the online shopping trend .
But Fiorentino says customers still want to go stores to buy electronics .
And Fiorentino says CompUSA can keep its prices low despite the additional overhead costs associated with a physical store .
CompUSA 's inventory now ties into Tiger Direct and the company offers the same prices whether consumers buy a product online or in a store .
Customers such as Robert Oschler , a New York resident who runs a site for robotics enthusiasts , are seeing the difference .
About a month ago Oschler found a CompUSA store near him running offering 48 - hour special deals .
" They seem to be doing a lot of that , " he says .
Oschler bought a Novint Falcon gaming mouse for $ 99 that otherwise retails for $ 180 .
He says he's also noticed the changes in the store ’s layout , “ They seem more organized , ” says Oschler .
“ Earlier , their aisles used to cluttered , almost supermarket - like , where they wanted to shove as much stuff as possible in your face as you walked by .
But now there are more categories and better displays . ”
Still , the revived CompUSA is a shadow of its former self .
At its peak about three years ago , CompUSA posted about $ 5 billion a year in sales and had more than 216 stores nationwide .
Now it posts a fraction of that in sales and has just about a tenth of its former reach .
If CompUSA can survive through the recession and manage its costs —rent , salaries , inventory –the chain can hope for a future , says Fleener .
As other big box retailers disappear , consumers are looking for alternative places to go to and the thrill of walking into a store and looking at products is not easily replaceable for shoppers .
“ Stores like Circuit City going out does leave an opportunity in the market , ” says Fleener .
“ With less brick and mortar competition around , people will give CompUSA a chance . ”

7 Tips for Anime Girls Who Seriously Can’t Cook
Filed under : Food , Humor , Parody March 22 , 2009 , 10:26 pmFiled under : Anime
Are you an anime girl who ca n’t cook to save their life ?
Do you repeatedly explode the kitchen and give your friends first degree botulism ?
Do you experience the above incident happening to you on a daily basis ?
No problem !
With these simple 7 handy dandy tips , any culinary catastrophe creating female biped ( and some male ones even ! ) can advance from making food that is legally poisonous to food that is surprisingly mostly edible !
Not FDA approved , but edible nonetheless , and is n’t that the most important thing in life ?
Next to money I mean … because you know , money is awesome .
Rule 1 : For the Love of God , Stop Using Eggs !
For some mystical unexplainable reason that defies all human logic , 62 % of all anime girls who ca n’t cook usually decide to make their first dish out of gratuitous amounts of the natural anomaly we call eggs .
General rule of thumb for beginners — DON ’T screw with eggs !
There ’s a phenomenally high chance that the final result will look something like a “ Brain on Drugs ” commercial .
Yes , cakes and omelets can be very tasty , but only if other people can actually recognize them as something other than a big purple towering monstrosity with a seven foot tall tentacle sticking out of them .
If you positively must cook an egg dish , use liquid eggs , the type that come in cartons that do n’t even remotely resemble actual eggs , they ’re easy to use and do n’t involve eggshells so your cooking will decidedly involve less hot smoking shell shrapnel in mouth action .
Remember kids , not killing your guests is half of the battle !
Rule 2 : Screw Freshness , Make Sure
It ’s !@#$ing Dead !
Freshness !
Who does n’t love freshness ?
You know what else people like their food to be ?
DEAD .
Oh so very dead .
Epicly dead even .
If your food is moving and is still in one piece , chances are , it ’s not dead , and that would be a bad thing .
Furthermore , if your food has wriggling , girl molesting tentacles and a giant gaping maw that ’s trying to eat random people , it ’s definitely not dead .
The people you serve your overly fresh fiasco to will usually be quite polite and downplay the situation as well as humbly noting the entire possibility of their impending doom and ruination for marriage , but rest assured , what they really are trying to say is that they do not particularly wish to die on that given day or lose their virginity to a giant man eating squid .
If you do not buy your food from a grocery store which has a good reputation for murdering everything you can buy in it first , be sure to thoroughly stab and decapitate what you intend to cook when you get home .
Rule 3 : If Your Hands Are Covered With Bandages , You ’re Doing it Wrong !
Remember girls , pain is your friend — chances are if it hurts , you ’re doing it wrong !
Cooking should not have to hurt !
Yes , it might look nice to show people just how much effort you put into cooking when your hands look like they are gift wrapped in mummy panties and it makes a great plot device for the male lead to notice just how much work you ’ve put into it , but in reality , they ’ll just wonder why the heck you ’re messing with forces far beyond your control to the point of masochism instead of investing in a food processor like any sane person would .
Why bother with all this trouble though , just buy a bag of cup noodles in bulk and call it a day .
A surprisingly unknown fact is that most guys actually like convenience store junk food in direct proportion to how much salt content and MSG it has written on the back .
They ’ll probably die from high blood pressure years later , but that would n’t be your fault … legally at least .
Rule 4 : If It ’s Emitting a Hazy Purple Aura , Kill It With Fire !
Outside of taste testing and scent testing which are essential for any cook and are apparently ignored on a regular basis , in the anime world , food is given one other beautifully elegant attribute to indicate to their creators that it is epically not fit for human consumption , the dreaded purple aura of doom .
If you see your food giving off this mystical wavy ether of incomprehensible abomination , do not panic !
It simply means that your cooking skill has successfully managed to fall into the negatives of skill allocation and has transcended the laws of elementary chemistry .
Be sure to call your nearest local emergency number and request immediate biohazard disposal , they will appreciate your honesty when they acknowledge that you did your best to keep the death count to an acceptable minimum .
Rule 5 : Cooking Healthy is NEVER a Good Idea !
Health food is all the rage now with everyone trying every new diet under the sun , but until you taste the horrors of your new culinary calamity complete with flax seed oil and endurance increasing herbs , you will never know the sheer horror the human taste bud is capable of experiencing .
Never under any circumstances unless you intentionally want to make people fear you with incredible animosity should you ever cook with health as your intention in an anime , especially if it involves using ingredients that oh… only exist on another planet or is made out of the part of something that really wants to kill you .
Remember , when they say that “ they ca n’t taste the difference ” , they really mean to say that they can — and it tastes like suicide .
Rule 6 : Despite Common Belief , People Cannot Eat Things Bigger Than Their Head
Cooking all boils down to timing , allocation and presentation , of course , when you completely ignore the size of people ’s mouths , some surprisingly interesting things can be made , and by interesting , I mean completely nightmarish .
To that extent , when in doubt , stick a knife into it repeatedly until it ’s clearly not the same shape any more .
It ’s all about small pieces , really small pieces , just do n’t put a that cake in the blender if at all possible .
A common mistake for anime girls , especially when making bento box lunches is that they make one huge towering ziggurat of culinary chaos unable to be eaten by all who gaze upon it .
Now this all fine since more is normally a good thing , but for anime male leads , there ’s an unwritten rule that you absolutely positively must eat every single thing that is given to or die a virgin ( allegedly ) , so when you combine these two events together , you experience the magic that can only be described as a stomach explosion of gastronomic proportions .
In all fairness , it ’s fricken ’ hilarious to watch .
Rule 7 : Combustible Liquids Are Not A Food Group !
I love fire as much as the next guy who is n’t actually on fire at that particular time , but when your kitchen physically explodes and your food tastes like eternal burnation , it ’s probably a good time to ease up on the Nitro Glycerin or any of the other wide assorted explosive liquids offered at your local friendly supermarket .
Also , despite how it looks , microwaves are not inherently designed to store dynamite inside .
By some supernatural talent , similar to the Hazy Purple Aura of Death , anime girls who ca n’t cook have the ability to make explosives out of regular every day cooking ingredients that in any other sense outside of bubble reality of comedic relief would result in minor side effects of third degree burns and spontaneous decapitation .
It ’s actually a surprisingly useful talent — if it were used for anything other than actual cooking .
In truth though , the old saying “ The best way to a man ’s heart is through his stomach ” is nothing more than a myth … nope , the best way to a man ’s heart is in the form of an overpowering explosion of unrivaled death and destruction .
WASHINGTON  President Obama has hit back at former Vice President Dick Cheney , calling Bush administration policy on detainees at the military prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , “ unsustainable . ”
“ How many terrorists have actually been brought to justice under the philosophy that is being promoted by Vice President Cheney ? ” Mr. Obama said Friday in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on “ 60 Minutes ” on CBS .
The president was responding to recent charges by Mr. Cheney that the administration ’s decision to shut down the Guantánamo prison , along with other policies on the treatment of terrorism suspects , would make the United States more vulnerable to attacks .
Bush administration terrorism policy “ has n’t made us safer , ” Mr. Obama said , according to excerpts of the interview released Saturday .
“ You might have heard that Detroit ’s automakers have been struggling recently , ” said Mike Lillis in The Washington Independent .
Odd , then , that “ withering automaker ” Chrysler ’s finance arm would reject a $ 750 million cheap federal loan because it might involve curbs on executive pay .
According to The Washington Post , Chrysler Financial opted for more costly private loans after some top executives balked at accepting “ Washington ’s pay limits . ”
Of course “ the liberals are going to use the executive pay angle to spin this , ” said Rob Port in the blog Say Anything .
But the lesson here is n’t that the Chrysler executives were “ greedy ” for rejecting the “ big , fat government handout . ”
They just learned from General Motors the steep price for a bailout : tTe Obama team starts “ running your business . ”
That ’s a pretty useless lesson if your business hits bankruptcy court , said Megan McArdle in The Atlantic .
This " fairly explosive accusation ” of corporate greed warrants “ a grain of salt ” — it sounds like a “ targeted ” leak from frustrated Obama negotiators — but if it ’s true , do n’t rule out “ simple stupidity and greed ” at yet another U.S. company .
That does n’t sound so unlikely , said Ryan Avent in Portfolio , after reading a new New York magazine story on the “ lamentations ” of New York ’s overpaid , entitled , and out - of - touch banking class .
It 's a “ monument to chutzpah . ”
If executives like these feel burned , let 's hope they keep it to themselves — “ all - out class warfare ” would n’t help anyone .
A British boy who tried to kill himself was saved when a girl he had been chatting with in the US via the internet raised the alarm , starting a trans -Atlantic police hunt .
The boy , 16 , had been in contact with a girl in Maryland on the social networking site Facebook when he told her he was about to kill himself .
The girl alerted her mother , who started a string of emergency messages between Maryland police , the White House , the British embassy in Washington , Scotland Yard and Thames Valley Police .
President Bush has nearly doubled the national debt during his eight years in the White House .
As he prepares to return to Texas next month , Mr. Bush is on track to add $ 5 trillion to the $ 5.73 trillion national debt he inherited when he took office .
According to Treasury Department data , the number was $ 10.66 trillion at the end of November , and it has been rising at an astronomical rate .
During fiscal 2008 , which ended Sept. 30 , the national debt increased by more than $ 1 trillion , breaking the previous fiscal year record of more than $ 600 billion .
The national debt includes obligations held by the public as well as the intragovernmental debt in trust funds such as those operated by Medicare and Social Security .
The government ’s debt situation is about to get worse .
“ Federal debt should increase by $ 2 trillion in fiscal year 2009 , ” said Stan Collender , a longtime budget analyst who is the managing director at Qorvis Communications .
“ We are in a situation where you do what you have to do to get the economy moving again , ” said Mr. Collender , who then issued a warning about the consequences of the soaring debt level .
“ It will complicate federal - debt financing and fiscal policy for decades . ”
For example , given an average interest rate of 4 percent , the $ 5 trillion in national debt that has accumulated so far during the Bush administration could require an additional $ 200 billion per year from taxpayers in interest on that debt - in perpetuity .
During October , the first month of fiscal 2009 , the national debt increased by a staggering $ 549 billion .
That was approximately three - quarters of $ 1 billion every hour of every day , or more than $ 12 million per minute and more than $ 200,000 per second .
Treasury borrowed a lot of money in October to give to the Federal Reserve , which needed the funds to lend to American International Group ( AIG ) and other financial firms and to finance an array of “ liquidity facilities ” into which the Fed has been pouring hundreds of billions of dollars in order to thaw the world ’s frozen credit markets .
Much of this money should return to the Treasury eventually , Mr. Collender said .
“ There is never a guarantee , ” he said .
“ For example , what if AIG goes belly - up and the loans become worthless ? ”
Maya MacGuineas , president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , fears the “ next big bubble ” will be a “ government debt bubble . ”
Meanwhile , the budget deficit has been setting its own records .
During October , the deficit totaled $ 237 billion .
The national debt increased more rapidly than the budget deficit in October because much of the Treasury ’s borrowings were given to the Federal Reserve and , as such , were not part of the budget deficit .
Also , as noted , increases in the national debt include trust fund debt , which is not part of the budget deficit .
Fueled by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.’s $ 115 billion capital injection into the nation ’s largest banks - the initial outlays from his $ 700 billion bailout plan - the October budget deficit amounted to more than four times the $ 57 billion deficit recorded in October 2007 .
After adjusting all previous annual budget deficits for inflation , October ’s deficit was higher than 27 of the 28 annual deficits from the end of World War II through 1980 - and , in nearly all cases , substantially higher .
The Bush administration now appears to be crossing another important threshold : the percentage of the federal government ’s publicly held debt that is owed to foreigners .
Publicly held debt is one of two components of the national debt , the other being intragovernmental trust - fund holdings .
In 1970 , foreigners held 5 percent of U.S. publicly held debt , a situation that led many economists to argue that the national debt was not problematic because Americans owed it to themselves .
By 1980 , before the debt level began to rise significantly , foreigners owned 17 percent of publicly held debt , which excludes the debt in government trust funds such as Social Security .
At the end of fiscal 2001 , before the Bush administration ’s fiscal policy went into action , foreigners owned 30.3 percent of the publicly held debt .
At the end of August , the latest month for which all data are available , foreigners held more than 50 percent of U.S. publicly held debt , which had increased 64 percent since Mr. Bush ’s first budget went into effect .
In the three months since the end of August , publicly held debt has soared more than $ 900 billion .
Thus , at the end of November , the publicly held debt had increased by nearly 90 percent since Mr. Bush ’s first budget took effect in October 2001 .

The first extensive audit of the loss of civil liberties in the UK has been published , documenting a catalogue of restrictions of fundamental British freedoms .
Among the 60 new powers contained in over 25 acts of parliament published by the Convention on Modern Liberty , are laws allowing 28 - day detention without charge and restrictions on protest .
Other changes include email , telephone and letter interception , electronic tagging , house arrest , private coroners ' inquests and restrictions on photography .
Former shadow home secretary David Davis said the report revealed how British freedom had been chipped away bit by bit .
" The government is casually disregarding our civil liberties in the face of problems to which it has no adequate solutions , " he said .
" There will always be threats to our country whether it be in the face of terrorist activity or crime and we must fight for our liberties and win the battle each time . "
Henry Porter , co-director of the Convention on Modern Liberty , said : " One of the problems with the erosion of liberty in Britain over the last decade was that the public failed to pay attention to what was happening in parliament .
" Laws that fundamentally challenged our traditions of rights and liberty and flew in the face of the Human Rights
Act were passed with relatively little debate .
" Few grasped the impact they would have on our society and ministers were able to brush aside protests with assurances that their desire to protect us was equal to their respect for civil liberties . "
The Home Office said its counterterrorism programme was " proportionate " .
" The government has been clear that where surveillance or data collection will impact on privacy they should only be used where it is necessary and proportionate , " a spokesman said .
" The key is to strike the right balance between privacy , protection and sharing of personal data . "
The 20 page report was compiled by University College London 's ( UCL ) student human rights programme .
Some things never change :
U.S. President Barack Obama will not cut the billions of dollars in military aid promised to Israel , a senior U.S. administration official said Wednesday .
The $ 30 billion in aid promised to Israel over the next decade will not be harmed by the world financial crisis , the official told Israel Radio .
He spoke on condition of anonymity .
The military aid is an increase from the recent past and was agreed to by Bush in 2007 .
Close to $ 1 billion will also go to rebuilding the wreckage in Gaza caused in part by armaments paid for by ... the US !
Quite a racket when you come to think about it .
But there 's a condition on that money :
Some $ 900 million pledged by the United States to the Palestinians will be withdrawn if the expected Palestinian Authority coalition government between Fatah and Hamas does not recognize Israel 's right to exist , Western and Israeli diplomats said Wednesday .
How does this compare to the military aid we give to other allies ?
Say , Turkey ?

Bank of Montreal is being caught up in a widening probe into the use of bailout funds by American International Group , the distressed U.S. insurer .
Payments made by AIG to Canada ’s fourth - largest bank are due to be examined by the New York Attorney - General Andrew Cuomo as part of an inquiry into billions in taxpayer money funnelled to financial institutions .
The investigation comes as the attention of U.S. lawmakers turns to the payouts to banks following a political firestorm over bonuses handed by the insurer to staff at a controversial unit that sold credit protection to sophisticated financial clients .
" Our investigation into corporate bonuses has led us to an investigation of the credit default swap contracts at AIG , " the Attorney - General ’s office said .
BMO declined to comment .
The payments and bonuses are all linked to a small part of the U. S. insurer ’s international empire known as AIG Financial Products , which sold protection against default on complex credit instruments .
The tiny unit based in London effectively dragged down the global giant when it faced collateral calls it could not meet from BMO and at least two dozen other clients after the credit crisis intensified .
BMO is one of the top 10 recipients of federal bailout money paid by the stricken insurer to counterparties , according to documents released by AIG earlier this month under pressure from Congress .
The documents showed a least US $ 1.1 - billion of bailout money was paid to BMO in 2008 to settle insurance contracts protecting the Canadian bank against losses on its credit investments .
Goldman Sachs received US $ 12.9 - billion , while Société Générale and Deutsche Bank were paid nearly US $ 12 - billion out of the nearly US $ 180 - billion used to prevent a collapse of AIG .
" The question is whether the contracts are being wound down properly and efficiently or whether they have become a vehicle for funneling billions in taxpayers dollars to capitalize banks all over the world , " said the Attorney - General ’s office .
The probe is significant for BMO because it could lead to attempts by U.S. authorities to claw back funds .
The Canadian bank may also have additional exposures to AIG that it is yet to be paid for or received further payments in 2009 that have not been disclosed , analysts said .
Christopher Hitchens and the Battle of Beirut
Last week Christopher Hitchens and I were attacked in Beirut .
Less than 24 hours after we landed at the international airport , a half dozen members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party jumped us on Hamra Street when he defaced one of their signs .
He and I were traveling together because Lebanon 's New Opinion Group invited us to meet Prime Minister Fouad Seniora , Future Movement party leader Saad Hariri , Druze chief Walid Jumblatt , and other leaders of the pro-independence “ March 14 ” coalition .
February 14 rally , downtown Beirut
We had just attended a massive rally downtown commemorating the fourth anniversary of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri .
Christopher needed a new pair of shoes .
Our colleague Jonathan Foreman from Standpoint Magazine needed a shirt .
I needed a coffee .
So I led the way as the three of us strolled over to Hamra Street where we could buy just about anything .
And I told my two companions a story about the neighborhood 's past on the way .
“ When Hezbollah violently seized West Beirut last May , ” I said , “ the Syrian Social Nationalist Party followed them in .
They put up their spinning swastika flags all over the neighborhood , and no one dared touch them until the prime minister ordered them taken down several months later . ”
SSNP flags on Hamra Street
It was a warning of sorts – or at least it would have been heeded as such by most people .
I do n’t go looking for trouble , Jonathan is as mild - mannered a writer as any I know , but Christopher is brave and combative , and he would have none of it .
“ My attitude to posters with swastikas on them , ” he later told Alice Fordham at NOW Lebanon , “ has always been the same .
They should be ripped down . ”
When we rounded the corner onto Hamra Street , a Syrian Social Nationalist Party sign was the first thing we saw .
Hamra Street , West Beirut .
The SSNP sign is in the lower - left corner .
“ Well there ’s that swastika now , ” Christopher said .
The now - infamous SSNP sign defaced by Christopher Hitchens
The Syrian Social Nationalist Party flags had been taken down , but a commemorative marker was still there .
It was made of metal and plastic and had the semi-permanence of an official “ No Parking ” sign .
SSNP member Khaled Alwan shot two Israeli soldiers with a pistol in 1982 after they settled their bill at the now - defunct Wimpy café on that corner , and the sign marked the spot .
Some SSNP members claim the emblem on their flag is n’t a swastika , but a cyclone .
Many say they cannot be National Socialists , as were the Nazis , because they identify instead as Social Nationalists , whatever that means .
Outside observers do n't find this credible .
The SSNP , according to the Atlantic in a civil war era analysis , “ is a party whose leaders , men approaching their seventies , send pregnant teenagers on suicide missions in booby - trapped cars .
And it is a party whose members , mostly Christians from churchgoing families , dream of resuming the war of the ancient Canaanites against Joshua and the Children of Israel .
They greet their leaders with a Hitlerian salute ; sing their Arabic anthem , ' Greetings to You , Syria , ' to the strains of ' Deutschland , Deutschland über alles ' ; and throng to the symbol of the red hurricane , a swastika in circular motion . ”
They wish to resurrect the ancient pre-Islamic and pre-Arabic Syria and annex Lebanon , Cyprus , Jordan , Iraq , Kuwait , Israel , and parts of Turkey and Egypt to Damascus .
Jews would have no place in the resurrected Syrian empire .
The SSNP ’s map of what they claim is their “ Greater Syria ”
SSNP militiamen , along with fighters from Amal and Hezbollah , used heavy weapons to seize West Beirut last May after the government shut down Hezbollah ’s surveillance system at the airport , and they set aflame Hariri ’s Future TV office and studio with molotov cocktails .

In 2006 some of their members were arrested by the Lebanese Army for storing “ a large quantity of explosives , electrical detonators and timers in addition to a large cache of weapons . ”
Confiscated SSNP bomb materials
Confiscated SSNP weapons
Many Lebanese believe they ’re the hired guns of the Assad regime in Damascus and have carried out many , if not most , of the car bomb assassinations in Lebanon since 2005 .
Christopher wanted to pull down their marker , but could n’t .
He stuck to his principles , though , and before I could stop him he scribbled “ No , no , F *** the SSNP ” in the bottom - right corner with a black felt - tipped pen .
I blinked several times .
Was he really insulting the Syrian Social Nationalist Party while they might be watching ?
Neither Christopher nor Jonathan seemed to sense what was coming , but my own danger signals went haywire .
An angry young man shot across Hamra Street as though he ’d been fired out of a cannon .
“ Hey ! ” he yelled as he pointed with one hand and speed - dialed for backup on his phone with the other .
“ We need to get out of here now , ” I said .
But the young man latched onto Christopher ’s arm and would n’t let go .
“ Come with me ! ” he said and jabbed a finger toward Christopher 's face .
They were the only words I heard him say in English .
Christopher tried to shake off his assailant , but could n’t .
“ I ’m not going anywhere with you , ” he said .
The young man said something sinister - sounding in Arabic .
“ Do you speak English ? ” I said .
He did n't , and I 'm not sure why I even bothered to ask .
I hoped to calm him down , but Christopher , Jonathan , and I needed to leave .
Standing around and trying to reason with him would serve his needs , but not ours .
His job was to hold us in place until the muscle crew showed up in force .
“ Let go of him ! ” I said , and shoved him without result .
He clamped onto Christopher like a steel trap .

I stepped into the street and flagged down a taxi .
“ Get in the car ! ” I said .
Christopher , sensing rescue , managed to shake the man off and got into the back seat of the taxi .
Jonathan and I piled in after him .
But the angry young man ran round to the other side of the car and got in the front seat .
I shoved him with both hands , but I did n’t have the leverage to eject him with the back of the front seat between us .
The driver could have tried to push the man out , but he did n’t .
I sensed he was afraid .
So my companions and I got out of the car on the left side .
The SSNP man bolted from the front seat on the right side .
Then I jumped back in the car and locked the doors on that side .
“ He ’ll just unlock it , ” Jonathan said .
Jonathan Foreman from Standpoint Magazine
He was right .
I had n’t noticed that the windows were rolled down on the passenger side .
The young man reached in , laughed , and calmly unlocked the front passenger door .
I stepped back into the street , and the young man latched once again onto Christopher .
No one could have stopped Jonathan and me had we fled , but we could n’t leave Christopher to face an impending attack by himself .
The lone SSNP man only needed to hold one of us still while waiting for his squad .
A police officer casually ambled toward us as though he had no idea what was happening .
“ Help , ” Christopher said to the cop .
“ I ’m being attacked ! ”
Our assailant identified himself to the policeman , and the officer took three steps back as though he did not want any trouble .
He could have unholstered his weapon and stopped the attack on the spot , but even Lebanon ’s armed men of the law fear the Syrian Social Nationalist Party .
A Lebanese man in his thirties ran up to me and offered to help .
“ What ’s happening ? ! ” he said breathlessly as he trembled in shock and alarm .
I do n’t remember what I told him , and it hardly matters .
There was n’t much he could do , and I did not see him again .
“ Let go of him ! ” I said to the SSNP spotter and tried once more to throw him off Christopher .
“ Hit him if you have to , ” I said to Christopher .
“ We ’re out of time and we have to get out of here . ”
“ Back to the hotel , ” Christopher said .
“ No ! ” I said .
“ We ca n’t let them know where we ’re staying . ”
Christopher would n’t strike his assailant , so I sized the man up from a distance of six or so feet .
I could punch him hard in the face , and he could n't stop me .
I could break his knee with a solid kick to his leg , and he could n't stop me .
He needed all his strength just to hold onto Christopher while I had total freedom of movement and was hopped up on adrenaline .
We had n't seen a weapon yet , and I was pretty sure he did n't have one .
I was a far greater threat to him at that moment than he was to me by himself .
Christopher , Jonathan , and I easily could have joined forces and left him bleeding and harmless in the street .
I imagine , looking back now , that he was afraid .
But I knew the backup he ’d called would arrive any second .
And his backup might be armed .
We were about to face the wrath of a militia whose members can do whatever they want in the streets with impunity .
Escalating seemed like the worst possible thing I could do .
The time to attack the young man was right at the start , and that moment had passed .
This was Beirut , where the law of the jungle can rule with the flip of a switch , and we needed to move .
I saw another taxi parked on the corner waiting for passengers , and I flung open the door .
“ Get in , get in , ” I said , “ and lock all the doors ! ”
Traffic was light .
If the driver would step on the gas with us inside , we could get out of there .
Christopher managed to fling the man off him again .
It looked hopeful there for a second .
But you know where this story is going .
We knew it , too , because six or seven furious men showed up all at once and faced us in the street .
They stepped in front of the taxi and cut off our escape .
None wore masks , which was a good sign .
And I did n't see any weapons .
But they were well - built and their body language signaled imminent violence .
We were in serious trouble , and I ran into the Costa Coffee chain across the street and yelled at the waiter to call the police .
“ Go away ! ” he said and lightly pushed me in the shoulder to make his point .
“ You need to leave now ! ”
This was no way to treat a visitor , especially not in the Arab world where guests are accorded protection .
But getting in the way of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party can get a man killed , or at least beaten severely .
Just a few months ago the SSNP attacked a Sunni journalist on that very street and sent him bleeding and broken to the hospital in front of impotent witnesses .
A Lebanese colleague told me he was brutally assaulted merely for filming the crew taking down the SSNP flags as the prime minister ordered .
“ He did n't do anything to them , ” she said .
“ He just filmed their flag . ”
Journalist Omar Harqous was beaten by the SSNP for filming their flags
Christopher was encircled by four or five of them .
They were geared up to smash him , and I reached for his hand to pull him away .
One of the toughs clawed at my arm and left me with a bleeding scratch and a bruise .
I expected a punch in the face , but I was n’t the target .
Christopher was the target .
He was the one who had defaced their sign .
One of the guys smacked him hard in the face .
Another delivered a roundhouse kick to his legs .
A third punched him and knocked him into the street between two parked cars .
Then they gathered around and kicked him while he was down .
They kicked him hard in the head , in the ribs , and in the legs .
Jonathan and I had about two and a half seconds to figure out what we should do when one of the SSNP members punched him in the side of the head and then kicked him .
I stoically accepted that I was about to get beaten myself .
The fear drained out of me as I was reasonably sure they were n't going to kill us .
They did n’t have weapons or masks .
They just wanted to beat us .
There were too many for us to fend off .
We lost the fight before it even began .
I could have called for backup myself , but I did n’t think of it – a mistake I will not make again .
I have my own muscle crew on speed dial now for protection .
Then the universe all of a sudden righted itself .
Christopher managed to pull himself up as a taxi approached in the street .
I stepped in front of the car and forced the driver to stop .
“ Get in ! ” I yelled .
Christopher got in the car .
Jonathan got in the car .
I got in the car .
We slammed down the locks on the doors with our fists .
The street was empty of traffic .
The way in front of the taxi was clear .
The scene for our escape was set .
“ Go ! ” I said to the driver .
“ Where ? ” the driver said .
“ Just drive ! ” I said .
One of the SSNP guys landed a final blow on the side of Christopher 's face through the window , but the driver sped away and we were free .
I do n’t remember what we said in the car .
I was barely scathed in the punch up , and Jonathan seemed to be fine .
Christopher was still in one piece , though he was clearly in pain .
All of us were relieved .
Our afternoon had gone sideways , but it could have been a great deal worse than it was .
“ Let ’s not go back to our hotel yet , ” I said .
I covered my face with my hands and rubbed my eyes with my palms .
“ In case we 're being followed . ”
Some of our colleagues were back at the hotel .
If the SSNP found out where we were staying , every single one of us would have to move to the other side of Beirut .
“ Where do you want to go ? ” our driver said .
“ Let ’s just drive for a while , ” Jonathan said .
So our driver took us down to the Corniche that follows the curve of the Mediterranean .
He never did ask what happened .
Or , if he did , I do n't remember him asking .
I kept turning around and checking behind us to make sure we were n’t being followed .
Beirut ’s Corniche
“ Maybe we should go to the Phoenicia , ” I said .
The Phoenicia Intercontinental Hotel is one of the priciest in the city .
Management installed a serious security regime at the door .
This is the place where diplomats and senators stay when they are in town .
I doubted the guards would allow thugs from any organization into their lobby .
“ He deserves a huge tip , ” Jonathan said as our driver dropped us off .
“ Yes , ” I said .
“ He certainly does . ”
The three of us relaxed near the Phoenicia 's front door for a few minutes .
We would need to change cars , but first had to ensure we had n’t been followed .
“ You 're bleeding , ” Jonathan said and lightly touched Christopher 's elbow .
Christopher seemed unfazed by the sight of blood on his shirt .
“ We need to get you cleaned up , ” Jonathan said .
“ I 'm fine , I think , ” Christopher said .
He seemed to be in pretty good spirits , all things considered .
“ The SSNP , ” I said , “ is the last party you want to mess with in Lebanon .
I ’m sorry I did n’t warn you properly .
This is partly my fault . ”
“ I appreciate that , ” Christopher said .
“ But I would have done it anyway .
One must take a stand .
One simply must . ”
*
Bashar Assad ’s government in Damascus still wields some of its occupation instruments inside Lebanon .
The Syrian Social Nationalist Party is one of those instruments , and it counts the regime as its friend and ally .
The volksy geographic “ nationalism ” of the SSNP differs from the racialist Arab Nationalism of the Syrian Baath Party , but it conveniently meshes with Assad ’s imperial foreign policy in the Middle East .
It follows , then , that the SSNP is also allied with Hezbollah .
I shudder to think what might have happened to Christopher , Jonathan , and me if we were Lebanese instead of British and American .
“ If you were Lebanese , ” said a long - time Beiruti friend , “ you might have disappeared . ”
“ If you were Lebanese , ” said another , “ none of this would even have happened . ”
Two days after the punch up , various factually inaccurate versions of the story made their way into the blogosphere .
Everyone seemed to think we had been drinking or were in a bar fight .
I was annoyed .
Christopher was amused .

“ You have no idea what it ’s like being me , ” he said .
“ Everything I do is news . ”
I later sat down with him over coffee and asked him to reflect on the recent unpleasantness .
“ When I told you that I should have warned you , ” I said , “ that I take partial responsibility , you said ... ”
“ It would n't have made any difference , ” he said .
“ Thank you , though , for giving me a protective arm .
I think a swastika poster is partly fair game and partly an obligation .
You do n't really have the right to leave one alone .
I have n't seen that particular symbol since I saw the Syrianization of Lebanon in the 1970s .
And actually the first time I saw it , I did n't quite believe it . ”
“ You saw it when you were here before ? ” I said .
“ Oh yes , ” he said .
“ But it was more toward the Green Line .
I did not expect to see it so flagrantly on Hamra . ”
Hamra Street , West Beirut
Christopher has seen Beirut at its worst .
He visited Lebanon during the war and immediately after .
In 1991 , he told me , the city looked like Rotterdam after World War II had gone to work on it .
“ Anyway , ” he said , “ call me old fashioned if you will , but my line is that swastika posters are to be defaced or torn down .
I mean , what other choice do you have ?
I 'd like to think I 'd have done that if I had known it was being guarded by people who are swastika fanciers .
I have done that in my time .
I have had fights with people who think that way .
But I was surprised first by how violent and immediate their response was , and second by how passive and supine was the response of the police . ”
The police are not utterly supine .
Some SSNP members have been arrested .
Weapons and explosives have been confiscated .
Clearly , however , the state is more supine than it should be .
A police officer who wandered upon the scene of our assault did n’t do anything .
Not even the army stopped the SSNP when its black masked fighters conquered the western half of the capital with Hezbollah and Amal in 2008 .
A Hezbollah militiaman smokes a nargileh in Hamra
The men of the SSNP must use force to maintain a hold in West Beirut .
Most of its members are Orthodox Christians while most West Beirutis are Sunnis .
The Hamra district is a liberal and cosmopolitan “ March 14 ” stronghold , and the SSNP is aligned with the Syrians and the Shia Hezbollah militia .
They could be hardly be any less welcome in Tel Aviv .
If its enforcers did n't jump Christopher in the street , their commemorative sign might not have lasted .
“ But I was impressed , ” Christopher said , “ with the response of the cafe girls . ”
“ What was their response ? ” I said .
“ I missed that . ”
“ Well , ” he said , “ when I was thrown to the ground and bleeding from my fingers and elbow , they came over and asked what on earth was going on .
How can this be happening to a guest , to a stranger ?
I do n't remember if I was speaking English or French at that time .
I said something like merde fasciste , which I hope they did n't misinterpret . ”
I did not see the cafe girls .
Or , if I did , I do n’t remember them .
Once the actual violence on Hamra began , it was over and done with in just a few seconds .
The whole thing was a blur .
Most of what I remember is what happened to me .
Christopher , Jonathan , and I naturally recall different details .
Jonathan later told me that one of the SSNP guys called off the assault after Christopher had been kicked a few times .
I had n't seen that , and I have to wonder what other details I missed .
“ By then , ” Christopher said , “ I had become convinced that you were right , that we should get the fuck out of there and not , as I had first thought , get the hotel security between them and us .
I thought no , no , let 's not do that .
We do n't want them to know where we are .
The harassment might not stop .
There was a very gaunt look in the eye of the young man , the first one .
And there was a very mad , sadistic , deranged look in the eyes of his auxiliaries .
I wish I 'd had a screwdriver . ”
“ You know these guys are widely suspected for setting off most or all of the car bombs , ” I said .
“ They were n't ready for that then , ” he said .
“ They were n't , ” I said , “ but they ’re dangerous . ”
“ Once you credit them like that , ” he said , “ you do all their work for them .
They should have been worried about us .
Let them worry .
Let them wonder if we 're carrying a tool or if we have a crew .
I 'd like to go back , do it properly , deface the thing with red paint so there 's no swastika visible .
You can't have the main street , a shopping and commercial street , in a civilized city patrolled by intimidators who work for a Nazi organization .
It is not humanly possible to live like that .
One must not do that .
There may be more important problems in Lebanon , but if people on Hamra do n't dare criticize the SSNP , well fuck .
That 's occupation . ”
“ It is , ” I said , “ in a way .
They have a state behind them .
They are n't just a street gang , they 're a street gang with a state . ”
“ Yes , ” Christopher said .
“ They ’re the worst .
And also a Greek Orthodox repressed homosexual wankers organization , I think . ”
The Syrian Social Nationalist Party spokesman denies the attack ever took place .
He is lying .

「 橋本治の手トリ足トリ」の内容から、同氏が凄腕テクニカルライターであることを感じ取った私は、いくつか彼の著作を買い求めたのですが、この中に「わからない」という方法
と題する一冊がありました。変てこりんなタイトルですが、変てこりんな私には、その言わんとすることが本を紐解く前から分かったように思います。
章立ては次の通り 。
第一章 「 わからない」は根性であ る
第二章 「 わからない」という方 法
第三章 なんにも知らないバカはこんなことをす る
第四章 知性する身 体
いきなり第一章から、訳がわからないタイトルです。「根性である」と言われてもねぇ・・。しかも、内容はくどい上にあんまり面白くない。Amazon.co.jpのレビューで「くどい」が連発されているのは当然と言えますが、実はこれは意地の悪い著者が読者を選別するために仕掛けたフィルターなのです。「根性ある奴しかこの本は読まんでいい」というのが、第一章の言わんとするところ。この仕掛けについては、第二章で明かされます(と私は思う ) 。
そしてしかし、 「くどい」と怒られて私はキョトンとする。「私は" 頭の悪い人 "
を読者として想定しているのに、なんでそんなに頭のいい人がわざわざ俺の本なんか読むのだろう？」と思うからである。べつに皮肉でもなんでもない。小学生には「小学生のための本」が必要で、大人がそれを読んで「自分向きじゃない」と言うのは、単なる理不尽だということである。
なんでもさっさとわかりたがる人は、「わかっていない自分」に直面したくない人なのである。「あまりここに長居をしていると"
わかっていない自分"に直面することになるから、そうなる前に、さっさとわかってここからおさらばしよう」と思う人にとって、私の本は不向きなのだ。
橋本治氏は、真面目に自分のことをバカと捉え、そのバカさ加減を解析しています。ですから、この本は「バカ」を自認できる人のみが手にするべきです。「かしこい人」は本書を避けた方が賢明でしょう、読後には不快感しか残らないでしょうから。
大まかなる日本語の歴史
第三章のタイトルも誤解されやすいため補足しておきますと、このバカは一般人ではなく著者自身をさしています。「なんにも知らないバカなワシは、ここまでするんじゃ！」こちらで捉えてください。この章では、" 桃尻語訳 枕草子 " の現代語訳過程 が 「地を這う方法」として紹介されていますが、実はこの章には「大まかなる日本語の歴史」が描かれています。橋本氏は東京大学文学部国文科卒ですが、教科書では到底お目にかかれないような国文学のお話が続きます。これが実に面白い。しかも目次や紹介文でこのことには一切触れられていないのだから、実に控えめというか、やっぱり意地が悪い。
例えば、この中で紀貫之の手になる土佐日記の有名な冒頭
男もすなる日記といふものを、女もしてみむとするなり
この一文をどのようにして現代語訳するか、順を追って解説が進みます。
男もするらしい日記というものを、女もしてみようとするのである
男もするらしい日記というものを、女もしてみようとするのね
男もするらしい日記というものを、女もしてみようとするんだもん
男もするらしい日記というものを、女もしてみようとするんだ
橋本氏によれば、最後が正解なのだそうですが、この推敲過程ひとつひとつを彼は真面目に考察しています。冗談ととられかねないので付け加えておきますと、これらの訳は平安時代の時代背景と文法に基づいた厳密な解釈に立脚しているのであります。
熊川哲也もそうだっ た
話を本題に戻しましょう。試練の第一章を過ぎ去ると、第二章から途端に本書は面白くなります。中でも、バレエダンサー熊川哲也氏の中学時代のエピソードは象徴的。
熊川哲也は、世界的に有名な超一流のバレエダンサーである。以前にたまたまテレビを見ていたら、彼の特集をやっていて、そこに子供時代の彼にバレエを教えていた先生が出て来た。北海道でバレエ教室を主宰する女の先生である。この彼女は、子供の頃の熊川哲也が、やたらと「わからない」を連発していたと証言していた。新しいプロセスを彼に教えようとすると、まだ中学生の熊川哲也は、「そんなことできねーよ、先生」と言うのだそうである。口で新しいプロセスを教えられても、「できない、わかんない」を連発して、「じゃ、先生やってみてよ」と言うのだそうである。熊川哲也が「できない」と思うことを先生がやって見せると、首をかしげて、「わかんない」がまた始まるんだそうである。
( 略 ) 「 わからない、わからない」を連発していた少年熊川哲也は、身体各部の動きを「どうやらこういうものらしい」と理解すると、家に帰ってそのことを我が身に実現させるためのレッスンに一人で励んでいたのだという。「前の日に"
わからない、わからない"を連発して、しかし少年熊川哲也は、翌日にはちゃんとできるようになっていた」と、彼の先生は往時を語っていた。
もちろん、熊川哲也のすごさは、「次の日にはできるようになっていた」ではない。自分の理解の届かないところを確実に発見して、それに対して「わからない」を明確に確認していたことーー「わからないの掘り起こし」である
「 わからないの掘り起こし」とは、なんちゅう素晴らしい表現なんや〜〜、私は感涙しました。さすがは凄腕テクニカルライター、「わからないの掘り起こし」こそ、テクニカルライターに求められる最も重要な資質でありましょう。
ところで、熊川氏のバレエ講演中の怪我から復帰までを特集したテレビ番組を昨年見たのですが、この中で繰り返された
" No pain , no gain " という彼の言葉がいまだ耳に残っています。
自分がバカか、世界がバカか
橘曙覧(たちばなのあけみ ) という江戸時代の歌人が、独楽吟という一風変わった連作を残しています。五十二首の連作は、すべて「たのしみは」で始まり「〜する時」で終わるのですが、この中に次のような歌があります。
たのしみは そぞろ読みゆく 書( ふみ ) の中( うち ) に 我とひとしき 人をみし 時
「 ええこと言うなぁ・・でも、こんな本には滅多に出会えないのよね」と常々思っていたのですが、第二章で出てくる「自分がバカか、世界がバカか」という見出しに、私はまさに「我とひとしき人」を見たのであります。
「 自分はわからないことだらけだ」と、私は思う。そして、その疑問を解いてくれるような本に出会うことがそうそうない。他人の書いた本を読んで「なるほど」と思うことももちろん多かったのだが、それと同時に、「どうしてこういうことは書いてないんだ？」と思うことも多かった。「わからないことだらけ」を当然とする私は、他人の本の中に「書かれていること」より、「書かれていないこと」をより多く発見してしまっていたのである。
そんな私にとって、「わからない」と思っているお客さん＝読者は、いくらでもいるはずなのである。だから平気で、「書くことなんかいくらでもあるはず」と思っている。「自分が書くしかないのかな？」と思うことも当然ある。
「ほんとホント、そうよねぇ。技術書のテーマなんて、いくらでもあるもんねぇ。」ここから私の首は振り子の虎状態、ひたすらうなずきまくり。かって、編集部界隈から「ネタがない」という声をよく耳にしましたが、私にこの悩みは到底理解できませんでした。C言語 ,
Python , Linux , FPGA あらゆるテーマは、優れた書き手の登場を待っています。これまで出版されてきた書籍が書き切ったことよりも、書き漏らしていることの方が " 質的 " には遙かに多いのですから 。
こうした事実に、なぜ出版社は気づかないのか？
人 は 「 わかりやすさ」をバカにする
橋本氏は、その理由を 「人はわかりやすさをバカにする」からだと説明しています。
私にとって、 「本を書く」ということは、自分が率先して「一番のバカ」になることであり、その「バカな自分」を納得させることなのである。私はそういう人間だからそれでいいのだが、しかし、世の中の人間すべてが私と同じような人間ではない。「自分はそんなにバカではない、ある程度以上のことはもう知っている」と思う人だって多い。もしかしたら、そういう人間の数の方が多いかもしれない。「知っている」と「知らない」とを比べたら、「知っている」の方が体裁はいい。「知らない」がバレない限り、その体裁のよさは崩れない。である以上、世の中には、「自分はもうある程度以上のことを知っている」と思う人間の方が多いのである。
まだ経験の浅い若い人達が、「自分は知っている」と誤解してしまうことは仕方がないでしょう。しかし、技術書を出版する著者・編集者が「自分はわかっている」と思い込んでしまうと、事態は深刻です。「わかっているから、ネタがない」これは自業自得でしょう。しかし、先日紹介した
OR/XOR 問題に代表されるように、著者の「わかったつもり」は罪のない読者にまで感染してしまうのです。
壁を越えるための 「基本 」
人はなぜ 「わかったつもり」になるのか、なぜ「わかる」ことができないのか？橋本氏は「わかる」という壁を乗り越えるためには、基本が必要であると説きます。
「 できるはず」と思い込んでいる人間が壁にぶつかると、厄介なことになる。「できる」と思い込んでいる人間は、「自分の無能」を理解せず、「自分を不適合にする状況が悪い」という、とんでもない判断をしてしまうからである。 仕事が「自分のもの」にならないのは、その仕事の中に隠されている「基本」が見えず、マスターできなくなっているからである。教えられた通りのことを教えられた通りにやっていたって、その先はない。薄っぺらな自分が薄っぺらに見た程度のことだけを「仕事」と勘違いしていたら、すぐに壁にぶつかってしまう。ただそればかりのことである。 その昔は、「まず基本」がその初めにあった。時代が進むにつれて、「基本」の上に厚い堆積物が積もった。「基本」が見えないまま、小起用な人間がテキトーにやれば、それでOKになった。そして、その二十世紀という便利な時代は、壁にぶつかるのである。「この自分のイージーさはなんかへんだなー」という自覚がない限り、その壁を越えるための「基本」は姿を現さないだろう。それくらいのシビアさはあるのである。
「 基本が厚い堆積物で多い隠されてしまった」というくだりには、激しく同意。読者は、いつの時代も純粋に「わかる境地」を追い求めています。しかし、この境地に達するためには「基本を掴む」必要があるのだということを学校の先生や教科書は教えてくれません。基本を体得できていないから、「この自分のイージーさはなんかへんだなー」という厄介な不安が生まれる。この不安に付け込み、出版業界は怒濤の如く「わかりやすそうな顔をした」駄本を送り込む。新刊書を読んでも、読者はやっぱりわからない。ふりだしに戻る。
K&R版 プログラミング言 語Cによる初心者へのイジメ
残念ながら、この繰り返しは今後も止むことがないでしょう。例えば、40年近い歴史を誇るC言語ですが、いまだに手を替え品を替え、C言語本(特に入門書)が出版され続けるのはなぜか？答えはひとつ、「読んでもわからない」からです。古今東西、数え切れないほどのC言語入門書が出版されては消えていきましたが、この事実は決定版となり得る入門書の名著がいまだ存在していないことを意味しています。
Kernighan and Ritchie による " The C Programming Language ( 邦訳 プログラミング言 語C ) " があるではないかという指摘もあるかと思いますが、この本は初心者にとってとんでもない悪書であると私は考えます。
世の中に は 「わかる人が読めばわかる」という書物が少なからず存在します。デバイスのデータシートがその典型例ですが、この手の文書は「わからない人がわかる」ようには書かれていません。プロセッサを見たこともない新人に、いきなりルネサス
H8/300H マイコンのハードウェアマニュアルを手渡し「今度このマイコンを組み込み制御で使うから読んでおいて」と言ったら、それはイジメというものでしょう。
" K&R版 プログラミング言 語C " も、まさしくデータシートと言えます 。C言語入門者が、 「 この本を読んでもチンプンカンプンです」というのは、極めて素直で正直な反応。わかる方が、おかしい。なぜなら、C言語を体得するためにはコンピュータアーキテクチャの基礎を理解する必要があるにも関わらず、この書籍では全く触れられていないからです。
本書が " データシート " となってしまった理由のひとつには、第一版が発刊された1978年当時の対象読者は、主として十二分なプログラミング経験を積んだ
UNIX ユーザーであったことがあるのではないかと思います。プログラミングと言っても、まだアセンブリ言語が大活躍していた時代ですから、PDP-11 を始めとするコンピュータアーキテクチャに精通していることは、当時常識でした。つまり、
" The C Programming Language " の対象読者 は 、PDP - 11 のプロセッサマニュアルやペリフェラルマニュアルを小説のように楽しめる人達であった訳です。
時は流れて21世紀。アセンブルすら経験したことがない人達に本書を理解せよと言っても、それは無茶というものでしょう。恐らく、著者達自身もよくわかっていると思います。ところが・・
本書は毎年、毎シーズン、 " コンピュータ書フェア " や " コンピュータの名著特 集 " で永遠のリファレンス書として登場するのであります。確かに本書は名著かもしれませんが、それはごく一部の経験者にとってであり、大多数の初心者にとっては「わからない」というコンプレックスに等しい存在です。際限ない入門書出版の遠因にも、なっているように思います。
今年も、フレッシャーズ特集の季節が近づいています。「まずはプログラマのバイブルである、プログラミング言語Cを読みましょう」というような記述があれば、その特集はポイした方が良いでしょう。このような
" 無責任な紹介 " をする人は、およそ三つのグループに分類されます。
紹介した本人自身が、実はわかっていない派 ( 最も多い、ブランド派とも言える )
自分が経験した苦労を後輩にも味わせてやろう派 ( これも多い、別名は意地悪派 )
真の名著にまだ出会ったことがない派 ( ジャンクフードで育ち日本食の良さが分からない子供に似ている、いわば味音痴派)
これからの季節 、 " プログラミング言語C " を小脇に抱えてニコニコ近づいてくる先輩にも、要注意です。
結 局 「 一人で地を這う」しかない
それでは、どうすれば 「 わからない」から「わかる」に達することができるのか。橋本氏は「わかるためには、地を這うしかない」と言っています。
私はそういう人間なのである。なにかをするに当たって、「めんどくさい」は当然のことだと思っている。「めんどくさい」のは事実だから、「めんどくさい、めんどくさい」とは言うが、私は、「めんどくさいことをやる」ということに関しての覚悟ばかりはできている。私には、それ以外の方法がないのである。私の「わからない」や「できない」は、その下地の上に載っている。
( 略 ) 私にとって、すべては 「自分の中から出てくるもの」であって、それが出てくるまでは平気でなんにもわからない。ただ一人でウロウロして、その内に、いろんなことを思い出したり見つけたりして、そうなった時には、もう編集者の出る幕なんかなくなっている。結局私は、一人で全部をやるしかなくなっていて、仕事中の私には話す相手もいない。それは当然のことだから、べつに嘆きもしない。
「 めんどくさいことをやる覚悟」、当たり前と言えば当たり前なのですが、私はこの言葉を目にしてしびれました。著者の
" 孤独な覚 悟 " からしか、名著は生まれない。いやはや、その通り。
上記で強調されている「一人」という言葉にも感銘を受けました。一般的には書籍の出版にあたっては、編集者の存在が大きいように言われますが、こと専門書に関しては橋本氏が言うように「編集者の出る幕なんかない」。私も全く同感です。すべては「自分の中からしか出てこない」からです。ちなみに、ほぼ日刊イトイ新聞の「担当編集者は知っている」というコーナーに、" わからないという方法 "
の担当編集者が紹介文を書いていますが、はからずも「編集者の出る幕なんかなかった」ことが披露されています。
上記引用とは別の場所で、桃尻語訳枕草子の出版後に起きた次のようなエピソードが紹介されていますが、これもなかなか含蓄に富んでいます。
書店に出 て 「もう終わりか」と思っていたら、北海道の女子高校生から「一ヵ所、訳が抜けてるのはなぜですか？」という手紙が出版社に来て、「あ、ほんとだ」になった。たった「五文字」が抜けていたのである。一年半かかりっきりの著者が見落としていた箇所に気づくということは、その彼女が原文と突き合わせながら読んでいたということである。作者冥利につきる読者もちゃんといるということだが、結局の話、「だから手は抜けない」である。
このエピソードは、裏を返せば「担当編集者が原文と突き合わせて読んでいなかった」ことを意味しています。読んでいたかもしれないが、結果として抜けに気づくことができなかった。
これも雑誌の校正作業中にしばしば起こることであり、私は自分自身はもちろん、編集部の校正も全くあてにしていません。一方、同じ出版業界でも、私の本業である分野の編集者は「こんな間違い、よー見つけたなぁ」と感心するほど完璧な校正で仕上げてきます。職場にもよるのでしょうが、「だから手は抜けない」という覚悟をもったプロの編集者は、日本では少数派なのかもしれません。
孤独な著者を支える読者
私達一人一人が地を這うことができれば、それが理想かもしれませんが、これには膨大な時間と手間、そして効率よく這い回る技術が必要とされます。現実的ではありません。では、どうすれば最小限の努力で「 わかる」ようになるのか？
それは、橋本氏が語ったように一人でも多くの著者が「めんどくさいことをやる覚悟」を決め、「一人で地を這う」。その上で、「自分の中から出てきたものを本に著す」。これしかないと、私は思うのです。
一方、読者には著者には決してできない役割があります。それは、これまで地を這ってきた先人や、今まさに地を這っている人達を正しく評価し、支え合うこと。これに尽きるのではないでしょうか。
President Barack Obama ( L ) and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner arrive in the East Room of the White House in Washington March 16 , 2009 to make announcements on helping small business during the economic crisis .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will take his economic strategy to Jay Leno ’s comic couch on Thursday in the first appearance by a sitting U.S. president on a late - night TV talk show .
NBC said in a statement that Obama would sit down before a live audience on “ The Tonight Show with Jay Leno ” on March 19 to talk about his economic plan and “ other topics . ”
Obama ’s visit to the Burbank studio near Los Angeles , where the top-rated late - night TV show is recorded , will come during a visit by the president to Southern California this week .
NBC said it would be Obama ’s first sit - down talk show appearance in studio with a live audience since his election last year , and the first ever appearance by a U.S. president while in office on a late - night chat show .
Obama appeared on the “ The Tonight Show ” in October 2007 during a presidential election campaign that broadened the reach of political campaigning into popular television , the Internet and text messaging .
The two - month - old Obama administration has already won passage of a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at lifting the U.S. economy out of a deepening recession .
But Obama ’s record $ 3.55 trillion budget plan faces opposition from Republicans , and some Democrats , over its high costs and bold moves on healthcare , education and global warming .
Leno announced last week that he would host a free benefit concert on April 7 in Detroit -- one of the cities hit hardest by the recession .
A second show has since been added to meet strong demand .
The comic host is leaving the late - night slot on NBC in May after 17 years and launching a new , prime - time chat show at 10 p.m. , five nights a week , in the fall of 2009 on the same network .

Three months ago , Linda Stout - Turner had money , a good job and a nice house .
Now she is homeless - part of a growing number of middle - class people whose lives suddenly implode as the economic crisis wreaks havoc on jobs , homes and relationships .
Across the country , as hostels fill up , charities are warning that it can only get worse
In the spring London sunlight , a tattered , filthy , homeless woman walks along the crowded Strand , trailing a checked sleeping bag behind her .
Sitting by the window of a coffee bar , Linda Stout - Turner looks out and recognises the sleeping bag .
" There you are , there goes my sleeping bag .
That was mine , you can't hang on to anything , and you certainly can't go demanding it back .
It makes me furious . "
With her mobile phone , clean , pressed jumper and trousers , and carefully applied make - up , Stout - Turner , a sales executive and mother - of - two , merges into the noisy , busy cafe like any other customer - but she has n't got the money to buy a cup of water .
It 's only when the workers and shoppers have gone home , and the pavements empty and darken , that the 52 - year - old stands out , as much a homeless woman as the lady dragging the sleeping bag .
She had a house , a rented four - bedroom home in Epping , Essex , where she parked her sleek car after a day spent meeting her £ 3 m sales targets .
Now she beds down in a night shelter off Trafalgar Square , on a narrow army cot in a large room of strangers that smells of unwashed bodies , dirty clothes , urine and stale alcohol .
She is woken at 6.30 am , folds away the bed and has an hour to wash in the hostel showers and dress before the hostel closes and she is out on the street again until 10 pm .
" I keep myself busy .
I have been out for long walks and I go to the library and use the computer to upload and redo my CV .
I do the rounds of the recruitment agencies , trying to get myself known .
I have set myself a target of applying for three jobs a day . "
Stout - Turner has had no home to go to for nearly a month , part of a growing phenomenon changing the picture of Britain 's homeless .
Charities and homeless agencies are reporting a huge rise in the numbers of once - successful high - earners approaching them as the economic recession begins to strip away jobs , homes and relationships .
Unlike the majority of people traditionally at risk of ending up on the streets , Stout - Turner is not running away from anyone , she has no mental illness or substance abuse problems .
But when it all went wrong it happened so fast that she still has trouble taking it in .
It began before Christmas , when her rented house had to be sold quickly by her landlord and at the same time she was made redundant .
" I was out of a home , so I decided I 'd move to London and do a business course while taking agency work .
I was absolutely confident that I would have no problem getting work . "
Several flats she was looking to rent fell through , the course was delayed , the agency work dried up , and finally , while staying in a hotel , she was robbed .
" I had nowhere to go and the police directed me to the hostel .
It all happened so fast : 25 years of work ripped away with nothing to show for it .
They say you are two pay packets away from the streets ; well , it 's true . "
Stout - Turner is clinging to the vestiges of her former , solvent , self .
But the slightly unkempt hair and tired eyes show the strain .
" I would never have thought someone like me could have reached this position .
The streets are no place for a woman , it 's so dangerous out there .
Violence is a worry at the hostel , too , but you can't dwell on it .
There 's a lot of paranoia from the people there .
They thought I was an undercover cop at first ; now they call me Lady Linda .
I have n't slept at all the past couple of nights as it's a bit rowdy at times , people have nightmares or screaming fits .
There was a stabbing a few night ago .
I have got to the point of exhaustion .
I think that 's why a lot of them drink as much as they do , just to knock themselves out .
My sleeping bag and gloves being stolen made me furious .
One woman had her socks and shoes stolen off her feet while she slept .
" I have met a lot of people you would not expect to meet in such a situation : young people , students .
One girl I met the other day was a violin student at Goldsmiths .
She had her violin stolen .
I know a lot of my former colleagues in multinational companies would find this devastating .
But I 'll get myself out of this . "
Her two teenage children are living with her ex-husband and studying for exams and she has kept her predicament from them .
" It 's the same story with a lot of us - it 's the shame barrier .
It 's not until you get close to the edge of the whirlpool that you realise how easily you get sucked in . "
It 's a familiar story to Maff Potts .
He lost his job with an insurance company and remembers vividly how quickly he lost self - esteem and motivation , finally ending up on the streets .
With help , he was able to pick himself up and went on to run a hostel regeneration project for the government , and is now the new director of homelessness in the UK for the Salvation Army .
" Of course , it 's a worrying time : utility bills are going up and charitable giving is going down .
" We are seeing a lot more requests for food and clothes parcels , but we are expecting to see the real effect of the recession in about a year .
It 's like there is the top of the cliff and there is the bottom and at the moment a lot of people are clinging on to the top by their fingernails .
I 'll expect to see them at the bottom in 12 months .
" The single biggest reason for homelessness is relationship breakdown and the stress of things at the moment will be starting that process off for a lot of people .
The stereotype of the homeless , the old man of the road , the entrenched drinker with a dog on a string , is changing .
It 's not a class issue at all : middle - class people are just as vulnerable . "
Many of the people the Observer spoke to at shelters and day centres around London whose stories fitted into this mould were too embarrassed to be named , or to discuss their situations but we talked to businessmen , a nurse , a carpenter , a florist and a farmer .
All talked of the speed at which things fell apart for them and of a similar pattern - job loss bringing a reliance on credit , followed by inability to pay their debts , rents or mortgages .
The nurse could no longer face going to work after being caught bedding down in the clinic when she was evicted from a flat the landlord had failed to pay the mortgage on .
The picture is the same across the UK .
In Brighton , Dawn Devaney , advice manager at the Brighton Housing Trust , told of helping a stockbroker who had been sleeping on the beach .
" Since Christmas , we have been very , very busy .
We are seeing a huge increase in people whose world has just been suddenly destroyed and they 're in shock .
The advice sector is certainly stretched .
We 're not crumbling , but we are seeing a massive increase in demand .
And for a lot of single people there is no legal requirement for the local authority to help them , or even see them as homeless .
" We are seeing a lot more people who earned very high wages but their outgoings were high too so they are in problems very quickly if they lose their job .
We just had a property developer who employed 37 people in .
These type of people do n't know where to turn , they are not used to claiming benefits and many leave it until it 's too late .
I would tell people there is help out there . "
Nikki Homewood , director of homelessness and complex needs at the trust , agreed .
" Homelessness rarely comes on its own ; issues such as mental illness , substance abuse and personality disorders often come too and most homeless services are set up for people with support needs .
But now we are seeing a very different type of client , people who have been working and earning high salaries , highly skilled , professional people , in a state of shock at just how fast things have gone downhill for them ; jobs , relationships and homes all gone in a matter of months .
" They have been made redundant , expected to find new jobs which have not materialised and have maxed out credit cards to pay for rent and food .
A high proportion have no understanding about benefits and feel a great loss of pride in walking into a job centre or day centre , and perhaps even have prejudices against homeless people .
Some of them wo n't meet the criteria to get access to a hostel place because they do n't have complex needs , " she said .
" What is also becoming more common is people in private rented accommodation unaware their landlord is not keeping up mortgage payments until a bailiff 's letter turns up .
" Places such as Brighton and Hove do have a significant homelessness problem but we also co-ordinate our services well across the city and have been achieving much better results , probably in a way that a large city like London cannot . "
Certainly , services in London can be difficult to access without assistance and it can take a long time to find the right help .
Agencies and charities will have to rethink how to best provide help for a different type of homeless person .
For some who were living fulfilled and successful lives before being tripped up by job loss or debt , hitting financial rock bottom is what makes them vulnerable to mental illness or a drug or drink problem rather than the process working the other way around . "
In England and Wales , a person is not entitled to accommodation unless deemed to be " vulnerable " , so single homeless people have less incentive to apply .
In Scotland , they are entitled to temporary accommodation and , from 2012 , will be entitled to permanent accommodation .
Hostels like the one run by The Connection at St Martin's , where Linda Stout - Turner has found a bed , are already pushed to cope .
Demand is rising just as charitable donations are falling .
" We are seeing a drop in donations , especially from the corporate sector , although individuals ' donations are holding up so far .
It 's a downward spiral of seeing more and more people just as we are able to do less and less for them , " said Clive Glover , chief executive of The Connection at St Martin's .
" Homelessness does n't quite reflect society as a whole , although we have had BBC producers and professional people .
The causes of homelessness are incredibly varied : randomly bad things happen to individuals and some people will have support networks to fall back on and have more options than others .
But it will always get worse when unemployment and poverty rises .
" Our numbers have gone up but we do n't know yet if all the homelessness charities are seeing a similar rise .
The problem with this recession is that there are so very few preventative services , so agencies like mine are really the ambulance service ; we pick people up rather than catch them on the way down .
At the worst , we can even add to the problem rather than solve it by bringing people into a culture of homelessness that it is tremendously difficult to break out of . "
Gripped by that kind of helplessness , construction worker Phil Jacobs cannot see a way off the concrete streets he beds down on as soon as the daytime shift of shop and office workers has gone home .
After losing his job , flat and girlfriend in the space of two weeks , he is sharing a regular doorway across from Covent Garden 's extravagantly expensive five - star St Martins Lane hotel , with Andy , 26 .
He earned £ 24,000 a year as a nightclub manager in Northampton .
His mother is a psychiatrist and his father a marine engineer .
When the club went bust , Andy came to London to look for similar work but swiftly found himself on the streets as his money ran out and no job materialised .
" I had a good lifestyle .
My landlord went under and I had a couple of grand in loans and credit cards and you run out of money .
You use up all the favours from your mates and then you can't go home and it just happens . "
His trainers still look clean and trendy , and he is waiting for an interview for a place in a night shelter .
Time is still on his side but only just .
For Linda Stout - Turner , the wheels are turning very slowly but she knows she is lucky to have a hostel place at all .
" I have only been at St Martin 's for a couple of weeks but already the queues outside are getting longer .
The number of new faces is becoming greater .
Some will cope and some wo n't .
I will be OK , I know I will .
I will get my own place and then I will look back on all this and see it for the bad dream it is . "
Living on the street
• Under the 2002 Homelessness Act , all households in England and Wales that are officially recognised as homeless are entitled to advice and support from their local authority .
However , a household is entitled to accommodation only if the local authority is satisfied that the applicant is eligible for assistance , unintentionally homeless and in priority need .
• Crisis has estimated that there are about 400,000 " hidden homeless " people , a category that includes all those who satisfy the legal definition of homelessness , but have not been provided with accommodation .
• In the last three months of 2008 , local authorities in England accepted 12,070 people or family groups as being owed suitable accommodation .
• 4 % of these acceptances were in cases where homelessness resulted from mortgage arrears .
There has been a steady increase in the proportion of such acceptances since 2003 .
• According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders , there were 40,000 repossessions in 2008 ( 2007 : 7,100 ) .
• Research by the homelessness charity Shelter predicts that the recent collapse in house building will mean a total housing shortfall in England of almost 1 million by 2020 .
• According to the most recent local authority street counts , 483 people are sleeping rough in England a night .
• Nationally , there are 187 day centres serving an estimated 10,000 people experiencing or at risk of homelessness every day .

( CNN ) --
The four Doctors Without Borders staffers abducted earlier this week in Sudan 's Darfur region have been " safely released , " the group said on Saturday .
Members of the humanitarian group Medecins San Frontieres are greeted at the airport after their release .
Canadian nurse Laura Archer , Italian doctor Mauro D'Ascanio , French coordinator Raphael Meunier and Sudanese watchman Sharif Mohamadin were abducted Wednesday .
They appeared Saturday on Sudanese TV following their release , and the TV news said they had arrived in the city of El - Fasher .
They " appear to be OK " and were headed to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum , the aid group said .
Five people were taken in Serif Umra in north Darfur .
However , one of them , a Sudanese staffer , was freed earlier .
The four work for the Belgian section of Doctors Without Borders , also known as Medicins Sans Frontieres .
" We are incredibly relieved that our colleagues are safe and in good health , " said Christopher Stokes , general director of the Belgian section of MSF .
After the abductions the group evacuated virtually all of its international staff from Darfur projects , and Sudanese staffers were relocated .
A small team stayed " to secure the release of the kidnapped staff , " Doctors Without Borders said .
Stokes stressed the group 's outrage over the abductions and said the act illustrates greater dangers for aid workers in Darfur , in western Sudan .
" It is a gross violation of everything that we stand for , " Stokes said .
" Kidnapping of humanitarian workers jeopardizes humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable .
Our independent medical work must be respected if we are to continue working in conflict areas to save the lives of those who suffer most . "
Sudan last week ordered 13 major aid groups to leave the country after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al - Bashir , accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Two of MSF 's sections working in Darfur -- one run by the Dutch and one run by the French -- were among those ordered out .
MSF helps people " threatened by violence , neglect , or catastrophe " in more than 60 countries .
The United Nations on Wednesday announced the start of a joint U.N. - Sudanese government mission " to evaluate the need for food , water , health and emergency shelter in Darfur " amid the expulsions of the groups , which are believed to have assisted about 4.7 million people .
The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have died in Darfur , where government forces and Arab militia allies have been fighting rebels .
People have died " either through direct combat or because of disease , malnutrition or reduced life expectancy . "
About 3 million people have been displaced since 2003 , the U.N. says .

Inhalers make way for GPS
Thanks to David Van Sickle , we ’ll soon be able to track ( and hopefully eliminate ) recurring asthma attack outbreaks .
Sickle , a scholar in the Department of Population Health Sciences at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , is working with students in the biomedical engineering program to create an asthma inhaler with a built - in GPS receiver .
The project is still in its early stages , but David ’s goal is to eventually map out danger zones that could be life - threatening to those stricken with the lung disease .
He already has it all mapped out : “ rescue inhalers ” will pinpoint the location of each asthmatic attack and cross-reference it with other devices , attempting to detect new locations and trends that previously flew under the radar undetected by asthma researchers .
Sickle envisions a time when his technology can help researchers discover exactly why people suffer from asthma .
“ It will allow us to better target public - health interventions to the places and times when people are really suffering , ” Sickle said .

No garden would be complete without its own natural recycling system , a compost pile .
Without a way of dealing with compost , weeds and scraps are waste .
But why create more trash when you can turn your garden and kitchen waste into valuable soil - building fertilizer ?
One of the first steps to starting an organic garden should be to begin a compost pile .
Composting will break down organic matter into nutrient - rich material that builds soil and nourishes plants .
And just like anyone can garden , no matter their situation , there are composting possibilities for everyone !
Read on to learn how to close the loop and start composting …
Possible Composting Methods
A big outdoor compost heap or bin .
If you have the space in your garden or yard , a large compost heap is the best way to make the most of all your organic matter waste and fertilize a large garden .
Your compost pile can be as simple as a loose heap in a sheltered area of the yard , or as fancy as a pre-made tumbling bin .
For my garden , I created a simple 3 - sided structure ( pictured above ) along the fence using free shipping pallets held up by rebar posts that were pounded into the ground .
A compost pile should be at least 3 ′ x 3 ′ x 3 ′ to break down the organic matter well .
It ’s best to allow it to breathe , and you ’ll need to be able to easily access it to stir your compost every so often to keep it going .
You can find bin construction instructions and ideas here .

A worm bin for vermicomposting .
The idea of keeping a bin of worms to eat garbage freaked me out at first , but now that I ’ve harvested a few rounds of rich worm castings and seen the results , I ’m a big believer in worm power .
You can build your own worm bin or buy a ready - made stacking bin ( I ’ve had great results with the Can o’ Worms ) .
Worm composting can be scaled to your available space , so it ’s great for keeping in a garage , deck , or even in the kitchen .
I use both a worm bin and a garden compost pile because my worm bin can only digest so much , so I only give the worms kitchen scraps .
Some worms often do n’t like things like onions , citrus , and hot peppers , so those can go in the compost pile .

Small - scale container composting .
Bokashi , or bucket composting , is a high - speed and scalable composting method developed in Japan .
This is ideal for apartment - dwellers or for generating compost quickly .
It uses special microbes to speed up the composting process .

Collective composting .
Some municipalities will collect yard waste for composting much like they collect recycling and trash .
This is an option if you have no room to compost or no use for compost .
Alternatively , you could organize a collective compost pile for your apartment complex , neighborhood , or community garden .
Once you have chosen the best composting method for your needs and lifestyle , you can learn how to build a composting set - up and start turning your veggie scraps and weeds into valuable garden fertilizer .
But before you start , here are a few tips and reminders …
Composting Guidelines
Layer your pile .
If you ’re building a large compost pile , you ’ll want to layer it with alternating layers of “ green ” and “ brown ” organic matter .
It helps to throw some soil , manure , or completed compost on top to get the microbes working .
I like to put woodier things like dead plant stalks on the bottom and layer veggie scraps , weeds , and dead leaves on top .
The amounts of the various types of organic matter will determine how long your compost takes to decompose .

Know what to compost and what not to .
Before you throw just any organic matter into your bin , make sure you research what your bin can handle .
For instance , worms do n’t seem to like citrus ( too acidic ) or anything too spicy , but they love coffee grounds .
Keep meat and dairy products out of compost piles , as they can go rancid and also attract critters , though eggshells are ok .
And large pieces of wood or sticks may take a long time to break down , so they ’re best left out of the compost bin .

Let it breathe .
For most compost bins , the organic matter needs a way to get oxygen so that it can break down ( the exception to this is a Bokashi system , since it uses unique microbes that do n’t need oxygen ) .
Worm bins usually have ventilation holes , and allowing some air to get into your compost bin or container helps for this .
My compost container is only 3 - sided and air can get in through the slats in the pallets that are used for walls .

Keep it moist .
Compost needs moisture to aid in decomposition .
I water my compost pile a little bit every time I water the garden .
It does n’t like to be soaked though , so in the rainy season you may want to put a tarp over the pile or bin .

Turn it occasionally .
How often you turn your compost pile depends on how fast everything is breaking down .
Normally the center of a compost pile will be warm .
Once the heat starts dying down , you can stir or turn it with a garden fork to get the decomposition going again .
Stirring your pile every few weeks can help it decompose faster .

Multiple piles for a constant supply .
If you keep adding kitchen scraps to a compost pile , each addition will be at varying stages of decay .
This can make it difficult to know when to harvest finished compost .
It may help to start a big pile in the spring , then let it sit ( stirring occasionally ) and start a new one to add new waste to .
This way you always have compost in the works .
With vermicomposting , you can keep adding and harvest a layer of the bin , moving the worms to a new layer .
With container composting , usually the turn - around time for compost is pretty quick , but multiple containers ca n’t hurt .
Compost is an artform that ’s best learned through practice .
Everyone has different methods , which you ’ll learn as you experiment .
Composting is simple , inexpensive , and very eco-friendly .
It ’s recycling you can do right at home !
You may be amazed at how little ends up in the trash can once you start composting , and instead of filling the landfill , you can turn waste into delicious home - grown produce !
I ’ll share more on how to start a garden in upcoming articles , so stay tuned and find out how my garden grows .

A court psychiatrist yesterday described how Josef Fritzl had locked up his daughter as a way of compensating for a loveless childhood as she detailed his troubled relationship with his mother .
Adelheid Kastner told the court in St Polten that Fritzl was a dangerous man and recommended his transfer to a psychiatric institute for intensive therapy for a serious personality disorder .
She said if it was left untreated even at his advanced age , Fritzl could go on to commit other crimes so great was his " need to dominate and control other people " .
Kastner said Fritzl had developed strategies to learn to cope with life , including " pushing his feelings into the cellar of his soul " .
She said there was " much of the volcano about him , " explaining that violent sex had provided the main outlet for his pent - up feelings .
She said he had told her : " I was born to rape " .
In an hour - long testimony to the court , based on extensive interviews she carried out with Fritzl last year , Kastner said that his behaviour had its roots in his troubled childhood , describing a mother who did not love him , who left him to cry when he was in pain , who regularly beat him and left him on his own for hours at a time .
" Herr Fritzl spent most of his childhood in a severe state of anxiety , " she said .
She described how his mother Maria , who herself had been fostered as a child , had had him " solely in order to prove to the world that she was not infertile " following a marriage which broke up because it produced no children .
" Herr Fritzl was a ' proof child ' , an ' alibi child ' , " she said , adding that this " was his only function as a child " .
" As a consequence he was a burden to her , something she was forced to look after " .
She said that Fritzl , now 73 , struggled throughout his childhood to form a relationship with his mother but that " it was impossible to build up any sort of bond of trust with her " .
The fear he felt by her constant absences was never more intense than during the second world war bombing raids on their home town of Amstetten .
She refused to take refuge in the air raid shelter near to the family home , insisting on staying in the house and sending her son into the underground shelter instead .
" As a result he suffered from an overwhelming sense of anxiety , not knowing when the air raid was over whether or not the only person in the world to whom he had any relationship , would still be alive , " she said .
" It 's the type of fear that over time has a huge impact on a person " .
She described how his mother ignored his screams when , as a young boy he suffered from the extremely painful , but easily treatable condition of phimosis , or a tight foreskin .
Only the intervention of a neighbour prompted her to take him to see a doctor .
Fritzl listened attentively as Kastner delivered the in - depth psychiatric analysis of his character to the court .
But at times he appeared nervous , twisting his fingers and his left foot , while glancing at the floor .
His decision to lock up his daughter stemmed from a need to compensate for the years during which his mother dominated him .
" He developed an overwhelming desire to exert power - to dominate , control and possess another person .
These were fantasies that grew and grew and which he managed to realise " .
She said one reason as to why he chose Elisabeth , his fourth of seven children , was because of her resistance .
" If you conquer someone you consider strong and stubborn , the effect is all the more gratifying " .
He told her he had chosen Elisabeth " because she was most like me , as strong as me , as stubborn as me " .
She said that the more incestuous children he had with her , the more powerful he felt .
" The more children , the more power he had over his victim " .
She said Fritzl was able to separate his two lives - the family he kept downstairs , and his official upstairs family .
" When I asked him how he was able to lead a double life , he said it was very simple .
' As soon as I went upstairs the downstairs family did n't exist any more ' . "
But he told her that when he woke up in the mornings he was flooded with feelings of guilt , " realising that he was breaking every rule in the book " .
The news that we used waterboarding a total of 266 times on two terror suspects has rocked the country .
C.I.A. interrogators used waterboarding , the near - drowning technique that top Obama administration officials have described as illegal torture , 266 times on two key prisoners from Al Qaeda , far more than had been previously reported .
MSNBC 's military analyst retired Col. Jack Jacobs said that it was an astounding number .
Norah :
Are you surprised by the number , two hundred and sixty six time on two terrorism suspects ?
Jacobs :
It 's kind of astounding is n't it ?
You think after one or two times it did n't work , you would n't keep trying .
Clearly , if you 're doing it that many times it should be obvious to the casual observer that the technique is not working .
Usually the information that you can get that 's useful , you can get with very easy techniques .
I 've been in combat plenty of times , captured lots of bad guys and invariably got lots of information out of them using cigarettes , medical care and food .
Most of the stuff that you 're going to get when you give people a bad time , most of it is going to be information that they 're going to give just to shut you up or to get you to stop doing what you 're doing to them .
The colonel did n't want President Obama to release the CIA memos , but his take on torture is right on .
It should be obvious , but it was n't and that 's often the case when new powers are bestowed on people with power .
And that 's why Judge Bybee should be impeached .

Troubled insurance giant AIG , already under fire for intending to pay out $ 165 million in bonuses and compensation , succumbed Sunday to congressional pressure , identifying banks that received chunks of the company ’s billions in federal bailout funds last year .
AIG , a recipient of at least $ 170 billion in federal bailout money , got an $ 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve .
[ efoods ]
The list released Sunday of " counterparties " that benefited from the bailout is topped by European banks Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank , which received $ 4.1 billion and $ 2.6 billion , respectively .
Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch round out the top four , receiving $ 2.5 billion and $ 1.8 billion , respectively .
In releasing the list , AIG said it " recognizes the importance of upholding a high degree of transparency with respect to the use of public funds , " in a statement .
Lawmakers have been pushing for AIG to release a list of its counterparties since last fall , arguing taxpayers have a right to know how federal aid is being used .
Earlier this month , in reference to lawmakers request for a list of AIG ’s counterparties , U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - New York , told CNNMoney it was critical to determine whether AIG ’s collapse would have resulted in a market catastrophe .

S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats
If a big part of an investor ’s returns are the dividends that companies distribute every quarter , would n’t it make sense if we invest in companies that increase their dividends each year ?
There are certainly many ways to do this , but one way is to invest with the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats .
Basically , the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats represent companies ( ones that are apart of the S&P 500 ) that have increased their dividends consistently for at least the last 25 years .
To make tracking easier , Standard & Poors published a S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for us to keep track and also invest in .
The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index
The Aristocrats Index is an equally weighted index that is re-weighted every quarter .
Also , all companies are reviewed annually to make sure :
The companies in the index have increased their dividends

What the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Mean For Us
Investing in these companies are a great way to invest in solid companies with a great track record .
In fact , the performance of this index have been proven to outperform the S&P 500 and be less volatile at the same time .
However , it ’s not hard to see that 2008 ( and so far in 2009 ) have n’t been a good one for this index .
Just because it outperforms the S&P 500 does n’t mean it will make you money .

Every Saturday , Cracked lets someone from another website do the update for us .
They get to show off their stuff to our fans , and we get to be lazy while someone else does our job for us .
In the latest example of our convenient selflessness , former Cracked writer Matt Wilson of the International Society of Supervillains pleads his case for some of the more sympathetic supervillains .

6 Doctor Octopus Continue Reading Below Advertisement Origin and M.O. Otto Octavius uses the four mechanical arms that were accidentally fused to his body in an experiment gone wrong to commit crimes and generally make life difficult for Spider - Man .
He also , oddly enough , almost married Spider - Man 's Aunt May .
Awkward .
Spider - Man was invited .
This is just how he likes to attend weddings .
Why He 's Not So Bad
In two words : brain damage .
See , Otto was just a regular old misanthropic mama 's boy who did n't really want to hurt anybody prior to his accident .
But as fans of every comic book ever know , radiation has a tendency to angry up the blood , and he went into full - on supervillain mode afterward , unmasking Spider - Man and waddling into various banks to rob them .
So , really , to blame him for his crimes is sort of like blaming a blind kid for walking into shit .

In the movie , it 's not even
Otto that 's the problem , it 's his four mechanical arms leading him around by the torso , randomly killing doctors and taking over abandoned clock towers ( presumably out of envy for the width and girth of tower clock 's mechanical arms ) .
But Then Again Even radiation - induced mental illness cannot explain those glasses or that haircut .
5 Mr. Freeze Origin and M.O. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Victor Fries was a scientist working on cryogenics research when his wife , Nora , fell ill .
He found a way to preserve her body , but his boss did n't like him using company resources for personal use , so he tried to put a stop to all this " keeping my wife alive " bullshit .
When Fries tried to fight back , the boss kicked him into a vat of chemicals , greatly lowering his body temperature .
Rather than taking a hot shower and suing his dickhead boss , Fries decided to go with this whole cold thing , living out the rest of his days in a cumbersome refrigerator suit and freezing shit with a ray gun .
Why He 's Not So Bad Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Because his motive is love .
Everything Mr. Freeze does , he does it for Nora .
And like Bryan Adams says , it 's OK to fight , lie , die or even walk the wire for someone , as long as it's for love .
" Shoot people with freeze rays " sounds at least as excusable as walking the wire .
But Then Again
Photos purporting to show prisoner abuse in Iraq were published in 2004
The Pentagon is about to release " hundreds " of photographs showing the alleged abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan , US officials say .
The alleged abuses by US personnel are said to relate to President George W Bush 's time in office .
The photos are being made public in response to a Freedom of Information lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) five years ago .
The court order had been contested by the Bush administration .
The US defence department said the Pentagon had agreed to release a " substantial " number of previously unseen photographs by May 28 .
" I think it will be in the hundreds , " added a Pentagon official , who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity .
' Visual proof '
The images relate to around 60 criminal investigations of US military personnel suspected of abusing detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2001 to 2006 .
The ACLU says the photos show that the much - publicised abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq amounted to a specific policy .
" These photographs provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by US personnel was not aberrational but widespread , reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib , " said ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh .
But a Pentagon spokesman downplayed allegations of widespread abuse , saying it had acted swiftly to discipline some 400 personnel found to be involved in abuses .
The release of the photos will increase pressure on the Obama administration to consider prosecuting Bush - era officials for alleged complicity in torture and maltreatment of terrorist suspects , says the BBC's North America Editor Justin Webb .
It follows the publication last week by the Obama administration of four sensitive memos outlining harsh interrogation techniques approved for use by the CIA by the Bush government .
Rights groups have called for CIA personnel involved in any torture cases to be prosecuted , while critics say the move would endanger national security .
Cambridge - based researchers provide new evidence that the human brain lives “ on the edge of chaos ” , at a critical transition point between randomness and order .
The study , published March 20 in the open- access journal PLoS Computational Biology , provides experimental data on an idea previously fraught with theoretical speculation .
Self - organized criticality ( where systems spontaneously organize themselves to operate at a critical point between order and randomness ) , can emerge from complex interactions in many different physical systems , including avalanches , forest fires , earthquakes , and heartbeat rhythms .
According to this study , conducted by a team from the University of Cambridge , the Medical Research Council Cognition & Brain Sciences Unit , and the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Unit Cambridge , the dynamics of human brain networks have something important in common with some superficially very different systems in nature .
Computational networks showing these characteristics have also been shown to have optimal memory ( data storage ) and information - processing capacity .
In particular , critical systems are able to respond very rapidly and extensively to minor changes in their inputs .
“ Due to these characteristics , self - organized criticality is intuitively attractive as a model for brain functions such as perception and action , because it would allow us to switch quickly between mental states in order to respond to changing environmental conditions , ” says co-author Manfred Kitzbichler .
The researchers used state - of - the - art brain imaging techniques to measure dynamic changes in the synchronization of activity between different regions of the functional network in the human brain .
Their results suggest that the brain operates in a self - organized critical state .
To support this conclusion , they also investigated the synchronization of activity in computational models , and demonstrated that the dynamic profile they had found in the brain was exactly reflected in the models .
Collectively , these results amount to strong evidence in favour of the idea that human brain dynamics exist at a critical point on the edge of chaos .
According to Kitzbichler , this new evidence is only a starting point .
“ A natural next question we plan to address in future research will be : How do measures of critical dynamics relate to cognitive performance or neuropsychiatric disorders and their treatments ? ”

GLAMOUR : Still , you 've come into your own .
In a recent interview you said , " I 'm a bit wiser . "
How ?
KATIE HOLMES :
Well , becoming a mother has been the most amazing experience — in an instant you become strong .
You have to be a little bit wiser ; it 's the most important job in the world .
GLAMOUR : Did it scare you at all ?
The responsibility ?
KATIE HOLMES : Of course .
During the first couple of days [ with Suri ] , we would just sleep right next to her to make sure she was breathing .
And I was constantly learning on the job , but Tom was very helpful and supportive .
GLAMOUR : You are very protective of your family .
You 've said a couple of times [ in response to various rumors about her relationship with Cruise , a practicing Scientologist , and speculation that Suri did n't exist ] that all of the gossip is " not OK . "
KATIE HOLMES : Some of the stuff [ people said ] was such absolutely horrible things to say about a child .
It was so uncalled for and so disgusting .
Enough is enough .
GLAMOUR : Did Tom ever say , " Do n't worry about it " [ since he was more used to media scrutiny ] ?
KATIE HOLMES : Yes .
We were changing diapers .
He said , " I do n't want you to get upset . "
And I said , " Well , I am upset . "
So we approached it together .
But I definitely felt like — as a woman , as the mother of Suri — I want to handle this !
My mom is very strong , and if anyone ever said anything about any of us , she would be , " Excuse me ?
That 's my family ! "
GLAMOUR : As you know , the rumor right now is that you are pregnant !
KATIE HOLMES : Well , I 'm not pregnant right now .
GLAMOUR : The people who print stuff like that …if you could say something to them , what would it be ?
KATIE HOLMES : Sometimes I think I would say , " Why do n't you come over and have dinner ?
See what there is to see . "
GLAMOUR : And what would they see ?
What 's a day in the life of Katie , Tom and Suri ?
KATIE HOLMES : We 're all together .
We like to be together , so we use the house for our [ business ] meetings .
[ We ] play Yahtzee , board games , Scrabble .
We grill ; have pool parties .
We play " The Three Little Pigs " and Suri is the Big Bad Wolf .
[ Tom ] reads storybooks to Suri , and we all laugh .
When a good song comes on , he 'll break out in a dance .
We 'll watch movies in bed — recently Madagascar and Cinderella , for Suri .
We really have a good time .
GLAMOUR : Who cooks ?
You or Tom ?
KATIE HOLMES : I do n't really cook that much — eventually I will .
I do make cupcakes .
And [ Tom ] makes his pasta carbonara for me .
He knows exactly how to do it : a pinch of this , a pinch of that .
He has a recipe , but he also kind of [ improvises ] by himself .
You have to do the egg at a certain time .
He did it once when we were camping .
GLAMOUR : The media's had this perception that you were going to be overwhelmed by Tom 's life .
Did you ever think that perception was off or did you just not pay attention to it ?
KATIE HOLMES : From an early age I knew that I wanted to be in this business .
So I did everything I could to get here , and when I met Tom , I knew in an instant that we were going to be together , that we were going to get married .
He does have a very big life .
And you know , we just do it .
And , as a woman , you make that transition from being single to [ being ] a partner .
I have a teammate , and it's like , we 're going to make this work .
March 25 , 2009  -- North Dakota is in a race against time as residents try to shore up huge sandbag levees ahead of massive flooding expected to hit this weekend .
Forecasters predict the Red River 's waters will crest at 41 feet by early Saturday , exceeding record levels set in 1997 .
Along the river , residents engaged in a frantic battle against the fast - rising water and bitter cold .
Water reached 35.6 feet in Fargo by midday Wednesday , according to the National Weather Service .
City officials said they 'll add another foot to the dikes -- already 42 feet high -- in an effort to withstand the river 's crest .
Mayor Dennis Walaker said the city is bracing for the worst .
" We 're talking about levels never reached before by any stretch of the imagination , " he said .
A 41 - foot crest in Fargo would be two feet higher than the record level of 39.6 in April 1997 , when the area was struck by one of the largest and costliest floods in U.S. history .
President Obama has already declared the state a federal disaster area .
Downstream from Fargo in Oxbow , the Missouri River showed its muscle when icy floods burst levees and swallowed homes .
Rescuers in airboats pulled stranded residents to safety .
" It was terrifying , " said one resident who was rescued by officials today .
" The water was n't that deep this morning and we woke up , we got to the window … and there was the river ... just right there . "
In Bismarck , demolition crews used explosives to blast through an ice jam in the Missouri River , whose waters threatened low - lying regions of the city .
Blizzard conditions and more than 8 inches of snow heightened the alert , where about 1,700 residents were forced to evacuate .
In Fargo , where three swollen rivers converge , it 's been all hands on deck .
Thousands of volunteers from across the state worked around the clock , building a 12 - mile fortress of millions of sandbags to hold back the water Wednesday .
" The water 's coming up , the snow 's coming down , the rain is coming down … it 's crazy , " said Eric Lorenz , a sandbag volunteer , who waded through six inches of snow .
Volunteers Scramble With 48 Hours Left to Sandbag
Local universities and high schools cancelled classes to lend manpower to the city for the sandbagging effort .
" They 're in need of students and anyone else who can work , " said Karl Underdahl , a college student .
" We 're here working . "
Volunteers who descended to build walls on Fargo resident Ilene Lee 's riverfront back yard were greeted with pork sandwiches and tortilla soup .
" We hope by feeding them good , they 'll come back here and work hard , " Lee told ABC News .
Capt .
Dave Todd of the Fargo Police Department worries plunging temperatures could compromise the sandbags ' effectiveness , which the city is counting on .
" If we leave them sitting outside for too long , they become like blocks of concrete and they 're hard to work with , and they do n't really work for flood protection at that point , " Todd said .
Fargo residents have 48 hours to add a foot to the wall of sandbags surrounding the city , giving the city minimal time to prepare .
In case the walls do n't hold , officials have discussed and will distribute evacuation plans to resident on Thursday .

Schumer backs same - sex marriage
Chuck Schumer reportedly told gay supporters last night that he now supports same - sex marriage — a 180 - degree reversal , and an important moment in the marriage fight .
It 's a big deal because it represents support for same - sex marraige moving toward becoming the default , mainstream position of the Democratic Party .
Schumer 's a New York senator , but he's also always been extremely careful to protect his right flank on issues like crime and gay rights .
His statement :
It ’s time .
Equality is something that has always been a hallmark of America , and no group should be deprived of it .
New York , which has always been at the forefront on issues of equality , is appropriately poised to take a lead on this issue .
ALSO : The Empire State Pride Agenda's Alan Van Capelle gets out the first statement on the shift :
Note that Ms Marcotte is quite insistent on this point .
The inclination to reproduce simply is a cultural construct , and a dubious one at that .
Why humans should apparently be unique in this regard , untouched by biology , is n’t entirely clear .
Presumably , human beings - specifically human men - have constructed elaborate patterns of behaviour to mimic almost exactly biological inclinations that are felt as real , by men and women , but which do n’t in fact exist .
The theory that women have a natural urge to have babies is one that ’s got a long and ignoble sexist history , [...]
None of that is to say that the urge to have children that some ( but far from all ) women experience is n’t real , and that ’s my other giant problem with the ongoing preoccupation with [ evolutionary psychology ] theories to explain things that are cultural constructs …
With the above in mind , let ’s turn our attention to the feminist commentator Amanda Marcotte , whose book cover mishap entertained us so .
In a recent outpouring , Ms Marcotte offered this :
If a person ’s tastes and disposition are primarily socially constructed , that person can also , presumably , be remade to suit society and its representatives .
Such high - minded Agents of Society might even become “ engineers of the human soul , ” to borrow Stalin ’s phrase .
I ’ve touched on some problems of social construct theory before , more than once , and noted that its implications could appeal to unsavoury motives :
That something is a cultural construct does n’t make it less real , it just means that it ’s more changeable .
This seems like a small distinction , but it ’s an important one .
I am routinely accused by evo psych fans of denying that men and women are different .
I do think there are major culturally constructed differences , and I think most of them exist to demean and oppress women and should be changed in the culture .
That ’s not to say that they are n’t real , but just that they ’re changeable .
She continues ,
To which , Protein Wisdom ’s Darleen Click not unreasonably replies :
Interestingly , nowhere would [ Marcotte ] state something so positively about homosexuality or transgenderism … no , those are n’t subject to change at all , no social construct there .
As a PW reader points out ,
So , the urge / feeling / inclination / whatever to bear offspring - ultimately the fundamental biological goal of any species - is a social construct , while “ gender identity ” , sexual orientation , and other politicized issues are as unchanging and fixed as the heavens .
Another reader notes ,
So a woman acting like a woman is a cultural construct , but a woman acting like a man is biologically preordained .
Jeff Goldstein adds the following :
Social construct theorists like Amanda are often trapped by inconsistencies in their own arguments , which … are often selectively applied , and based , conveniently , on the specific ethical frame of those who would deny biology or essentialism in favor of an explanation for human action that is always necessarily about power relations and the construction of perceptions that act as if they were biological imperatives .
Deconstructing - and so reconceptualizing - the “ social construct ” that Amanda suggests was built up by patriarchal forces to trick women into thinking the desire to procreate and “ mother ” is a biological imperative is , to her way of thinking , good .
Reconceptualizing the “ social construct ” that tricks homosexuals or the transgendered into thinking that their behavior is biologically driven , on the other hand , is , conversely , reductive , evil , and Christianist .
In short , she wants to have it both ways - and she wants this precisely because it puts her in charge of deciding for everyone else what is right and what is wrong , socially speaking .
Update , via the comments :
Undaunted by the concerns above , Ms Marcotte rumbles on :
The myth of the biological clock is , for instance , an attempt to preserve a cultural construct that makes motherhood an obligation instead of a choice , for no other reason than the fear that if some women choose not to have children , we ’d have to redefine women away from their roles and closer to how we define men , which is as complete individuals .
Note the pile of assumptions in just that one sentence .
An unspecified “ cultural construct ” somehow makes motherhood “ an obligation instead of a choice . ”
Apparently this diabolical construct is “ preserved ” ( by unspecified villains ) solely to ensure that women without children are n’t recognised as “ complete individuals . ”
The thought of women being recognised as “ complete individuals ” apparently makes some ( unspecified ) people very , very frightened .
I can of course think of some individuals and institutions , chiefly in non-Western cultures , which do seem threatened by the prospect of women as autonomous beings .
Indeed I ’ve written about some of them , unkindly and at length .
But Marcotte ’s repeated use of abstract generalities steers readers to the assumption that this is pretty much the position of menfolk everywhere .
Now I know quite a few women and my estimation of their individuality and / or “ completeness ” is n’t based on whether or not they happen to have children or are capable of gestation .
And I do n’t think I ’m particularly unusual in this regard .
In fact , I do n’t know anyone personally who does evaluate women on that basis .
So who , exactly , is Ms Marcotte talking about ?
Given her adamance and slightly paranoid tendencies , she really ought to be clear about this .
And if the species ’ inclination to reproduce ( or become pregnant , or to parent or whatever ) is real only as a malleable social construct , what , then , did we do earlier in our history before this construct was sufficiently widespread and developed ?
And how did such a thing arise at all , if not at least in part from actual , biological differences between men and women ?
I ’m reminded of another feminist pundit , Freethinker , who claims ,
Gender as a male / female dichotomy is a social construct more than anything else …
The only reason gender dichotomy seems like a fact is because of the way the society is organised .
Again , one notes how “ social constructs ” and “ the way society is organised ” are deemed to determine how people behave above and beyond all else , but are much less often entertained as the possible consequences of biological facts .
There does n’t seem to be much willingness to ask whether “ the way society is organised ” has at least a little to do with evolutionary biology , evolutionary psychology and ( gasp ) human nature .
Freethinker goes on to say ,
Men in our country also love to point to ‘ strength , ’ mental and physical , as a point of difference .
And they need to be told that if women were not conditioned into gender - appropriate behaviour that renders their bones and muscles weak from disuse and their minds unassertive and submissive , they would have all the strength .
A bold claim , and again quite insistent .
Though I suspect one or two weight lifters , male and female , would take a different view .
One based on first hand experience , rather than bare ideology .
Applications Collapse of the ice bridge supporting Wilkins Ice Shelf appears imminent
03/04/2009 2725 views 2 likes
The Wilkins Ice Shelf is at risk of partly breaking away from the Antarctic Peninsula as the ice bridge that connects it to Charcot and Latady Islands looks set to collapse .
The beginning of what appears to be the demise of the ice bridge began this week when new rifts forming along its centre axis resulted in a large block of ice breaking away .
The Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) images acquired on 2 April by ESA ’s Envisat satellite confirm that the rifts are quickly expanding along the ice bridge .
Dr Angelika Humbert from the Institute of Geophysics , Münster University , and Dr Matthias Braun from the Center for Remote Sensing , University of Bonn , witnessed the recent development during their daily monitoring activities of the ice sheet using data from Envisat and the German Aerospace Center ’s TerraSAR - X satellite .
First block of ice breaks away
By having a time series of radar satellite images throughout this event , Humbert and Braun are able to determine how the rifts develop and how the narrowest part of the bridge responds to these changes .
Knowing these details allows them to learn more about the behaviour of ice under stress .
Satellite acquisitions of the ice shelf are available to the public via ESA ’s ‘ Webcam from Space ’ .
The web page will be updated with Envisat images as they are received to allow the public to witness the event .
By acquiring daily images of Antarctica that are easily accessible to scientists , ASAR has provided an unprecedented time series of the recent break - up events and allowed scientists to continuously monitor these developments to better understand the break - up process of ice shelves .
Rifts on the Wilkins Ice Shelf captured by Envisat in 2008 Many changes occurred to the ice shelf in 2008 , as witnessed by Envisat .
In late February , 425 sq km of ice calved away , narrowing the ice bridge down to a 6 - km strip .
At the end of May a 160 - sq - km chunk of ice broke away and reduced the ice bridge to just 2.7 km , leaving it only 900 m wide at its narrowest location .
" In the past months , we have observed the ice bridge deforming and its narrowest location acting as a kind of hinge , " Humbert said .
" During the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 sq km or about 14 % of its size .
The break - up events in February and May 2008 happened in just hours , leaving the remaining part of the ice bridge in a fragile situation , " Humbert explained .
" Rift developments during October and November resulted presumably from the loss of 1220 sq km along the northern ice front during June and July 2008 . "
Wilkins Ice Shelf in 1992 Antarctic ’s ice sheet was formed by thousands of years of accumulated and compacted snow .
Along the coast the ice gradually floats on the sea , forming massive ledges known as ice shelves .
Several of these ice shelves , including seven in the past 20 years , have retreated and disintegrated .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf had been stable for most of the last century before it began retreating in the 1990s .
Scientists are currently investigating the reasons and processes of the recent ice shelf break - ups and whether the current situation is linked to the extraordinary warming during the past 50 years , in which the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by 2.5 °C – far more than the global average .
Map of Antarctica Polar areas are very remote and the conditions often found there , such as restricted daylight and thick cloud cover , make it very difficult to carry out in situ research .
The advent of satellites has allowed scientists to continuously monitor these regions .
ASAR is particularly suited for polar monitoring because it can operate at night and penetrate through clouds .
Long - term satellite monitoring over Antarctica is important because it provides authoritative evidence of trends and allows scientists to make predictions .
Following the conclusion of the International Polar Year in March , ESA is compiling complete datasets over polar areas and making them available to polar scientists at no cost .

Ever since school days , I was taught that a good start in programming is a way to become a good software developer .
Today , the college students desire to learn programming languages which are easy to implement and has a good portability across various platforms .
Something which Java started off .
The recent past has witnessed the development of open source programming languages , software , applications and other utilities that are geared towards the younger minds .
What can fascinate these fresh minds include games , animations and the new environment of programming languages .
When the minds are young and malleable , they can really pick up things fast .
An open source environment teaches newbies how to interact with the new world of open and collaborative development .
Scratch is a new programming language that makes it easy for the kids to create their own animations , games , music and art and share them on the web .
Here , all the uploaded programs are open source .
Scratch is designed to help young people to learn important mathematical and computational ideas , at the same time gain a deeper understanding of the design process .
At the same time , it teaches programming fundamentals in the form of 3 - D movies and games .
Alice , one of the oldest and most developed environments is used in most of the schools for teaching programming to the children as a part of their education
Another open source toolkit is Shoes which is quite similar to the traditional method of programming .
It is user - friendly and children find it easy and familiar as it requires just a basic text editor to make programs .
Children may pick up the basics of programming pretty fast as it is easy to follow instructions and tutorial .
It is a proven fact that children are happy to sit down and play with a computer as long as the software titles provided are engaging and fun .
Having this kind of software packaged and multitude of programming environment would really be great .
At the moment , aspiring programmers often learn through sources that favor proprietary software and closed development methods .
If a free software operating system ( a Linux distro ) could encourage people with an open source environment , things could get pretty different .
These programming environments with tutorials should get you up and running quickly with a powerful programming language .
Edubuntu is another such program , based on the Ubuntu Linux operating system and aimed primarily at children in educational environments .
According to the distribution homepage , Edubuntu is “ Linux for Young Human Beings ” .
It has its unique ways that encompasses the total learning process .
There is load out there for you to evaluate and install for your kids as they grow out of the programs they are currently enjoying .
Open source programming languages really shine in the way it lets kids learn about programming in a less complex process .
This actually reflects that open source software are n’t theoretical but – are able to compare for themselves how well it stacks up against the other OS available in our homes .
These applications contain numerous games which are a clever collection and appeals the kids .
Apart from the games , they contain certain other tools that keep the kids organized .
These different Open Source versions strike the right balance between helping them learn the basics and teaching them ways to achieve great things .
So the case is not “ Is Open Source ready for kids ? ” but rather “ Why not Open Source for kids ? ” as this would make programming easy and approachable for little sweethearts .
イナゴは昔から日本の各地で食用にされてきた有名な食用昆虫です。
一説によるとイナゴによる虫害でお米が被害を受けた年に、食べるものがなかったので大量発生したイナゴを食べたのが、イナゴの食用文化の始まりといわれています。
一方、蜂の子もまた日本の代表的な食用昆虫です。 蜂の子を食べる地域は主に内陸部が多く、海が少ない地域は魚からタンパク質を摂取するのが難しかったため、比較的簡単に採れる蜂の子を食べるようになったといわれています。
蜂の子とイナゴ、どちらも食料に困った末に手軽に採れるタンパク源として食べられるようになったのが始まりとされています。
しかし現代では含まれる栄養素の違いから蜂の子とイナゴはそれぞれ違った用途で使用されています。
栄養成分の違 い
イナゴの栄養成 分
イナゴも蜂の子もとても栄養価の高い食品です。 両方ともビタミンやミネラルなどの栄養素が非常に高い水準で含まれています。
更にタンパク質が豊富な上に、脂質は少ない ので、イナゴも蜂の子もダイエットやトレーニング中の不足している栄養素を補うのに最適です。
特にイナゴは鉄分や銅などのミネラルがとても豊富に含まれており、含まれているミネラルのほぼ全てが、一食で摂取することが推奨される目安量を超えます。
ミネラルは不足しないように摂取することで健康状態を維持してくれる栄養素で、不足してしまうと多くの体の不調を引き起こします。 またビタミンEもとても多く含まれており、目安量を超えています。
ビタミンEは抗酸化作用があり、肌や血管の酸化による老化を防いでくれます。 ビタミンEもミネラルも、どちらも人が健康的に生きるためには、無くてはならない成分です。
このようにイナゴは、体調を管理する作用のある栄養素が多く含まれた昆虫食です。
蜂の子の栄養成 分
蜂の子もイナゴと同じくらい高い水準で栄養素を含んでいます。
蜂の子の場合は、タンパク質に多くの必須アミノ酸を多く含んでいることが特徴です。
必須アミノ酸とは疲労の回復や、エネルギーを作り出す際に無くてはならない栄養素のことです。
ですが、必須アミノ酸は体内で合成することができないので、蜂の子などの必須アミノ酸を多く含む食品から摂取する必要があります。
また、同じく体内でエネルギーを作る際に必要になる、ナイアシン(ビタミンB3)というビタミンB群の一種があります。 蜂の子はこのナイアシンの含有量も非常に多く含まれています。
このように蜂の子にはイナゴと比較すると、エネルギーの生成や疲労の回復に効果のある成分が多く含まれている特徴があります。
漢方としての違 い
蜂の子とイナゴを漢方として比較してみると、それぞれの持つ特色が更に見えてきます。
イナゴの効 能
まずイナゴは漢方としての効能は、咳止めや解熱、そして貧血予防といった風邪薬のような効能があるとされています。
この効能はイナゴに多く含まれている、ミネラルとビタミンDが作用するものと考えられます。
ミネラルは体の免疫力を管理する役割があり、不足してしまうと免疫力低下の原因になります。 またビタミンDには、体がミネラルを吸収しやすくする作用があります。
ビタミ ンDとミネラルの両方を多く含んでいるため、イナゴは高い免疫力向上効果があり、咳や熱が早く治まります。
蜂の子の効 能
対して蜂の子は豊富なアミノ酸が、高い滋養強壮効果や耳鳴りの緩和効果をもたらします。
これは先述したアミノ酸のエネルギーを作る作用や疲労回復効果により、体力が付くためと考えられます。
そして、蜂の子のアミノ酸を摂取することにより、自律神経の乱れが原因の耳鳴りに有効に作用します。
また蜂の子にもイナゴ程ではないにしても、充分すぎるくらいの豊富なミネラルが含まれています。
このミネラルも内耳などの聴覚器官に有効に作用することで、耳鳴りを抑え、耳の聞こえを良くします。
蜂の子とイナゴの大きな違 い
蜂の子とイナゴの主な特色は以下のようになります。
イナゴはミネラルが豊富で、風邪に効果的
蜂の子はアミノ酸が豊富で、体力の回復など滋養強壮効果が高い
蜂の子とイナゴは両方とも高い栄養価があり、どちらも似たような栄養成分ですが、それぞれ突出した栄養成分があります。
今回は違いを分かりやすくするために、最も突出した栄養素や効能に焦点を当てました。
そのため蜂の子にも風邪予防効果が、イナゴにも滋養強壮効果が充分に期待できます。
ですが、もし健康のためにどちらかを摂取することを習慣にしようとするなら、上記の特色を参考にしてみてください。
The real Empire of the Sun : JG Ballard on how his childhood inspired the gripping war film
It was an enthralling war film - based on the childhood adventures in a Japanese prison camp of author JG Ballard , who died this week .
But , as his actual memoirs reveal , the full story was even more strange and disturbing .
Shanghai childhood : JG Ballard as a young boy before Japan invaded China
While I was lying in bed studying for a Scripture test , I heard tanks moving down Amherst Avenue .
My father , who ran cotton mills , burst into my bedroom and told me that Japan had declared war .
' But I have to go to school , ' I protested .
' Exams start today . '
He then uttered the greatest words an 11 - year - old schoolboy can ever hear .
' There 'll be no more school , and no more exams . '
From that point , the old Shanghai - celebrated as the Paris of the Orient - ceased to exist .
I was born in the city 's general hospital on November 15 , 1930 and we lived at 31 Amherst Avenue in the western suburbs .
It was a magical place .
There were receptions at the French Club , race meetings at the Shanghai Racecourse and various patriotic gatherings at the British Embassy on the Bund , the city 's glamorous waterfront area .
I remember , as an excited English boy , our trips in the family Buick to the Country Club swimming pool .
There was unlimited Coca - Cola and ice cream , and the chauffeur would stop on the way back to buy the latest American comics .
But everything changed with the Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor , the American naval base , on December 7 , 1941 .
The day after , Japanese troops occupied the international section of the city where we lived .
There were no more parties , and the Country Club became a Japanese officers ' club - my mother told me in tones of great indignation that they had stabled their horses in the squash courts .

Looking back , it puzzles me that my parents decided to stay in Shanghai when they must have known that war was imminent .
But the cotton works were my father 's responsibility and duty then counted for something .
In March 1943 , my parents , four - year - old sister and I were interned with other foreign civilians at Lunghua camp , a former teacher training college outside Shanghai , where we remained until the end of August 1945 .
Our assembly point was the city 's American Club .
There we found a huge press of people , mostly British , sitting with their suitcases around the swimming pool , many of the women in their fur coats .
Some of the men carried nothing apart from the clothes they were wearing , confident that the war would be over within days .
Others had strapped tennis rackets , cricket bats and fishing rods to their luggage .
Together we waited at the tables where Americans had once sipped their bourbons .
Then we were taken to Lunghua , my last real childhood home , where I would spend the next two - and - a - half largely happy years .
We were given a small room in G Block .
My first impression was of how relaxed and casual the internees seemed .
All this would change , but for the moment the people around me were enjoying a ramshackle , but rather pleasant , holiday .
I had known a Shanghai where the men wore suits and ties , but here they were dressed in cotton shorts and shirtsleeves .
Many of the younger women were in beachwear .
The dining hall had the atmosphere of an unsupervised prison , children screaming , husbands flirting with each other 's wives .
Outside , there were earth tracks named Oxford Street and Piccadilly , and the amateur dramatics group rehearsed The Pirates Of Penzance .
All in all , this was a relaxed and easy - going world and I enjoyed my time in Lunghua , made a huge number of friends of all ages , and on the whole felt buoyant and optimistic .
Impressionable :
In the film Bale idolises the Japanese despite being a prisoner
My parents were glad to let me stay out to all hours .
Of the 2,000 inhabitants , 300 were children , and I roamed at the centre of a pack of boys my own age .
There were 1,000 sights to be investigated , 100 errands to run in return for an old copy of the photo magazine Life or an unwanted screwdriver .
The camp was ringed by a barbedwire fence , through which I often climbed to retrieve a ball or kite .
A building was designated as the school .
Inside the crowded dormitories , there was desperate competition for space .
Former classrooms were divided into a maze of cubicles by sheets hung from lines of string .
All the women in the camp were assigned jobs - running the kitchens or boiling our drinking water .
Women with small children were excused duties and my mother rarely left our tiny room .
Families with one child were obliged to take in a child without parents .
A boy named Bobby Henderson was so resented by the couple on whom he was billeted that he constructed a cubicle like a beggar 's hovel , which he defended fiercely .
Bobby and I were close , though I never really liked him and found something threatening about his tough and self - reliant mind .
Circumstances had forced him to fight too hard to survive and this had made him ruthless .
He regarded my endless curiosity and roaming around the camp as a waste of time , and my interest in chess , bridge and kites as frivolous .
His parents were interned in Peking , but he never spoke about them , which baffled me at the time .
The truth is I suspect that he had forgotten what they were like .
On the whole , however , Lunghua seemed full of easy - going and agreeable characters .
Striding around the assembly hall with my chessboard , I would be affably hailed as ' Shanghai Jim ' .
I would settle down for a game with a man who might be an architect or a former jockey .
Then I might be lent an old copy of The Saturday Evening Post , or Punch .
What all these adults shared , of which I took full advantage , was the crushing boredom of camp life .
They were living in an eventless world .
An hour 's chess with a talkative 12 - year - old was an hour less to endure .
Our food supply was a serious problem from the start .
Our meals consisted of rice congee - rice boiled into a liquid pulp - vegetable soup that concealed a piece of gristly horse meat and hard , black bread .
Change of heart :
When U.S. pilots bomb a nearby airfield , they become his heroes
For the rest of my life , I would find it difficult to leave food on my plate , even
if I disliked its taste .
And in the last 18 months of the war , our rations fell further .
As we sat at the card table in our room one day , pushing what my mother called ' the weevils ' to the rim of our plates of congee , my father decided that we should eat them - we needed the protein .
They were small white slugs , and perhaps maggots , a word my mother preferred to avoid .
I counted them before tucking in lustily - 100 or so was my usual score .
The camp commandant , Hyashi , was almost a caricature short - sighted Japanese with a toothbrush moustache and spectacles .
He would smile at the noisy British children , a feral tribe if ever there was one .
I also became friends with several of the young Japanese guards .
They were bored , too , and would let me wear their kendo martial arts armour .
I knew they could be viciously brutal .
In the early days , when there was still electric power , my mother would read late into the night .
And once , a passing Japanese officer spotted the light .
He burst into the room , drew his sword and slashed away the mosquito net above my mother 's head .
He then smashed the light bulb into fragments and vanished without a word .
For me , the most important consequence of internment was that for the first time in my life I was extremely close to my parents .
I slept , ate , dressed and undressed within a few feet of them in the same small room , in many ways like the poorer Chinese families for whom I had felt so sorry in Shanghai .
But I revelled in this closeness .
Lying in bed at night I could , if I wanted to , reach out and take my mother 's hand .
I flourished in this intimacy , such a contrast to formal English life .
In pre-war Shanghai , if I caught my mother brushing her hair , it seemed a strange and almost mysterious event .
The vistas of polished furniture turned a family home into a deserted museum .
Lunghua camp may have been a prison of a kind , but it was a prison where I found freedom .
My parents ' memories of Lunghua were always much harsher than my own - perhaps because I knew nothing about our likely fate at the hands of the Japanese .
Missed : JG Ballard died at age 78
The adults must have been weak and demoralised , and had heard rumours that we would be marched up - country and disposed of .
By the summer of 1944 , the conditions in the camp had changed markedly for the worse .
The guards became more brutal as Japan faced defeat .
They would lash out during roll - calls .
I can still see two of the guards beating to death an exhausted Chinese rickshaw coolie who had brought them from Shanghai .
The desperate man sobbed on his knees as they kicked him until he lay in a still and bloody pulp on the ground .
I watched from 30ft away , with a large crowd of British internees .
I understood why no one tried to intervene .
They all had wives and children .
The reprisals would have been instant and fearsome .
I remember feeling a deep deadness .
The first escape , of some men who set off for the Chinese lines 400 miles away , led to a harsher regime .
The food ration was cut and the shower block closed .
The winters were fiercely cold .
Many people retired to bed for as long as they could .
American air raids then began .
Once an anti-aircraft shell exploded above me and I stopped to pick up a gnarled piece of steel , like the peel of a silver apple .
It was still hot to the touch .
The sight of American aircraft gave me a new focus of adolescent veneration .
I watched the Mustangs streak overhead and spent every spare moment watching the sky .
By early 1945 , destitute Chinese peasants tried to enter the camp .
Starving families sat around the gates , the women wailing and holding up their skeletal children .
The guards helped us keep them out .
And then , one day in early August , we woke to find that the Japanese guards had gone .
We assembled for the morning roll - call , but they failed to appear .
We wandered away , listening to the empty sky .
One or two reconnaissance planes drifted high overhead , but for the first time everything was silent .
Had the war ended ?
A few of the internees began to step through the barbed wire .
They stood in
the deep grass , inhaling the air outside the camp , as if testing a different atmosphere .
I walked to a nearby burial mound .
I climbed onto the lowest tier of rotting coffins , turned and looked back at the camp , a view I had never seen before .
Everything about it seemed strange and unreal , though it had been my home for two - and - a - half years .
I ran back and climbed through the wire , relieved to be back in the camp and the only security I knew .
I assume that at this time the first atomic bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima , but the Japanese had not yet decided to surrender .
A few days later we heard of Hirohito 's broadcast , calling on Japanese forces everywhere to lay down their arms .
But we were all unsure whether they would obey him .
It was several weeks before American forces arrived to take control of Shanghai .
And so August 1945 was a strange interregnum when we were never wholly certain that the war had ended .
All sense of community spirit had left Lunghua , and nothing seemed to matter any more .
The school had closed , and mothers abandoned the family washing on the lines behind G Block .
Then , in the last days of August , a B - 29 flew towards the camp .
A line of canisters ' parachutes flared and the first American relief supplies floated towards us .
Each was a cargo of treasure .
There were tins of Spam , cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes , jars of jam and huge bars of chocolate .
I remember vividly our first meal on our little card table and the extraordinary taste of animal fat , sugar , jam and chocolate .
The vast , lazy planes that floated overhead were emissaries from another world .
The camp came alive again , as the internees found a new purpose in their lives , hoarding their new supplies , quick to point out the smallest unfairness .
Tired of all this , and revived by the Spam and chocolate , I decided to walk to Shanghai five miles away .
Without telling my parents , I stepped through the wire fence .
I passed through a silent terrain of abandoned paddy fields , burntout trucks , burial mounds and ghost villages .
After an hour , I reached a railway station .
A group of fully - armed Japanese soldiers waited on the platform , picking their teeth while one of them tormented a young Chinese man .
The Japanese soldier had tied the Chinese to a telegraph pole and was now slowly strangling him .
I was about to walk past when the soldier beckoned me to him .
He had seen the transparent celluloid belt that held up my frayed cotton shorts .
It was a prized novelty .
I handed it to him , then waited as he flexed the colourless plastic and stared at me through it , laughing admiringly .
Behind him the young Chinese was slowly suffocating to death , his urine spreading across the platform .
I waited in the sun , listening as his strangled voice grew weaker .
I was old enough to know that this lost Japanese platoon was beyond the point where life and death meant anything at all .
Ten minutes later , the Chinese was silent and I was able to walk away .
The Japanese soldier looped my plastic belt around his neck , stepped over the trussed body , and rejoined his companions , waiting for a train that would never come .
I was no different from millions of other teenage boys in enemyoccupied Europe and the Far East .
A vast cruelty lay over the world and was all we knew .
I had changed and I knew that childhood had passed for good .
I walked down Amherst Avenue to our house at 31 .
A young Chinese soldier not much older than I was , opened the door and tried to bar my way with his rifle .
I pushed past him , saying : ' This is my house . '
A general had occupied the house , but had fled after the Japanese surrender .
The house was untouched , every piece of furniture and kitchen equipment in place .
I walked around the airless rooms , watching the sunlight play on the swirls of dust that followed me .
I climbed the stairs to my bedroom , and lay on the bed , counting the screw - hooks from which I had hung my model aircraft .
The house seemed strange and I felt that it should have changed like everything else in Shanghai .
It was almost as if the war had never happened .

Americans want immigration solved , and they realize that mass deportations will not do that .
When you add the unprecedented engagement of growing numbers of Latino voters in 2008 , it becomes clear that the nativist path is the path to permanent political irrelevance .
Unless you can find a way to get rid of all the Latinos .
What was perhaps more notable than the report itself was the team that delivered it .
It included Bay Buchanan , former adviser to Representative Tom Tancredo and sister of Pat , who founded the American Cause and wrote “ State of Emergency : The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America . ”
She was joined by James Pinkerton , an essayist and Fox News contributor who , as an aide to the first President Bush , took credit for the racist Willie Horton ads run against Michael Dukakis .
So far , so foul .
But even more telling was the presence of Peter Brimelow , a former Forbes editor and founder of Vdare.com , an extremist anti-immigration Web site .
It is named for Virginia Dare , the first white baby born in the English colonies , which tells you most of what you need to know .
The site is worth a visit .
There you can read Mr. Brimelow ’s and Mr. Buchanan ’s musings about racial dilution and the perils facing white people , and gems like this from Mr. Epstein :
“ Diversity can be good in moderation  if what is being brought in is desirable .
Most Americans do n’t mind a little ethnic food , some Asian math whizzes , or a few Mariachi dancers  as long as these trends do not overwhelm the dominant culture . ”
It is easy to mock white - supremacist views as pathetic and to assume that nativism in the age of Obama is on the way out .
The country has , of course , made considerable progress since the days of Know - Nothings and the Klan .
But racism has a nasty habit of never going away , no matter how much we may want it to , and thus the perpetual need for vigilance .
It is all around us .
Much was made of the Republican mailing of the parody song “ Barack the Magic Negro , ” but the same notorious CD included “ The Star Spanglish Banner , ” a puerile bit of Latino - baiting .
It is easily found on YouTube .
Google the words “ Bill O’Reilly ” and “ white , Christian male power structure ” for another YouTube taste of the Fox News host assailing the immigration views of “ the far left ” ( including The Times ) as racially traitorous .

The giveaway sign was probably the missing blue ringbinder .
It was Josef Fritzl 's nod to the Austrian court and to the world that he had capitulated , that his realm of power and domination had collapsed .
As he shuffled into court today without the most potent symbol of this trial , which out of shame and embarrassment he had held up to cover his face during previous sessions , he made a decision that elicited gasps from the public gallery .
" I recognise that I am guilty of all the charges presented , " he said .
" I regret what I 've done . "
Asked by the stunned judge , Andrea Humer , what had made him change his mind so suddenly , and prompted him to admit to the charges of murder and slavery that he had previously rejected , Fritzl said : " Because of the video testimony of my daughter . "
On a large television screen the previous day , Elisabeth , 42 , had confronted her father with the full horror of her 24 - year ordeal in hour after hour of harrowing prerecorded testimony .
She detailed everything , from the years of violent sexual abuse , often in front of her children , to how he tortured her in the dark , damp and cold cellar , and let her repeatedly give birth without medical help , allowing one of her children to die .
A point in that testimony which reportedly left a searing impression on the court was her remark : " I screamed many times during all those years , but nobody ever heard me . "
Fritzl told the court in a strained and croaky voice : " I should have realised it before , but I only realised yesterday for the first time how cruel I was to Elisabeth . "
" You mean , " the judge asked him , " you recognised for the first time what she had experienced just as she depicted it ? " - to which Fritzl nodded .
Reports were rife today that Elisabeth had slipped into court on Tuesday to watch the man who stole her life squirm as he heard her damning testimony .
The respectable Kurier newspaper reported that she had been brought to the court under cover of darkness from the nearby clinic where she and her family are living for the duration of the trial .
A member of staff from the clinic told the newspaper : " She 's planning to write a book and simply wanted to gather her impressions . "
In the evening , amid tight security , she was taken back to the clinic and her six children , all of whom were born in the cellar , the source said .
Her testimony had a " devastating effect " on Fritzl , according to his lawyer , Rudolf Mayer .
He said the full force of it hit Fritzl when he returned to his prison cell that evening and requested to see a counsellor .
Mayer would neither confirm nor deny whether Elisabeth had been present at the court .
But he told the Guardian : " If Elisabeth was indeed in the court then I'm of the opinion that it would have been the trigger for his devastation .
" He asked to see a psychiatrist afterwards , so crushed was he .
The testimony which he saw for the first time had a profoundly devastating effect on him and led to the change of direction in this trial . "
Mayer 's client had not informed him in advance of his decision to plead guilty , he said .
" I was indeed surprised , not least because someone with such a personality disorder as he has - which involves keeping up appearances and giving the impression that he 's the one with the power - finds it difficult to drop his trousers in front of the world . "
Fritzl 's decision to confess to the murder through third - party negligence of his son Michael , born to Elisabeth in 1996 , who died of severe respiratory problems after 66 hours of life , brought to a close to one of the most controversial aspects of the trial .
Asked by Humer why he had not taken the sick child out of the dungeon and sought medical help , Fritzl whispered : " I do n't know why I did n't help .
I just overlooked it .
I thought the little one would survive .
I should have recognised that the baby was doing poorly . "
Earlier in the week , state prosecutor Christiane Burkheiser had told the court how Elisabeth had given birth to Michael and his twin Alexander without any medical assistance , as she had all her children , and using just a pair of unsterilised scissors , a dirty blanket , a 1960s manual on childbirth and a bottle of disinfectant .
She also presented the jury with a box of objects from the cellar which were still contaminated with the rancid , damp smell that Elisabeth had lived with for 24 years , urging them : " Smell , smell those 24 years . "
As he was escorted into court today flanked by 11 guards , the sallow - skinned Fritzl cut the figure not of a tyrant , but of a broken man , his hands shaking , his back curved and his shoulders stooped under the same black and grey small - check jacket he was wearing when he was arrested in his home town of Amstetten in April 2008 .
He listened passively , his hands crossed on his lap , alternatively sitting with his legs crossed or nervously jigging his left leg and wiping his nose with a tissue , as psychiatrist Adelheid Kastner told the court that his mother 's failure to love him as a child was central to understanding Fritzl 's subsequent behaviour and his need to dominate and possess a person for himself .
" Herr Fritzl spent most of his childhood in a state of anxiety , " Kastner said .
She added that the more children Elisabeth had given birth to in the cellar , " the more power he felt he had over her " .
Reports by technical experts read out in court went some way to explain how Fritzl operated his underground empire .
They concluded that a timer switch , which he claimed would open the door after a set period in case he died or fell ill , did not in fact exist .
Until today 's confession , Fritzl had stubbornly refused to admit that he had caused Elisabeth much suffering , arguing instead that he had saved her from a life of ruin and debauchery when he lured her into the cellar at the age of 18 , at a time - he falsely claimed - when she was living a life dominated by drink and drugs .
He told authorities she had joined a sect , and that over the years had dumped three of her children on his doorstep , unable to cope .
It was a story that they failed to question for more than two decades .
Fritzl 's defence lawyer had insisted to the court earlier this week that his client was not a " monster " as he has been portrayed in much of the media .
Mayer argued that Fritzl had struggled to look after both his family upstairs - wife Rosemarie and three of Elisabeth 's children , whom he had brought up from the cellar to live with them upstairs - as well as his " underground " family .
He brought them food , school books , a television , and even a Christmas tree , Mayer said .
He said if he had only wanted to keep his daughter as his sex slave , he would not have had children with her .
But if the jury felt any sympathy whatsoever towards the man whom the prosecutor said gave many the impression that he was the " nice old man from next door " , it was then hit by the full impact of Elisabeth 's evidence , which laid bare the horror of her life .
Counsellors were on hand , as well as four replacement jurors ready to step in if the evidence proved too hard to stomach .
Fritzl will face a sentence of between 20 years and life imprisonment .
But it is possible that his confession will lead to a reduced sentence .
" It all depends on whether the jury and the judges take the confession to be a mitigating circumstance , " said the vice - president of the court , Franz Cutka .
The court 's judges retired at around midday to formulate a series of questions for the jury , which will be put to them this morning .
The jury will then retire to decide their verdict based on both the evidence and Fritzl 's confession , and to determine the sentence .
The court is expected to hear their decision this afternoon .
Authorities will then decide over the next two weeks where Fritzl will be sent .
It is likely that he will be transferred from his prison cell in St Pölten to a psychiatric institute following Kastner 's recommendation yesterday that he needed to undergo intensive therapy to treat a serious personality disorder , and that untreated , he was capable of carrying out further crimes even at his advanced age .
Fritzl is on suicide watch , meaning at the end of each day 's court sessions guards remove his tie and belt to ensure he cannot use them to harm himself .

See updated story : Credit card balances jump as economic woes deepen
Credit card balances rose in January , according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve , as consumers had difficulty paying down debt in a troubled economy .
The rise in card balances was detailed in today ’s release of the Federal Reserve ’s monthly G.19 report , which showed revolving credit — a category of loans made up almost entirely of credit card debt — showed a 1.2 percent increase in January .
Overall , revolving debt grew to $ 961.3 billion from a total of $ 960.4 billion in December .
Meanwhile , nonrevolving credit grew 0.6 percent in January to $ 1.6 trillion .
That section of the consumer credit report includes a variety of types of lending , primarily auto loans , student loans and loans for mobile homes , boats and trailers .
In all , consumers were carrying $ 2.564 trillion in total debt in January .
That ’s up from a revised December figure of $ 2.563 trillion .
With job losses mounting , cardholders had difficulty putting their limited incomes toward credit card debt .
Research and risk analysis firm Moody ’s recently reported that credit card delinquencies — credit card accounts that are more than 30 days past due — rose to 5.94 percent in January , the highest level since the rate ’s historical peak of 6.31 percent in January 1992 .
Increasing delinquencies come at a time when access to credit is already restricted .
A Federal Reserve report released last month showed that more than half of lenders tightened credit card lending standards in the final months of 2008 .
The pullback in available credit is something of a mixed blessing to analysts , many of whom say lending had become excessive .
“ I have always been of the view that over the last 20 years there has been far too much credit available to consumers , ” says David B. Humphrey , finance professor at Florida State University .

If you are not following Mauricio Fernandez 's blog then please do yourself a favor and subscribe to it .
Mauricio's writings are very interesting and informative .
In one of his posts Mauricio gives a record of re-implementing his blog in OCaml using the OCsigen ( webserver + framework ) library .
Mauricio did some benchmarking for the OCsigen environment against Rails and even a C fastcgi implementation .
Naturally one would expect that OCaml will be orders of magnitude faster than Ruby .
But the benchmark showed really abysmal performance for Rail vs. OCsigen .
We are talking 260 request per second vs. 4500 requests per second for a single process test !
That 's north of 20X difference !
I decided that Ruby can do better .
Looking at what OCsigen offers revealed that Rails is an overkill in comparison .
I thought that for Ruby a nice alternative can be the mystery webserver + framework called unicycle ( never heard of it ?
you do n't know what you 're missing ) .
Since OCsigen offers LWt ( a light weight cooperative threading library ) at its core for concurrency I added a fiber wrapper to Unicycle 's request processing path so that we get a similar overhead ( the testing was done using Ruby 1.9.1 ) .
Here are my results :
Please note that this is running on my Intel Mobile Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHZ processor vs. the 3GHZ desktop AMD Athlon64 that was used for the original tests ( it should be roughly 50 % faster than my mobile core2 ) .
I decided to take it further still .
Mauricio mentioned that he was able to get performance above 2000 req/s from OCsigen when benchmarking the blog page that we are discussing here .
So I created a sqlite database ( he mentioned somewhere that he is using sqlite ) and inserted the same blog entry ( with very little modifications ) in a structured manner .
I did n't bother with comments though ( out of being lazy ) .
Sequel was used to connect and fetch the record from the database and an rhtml template that is rendered using Erubis .
The result was a page very similar to the original blog post .
ApacheBench was used to benchmark the page .
During the time of testing the Unicycle process was between 13MB and 21MB ( that 's 3 x to 4 x the size of the OCsigen process ) Considering that the components found in any laptop are usually inferior to their desktop counter parts I believe this at least equals the figure reported for OCsigen 's performance .
How can Ruby achieve such performance ?
By careful selection of components :
First off , Ruby 1.9.1 , everybody should start using it for their next project .
It is much faster and much easier on memory Unicycle is built atop EventMachine and the EventMachine HTTP Server .
Both are C based speed demons .
Unicycle itself is a minimal framework that does n't attempt to be so smart .
Erubis is a nice surprise .
Pure Ruby and decently fast are not commonly found together but kudos to the authors of Erubis , they somehow did it .
Ruby is faster the OCaml .
Wrong !
OCaml is a lot faster than Ruby .
But thanks to hard work by some prominent Rubyists you can have a Ruby setup that performs decently enough to make you proud .

The so - called sunshine vitamin is poised to become the nutrient of the decade , if a host of recent findings are to be believed .
Vitamin D , an essential nutrient found in a limited number of foods , has long been renowned for its role in creating strong bones , which is why it is added to milk .
Now a growing legion of medical researchers have raised strong doubts about the adequacy of currently recommended levels of intake , from birth through the sunset years .
The researchers maintain , based on a plethora of studies , that vitamin D levels considered adequate to prevent bone malformations like rickets in children are not optimal to counter a host of serious ailments that are now linked to low vitamin D levels .
To be sure , not all medical experts are convinced of the need for or the desirability of raising the amount of vitamin D people should receive , either through sunlight , foods , supplements or all three .
The federal committee that establishes daily recommended levels of nutrients has resisted all efforts to increase vitamin D intake significantly , partly because the members are not convinced of assertions for its health - promoting potential and partly because of time - worn fears of toxicity .
This column will present the facts as currently known , but be forewarned .
In the end , you will have to decide for yourself how much of this vital nutrient to consume each and every day and how to obtain it .
Electric vehicles currently face a variety of Catch - 22 style challenges .
They require vast , cutting - edge battery manufacturing capacity , but building that capacity wo n't happen until it 's clear that electric vehicles will be sold on a large enough scale .
Driving electric vehicles will be challenging without a support network of charging and maintenance stations , but it's hard to make an economic case for building the support infrastructure until the vehicles are already on the road .
President Obama , armed with stimulus money , has apparently decided that the US government is now ideally placed to break the deadlock .
Obama used a tour of Southern California Edison 's electric vehicle testing center to announce that $ 2.4 billion of stimulus money would be used to help get everything in place for widespread adoption of electric vehicles .
The goal : to put a million plugin hybrid vehicles on the road by 2015 .
All of this money will be administered by the Department of Energy , where agency head Steve Chu has recently streamlined the funding protocols with the intention of making sure the stimulus money is put to use quickly .
The bulk of it , $ 1.5 billion , will go to the development of battery technology and manufacturing capacity .
This was the sort of thing US battery manufacturers were looking for , as they 've already formed the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Battery Cell Manufacture in the hope of spreading some of the risk of investment in expanded battery manufacturing technology .
The DOE has announced that , in addition to manufacturing , the money will be used to develop recycling capacity for lithium batteries , something that will be essential if electric vehicles take off .
They money will be distributed in the form of competitive grants .
Another $ 500 million of grants will go to the companies that make components such as electric motors .
As this technology is already fairly mature — it 's certainly not viewed as the primary roadblock to electric cars — this will presumably go primarily to expanding the manufacturing capacity .
The last $ 400 million will be spent on infrastructure concepts , with grants funding research on the basic technology , and other money being spent on demonstration projects .
According to the DOE , this money will cover everything from evaluating different approaches to plugin hybrid vehicles to training mechanics to service them .
This is actually one case where we may be underspending .
Not a month goes by where a new public - private partnership for electric vehicle infrastructure is announced ( see here for this month 's example ) , and some of these are very clearly based on incompatible concepts , such as battery swaps vs. quick - charge stations .
The US risks a balkanization of its roadways if each region winds up doing its own thing , and it seems worthwhile to spend the money up front to figure out what system is likely to scale to a market the size of the US .
In any case , the announcements make it clear that the US government is putting its money behind the plugin hybrid concept , rather than a pure electric vehicle .
They also make it clear that the administration is viewing the issue as part of a larger whole — Obama specifically mentioned that this effort should n't be seen as separate from the efforts to upgrade the electric grid .
" It wo n't come without cost , nor will it be easy , " he said .
" We 've got 240 million cars already on the road .
We 've got to upgrade the world 's largest energy grid while it 's already in use . "
Despite the challenges , Obama indicated that the effort was essential , saying , " We 'll do this because we know that the nation that leads on energy will be the nation that leads the world in the 21st century . "
Good news : The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) has added Nouriel Roubini and Simon Johnson to their advisory panel .
This should bring some badly - needed outside perspective to Congress .
Here ’s a quick overview of what the CBO does ( more on Roubini and Simon below ) :
What is the Congressional Budget Office ?
The CBO is a US Government Agency which employs ~ 235 people , mostly economists and public policy analysts .
Their job is to provide reports and data to Congress .
In theory , Congress should actually listen to this advice , and at least weigh it against the nonsense being whispered into their ear by bank lobbyists at Ruth ’s Chris .
CBO ’s Chairman is appointed jointly by The Speaker of the House ( Nancy Pelosi ) , and the “ President pro tempore of the Senate ” ( Robert Byrd ) .
The CBO ’s official mandate is to provide the Congress with two things :
Objective , nonpartisan , and timely analyses to aid in economic and budgetary decisions on the wide array of programs covered by the federal budget and
The information and estimates required for the Congressional budget process .
About the New CBO Panel Members
Simon Johnson is the former Chief Economist for the IMF , and has become a leading voice in the fight against corruption .
His blockbuster article in the Atlantic , The Quiet Coup , is required reading for any self - respecting bear / skeptic / realist .
In that piece , he explains how the finance industry has effectively seized control of our government .
Mr. Johnson seems like an ideal reformer .
He is civil , logical , and respectful in his critiques of the current system .
He does n’t go around calling for bankers ’ heads and revolution .
That approach wo n’t work against the entrenched power structure in Washington .
We have to play nice , for now .
Johnson seems to have the integrity , credibility , independence , and maybe even the influence to accomplish important things .
We should support guys like this .
His interview with Bill Moyer is a must - watch :
Nouriel Roubini teaches econ at NYU and is Chairman of RGE Monitor , an econ consulting firm .
The mainstream media has dubbed him Dr. Doom .
In an interview with Newsweek , Mr. Roubini noted that a better nickname would be Dr. Realist .
And it ’s an excellent point he makes .
So - called “ bears ” like Roubini are usually dismissed by CNBS as short - sellers , pessimists , doomsayers , party - poopers , etc .
But all they ’re trying to do is steer the economy away from a disastrous course .
This clip is a good example of two logical economic bears , Nassim Taleb and Nouriel Roubini , being assaulted by a giddy group of morons on CNBS :
After suffering court action that cost the family $ 100,000 , Liam Sheahan believes clearing trees saved his home and his family .
Credit : Paul Rovere
Anger at government policies stopping residents from cutting down trees and clearing scrub to protect their properties is already apparent .
" We 've lost two people in my family because you dickheads wo n't cut trees down , " Warwick Spooner told Nillumbik Mayor Bo Bendtsen at a meeting on Tuesday night .
Although Liam Sheahan 's 2002 decision to disregard planning laws and bulldoze 250 trees on his hilltop property hurt his family financially and emotionally , he believes it helped save them and their home on the weekend .
" The house is safe because we did all that , " he said as he pointed out his kitchen window to the clear ground where tall gum trees once cast a shadow on his house .
" We have got proof right here .
We are the only house standing in a two - kilometre area . "
At least seven houses and several sheds on neighbouring properties along Thompson - Spur road in Reedy Creek were destroyed by Saturday night 's blaze .
Saving their home was no easy task .
At 2 pm on Saturday , Mr Sheahan saw the nearby hills ablaze .
He knew what lay ahead when the predicted south - westerly change came .
The family of four had discussed evacuation but decided their property was defensible , due largely to their decision to clear a fire break .
It also helped that Mr Sheahan , his son Rowan and daughter Kirsten were all experienced members of the local CFA .
" We prayed and we worked bloody hard .
Our house was lit up eight times by the fire as the front passed , " Mr Sheahan said .
" The elements off our TV antenna melted .
We lost a Land Rover , two Subarus , a truck and trailer and two sheds . "
Mr Sheahan is still angry about his prosecution , which cost him $ 100,000 in fines and legal fees .
The council 's planning laws allow trees to be cleared only when they are within six metres of a house .
Mr Sheahan cleared trees up to 100 metres away from his house .
" The council stood up in court and made us to look like the worst , wanton environmental vandals on the earth .
We 've got thousands of trees on our property .
We cleared about 247 , " he said .
He said the royal commission on the fires must result in changes to planning laws to allow land owners to clear trees and vegetation that pose a fire risk .
" Both the major parties are pandering to the Greens for preferences and that is what is causing the problem .
Common sense is n't that common these days , " Mr Sheahan said .
Melbourne University bushfire expert Kevin Tolhurst gave evidence to help the Sheahan family in their legal battle with the council .
" Their fight went over nearly two years .
The Sheahans were victimised .
It was n't morally right , " he said yesterday .
Dr Tolhurst told the Seymour Magistrates court that Mr Sheahan 's clearing of the trees had reduced the fire risk to his house from extreme to moderate .
" That their house is still standing is some natural justice for the Sheahans , " he said .
He said council vegetation management rules required re-writing .
He also called on the State Government to provide clearer guidelines about when families should stay and defend their property .
Houses in fire - prone areas should be audited by experts to advise owners whether their property is defensible , Dr Tolhurst said .
Mr Sheahan said he wanted others to learn from his experience and offered an invitation for Government ministers to visit his property .

He would also like his convictions overturned and fines repaid .
" It would go a long way to making us feel better about the system .
But I do n't think it will happen . "
What Alistair Darling offered us in this week 's budget was the worst of the left and the worst of the right .
On the one hand he promised a massive increase in taxation and on the other the prospect of unprecedented cutbacks in public services .
In an act of unusual political dexterity he combined the polices of Michael Foot with the inclinations of Mrs Thatcher – seldom has the complicity between New Labour and neo-liberalism been so manifest .
In so doing , Darling and Brown have managed to both enthuse and enrage the left and right in equal measure .
While this plays out the most bizarre consequences of the Blairite confusion of private and public interests , it merely repeats in extreme fashion the complete ideological bankruptcy at the heart of current thinking .
All of the above conceals a fundamentally blighted economy , one still governed by low wages , poor skills , miserable workers and a purely speculative capitalism .
As a whole Britain remains untouched by mass innovation , bedeviled by weak productivity , and in dire need of modern infrastructure .
In terms of the budget , the unaddressed middle of the present conundrum is public service reform or in short how do we get more for less ?
If we were able to genuinely innovate and produce real productivity gains in the public sector , then the need for both tax rises and service cutbacks would be mitigated .
Any genuine reform has however been eschewed in favour of public service reduction and state revenue raising .
Where is the budgetary recognition of the costs of productivity management through targets ?
Where is the drive to liberate services from external and internal managerialism ?
The much mooted Whitehall efficiency targets will only salami slice services , delivering a real drop in both quality and quantity .
Instead , now more than ever , what we need is widespread systemic reform to revolutionise public service delivery .
Everyone who works in the public sector can testify to evermore useless meetings about forms , paperwork and putative quality control .
Everywhere bureaucracy and accountability cripple workers and overwhelm systems and organisations .
More and more people are required to service less and less clients .
Even if targets are removed the system remains the same – and no genuine transformation takes place .
If we are to save the public sector from cuts and the private sector from taxes radical innovation is required .
Front line workers need to be de-managerialised and re-professionalised so that ethos and commitment can replace working by rote and dictation by form .
The real black hole in Labour 's political economy is not so much cash – though that is real enough – it is the absence of ideas .
Anonymously - sourced rumors from Asian trade publications should be taken with , like , four grains of salt , and this is no exception : Digitimes reports that OmniVision has received orders for 3.2 - megapixel CMOS sensors , for a new iPhone .
Advertisement
OmniVision , a known quantity in the industry , beat out Apple 's current CMOS supplier , Aptina , for the contract .
But the reporting one this is extremely brief and spares us virtually any details .
One gets the feeling that this particular rumor was held to a lower evidentiary standard than , say , a rumor about an Apple tablet , because it 's just so plausible — most of us would be surprised if the next iPhone does n't boost its camera resolution to 3.2 megapixels or beyond .

Oh , and there 's the throwaway secondary rumor attached to this whole thing too : Apple has apparently also ordered a 5 - megapixel CMOS sensor for " another product " set to be launched this year .
Despite being able to fully ascertain that the 3.2MP sensor is meant for the " next - gen iPhone " , Digitimes ' source evidently could n't tell them what the other sensor is for .
Hence the salt .

Kidnapping Capital of the U.S.A .
Washington too concerned with al Qaeda terrorists to care , officials say .
February 11 , 2009  --
In what officials caution is now a dangerous and even deadly crime wave , Phoenix , Arizona has become the kidnapping capital of America , with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone .
But local authorities say Washington , DC is too obsessed with al Qaeda terrorists to care about what is happening in their own backyard right now .
" We 're in the eye of the storm , " Phoenix Police Chief Andy Anderson told ABC News of the violent crimes and ruthless tactics spurred by Mexico 's drug cartels that have expanded business across the border .
" If it does n't stop here , if we 're not able to fix it here and get it turned around , it will go across the nation , " he said .
California Attorney General Jerry Brown warned that as the U.S. government focuses so intently on Islamic extremist groups , other types of terrorists – those involved with the same kidnappings , extortion and drug cartels that are sweeping Phoenix – are overlooked .
" Those [ criminals ] , for the average Californian or the average America , may be a more immediate threat to their well being , " Brown said .
In fact , kidnappings and other crimes connected to the Mexican drug cartels are quickly spreading across the border , from Texas to California .
The majority of the victims are either illegal aliens or connected to the drug trade .
An ABC News ' investigation uncovered horrific cases of chopped - off hands , legs and heads when a victim 's family does n't pay up fast enough .
" They 're ruthless , so now they 're ripping each other off , but doing it in our city , " Anderson said .

To try and combat the crime wave , the Phoenix police have created a special unit to handle the kidnappings called the Home Invasion Task Force , which has pulled more than a dozen officers off other assignments .
The crimes are occurring across the valley and in all types of neighborhoods , authorities warn .
Crimes Endanger More Than Just Victims
" These are very dangerous situations here , not only dangerous situations for our community , but also extremely dangerous for our officers who have to go out and track these guys and arrest these folks , " Anderson said .
Click here to watch a Phoenix police sergeant on the job .
In some cases , dozens of people at a time have been kidnapped .
They are often illegal aliens whose captors then demand ransom from the victims ' relatives in Mexico .
ABC News followed Sergeant Phil Roberts in Phoenix on a day when his unit was working on three on - going kidnapping cases and trying to find a victim in peril .
" Our victim 's probably being brutalized , he 's probably being beaten up and tortured and God knows what else is taking place , " Roberts told ABC News .
" And we do n't know whether he 's a legal or illegal .
We look at it as if he 's a human being .
He 's being tortured out there , and we 've got to do everything we can to try and rescue that individual . "

Downing Street is trying to downplay this as a “ blog story ” knowing that journalists and the public wo n’t be so interested in another online spat .
That attempt to spin the story away has failed , because everyone realises that it is in reality a story from the heart of Downing Street .
Downing Street ’s press office has been trying to get prominent Labour supporting bloggers into the studios to do rebuttal .
So far they have been unable to find someone credible to defend the indefensible .
It is also Downing Street that is quite deliberately hyping the Derek Draper angle – clearly he is disposable – but it cannot be emphasised enough that he is not the only recipent of these smears ideas .
Other well known spin doctors from the Brown camp are involved .
They have two objectives – to keep Gordon out of the story and save Tom Watson MP .
It is probably already too late for Damian .
Where is the Minister for Digital Engagement today ?
What was his exact role in the smear operation ?
He is referred to in Damian McBride ’s emails , he sits next to McPoison in Downing Street , and he of course is notorious for his use of the dark arts .
He also was involved with Sion Simon in a previous cringe making online attack video on Cameron that backfired badly – he has previous .
The smears are not of the usual rough and tumble of politics – they are obscene and sexually explicit – Guido spoke to Nadine Dorries MP last night , she told Guido that she will be consulting lawyers on Tuesday .
Can the Prime Minister ’s official Political and Press Adviser , a civil servant , survive losing a case for defamation to an opposition MP ?
If Gordon Brown keeps Damian McPoison in place , he is condoning his behaviour , again .
Where have they hidden Gordon ’s moral compass ?
It certainly is n’t anywhere to be seen in Downing Street .
Oakland nonprofit housing organization ( EBALDC ) retaliates against tenant activist with a 64 % rent increase , for blowing the whistle on scheme to displace hundreds of households from their housing with $ 10 million in funds to be used for major renovation projects citywide !
For Immediate Release : Contact : 510/763-1085 Lynda CarsonOakland housing nonprofit ( EBALDC ) retaliates against tenant activistOakland --
One of Oakland 's largest nonprofit housing organizations retaliates against tenant activist with a 64 % rent increase , for blowing the whistle on scheme to displace hundreds of households from their housing with $ 10 million in funds to be used for major renovation projects citywide .
On March 29 , 2009 , at around 11 : pm , East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation ( EBALDC ) , served a 60 Day Notice to tenant activist Lynda Carson , demanding a 64 % rent increase by June 1 , 2009 , after Carson recently wrote a number of articles and spoke at several Oakland City Council meetings in opposition to Oakland 's $ 10 million dollar renovation plans that will force up the rents on Oakland 's poor and will displace around 600 households from their housing in coming months .
This is a clear act of retaliation against someone for exercising their first amendment right to free speech by a large nonprofit housing organization ( Over $ 64 million in assets ) , against a low - income tenant activist for being in opposition to a $ 10 million scheme that will displace hundreds of households in the coming months .
In an April 9 , e-mail to Mary Hennessy , Director of Property Management for EBALDC , Lynda Carson said , " People must be free from retaliation when they file complaints or become public speakers , especially when they feel that something is so important they have to speak up , even if they fear retaliation from others , such as yourself .
" During March , 2009 , Oakland 's Rent Stabilization Program announced that allowable rent increases in Oakland were set at 0.7 % , starting July 1 , 2009 , through July 1 , 2010 .
Meanwhile , EBALDC a so - called Oakland nonprofit housing organization is demanding a 64 % rent increase from Lynda Carson for blowing the whistle on the scheme to displace hundreds of households from their housing with $ 10 million in funds to be used for major renovation projects citywide !

94606Effie's House510/763-1085 Re : Retaliation is Unlawful .
Resign Now !
Dear Ms. HennessyOn March 29 , 2009 , I was served a 60 Day Notice from your department ( Property Management ) demanding a 64 % rent increase for the rental unit I reside in .
I was advised by Clifford Gatewood that you are directly responsible for the rent increase , demanding a $ 340.00 per month rent increase from me .
At this point , I must warn you that RETALIATION is unlawful , and that you have violated state law by going after me with an obscene rent increase at this time .
With - in the past year , I filed complaints with the office of Oakland 's Code Compliance against EBALDC in regards to Effie 's House , and under California state law , rent increases or evictions are considered retaliation if served with - in one year of when complaints are filed .
I accuse you of retaliating against me , for going after me with a 64 % rent increase .
I accuse you of violating California state law , regarding retaliation .
I accuse you of abusing your power by going after me with unclean hands , just because you have power over me .
In addition , I know it upset you recently when I publicly spoke out against EBALDC in opposition to the $ 10 million dollar NOFA loans from the City of Oakland for renovation projects that will displace over 600 low - income renters from their housing .
There you were at the March 17 , Oakland City Council meeting , as a speaker asking for a loan on behalf of EBALDC , and there I was as a speaker telling the council that they should not give a loan to EBALDC that very same evening .
Low and behold , only 12 days after I was at that public meeting on March 17 , as an invited speaker at that City Council meeting directly speaking out against what it was that you wanted , and you then get angry and have the nerve to order your staff to jack up my rent by an extra $ 340.00 per month !
And I 'm on disability .
Have you lost your mind ?
You are not allowed to abuse your power like that !
People must be free from retaliation when they file complaints or become public speakers , especially when they feel that something is so important they have to speak up , even if they fear retaliation from others , such as yourself .
Ms. Hennessy , you are not fit to be in a position of power above others , and I must ask that you resign from any and all positions that have to do with housing for the poor , elderly and disabled .
I'm in no position to raise your rent because you publicly spoke out in opposition to what I wanted recently .
But unfortunately for me , that can not be said about yourself ... I also have a copy of the e-mail that was sent to you and others in " YOUR HOUSING GROUP " regarding YOUR rebuttal to my efforts to oppose the million dollar renovation schemes , that will displace hundreds of low - income households in coming months .
I 've clearly been targeted , by you and your group , in more ways than one .
I fully , understand your anger at me , but have to remind you that retaliation is unlawful , and that you have abused your power over me once to often .
Ms. Hennessy , I insist that you must immediately retract your demands for a 64 % rent increase from me , apologise for retaliating against me , resign from your position as director of property management with EBALDC , and resign from the board of directors at Non Profit Housing ( NHP ) .
Your treatment of me is not acceptable .
It is an abuse of power on your part , and clearly shows that you lack the integrity to be in a position of power over the poor , elderly , and disabled , when it comes to their housing .
I ask that you send me a letter of resignation from EBALDC immediately , along with a retraction of the 64 % rent increase that you are demanding from me in retaliation , including your letter of apology .
I look forward to to your immediate resignation .
Sincerely , Lynda Carson >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

PDTEight low - income apartment buildings , including four abandoned by a nonprofit organization , will receive $ 10 million worth of much - needed upgrades to make the units more habitable .
The Oakland City Council unanimously approved the loans Tuesday night and reassured residents who had worried that they might be displaced during renovations .
Any relocation would be temporary , and the relocation costs would be borne by the developer , said Marge Gladman , city housing manager , in response to a question by Councilmember Nancy Nadel ( Downtown - West Oakland ) , who said some of her constituents had raised the concern .
Gladman said tenants will be moved back when the work is done .
The money will come from a combination of federal funds and the city 's tax increment funding .
Deborah Butler , a resident of Effie 's House on East 19th Street , said the work could n't start too soon for her .
She was told she would n't have to move while the work is being done .
"
The building needs some serious , major work , " she said , ticking off a list that included upgrades to paint , appliances , outlets and pipes , among other things .
" My ( front ) door has shifted so I can see the outside light when it 's closed .
I had to move my bed away from the windows because the air ( and water ) came in .
" East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation will receive $ 1.26 million to renovate Effie 's House , as well as $ 1.1 million for the Hugh Taylor House on Seminary Avenue and $ 1.9 million for Slim Jenkins Court on Willow Street .
Resources for Community Development will receive $ 840,000 for the Drachma Housing Project complexes in West Oakland , $ 1.65 million for the Eldridge Gonaway Commons Project on Third Avenue , and $ 1.2 million for the Marin Way Court Apartments on International Boulevard .
Affordable Housing Associates will receive $ 1.1 million for the Oaks Hotel project on 15th Street , and the Unity Council will receive $ 540,000 for the Posada De Colores Apartments on Fruitvale Avenue .
" These buildings have been around 20 , 30 years and need work , " said Amie Fishman , director of East Bay Housing Organizations .
" These are really stable properties and communities .
" The money used on buildings owned by Oakland Community Housing Inc. will help the city transfer ownership of those properties to other stable nonprofit housing developers , Fishman said .
"
The city is putting aside resources , and the nonprofits are stepping up and saying they will take those on , " she said .

It was a setup .
The video purporting to show Vice President Joe Biden ‘s daughter Ashley snorting cocaine was preplanned by a man trying to get rich selling the tape , RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively .
The man , who is apparently a friend of Ashley ’s , even bought the cocaine and the hidden camera , our investigation has uncovered .
Click here to read the exclusive report of the tape and its contents
The Vice President has been one of this country ’s leading warriors in the fight against drugs and helped create the Drug Czar post .
But scandal exploded around him in the past few days when RadarOnline.com uncovered that a man was hawking a tape that shows a cocaine - snorting woman who looks identical to Biden ’s 27 - year - old daughter .
The seller represented that the woman is Ashley Biden and hired a Washington , D.C. law firm to help him sell the tape .
Biden has not commented and his daughter has been unreachable .
RadarOnline.com viewed the tape but did not offer to purchase it .
The man who made the tape shopped it to several media outlets but did not receive any written offers , we ’ve learned .

There may be a few pea-sized chunks of butter remaining ; that ’s fine .
3 . Pour over 3 / 4 cup heavy cream and then pulse 4 to 6 times just to moisten the dough .
Do not overmix or the dough will be tough .
4 . Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gather into a shaggy mass .
Knead 3 to 4 times to make it cohesive and then pat into a rough circle 6 to 7 inches in diameter and a fairly consistent 3 / 4 to 1 inch in thickness .
5 . Using a sharp knife , cut the circle into 6 wedges .
Brush the tops very lightly with heavy cream ( there should be enough left in the measuring cup ) and sprinkle lightly with the coarse sugar .
6 . Transfer to a cookie sheet and bake until risen and golden brown , 18 to 20 minutes .
Turn the pan around halfway through to ensure even cooking .
Remove to a cooling rack .
Strawberries and assembly
3 pints strawberries , washed , hulled and quartered
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 cup whipping cream , beaten to soft peaks
1 . While the shortcakes are baking , toss the strawberries , sugar and orange juice together in a bowl .
Let stand several minutes .
( If the strawberries are extremely firm , do this 30 minutes in advance . )
2. Split the shortcakes in half horizontally and set the tops aside .
Place the bottoms on dessert plates and heap strawberries over them .
Spoon whipped cream generously over the strawberries and replace the shortcake tops .
Serve immediately with any remaining whipped cream on the side .

The EPA 's first action could cut emissions from cars
The US government is to regulate carbon dioxide emissions , having decided that it and five other greenhouse gases may endanger human health and well - being .
The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) announced the move following a review of the scientific evidence .
The decision marks a major change from the Bush presidency , when the EPA argued it could not regulate CO2 because the gas was not a pollutant .
Developing countries have asked for the US to show leadership on climate .
Many are not prepared to curtail their own emissions without firm indications that the US is willing to make significant reductions .
This reclaims the US role on the international stage as a leader
Phyllis Cuttino
Pew Environment Group Carbon - cutting legislation is being proposed in Congress , but the EPA decision - known as an " endangerment finding " - will allow the agency to mandate some cuts without waiting for the draft bills to become law .
" This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations , " said EPA administrator Lisa Jackson .
" Fortunately , it follows President Obama 's call for a low - carbon economy and strong leadership in Congress on clean energy and climate legislation ; and ... the solution is one that will create millions of green jobs and end our country 's dependence on foreign oil . "
' Disproportionate impacts '
In 2007 , the Supreme Court instructed the agency to review the evidence on climate change with a view to reconsidering its stance on the possible threats of climate change .
In the endangerment finding , the EPA now cites a number of impacts that it believes may impact significantly on US citizens , including : an increased risk of droughts and floods
sea level rise
more intense storms and heatwaves
harm to water supplies , agriculture and wildlife Ms Jackson concluded that these impacts would fall disproportionately on people who were poor or in ill health , and on indigenous groups .
The EPA quoted a 2007 report by a group of retired generals and admirals who said that climate change presented " national security challenges " for the US .
Lisa Jackson said Mr Obama would prefer new legislation on climate Environmental groups said this was the latest sign that the Obama administration is taking a very different line on climate change from its predecessor .
" This reclaims the US role on the international stage as a leader , " said Phyllis Cuttino , director of the US global warming programme at the Pew Environment Group in Washington DC .
" The EPA 's next step will probably be to grant the ' California waiver ' , which would allow states to restrict tailpipe emissions , and that we expect to happen very soon , " she told BBC News .
Under the Bush administration , the agency denied California the right to set targets for vehicle efficiency , for which it needed a waiver from federal law .
At least 15 states plan to follow California 's lead .
The EPA 's decision now goes out to public consultation .
The agency says it will " conduct an appropriate process and consider stakeholder input " before imposing restrictions on any part of the economy .
The endangerment finding also empowers the EPA to regulate the other five greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol - methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride .

Super - tough sunshield to fly on the James Webb Space Telescope

( click to enlarge )
Imagine sunglasses that can withstand the severe cold and heat of space , a barrage of radiation and high - speed impacts from small space debris .
They do n't exist , but Northrop Grumman engineers have created a Sunshield for NASA 's James Webb Space Telescope that can withstand all of those elements .
The space telescope needs a Sunshield to block heat from the sun so its cameras and instruments can operate properly a million miles from the Earth , when it launches in 2013 .
Any satellite that flies in the depths of space has to be able to withstand the rigors of space , including the icy cold or the intense heat and radiation of a solar flare .
Temperatures in space can range from a super - hot 400 K ( 260 F ) to a frigid 30 K ( - 406 F ) .
In addition , the Webb telescope 's Sunshield will be bombarded with tiny meteorites ( sand - like grains ) and radiation in space , so it has to be tough .
It has to stand up against those things , as well as tension and aging under the extreme space environments .
" The Sunshield 's ' aging ' occurs from extreme sunburn , " said Mark Clampin , NASA 's Webb Telescope Observatory Project Scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md .
Blocking light and heat from the sun will keep the observatory operating at cryogenic ( cold ) temperatures , enabling its infrared sensors to see distant galaxies , early stars , and planetary systems .
That 's important because infrared sensors actually measure the heat given off from far away galaxies and stars .
Shaded and protected from the Sun , the Sunshield allows the telescope to cool down to a nice and chilly 40 K ( - 387 F ) .
Any warmer than that and the heat given off from the telescope would corrupt the data .
" If you could imagine , this would be like going outdoors applying sunscreen of ' SPF ' of 1.2 million on your skin , " said Martin Mohan , Program Manager for the Webb Telescope at Northrop Grumman , Redondo Beach , Calif .
" Previous to this crucial technology , materials with thermal properties that reflect the sun without being heated did not exist . "
Jonathan Gardner , NASA 's Deputy Senior Project Scientist for the Webb Telescope at Goddard said " Infrared is heat radiation .
In order to see the faint glow of infrared heat from distant stars and galaxies , the telescope has to be very cold .
If the telescope were heated by sunlight or the warm glow of the Earth , the infrared light emitted by the telescope would outshine its targets , and it would n't be able to see anything . "
It would be a lot like going to a movie theatre where they never turned down the house lights .
Your eyes would n't see the screen very well because they would be swamped by the photons coming from the theatre surroundings
So what are these super - tough Sunshields made of ?
These super - tough Sunshields are made from a polymer - based polyimide film , DuPont™ Kapton ® E .
What 's most impressive about their strength is that each Sunshield " membrane " layer is about as thick as a human hair ( one to two - thousandths of an inch thick ) .
The layers are separated from each other and held in place at the center and tensioned by six perimeter booms and perimeter cables .
There are five layers of the Sunshield in all .
An alloyed silicon coating is applied to the sun-facing side of the two lowest layers ( Layers 1 & 2 ) , while " Vapor Deposited Aluminum " is coated on the rear surfaces of Layers 1 and 2 and both surfaces of Layers 3 , 4 and 5 .
The semi-conductive silicon coating is very good at reflecting the sun 's energy while the nice and shiny aluminum layers are chosen to reflect out to space any of the sun 's heat that does get by the first two layers .
These coatings and Sunshield geometry work together to reduce the 250 , 000 watts of the sun 's energy that hits the first sun facing layer to less than 1 watt by the time it works its way to the fifth and last layer .
Manufacturing and Testing
The continuous production of coating the Kapton E film is done by Northfield , Minn. based at Multek Flexible Circuits ( Sheldahl Technical Materials ) .
The fabrication of the Sunshield membranes is performed by the Huntsville , Ala. based Mantech - SRS Technologies and integrated with the Sunshield structure at Northrop Grumman 's Space Park facility in Redondo Beach , Calif .
In order to demonstrate that the membrane material and basic construction seams will retain their thermo-optical and structural integrity , a 6 - year development and testing program was performed by Northrop Grumman , the main contractor on the James Webb Space Telescope .
The program 's purpose was to show that the membrane material performs well in all relevant operational environments .
In those tests , basic mechanical properties of the Kapton E material were measured at extremely hot and frigid temperatures and under simulated space radiation at Aerospace Corporation .
Other radiation exposures were done at University of Dayton Research Institute and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center 's Solar Wind Facility , Huntsville , Ala. to evaluate the stability of the membrane coatings .
Hypervelocity impact tests up to 12 kilometers per second ( 7.4 miles / second ) of meteoroid - like sand particles were performed on tensioned , irradiated membrane material at extreme hot and cold temperatures at Auburn University 's Hypervelocity Impact Facility .
The durability of the thin coatings was also demonstrated under representative ground handling and packaging / deployment environments .
The strength and durability of membrane seaming joints and other design features were also tested under irradiated , extreme temperature environments , as was the resistance to tearing of the Kapton E .
The materials passed all the tests .
Each layer of the Sunshield is about 150 meters2 ( ~ 1600 feet2 ) or approximately the size of a tennis court .
Recently , at Northrop Grumman , in Redondo Beach , Calif .
a 5 layer Sunshield test sample was being folded and deployed to validate design concepts .
The materials are so large that when stretched out , it looks like a giant spider web .
Clampin said " To imagine how the Webb telescope Sunshield will appear , imagine 5 Sunshield layers the size of a tennis court and the thickness of a candy wrapper .
The Webb telescope 's Sunshields present new challenges , for instance how do you fold a candy wrapper the size of a tennis court ? "
That 's exactly what Webb Telescope engineers have figured out .
Due to its large size , the Sunshield must be compactly folded , much like a parachute , around the telescope in order to fit it into its launch rocket .
Once it's on the way to its final orbit , approximately 1 million miles from the Earth , engineers at Northrop Grumman will issue commands to the Webb telescope to unfold the Sunshield .
WS
GIHandler class and the supporting
WSGIRequest class can be found in
. py Python module .
Here is a simple illustration o
f what the mod
ule prov
id
es
.
Just as a brief overview of what this module contains , I 'll simply describe each of the four classes shown above .
First , the HttpRequest class provide the basic HTTP request attributes and methods .
The BaseHandler class provides attributes and methods common to all handlers .
The WSGIRequest class is a specialized HTTP request .
The WSGIHandler class is a specialized handler .
The WSGIHandler class depends on the WSGIRequest class because it instantiates the request instances .
This is done by setting the WSGIRequest class as the request_class attribute .
There are two aspects of the WSGIHandler class that I find interesting .
First , this class is n't instantiated .
There is no __init__ ( ) method defined and all attributes are class attributes .
However , the __call__ ( ) method is defined so this class can actually be invoked is if we were creating an instance only we get a response object returned instead .
At the beginning of the __call__ ( ) method , the WSGIHandler class acquires a threading lock .
This lock is than released after the middleware has been loaded .
Second , each middleware method is than cumulatively invoked on the response so as to filter it .
Very cool !
WSGI handlers in the Django Python web application framework are used to provide the WSGI Python interface .
This means that the Django framework can easily support middleware projects that manipulate the response sent back to the client .
The code for the
Microchip that tells the GP if you ’ve taken your pills
New technology : Doctors could soon monitor whether a patient has taken medication by microchips in pills
Microchips in pills could soon allow doctors to find out whether a patient has taken their medication .
The digestible sensors , just 1 mm wide , would mean GPs and surgeons could monitor patients outside the hospital or surgery .
Developers say the technology could be particularly useful for psychiatric or elderly patients who rely on a complicated regime of drugs – and are at risk if they miss a dose or take it at the wrong time .
It could also be used for the chronically ill , such as people with heart disease , to establish whether costly drugs are working or whether they are causing potentially dangerous side effects .
The sensors could even remind women to take the Pill if they forget .
The ‘ intelligent ’ medicine works by activating a harmless electric charge when drugs are digested by the stomach .
This charge is picked up by a sensing patch on the patients ’ stomach or back , which records the time and date that the pill is digested .
It also measures heart rate , motion and breathing patterns .
The information is transmitted to a patient ’s mobile phone and then to the internet using wireless technology , to give a complete picture of their health and the impact of their drugs .
Doctors and carers can view this information on secure web pages or have the information sent to their mobile phones .
The silicon microchips are invisible to patients and can be added to any standard drug during the manufacturing process .
Two major drugs companies are investigating the technology , developed by US - based Proteus Biomedical .
Trials are to begin in the UK within 12 months .
Professor Nick Peters , a cardiologist at Imperial College London , who is co-ordinating
trials , said the technology was ‘ transformative ’ .
‘ This is all about empowering patients and their families because it measures wellness , and people can actually be tracked getting better , ’ he said .
‘ Psychologically speaking , that ’s hugely helpful for patients and enormously reassuring for carers .
‘ Normally patients would have to be in hospital to get this level of feedback , so the hope is that it frees up beds and saves the NHS money . ’

Shakespeare , however , does .
Many are bawdy : puns operate , after all , on double entendre .
Yet the poet is guilty less of punning than wordplay , which Elizabethan taste considered more a sign of literary refinement than humor ; hence “ puns ” in seemingly inappropriate places , like a dying Mercutio ’s “ Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man . ”

The true punster ’s mind cycles through homophones in search of a quip the way small children delight in rhymes or experiment babblingly with language .
Accordingly , the least intolerable puns are those that avoid the pun ’s essential puerility .
Richard Whately , Archbishop of Dublin , was a specialist .
He could effortlessly execute the double pun : Noah ’s Ark was made of gopher - wood , he would say , but Joan of Arc was maid of Orleans .
Some Whately - isms are so complex that they nearly amount to honest jokes : “ Why can a man never starve in the Great Desert ?
Because he can eat the sand which is there .
But what brought the sandwiches there ?
Why , Noah sent Ham , and his descendants mustered and bred . ”
Whately shows us that it is the punner himself who gives his art a bad name , by so frequently reaching for the obvious .
Nothing vexes so much as a pun on a name , for instance .
Yet even these can rise to wit if turned with finesse .
Jean Harlow , the platinum - blond star of the 1930s , on being introduced to Lady Margot Asquith , mispronounced her given name to rhyme with “ rot . ”
“ My dear , the ‘t ’ is silent , ” said Asquith , “ as in Harlow . ”
The writer Andrew Lang asked his friend Israel Zangwill if he would take a stand on an issue .
Zangwill wrote back : “ If you , Lang , will , I. Zangwill . ”
Why do puns offend ?
Charles Lamb , a notorious punster , explained that the pun is “ a pistol let off at the ear ; not a feather to tickle the intellect . ”
Surely puns silence conversation before they animate it .
Some stricken with pun-lust sink so far into their infirmity that their minds become trained to lie in wait for words on which to work their wickedness .
They are the scourge of dinner tables and the despised prolongers of office meetings , some letting fly as instinctively as dogs bark and frogs croak , no longer concerned even with drawing applause ; they simply can’t help themselves .
How many festivals have been arranged in this current crazy era of covid-2019 ?
Most of them , maybe all of them have been canceled or then postponed to the later timing .
The map of European festivals have mostly been blank and totally dead .
Some countries allowed these big gatherings …

WASHINGTON  The Justice Department moved on Wednesday to drop all charges against former Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , who lost his seat last year just days after being convicted on seven felony counts of ethics violations .
The case was one of the most high profile and bitterly fought in a string of corruption investigations into current and former members of Congress .
But Justice Department lawyers told a federal court Wednesday that they had discovered a new instance of prosecutorial misconduct , on top of earlier disclosures that had raised questions about the way the case was handled , and asked that the convictions be voided .
The attorney general , Eric H. Holder Jr. , said he would not seek a new trial .
Mr. Stevens , 85 , was the longest - serving Republican in the history of the Senate and Alaska ’s dominant political figure for more than four decades .
His career mirrored the state ’s rough - and - tumble journey from a remote territory to an economic powerhouse as he used his influence to send billions of dollars in federal aid to Alaska .
The collapse of the Stevens case was a profound embarrassment for the Justice Department , and it raised troubling issues about the integrity of the actions of prosecutors who wield enormous power over people they investigate .
Mr. Stevens ’s case was handled by senior officials of the department ’s Public Integrity Section , which handles official corruption cases .

A teenager 's first concert is a rite of passage of sorts , and in San Francisco , that rite often is undertaken at one of the city 's inexpensive , small , all - ages music clubs - a type of business that owners warn might not survive much longer because of new enforcement efforts by state alcohol officials .
Bay Area natives probably can recall their first show at the Fillmore , one of San Francisco 's most famous music halls and the site of performances that span generations of music - from Jimi Hendrix to The Roots .
These days , music fans might go to Potrero Hill 's Bottom of the Hill club , the Tenderloin 's Great American Music Hall or Cafe du Nord in the Castro .
Those venues could be forced to close , owners say , if the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control , better known as ABC , continues to impose rules that club attorneys argue are legally questionable and often unrelated to booze or safety issues .
Some of the clubs say they only recently learned about the new rules , which are not written into state law and have n't been enforced in the past .
For example , ABC has decreed that at least half of the clubs ' revenue must come from food sales .
The agency also is taking issue with minor operating changes , such as one club 's decision to open an hour later .
In almost every case , the San Francisco clubs who have been battling ABC have the support of neighbors and local leaders .
ABC officials , meanwhile , wo n't comment on most pending cases but insist that they are not overstepping their authority .
A spokesman said the agency is taking appropriate action to protect the public .
Yet the ABC rules have some in the industry worried about where local bands will get their first break and where young people will go to experience live music if the clubs cease to exist .
" Without these businesses , there 's no local music scene - it's that simple , " said Jordan Kurland , co-owner of San Francisco 's Noise Pop music festival .
" It 's such a special experience when you are young to see a band you love in an intimate place ... where they are able to charge a more reasonable ticket price .
These small - capacity venues are very generous about paying bands , and , like any club in the world , they predominantly make their money off the bar , not off ticket sales . "
Not an eating place
All of the clubs fighting the ABC - Bottom of the Hill , Slim's , Cafe Du Nord and Great American Music Hall - are licensed to operate as all - ages venues because they serve food .
Historically , however , they have made most of their income from alcohol and ticket sales .
According to state law , businesses with that type of license must regularly serve meals - but the code makes no mention of a minimum sales requirement .
Still , some clubs have conditions set on their license by the ABC , such as a requirement that food sales exceed alcohol sales .
But that was n't the case at the Great American Music Hall , a storied 38 - year - old venue where the Grateful Dead recorded " One From the Vault . "
There were no conditions on the permit , which was last issued six years ago when the ownership changed , but the venue is being been targeted by the ABC anyway .
ABC spokesman John Carr said the scrutiny has come because the club has " had a substantial change to its operation from that represented in their license application . "
He said the agency determined that the legendary venue is not operating as a " bona fide public eating place . "
" Instead , they have altered the character of their business and are operating more like a club , " he wrote in an e-mail to The Chronicle .
Carr said a change matters because any ABC license - and public input on it - is based on a club 's business plan .
Club owners and their lawyers counter that the " business plan " the ABC is referring to is a state form filled out before a license is issued and that the form requires only that the agency be notified if the physical premises change .
Dawn Holliday , who owns a small stake of Slim's and the Music Hall and manages both venues , vehemently disagreed with Carr 's assertion that the business has changed .
If anything , she said , the Music Hall might serve more meals now than it did in years past .
But it has always been a music club , Holliday said .
" The Great American Music Hall has n't changed since 1971 - I know because I 've been going there since then , " Holliday said .
" I want to sell food , and not just because we 're dictated to do it .
I do n't think bands should play without eating ... ( but ) it 's not a majority of our income . "
Bottom of the Hill also has come under fire for the minimum food requirement , though in that case it was a condition of the license .
" Thirty or 35 percent of our sales come from food on our best days , " said Tim Benetti , co-owner of Bottom of the Hill , which has been around for 18 years .
" If ABC gets what they want , we will go out of business .
Can you imagine San Francisco without Slim's , Bottom of the Hill or Cafe Du Nord ?
I can't . "
Carr said Bottom of the Hill 's license has required the club 's alcohol sales to be less than its food sales since 2001 , when the ownership changed slightly and it had to reapply for a liquor license .
Benetti acknowledged that the club agreed to the condition but said the owners felt pressured .
The company immediately afterward hired a lawyer to challenge the agency 's authority to set such a requirement .
Carr said generally the agency imposes conditions in response to community complaints or adds them after a " disciplinary process . "
Authority questioned
John Hinman , the attorney representing Cafe Du Nord , said his club was chastised by the ABC for opening to the public at 7 p.m. instead of 5 p.m. , the hour owners put on their application form more than 15 years ago .
The owners explained that they open at 5 to feed the bands , Hinman said , but the ABC still challenged their state liquor license .
The agency also demanded that the club start selling at least as much food as alcohol , he said , even though that condition was never on the license .
The case was dismissed by an ABC judge , but Hinman said he expects the agency to refile the complaint .
He argued that there is no statutory basis for the rules , which he contends are being made up by the ABC without any communication to club owners .
" I do n't know if we 're supposed to call the Dionne Warwick psychic hot line or what , " added Holliday .
The fight has caught the attention of neighbors , the music industry and elected officials , including San Francisco Supervisor Sophie Maxwell and state Sen .
Mark Leno , who in February sent a letter to the attorney general 's office asking for a legal opinion on the ABC 's authority .
The office this week declined to weigh in , Leno said , because some of the matters are still in litigation with the ABC .
Leno said he will meet with ABC officials on Monday to express his concerns .
He noted that tourism is one of the city 's biggest job generators and said he has n't heard of similar restrictions in other cities .
" I believe the ABC has a job to do - of course enforcing the current law and protecting public safety , but also protecting the well - being of businesses , " he said .
" In San Francisco , we 're doing very well at working out our differences locally , and when you have this outside force that has the power to issue and revoke license and put small businesses out of business , I take it very seriously . "
Some San Franciscans , including Maxwell and Bottom of the Hill neighbor Kepa Askenasy , said they are baffled by the attention since the clubs in question have always had good reputations locally .
Maxwell said she has received no complaints about Bottom of the Hill and noted that it is seen as a family venue .
" It 's part of our culture , " Askenasy said .

Édouard - Léon Scott in his own words
Ever since First Sounds evoked the sound of Au Clair de la Lune from his 1860 recording , Édouard - Léon Scott de Martinville ( 1817 - 1879 ) has been receiving a lot of attention for his invention of the phonautograph - the first instrument to record airborne sounds capable of being played back .
As reliable information about Scott 's work is not readily available , First Sounds is publishing his phonautograph - related writings in the original French and in English translation , along with facsimiles of associated manuscripts and diagrams .
We hope the ready availability of Scott 's ideas , expressed in his own words , will foster a better understanding of his goals , his accomplishments , and his legacy .
Push and Pull Databases To and From Heroku
Listen to this article
Warning :
This feature is deprecated ; please use pg:pull instead .
A frequent question people ask us is “ how do I transfer my database between my local workstation and my Heroku app ? ”
This is an important question for several reasons .
First , you always own your data on Heroku , and we want you to be able to get to it quickly and easily at any time .
Also – as you may have noticed from previous posts – we ’re obsessive about workflow .
Whether you ’re debugging an issue with production data or setting up a staging environment , being able to quickly pull / push data between environments is key to a smooth experience .
Previously , we offered yaml_db as a solution .
We liked that it was simple and database agnostic , but parsing large YAML files is just too slow .
We also wanted something that works with any framework compatible with our Rack - based platform .
Ricardo , Blake and Adam came up with Taps , which was released last month as a standalone project .
Having collected some quality feedback from the community , we ’re now pleased to announce that Taps is officially baked into Heroku , allowing seamless and easy database transfer between Heroku apps and any external environment .
To try it out , install the latest Heroku gem .
Then use the “ db:pull ” command to pull your database down from your Heroku app to your local workstation :
$ heroku db:pull Receiving schema Receiving data 8 tables , 591 records users : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 pages : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 comments : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 tags : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 Receiving indexes Resetting sequences
This loads the schema , data , indexes and sequences of the remote Heroku database down into the local database specified in config/database.yml .
You can also specify the destination database using standard URI - syntax :
$ heroku db:pull mysql://root:mypass@localhost/mydb
Because Taps uses ActiveRecord ( for schema ) and Sequel ( for data ) , it seamlessly transfers between different database vendors .
In fact , if you do n’t feel like running a local database server , just use SQLite :
$ heroku db:pull sqlite:// path/to/my.db
Of course , the syntax for pushing your local database up to Heroku is equally simple :
$ heroku db: push Sending schema Sending data users : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 pages : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 comments : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 tags : 100 % |================================|
Time : 00:00:00 Sending indexes Resetting sequences
That ’s Taps in a nutshell .
It ’s live right now , so check it out and let us know how you like it .

It 's a good news day for Tesla Motors , the electric - carmaker behind the Tesla Roadster .
Tesla said the Department of Energy has granted the company $ 350 million in loans , to begin within the next five months .
The loans will be used to produce the Model S sedan , a four - door , five - seat electric vehicle now expected to go on sale by 2011 .
The company also reported - somewhat unexpectedly - it expects to be profitable by mid-2009 thanks to the $ 109,000 Roadster , which sold out its full production capability for 2008 .
Tesla will unveil a drivable prototype of the Model S on March 26 at the SpaceX rocket factory .
No clues yet on pricing for the Model S , but logic suggests it would need to be in the same price range as the much - anticipated Chevy Volt in order to compete .
In an added bonus , if you had the foresight and resources to purchase a Roadster , you 'll be first in line for the Model S and receive a $ 10,000 discount .
And to think I put my $ 110,000 into Lehman Brothers stock . . .

Neoliberalism and neoconservatism are two distinct political rationalities in the contemporary United States .
They have few overlapping formal characteristics , and even appear contradictory in many respects .
Yet they converge not only in the current presidential administration but also in their de-democratizing effects .
Their respective devaluation of political liberty , equality , substantive citizenship , and the rule of law in favor of governance according to market criteria on the one side , and valorization of state power for putatively moral ends on the other , undermines both the culture and institutions of constitutional democracy .
Above all , the two rationalities work symbiotically to produce a subject relatively indifferent to veracity and accountability in government and to political freedom and equality among the citizenry .

William Connolly has offered a different metaphor , that of the “ resonance machine , ” for capturing the relations or imbrication of different rationalities that together construct the contemporary political landscape , and especially for doing so without resorting to causality , crude materialism , theories of manipulation , or meta - theory .

In his Brief History of Neoliberalism ( Oxford : Oxford University Press , 2005 ) , David Harvey also explores the political and analytic relationship between neoliberalism and neo-conservatism .
But he regards them as largely issuing from the same source ( the corporate class ) and serving the same function , namely , restoration and consolidation of upper - class political and economic power from the dilution and crises it suffered in the third quarter of the twentieth century .
And even as the two “ isms ” vary on matters such as individualism and morality , he identifies the open state authoritarianism and militarism of neoconservatism with the prospect of rescuing neoliberalism from its contradictory relationship to the state and to freedom ( see 78 - 86 ) .
Harvey 's account is quite useful for debunking the common view of neoliberalism as anti-statist and also for linking neoliberalism to the imperial discourse of freedom promulgated in U.S. post–Cold War foreign policy ( see chs. 3 and 7 ) .
It is less useful for understanding the distinctions between neoliberal and neoconservative rationalities , their different sources of promulgation , and the chafing between them .

It is not strictly accurate to denote neoliberalism as amoral .
There is both its availability to utilization for governance aims such as law - abiding behavior or protection of the traditional family form , and there is its figuration of the subject as entrepreneur and normative promulgation of entrepreneurship itself .
However , neoliberalism takes distance from conventional moral discourse in its affirmation of a wholly instrumental rationality : it affirms market strategies across all fields of life and is formally indifferent to the ends for which these strategies are employed .

Frank 's depiction of the neoconservative strategy renders it brilliant and ( overly ) complete , one which is explicitly aimed at duping the working and middle classes about their “ real ” social and economic interests and using their resentment of liberals and concern with morality to do so .
In brief , he argues that by setting up an antagonism between an image of the little guy who is upright , moral , and hardworking , and an image of liberals characterized as elitist and profligate in every way , the neocons use a moral language ( Bush 's 2004 campaign theme of “ We share values ” ) to link the interests of the corporate class and those of the workers .
This language makes liberals rather than capitalism responsible for the vulgarity of culture and moral degradation , and identifies liberals primarily with support for gay marriage , abortion , women 's rights , secularism , and a free speech defense of pornography .
As this strategy thoroughly moralizes both the left and the right agendas , it metonymically associates all that each side stands for and gives everything from war , taxation , free trade , and welfare to the UN a moral valence .
This tactic also links the right with godliness , and positions God for the unborn and against homosexuality , and as a free market capitalist , an American , and a freedom fighter in the Islamic world .

While I am sympathetic to the content of these analyses , my worry about the move to use an old name ( especially one super - saturated with a particular history and signification ) for a new configuration of power is , first , that the novel aspects of this configuration may be insufficiently grasped and analyzed , and , second , that focus on the fascist dimensions of rule eclipses the importance of the faceless social and cultural forces of de-democratization I have emphasized in this essay .
In short , the nomenclature threatens to keep the focus on an oppressive “ them ” rather than a subjective “ us . ”

Michael Causer had never even considered concealing his sexuality : he was proud to be gay .
He grew up in a tight - knit family in a working - class suburb of Liverpool , and friends would describe the trainee hairdresser as a “ little sweetheart ” .
He was a gentle young man on the cusp of adulthood who “ would n’t hurt a fly ” ; someone who loved his many friends and adored life .
But last July , as the 18 - year - old lay in an upstairs bedroom at an after - pub party , sleeping off the effects of a night ’s drinking , he was viciously assaulted and his bleeding body dumped outside in the street .
The attack took place at the home of a friend ’s grandmother , in the Liverpool suburb of Huyton .
Nine days later , his family took the heart - breaking decision to turn off his life - support system but vowed that whoever had assaulted him would be brought to justice .
“ We wo n’t let Micky be pushed aside because he was gay , never in a million years , ” they vowed .

On Friday however , Mr Causer ’s family and friends who had packed into the public gallery at Liverpool Crown Court to hear a jury decide on Gavin Alker , a 19 - year - old man accused of carrying out his homophobic murder , were left in tears as the defendant was acquitted at the end of a three - week trial .
Last Sunday , 100 friends and relatives returned to the court precincts to express their sense of shock and outrage at the verdict and to demonstrate for what they see as justice in the case .
They said they are now hoping to launch a private prosecution .
“ We were so shocked at Friday ’s judgment .
Michael was made out to be a thug in that trial .
Gavin Alker claimed he acted in self - defence , ” said Mr Causer ’s mother Marie , holding her grand - daughter Daisy who her son had helped deliver just six weeks before his death , remaining “ tender and calm ” throughout the birth .
“ Michael weighed seven - and - a - half stone .
He could n’t have hurt a fly .
If anyone acted in self - defence that night it was Michael .
I want someone to explain to me how a lad who worked in an old people ’s home for free , who called bingo numbers , who volunteered for the British Lung Foundation ’s Breathe Easy scheme can be a thug , ” she said .
Before the trial , Mr Causer ’s one - time friend James O’Connor , 19 , of Runcorn , admitted murder but denied he had been motivated by the fact his victim was gay .
A second man Michael Binsteed , 18 , admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice .
Both are due to be sentenced later .
But Friday ’s decision means the judge must now decide on whether or not the attack was a hate crime .
According to evidence put before the jury , the trigger - point for the violence came when sexually explicit images of the trainee hairdresser were found on his mobile phone , prompting a “ sustained and brutal ” attack on his naked sleeping form and leaving him with a fractured skull and a swollen brain .
Mr Causer was punched , kicked and finally battered around the head with a heavy history book so forcibly that the book ’s spine broke , the court heard .
It was alleged that Mr Alker , who had never met Mr Causer , screamed “ You little queer faggot ” adding , “ He ’s a little queer , he deserves it . ”
During the trial it was also claimed that a cigarette lighter was used to burn the hair on Mr Causer ’s legs , and that threats were made to rip out his body piercings with a knife .
But the jury accepted Mr Alker ’s evidence that he had been acting in self - defence after he denied making homophobic comments , blaming the attack on O’Connor .
The murder has had a profound effect on Liverpool , a city which is busy re-inventing itself as a gay destination with the creation of its own gay quarter , referred to as the Gay Village , and plans for an annual Pride March .
Many in the city are puzzled at the lack of interest shown in the case by the outside world , Friday ’s acquittal again failing to generate national media attention .
Steve Radford , of the Liberal Party , who has been on the city council for three decades and has campaigned for the Gay Village , is saddened that Mr Causer ’s death has failed to generate the same sense of nationwide outrage as that of the black teenager Anthony Walker , who was killed in a racist attack as he crossed a park in Huyton in 2005 .

Though hundreds crammed into the church for Mr Causer ’s funeral , and thousands more signed books of condolence , campaigners including Mark Feehily from Michael ’s favourite band Westlife , are angry that no one seems to be listening .
“ It does make you question our social values .
We had a lot of positive comments made about the family of Anthony Walker , but here we had a tragedy which is homophobic but it is the word which will not speak its name , ” said Mr Radford .
Merseyside Police have won praise not only for pursuing Mr Causer ’s murder as a hate crime , but also for reaching out to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender communities in the wake of the tragedy .
Local officers cemented relations by taking part in a football match in a team captained by the city ’s Lord Mayor against a local side , the Mersey Marauders , made up of local gay men and members of the Causer family .
The senior investigating officer in the case , Detective Inspector Richie Carr , said serious violent homophobic crime was a rarity in the city .
“ This is the first time we are aware of anything like this .
We treated it as a hate crime .
We brought in to the inquiry people from the community to offer reassurance that there was not a maniac going round , but that the reality was that these were people who were known to the victim . ”
“ The general public ’s reaction was no different to that of the Anthony Walker case , but it has severely impacted on the gay community .
They want to see justice to be done , not just for themselves but for the wider society , ” he said .
Liverpool ’s gay community , confident in the support it has received from the police , fought hard to keep the case in the public eye .
In the days after Mr Causer ’s death , an emotional tribute was paid to him on the dance floors of the city centre ’s thriving gay clubs , when DJs led a silent tribute to the dead teenager .
“ You could hear a pin drop , there was a real sense of sadness and vulnerability , ” recalled Mr Radford .
Yet Liverpool ’s reputation as a city of tolerance took a severe hit in 2007 ahead of the Capital of Culture festivities .
Despite bequeathing the world gay men including Beatles manager Brian Epstein , Holly Johnson of the band Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Pete Burns , a report by the specialist research agency Stormbreak found that 60 per cent of lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender people in the city had experienced some form of homophobic crime – 12 per cent more than in London .
Statistics gathered by the gay rights group Stonewall suggest that 70 per cent of homophobic victims across the UK are still reluctant to come forward to report the crimes .
Some look to the church in Liverpool for leadership in reversing ignorance and prejudice in a city where 55 per cent of children are educated in a religious setting .
In the months after Michael Causer ’s death , every secondary school in the city was sent a DVD aimed at stamping out homophobic bullying in the classroom – now thought to account for 10 per cent of all cases .
But the journalist Andy Green , who writes under the byline of The People ’s Queen in the Liverpool Echo , believes Liverpool is a fundamentally good place to be for gay people , citing the council ’s recent decision to stage the first - ever Pride march here .
“ Michael ’s murder has galvanised the community and brought a lot of different groups together .
The atmosphere has been very solemn but there has been anger at the lack of national media coverage , ” he said .
It is a point likewise made by Ben Summerskill of Stonewall .
“ It is testament to the lack of seriousness with which these kinds of incidents are treated .
They are simply not regarded as newsworthy .
The BBC has reported every single murder of an adolescent in the past 18 months in this country as a national news story , but not this one . ”
Hate Crime : Victims of gay - bashing
Last year nearly 80 per cent of the 995 prosecutions in England and Wales for homophobic hate crimes resulted in conviction .
This number has risen steadily since the Criminal Justice Act 2003 , which gave the Crown Prosecution Service and the police authority to seek higher sentences from trial judges when an element of hate crime could be proved .
Campaigners say that nearly eight out of 10 homophobic offences still go unreported , while it has been suggested that between a fifth and a third of gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender men and women have fallen victim to so - called “ gay bashing ” .
The failure of victims to pursue legal redress continues to handicap cases and prosecutors still rely heavily on guilty pleas , which in 2007 / 8 accounted for 67 per cent of successful convictions .
In 2006 , two men were sentenced to serve at least 28 years in jail for the murder of gay barman Jody Dobrowski , who was punched and kicked as if “ trying to kill an animal ” on Clapham Common , south London .
Meanwhile , a recent study by the campaign group Stonewall found that almost two - thirds of lesbian and gay pupils surveyed in Britain ’s secondary schools have been victims of homophobic bullying .
Ford is betting the success of the Fiesta subcompact on the blogs , tweets and Facebook updates of 100 people who will live with the cars and share their experiences online .
It 's a hell of a gamble , but if it pays off , Ford just might recast itself as a cool company with a great product – no small feat for an American automaker .
Ford wants to generate buzz for the Fiesta , which will bring Europe 's " small cars can be cool " ethos to America when it arrives next year .
But rather than hand a bunch of them over to mainstream journalists , Ford broke with tradition by inviting dozens of 20 - somethings to live with the car for six months and tell the world about it .
" While were trying to build excitement and awareness for the vehicle with the Fiesta Movement campaign , there 's something bigger happening here , " Scott Monty , Ford 's social media boss , told Wired.com .
" We 're also going to be building broader awareness of Ford . "
Social networking sites sell everything from soda to singers these days , but the auto industry has been slow to catch on .
It might seem like a big risk – what if someone 's car craps out ?
But Ford , and the entire industry , for that matter , desperately needs to embrace the message it sends , said Ian Shafer , CEO of the marketing firm Deep Focus .
" It shows that Ford cares what customers think , " he said .
That 's supremely important when everyone is bashing Detroit and taxpayers wonder why they should pay to keep Chrysler and General Motors alive .
Something like the Fiesta Movement campaign also could give Ford an edge with a huge – and incredibly web - savvy – demographic .
Ford is n't shunning traditional advertising for the car , and it undoubtedly will invite the guys from Car & Driver , the Detroit Free Press and other mainstream outlets to review the Fiesta before it goes on sale at the end of 2010 .
But the healthiest of the Big Three wants to generate buzz for the car among " millennials , " those born between 1979 and 1996 .
Some 70 million millennials will be driving next year , and Ford is targeting the Fiesta squarely at them .
A Microsoft study found 77 percent of millennials use a social networking site like Facebook or MySpace daily and 28 percent of them have a personal blog .
That explains Ford 's marketing campaign .
Ford recently handed 100 Fiestas to 100 people selected from 4,000 applicants .
These " agents " – that 's what Ford calls them – get to use the cars for six months in exchange for completing monthly " missions " with different themes .
They 'll share their experiences through YouTube , Flickr , Facebook and Twitter accounts Ford created for the campaign .
It 's a smart move , Shafer said , because it plays into consumer demand for unofficial – read , unbiased – information about a new car .
By turning the marketing over to social networking sites , Ford provides its target audience with content generated by people within that audience .
Ford is taking a hands - off approach and telling participants not to hold back their opinions , bolstering the campaign 's credibility .
" We 've told them to be completely honest – that 's the only way it 's going to work , " Monty told us .
" We wo n't tell them what to say , nor will we censor or edit any of their content . "
So far , it 's working in Ford 's favor .
The tweets on the FordFiesta Twitter page are generally favorable , if a bit dry , as are the posts over at The Fiesta Movement Facebook page .
None of the 80 pictures on the Fiesta Movement Flickr page show broken down cars .
There are a few hundred videos on the FiestaMovement YouTube account if anyone 's got a few hours to kill .
There 's always a chance it could blow up in Ford 's face .
But the risk may not be as great as one might think .
The Fiesta has been wildly successful in Europe – Ford says it 's the second - best seller on the continent – and in Asia .
Monty 's confident the " agents " will give Ford a fair shake before posting a rant should something go wrong .
" As far as mechanical difficulties , let 's let common sense prevail , " he said .
" If you were driving one of our cars as part of this program , would n't you call for assistance first , rather than writing a blog post ? "
Still , even a breakdown or two could be good for Ford , just so long as the company handles any problems quickly and courteously , Shafer said .
" They could really look like a hero if they come through , " he said .
Monty says
Ford is ready for the challenge .
" We 've done a lot of war gaming and we 're prepared for a number of scenarios , " Monty told Wired.com .
" Again , we 're looking for their feedback and input on the vehicle – they 're testing the vehicle as much as they 're building buzz about it , and we want to know how to make it the best possible car . "

While checking out the massive collection of Creep ( Radiohead ) covers out there , we noticed that most singers are trying to mimic Thom Yorke 's voice instead of giving us their own take .
Face it , unless you ’re a little 6 year old girl and someone just stole your lollipop , you ’ll never reach the highs that Thom can .
We ’ve narrowed down today ’s Creep covers to a select few where the artists changed things up a bit .
Okay , we ’ll confess , we also slid in a few of the UpVenue favorites in the mix .
First , the originals ( both electric and acoustic ) :
Radiohead – Creep ( Original )
Radiohead – Creep ( Acoustic )
And on with the covers !
Bill Bailey ( Hindi Cover )
Pros : Very original arrangement .
Vocals are decent , backup singers are pretty good .
Better than expected .
Cons :
Takes forever until the song begins .
There ’s this water bubbling sound in the song that ’s very distracting .
Damian Rice ( Acoustic Cover )
Pros : Excellent cover , good range in his vocals .
Voice does n’t crackle at all .
Cons :
Too similar to the original , nothing new to see here .
KoRn ( Acoustic Cover )
Pros :
True to the original but with Jonathan Davis ’ unique voice .
Cons :
The pro we listed can also be taken in a bad way as we expected something a bit more unique and out there from KoRn .
Frank Bennett ( Jazz Cover )
Pros :
A jazzy tune that would work better for almost any other song .
Cons :
Too uplifting for creep , it ruins the experience .
It ’s hard to take the song seriously .
Northern Kings ( Creepy Cover )
Pros :
It ’s definitely creepy but for other reasons .
A unique spin on the song .
Cons : Would work better as a Tim Burton movie soundtrack .
The Pretenders ( Acoustic Cover )
Pros :
Very beautiful cover , good vocals .
Cons : I suppose if you think of it as a lesbian song , it could work ; Otherwise the lyrics make no sense .
G4 ( Opera Cover )
Pros :
The highs are really good , the performance is solid .
Even Simon Cowell liked it .
Cons :
It ’s a good cover but you ’ll never listen to it a second time .
Scarling ( Rock Cover )
Pros :
The guitar in the intro is great .
Soft voice .
Cons :
The music is overpowering Jessicka .
The electric guitar ’s overdrive is terrible .
Ingrid Michaelson ( Ukulele Cover )
Pros : Changed up the song a bit .
Cons :
She keeps striking the exact same chord over and over .
Voice is too high pitched at times .
Nell ( Korean Cover )
Pros :
This is actually a great cover .
The music arrangement is completely different .
Cons :
He should stick with the manlier voice ; the feminin parts are really weak and distracting .
Kermit The Frog ( Muppets Cover )
Pros :
We now understand the pain Kermit is going through .
Cons : Damn you Ms Piggy !
Leave Kermit alone .

New high - resolution images taken last month of Mars ’ south polar region are revealing signs of spring that are decidedly Martian .
The image above features a spider trough network left behind as seasonal dry ice caps have sublimated away in the warmer temperatures .
It ’s part of a new series of images released this week by the University of Arizona ’s High Resolution Imaging Experiment , or HiRISE , aboard NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
See more information and photos below .
The gas beneath the ice cap can flow in the same places year after year , eroding troughs in the surface of the planet .
“ What happens on Mars , we think , is that as the seasonal ice cap thins from the bottom , gas underneath the cap builds up pressure , ” said HiRISE deputy principal investigator Candice J. Hansen - Koharcheck of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
“ And where gas under the ice finds a weak spot or a crack , it will flow out of the opening , often carrying a little dust from the surface below . ”
The next HiRISE image shows how dust that has been carried to the surface by gas jetting through the ice cap is blown about by prevailing winds before settling in fan - shaped deposits atop the ice cap .
Varying orientations suggest that as the ice layer thins , a set of gas jets becomes active , they die down , then further away another set starts up at a later time with a different prevailing wind direction .
Many jets appear to be active at the same time since numerous fans are all deposited in the same direction : this next , closer image is an example of such an occurrence .
This southern hemisphere crater has gullies on its north and northeast walls .
Gullies are proposed to be carved by liquid water originating from the subsurface or melting ice / snow on the surface .
Dark dunes are visible on the crater floor .
Lighter , smaller dunes rim the south side of the crater floor .
The entire scene , pictured below , has a pitted texture , suggesting that ground ice was once present in this region .
When ground ice sublimates ( goes from a solid directly to a gas ) , it leaves behind empty spaces in the soil that turn into pits as the remaining overlying soil collapses to fill them .
The full set of new HiRISE Mars images is here .

A security clampdown at a London club provides a troubling glimpse of the extent of privatised monitoring brought about by government policy .
A Reg reader drew our attention to complaints that visitors to fetish club Torture Garden must now hand over personal details before they are allowed to enter .
Our follow - up investigation gave disturbing new insights into the farming - out of ID checks and its implications ; as Phil Booth of No2ID puts it , " Two of the biggest sources of data insecurity over the next few years will be government policy and bureaucratic abdication of responsibility . "
Torture Garden regulars must provide details not because sado - masochists are believed to be more prone to violence than anyone else – in fact , research suggests that on the whole , they are often better behaved than the general public – but because Torture Garden events take place on the premises managed by SEOne Club .
Following a shooting incident ( not during a TG event ) , police requested a licensing condition that in future , " all persons entering the premises must supply verifiable identification details that are passed through a digital scanning and recording system such as Club Scan , Idvista or similar computerised system " .
They duly installed Clubscan – software and equipment developed by IDScan - and now all club - goers must submit one of a number of approved pieces of ID at the door before they are allowed to enter .
IDScan promotes its system on various grounds : it helps organisations comply with legislation , particularly that relating to licensing and age restrictions ; it is a useful marketing tool ; it assists in maintaining exclusion lists ; data can be shared amongst groups of clubs to create area exclusions ; and so on .
Its core function is its ability to read 223 different IDs and 162 different passports : it is capable of storing data including , as far as we can tell , name , address , photo and passport number .
It is password - protected , and we have had no complaints about its inherent security .
In the case of the SEOne set - up , a spokesman told us that only senior management can access it : that information on the system is password - protected , and the equipment is removed from the front door when the club is shut and locked in a secure place .
A spokesman added that data is retained on the system for three years , in order to comply with the Data Protection Act. IDVista make similar claims for their equipment .
According to its site , it " verifies the age and validity of your customers whilst building a unique data base enabling you to monitor , manage and market to your clientele " .
So where ’s the problem ?
According to Phil Booth , this is all about coercion through the licensing system and exploitation of a culture created by the Home Office .
In its drive toward ever greater security for young people .
the government have passed ever more punitive legislation aimed at separating young people from dangerous items .
Age limits for cigarettes and knives have both been raised .
Meanwhile , the penalties for retailers under legislation such as the Licensing Act 2003 have become ever more draconian .
Speaking in respect of another of IDScan ’s products , Agescan , MD Tamlyn Thompson said : " Any shops or licensed premises failing an underage test twice within three months will lose the right to sell the item in question .
AgeSafe is designed to both stop teenagers buying these products and also protect retailers ’ livelihoods . "
Credit where credit is due .
Sen . John McCain on Fox News this morning said , in no uncertain terms , that waterboarding is undoubtedly torture .
Reacting to the fact that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times , McCain had this to say :
One is too much .
Waterboarding is torture , period .
I can assure you that once enough physical pain is inflicted on someone , they will tell that interrogator whatever they think they want to hear .
And most importantly , it serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us .
Nice to see that McCain still has at least a few honest bones left in his body .
Good for him .
Update : Also appearing on Fox News , fired NYT columnist conservative commentator William Kristol claims to not understand what all the torture memo fuss is about :
Wallace :
As you read the memos and you learn what we did and how top Justice Department officials justified it , are you struck by how brutal we were or how careful we were ?
Kristol : How careful .
I mean has any other country at war gotten memos from the Justice Department ?
Extremely carefully of recent I would say .
Especially the Steve Bradbury 2005 memos before going ahead and trying to deal with the rather small number of terrorists who had been involved in murdering thousands of Americans and were very much intending to do more of that .. I think .. you read those memos , you think that ’s what everyone ’s so upset about .
Hmm , who should we listen to …
Coddled upper - crust douchebiscuit William Kristol or Sen. John McCain , who was repeatedly tortured at the hands of the Vietnamese … Hmm …
Update 2 : Super fringey ultra-wingnut Deroy Murdock has a charming piece up on the National Review that makes the argument that we should all be proud of waterboarding .
I wonder what Sen. McCain might have to say to this fine gentleman ?
Though clearly uncomfortable , waterboarding loosens lips without causing permanent physical injuries ( and unlikely even temporary ones ) .
If terrorists suffer long - term nightmares about waterboarding , better that than more Americans crying themselves to sleep after their loved ones have been shredded by bombs or baked in skyscrapers .
In short , there is nothing “ repugnant ” about waterboarding .
Update 3 : No one could have predicted that rabid Bush apologist David Rivkin would do a complete 180 on waterboarding .
In a December 2008 appearance on Al Jazeera English , Rivkin stated emphatically that torture is “ always unacceptable ” and that in his view “ waterboarding is torture “ :
RIVKIN : Let me clarify , torture in my view is always unacceptable , and in fact I frankly think characterizing American interrogation policy , or debates about interrogation policy , as torture is misleading .
…
Torture is defined somewhat imprecisely in international law , but basically , in my view , waterboarding is torture .
Fast forward to the present day ( a whopping four months later ) , and this is what the esteemed Mr. Rivkin has to say :
Update 4 : Andrew Sullivan sums up the “ debate ” about whether or not waterboarding is “ torture ” thusly :
Some programming language libraries have special queues that can be used to pass messages between threads in a multithreaded application .
Some languages , like Erlang or Termite Scheme , have message passing so ingrained that you'd be crazy not to use those features .
Programming with functions or objects is also a form of message passing .
In this case , calling a function or method is equivalent to sending a message to your program or to an object in your program .
Essentially , your program is communicating with itself .
But that 's still message passing .
Just like how people sometimes like to talk to themselves ( well , at least I do ) .
Message passing is the means by which processes communicate .
Much like humans communicate by talking to each other or writing notes to each other , so do computer programs communicate with each other .
Sockets and pipes are prime examples of message passing technologies .
Shared memory can also be used for message passing .
Message Passing with GTK
Here I am going to explain message passing between GTK and your custom main loop .
I am not explaining message passing inside GTK ( e.g. between GTK widgets - you 'll have to read the GTK docs for more info about that ) .
GTK has a so - called " idle loop . "
This idle loop is how you can interface with GTK 's main loop .
GTK has a special function called " idle_add " which lets us add messages to be processed in the idle loop .
I am going to describe two types of messages here :
Asynchronous messages
These are messages that you insert into GTK 's idle loop , but you do not care about getting a response .
Synchronous messages :
These are messages that you insert into GTK 's idle loop , but you do care about getting a response .
In the Python programming language , functions are first - class citizens that can be passed around just like normal data .
Thus , a message really is just a function reference ( or a functor ) that we inject into GTK 's idle loop .
GTK 's idle loop will merely call / execute the function .
In C , this is similar to putting a function pointer into a queue which another loop dequeues and then calls the function associated with that function pointer .
Asynchronous GTK Message
Here is the magic trick for asynchronous GTK messages in Python .
By the way , if this code looks like giberish to you , then read up on variable arguments and keyword arguments in Python .
You 'll also want to read about tuple unpacking in Python .
You might also want to read about higher order functions which is a concept from functional programming .
( Sorry , I know that is a long list of things to read about . ) : import gobject #
This is a function which takes a function as an argument and # returns yet another function ( this is what higher order functions # are all about ! ) .
( Side note : this can be invoked / applied with # Python 's decorator syntax , '@ ' , if you so desire . ) : def asynchronous_gtk_message( fun ) : def worker ( ( function , args , kwargs ) ) : # Apply is a function that takes a function as its first # argument and calls it with positional argument taken # from " args " and keyword arguments taken from " kwargs " : apply ( function , args , kwargs ) #
This is a special type of function known as a " closure " # ( although it is not quite as advanced as a closure in Lisp # or Ruby .
Challenge question : do you know why ? ) .
In C++ , # a class - based functor which defines operator ( ) ( or Boost .
Lambda ) # is the closest you can get to a closure : def fun2 ( * args , ** kwargs ) : # " worker " is none other than the function just defined # above ( with " def worker " ) : gobject.idle_add ( worker , ( fun , args , kwargs ) ) #
Here , the closure is returned and must be called at some later # point in the program : return fun2
The code above has a lot of comments , so here is the same code again with all the comments stripped out ( some people may find this easier to read ) : import gobject def asynchronous_gtk_message ( fun ) : def worker ( ( function , args , kwargs ) ) : apply ( function , args , kwargs ) def fun2 ( *args , ** kwargs ) : gobject.idle_add( worker , ( fun , args , kwargs ) ) return fun2 Despite being a few lines of code , there are some pretty deep programming concepts required to understand the code above .
But it is concise and expressive and fairly hard to introduce bugs ( because it is so simple ) .
Here is an example of using " asynchronous_gtk_message " to manipulate a web browser widget ( specifically , WebKit ) running in GTK : browser = ... # read about synchronous_gtk_message below to see what goes here ... asynchronous_gtk_message(browser.execute_script ) ( ' alert ( " oops " ) ' ) # or , alternatively : async_execute_script = asynchronous_gtk_message(browser.execute_script ) async_execute_script(' alert ( " oops " ) ')
Note that " asynchronous_gtk_message " does not actually do anything .
All it does is return a special function ( remember the closure from above ? ) .
And it is that special function which we must call whenever we want to actually send an asynchronous message .
Notice how we ignore the return value from the message ?
Well , that is what makes it asynchronous ;
And fast .
The story is told of a monk , a discicple , who was thirsty and at the edge of a body of salt water .
He asked his elder to pray that the water would be made sweet , and by the prayers of the elder , the water was made sweet .
After drinking his fill , he began to fill a bottle with water .
The elder asked him , " What are you doing ? " and when the disciple answered , reproved him , saying , " God is everywhere . "
I am somewhat the monk who needed a reproof .
I have been trying for maybe a decade to get to a monastery where I could receive long - term medical care for a serious condition .
I went to Mount Athos , but could n't stay , and am now glad for the fact that I could n't stay , as a schism has occurred and we are not in communion .
I 've made multiple attempts to get to Holy Russia , but they 've all gone dead , and now due to Covid I can not reach there .
The door is potentially open to Ukraine , but nothing has materialized yet .
Meanwhile , I have visited a monastery in Michigan , in the Upper Peninsula , and found several things I was n't expecting , including care for which pharmaceutical drugs are a supplement .
I have in the past experienced significant spiritual healing through repentance , and the hieromonk is willing to work with me there .
I am presently trying to raise $ 400 for the next round trip , and get over as soon as I could .
That would let me take steps in discernment before , God willing , becoming a monk .
I also found , to my surprise , that there is a good possibility I would be able to work towards my studies at the Archdiocesan seminary , and possibly reach my dream of helping form priests .

YEONPYEONG , South Korea ( Reuters ) - North Korea on Monday said it had put its armed forces on full combat readiness in response to the start of annual military exercises by U.S. and South Korean troops , raising tension on the divided peninsula .
In a statement read on state television , a fierce - voiced military official also warned that any attempt to shoot down the long - range missile the reclusive state plans to launch soon would be seen as an act of war .
Pyongyang routinely accuses the United States and South Korea of aggressive intentions with the exercises , but the rhetoric this time has been more strident .
It called the drills a provocation that would only occur “ on the eve of a war , ” and threatened to cut off its hotline with the South ’s military -- the one telephone link between the two armies who are massed either side of the border that has divided them for more than half a century .
U.S. Marines will conduct live - fire drills north of Seoul and within an hour ’s drive from the border .
A U.S. aircraft carrier will take part in the exercises , the U.S. military said .
The drills come as Pyongyang prepares to test - fire its Taepodong - 2 missile and at a time of speculation about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong -il .
Pyongyang says the launch would be for a satellite as part of its communications development , though under U.N. sanctions it is barred from firing a ballistic missile .
“ Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war , ” a spokesman for the Korean People ’s Army said on North Korea ’s one television channel .
Media reports last week speculated that Japan and the United States might intercept any ballistic missile launched by the North , though neither has said publicly it would .
Both countries , and South Korea , have said they see no difference between a satellite and a missile launch because they use the same technology and the same rocket .
Washington repeated its call on Pyongyang to halt words and actions that add to tensions .
“ Korea needs to refrain from provocative rhetoric and actions that only further destabilize the region , ” State Department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters .
QUIET NEAR SEA BORDER
In the disputed waters off the west coast of the peninsula there was no sign that the North was about to match its rhetoric with action .
“ I hope that ( South Korean ) President Lee Myung - bak takes an easier line with North Korea .
It will makes things easier for people on the island , ” said Cho Hee - ju , visiting her husband on Yeonpyeong island , 11 km ( 7 miles ) from the North and the scene of deadly skirmishes between the two Korean navies in the past -- most recently in 2002 .
Much of the verbal fury from Pyongyang over the past few months has been directed at the conservative South Korean leader who , in his first year in office , has all but cut off aid to the impoverished North over its ambitions to produce nuclear weapons .
“ The touch - and - go situation in which a nuclear war may break out at any moment is prevailing on the Korean peninsula and the destiny of the nation is exposed to threat owing to the reckless moves of the Lee Myung Bak bellicose group , ” the North ’s communist daily Rodong Sinmun said .

Last week , the North said it could not guarantee the safety of South Korean civilian aircraft flying near its airspace as it readied to launch the missile .
That forced several airliners to change their routes .
South Korea ’s financial markets , normally immune to North Korean rhetoric , brushed off the latest outburst as more saber - rattling .
The Seoul stock market outperformed its counterparts in both Tokyo and Shanghai , boosted by news that LG Display would build a new production line at its Paju factory just minutes from the heavily armed border .
The recently tumbling won currency also rose .
“ Unless more drastic action is taken by the North , such as a missile test , investors will remain unfazed by these issues , ” said Yoo Soo-min , a market analyst at Hyundai Securities .
KIM GETS 100 PERCENT VOTE
The poor health of North Korean leader Kim -- it is widely believed that he suffered a stroke in August -- has triggered speculation over who might eventually take over a nation that tested its first nuclear device in 2006 .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month warned of a possible power struggle .
But there was no sign that the head of the world ’s first communist dynasty might be losing his iron grip on power .
In Sunday ’s tightly controlled elections for a new parliament , Kim was re-elected as deputy with 100 percent of the vote in his Pyongyang constituency , North Korean state media reported .
None of Kim ’s three known sons figured in the list of 687 delegates elected to the Assembly , read out on the North ’s official KRT television late on Monday .
The youngest son , Jong - un , was seen as a possible successor and news reports have said he might run .
In Seoul , the new U.S. special envoy for North Korea , Stephen Bosworth , held talks with South Korean officials on how to restart negotiations on ending the North ’s nuclear arms programme .
Bosworth is on a tour of North Asian capitals .
The two Koreas are technically still at war and station about 1 million troops near their respective sides of the Demilitarised Zone that has divided the peninsula since the 1950 - 53 Korean War ended in a ceasefire , but not a peace treaty .

Having lived through the ice storm , no juice for a month in the dead of a Quebec winter , I can relate to this .
Here 's the question :
With all that infrastructure world - wide coming up to ( or well past ) its ' best - before date , and demand for power showing no sign of declining ( what - you want to plug how many cars into Con Edison 's lousy power drop ??? ) - is it time to start aggresively switching offices from desktops to DTRs - ( desktop replacements , aka laptops ) .
Consider - even back in 2001 , this DOE ( Department of Energy ) paper shows desktops consuming 3 x the juice of laptops .
Desktop video cards , cpus , and motherboards have gotten hungrier - Vista is n't exactly a " green " operating system , and neither are " gaming rigs " .
Or this 2006 paper
Summary After lighting , computers and monitors have the highest energy consumption in office environments .
Studies have shown that power management of computers and monitors can significantly reduce their energy consumption , saving hundreds or thousands of dollars a year on electricity costs .
The energy consumption of computers and monitors is determined by the amount of energy they require to operate and how they are used .
While the energy requirements of a device make an important contribution to its overall energy consumption , the key to reducing energy consumption is changing how devices are used .
Approximately half of all office computers are left on overnight and on weekends .
Evenings and weekends account for 75 % of the week , so ensuring computers are turned off at night dramatically reduces their energy consumption .
Further savings are made by ensuring computers enter low power mode when they are idle during the day .
Power management is a way of ensuring computers and monitors are turned off when not required and in low power mode during idle periods .
Manual power management , which relies on education users to turn off their computers , can achieve impressive results with ongoing education and reinforcement .
Alternatively , automatic power management relies on software , or built in energy saving features .
Theoretically , automatic power management can achieve 100 % power management , with all computers turned off when not required and in low power mode when idle .
Between server consolidation and replacing desktops with more energy - efficient laptops ( or in some cases , netbooks ) , it should be possible to achieve at least a 2/3 power savings .
Throw in the extra savings from reduced heat ( less AC needed ) and noise , and the savings should pay for the equipment .
Throw in desktop consolidation - replacing that second ( or in some cases 2nd and third ) desktop + kvm switch ) with an external screen , and the savings increase ( most of the people where I work have at least 2 desktops and one server allocated to them - consolidation would be a big win here , plus make it a lot easier to back up and restore !!!
Reducing the " component count " - the number of boxes running , will also reduce the number of interruptions due to " component " failures , and consolidation would mean that it would be possible to have a " live spare " and still reduce the box count ) .
So , what about home servers ?
I rarely turn mine on any more .
Eventually , I 'll probably give it away , and when I buy another laptop , take my current laptop and have it become my " home server " .
Just the " quiet factor " is a good enough reason to go that route , and if I end up needing more than 1 tb of disk space , there 's always external storage .
With the screen powered down , it uses something like 1/ 8 the power of my old box , so why not ...
We 've reached the " crossover point " where the additional energy savings from lcds and laptops justify the junking of most desktops , and the consolidation of what 's left .
Being " greener " is a nice side benefit , but the " show me the money " aspect is what works in todays ' economy .
Hye Yeon Nam is a visual and kinetic artist living in Atlanta , GA and originally from Seoul , Korea .
She ’s a designer and artist who is inspired by her “ personal experiences , emotions , and in - between state . ”
At one point in time she asked herself the question :
What if we no longer had the use of our hands to play instruments or produce various forms of music ?
Through what alternative could we express ourselves musically ?
The Human Tongue
So , she decided to come up with the answer for her own question .
The human tongue can actually rival the hands and fingers in terms of it ’s ability to perform manipulative tasks , and with this concept in mind , the “ Tongue Music System ” was born .
This music system uses the tongue , rather than the hand , to generate sounds and melodies .
The system is run by two peoples ’ tongues :
One person stands in front of a projector , which displays an abstract video image consisting of hundreds of dots or large pixels .
The performer uses a head mounted system to control the mouse with his tongue to simultaneously play the main melody and to manipulate the video images .
The other performer create various piano melodies by placing the tongue against one of multiple bottles .
Here it is in action : Tongue Music
The headset or “ Tongue Drive System ” possesses sensors that detect the magnetic field from a small magnet secured on the tongue with tissue adhesive .
These sensor readings are wirelessly transmitted to the computer .
For the second performer , two bottles contain the circuit board of a mini-electronic keyboard .
The bottles also contain four magnets each which attach to springs .
When a performer touches the tongue magnet to a section of the bottle , it attracts the closest magnet , which touches a metal switch connected to the circuit board .
This connection completes a circuit that causes a specific piano note to be played .
As weird ( and creepy ) as it sounds , you have to admit that it ’s pretty creative .
I ’d love to see it hooked up to a synthesizer to control the sounds ( there ’s only so much of that piano that I can take ! ) .
Hye Yeon Nam also has a ton of other kinetic art projects that you should definitely check out .
I suppose April 1st is as good a day as ever to revisit the ruins of the Great Underground Empire , as Jolt Online Gaming launches their free - to - play browser - based adventure game , Legends of Zork .

What I love about powerful quotes are that they provide you with a certain perspective that you may not have considered before .
But once they resonate with you , they can completely change your outlook on life .
The quotes that I ’m about to present to you have drastically changed the way I approach business and entrepreneurship .
In fact , they have enabled me to run a 7 figure ecommerce store , a 7 figure blog , a podcast , an online store course and a conference all while working a full time job with 2 kids .

In fact , people who have seen me in action know that I drop things on the floor all the time and I can be pretty disorganized at times .
The reason I ’m able to accomplish what I do is because I follow a set of guidelines that allow me to slowly but consistently make progress towards my goals .
Here ’s a sneak peek into how my mind works and how I structure my life based on a set of short powerful quotes .

“ Does n’t matter if the glass is half - empty or half - full .
All that matters is that you are the one pouring the water . ”
If there ’s a single quote that defines my way of thinking , it ’s that I like to be in control .
Sometimes this attitude slows me down when I have to learn or develop something from complete scratch .
But for the most part , I strongly believe in owning the core parts of your business .
For example in my last post on the future of ecommerce , I mentioned that I ’ve considered switching over to a fully hosted shopping cart like a Big Commerce or a Shopify .
But the reason that I ’ve resisted all of these years is because …
I do n’t want to put my business platform in the hands of someone else who can raise prices or change policies at any time .
It ’s a major investment and very risky to switch carts from an SEO standpoint
I have the knowledge and capability to maintain my own solution
Can I innovate faster than a fully hosted platform ?
No way !
But on the other hand , I do n’t need 80 % of the functionality that the fully hosted carts support .
And the remaining 20 % ?
I can often code new features myself in a few weekends and avoid paying recurring fees .
Overall when it comes to outsourcing , I like to be in control over every aspect of my business that is not easily interchangeable .
For everything else , I do n’t mind paying a 3rd party .
For example I spend about $ 800 / month on email marketing services .
But even though email marketing makes up 90 % of my blog income , I would never create my own email platform .
Switching email providers is fairly trivial so it ’s not a major risk to my business if my provider decides to screw me .
Editor ’s Note : I ’ve been screwed by my email provider before .

This .
A shopping cart on the other hand would require many months of painstaking work to migrate .
Will my mindset change someday ?
Maybe .
But for the small shop that I run , I prefer to get by with what I have and stay in control for now .
“ The art of being wise is to know what to overlook ”
Remember when I said that I drop stuff on the floor all the time ?
Well , there ’s absolutely no way I could do what I do without saying no to most things .
Because I dedicate my weekends to my kiddos and family , I basically have about 20 hours during the week to get all of my business tasks done .
20 hours is not a lot of time so I have to fiercely prioritize .
With any business , it ’s very easy to get caught up in making more money , investing in more projects and trying to expand , expand , expand !
So I constantly have to remind myself why I ’m in business .
I ’m not doing this stuff to get rich or to become famous .
The reason I do what I do is to free up my time for family and to keep my mind stimulated .
That ’s all .
Any request or project that detracts from this goal is immediately dropped .
“ Your body is a public resume about what you say about yourself ”
A major component of business success is your ability to network and build lasting relationships with other like minded entrepreneurs .
And when it comes to building rapport or garnering respect from your peers , your appearance matters .
Whenever I meet someone new , no matter how hard I try to keep an open mind , I ’m often influenced by a person ’s overall demeanor .
For example if a person is dressed well and in excellent physical shape , I subconsciously have a positive impression of that person right from the start .
The other day I was catching up on reruns of Shark Tank when I saw a haggard , unkempt entrepreneur dressed in a tie dye shirt , shorts and flip flops pitch to the sharks .
And right away , I knew that he was n’t getting a deal no matter how great the idea .
Unfortunately , your body and the way you carry yourself can make or break a first impression which is one reason why I made a conscious effort to get in shape several years ago .

And to this day , I continue to exercise regularly , maintain a low carb diet and pay attention to my health .
Not only does this improve my energy level but it allows me to be more focused and productive as well .
“ We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten .
Do n’t let yourself be lulled into inaction . ”
Whenever I start a new project or business , I ’m usually over eager and impatient .
And when I ’m excited , I tend to over exert myself and expect great things to happen immediately .
But when I do n’t see results right away , I get discouraged and want to quit .
For example when I first started my blog , I was writing 5 times per week , not getting any traction at all , and burning myself out in the process .
It was n’t until I dialed my effort way back to a more maintainable pace did I finally begin to see results .
Here ’s what happened .
By publishing a single post once a week on a set schedule , writing for my blog became a weekly routine .
So much so , that maintaining my blog no longer felt like a chore when I was writing 5 times a week .
Time flew by and after 3 years , I started making significant money with the blog .
Here ’s the thing .
When I wanted to make money fast , it was a struggle and I was miserable .
But when my mindset and time frame changed to 3 - 5 years , blogging became a hell of a lot easier .
People often overestimate what they can accomplish in a short period of time but they vastly underestimate what can be done in the long run .
By making consistent progress over time no matter how small , you will eventually succeed .
“ Progress is impossible without change ; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything . ”
As I grow older , I often find myself set in my ways and unwilling to try new things .
For example , when my podcast editor introduced me to SnapChat and Instagram Stories , I was like …
GRRR …. I do n’t understand this tool .
Why would I want my messages to disappear after 24 hours ?
What ’s the appeal ?
Millennials are crazy …
Anyway I did n’t realize it at the time , but I must have sounded like a grumpy old man complaining about the good ole days of video cassettes and mix tapes .
The reason why most businesses fail is because they fail to adapt to new technology and trends .
Microsoft used to own personal computing and desktop software before the world transitioned to mobile .
Similarly , the field of ecommerce is constantly changing .
What worked 5 years ago no longer works today and you have to keep up with technology in order to thrive .
So today , I make an active effort to fight my crotchety old self by keeping an open mind and forcing myself to try new things .
There is always a better way to do something .
“ If you put everything off until you ’re sure of it , then you ’ll never get anything done . ”
I do n’t like to fail .
And by nature I ’m an analytical person which makes it difficult for me to start anything unless I know that I ’ll succeed .
In fact , I never would have started my first business if my wife ’s pregnancy did n’t force me to take action with imperfect information .
But over the years , I ’ve learned to trust my instincts and my abilities .
You do n’t have to have everything figured out from the start because you can make changes along the way .
When my wife and I launched our store in 2007 , we changed our target market and product positioning several times before focusing on the wedding market .
I launched my online store course with no content at all which forced me to figure out the curriculum on the fly .
In my limited entrepreneurial experience , I ’ve come to believe that any action is better than no action at all .
And it ’s sometimes better to turn off your brain completely : )
Business is unpredictable and the only way to know the outcome is to make a small , calculated bet .
“ The trick is in what one emphasizes .
We either make ourselves miserable , or we make ourselves strong .
The amount of work is the same . ”
Bad stuff happens in business all the time .
In fact just last week , we had a few employees bail on us due to various circumstances beyond our control .
For my blog , someone in Russia decided to spam all of my email forms with fake email addresses which annoyed me to no end .
When s$ %!
happens , you have 2 choices .
You can focus on the bad and make yourself miserable or you can actively find a solution to your problem and improve your circumstances .
The amount of energy to do both is the same .
Controlling your emotions takes a lot of practice and I ’m still not the best at it .
But it ’s important to shrug off the bad and keep your head in the game .
Living your life and running your business is going to have its ups and downs .
You just have to take it all in stride .
“ Life is like a camera .
Focus on what ’s important , capture the good times , develop from the negatives , and if things do n’t turn out – take another shot . ”
This is probably one of my favorite quotes of all time and whenever I ’m at a crossroads in my life , I constantly refer back to this saying .
Because of my personality , I often get carried away with new projects and I sometimes lose track of what ’s important .
For example , last year I considered going back to work and getting a full time job because I wanted to work on a large , team based project again .
I also considered starting a new software company with a few friends in my area .
But when I sat down and talked it over with my wife , I realized that pursuing either one of these ventures would consume almost all of my time .
I was reminded that we started all of our businesses for one main reason , to spend more time with family .
So right now , my focus is with my kids and I ’m really enjoying my time with them .
In fact , I ’m coaching my daughter ’s basketball team again next season and possibly volleyball as well and I want to take advantage of this age when they actually want to hang out with me : )
I ’ve also learned to be more grateful for what I have .
Whenever something bad happens , I remind myself how lucky I am to have my family and a lifestyle that allows me to spend time with them .
But probably the biggest lesson that I ’ve gained from this quote is that it ’s never too late to reinvent yourself .
For over 20 years , I was an electrical engineer and I never would have dreamed that I ’d end up as a blogger / podcaster .
For the longest time , I did n’t think that I could do anything else and that I was going to design hardware for the rest of my life .
But I ’ve discovered that there ’s plenty of time to start all over again .
So go out and try something new .
Enjoy the process of learning and the journey .
Behave like a camera and all will be well in business and life !

Executive Summary
" For two days I had agonizing pain in both the back and front of my body .
I thought I was going to die .
The doctor said that there was no need to medicate my pain , that it was just a hematoma and that the pain would go away by itself .
I was screaming all through the night . "

" Cancer is killing us .
Pain is killing me because for several days I have been unable to find injectable morphine in any place .
Please Mr. Secretary of Health , do not make us suffer any more … "
– A classified ad placed in a Colombian newspaper in September 2008 by the mother of a woman with cervical cancer . [ 2 ]
" Physicians are afraid of morphine … Doctors [ in Kenya ] are so used to patients dying in pain … they think that this is how you must die .
They are suspicious if you do n't die this way – [ and feel ] that you died prematurely . "
– Physician at hospice in Kenya . [ 3 ]
In 1961 , the world community adopted an international agreement - the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs - that proclaimed " narcotic drugs … indispensible for the relief of pain and suffering " and instructed countries to make adequate provision to ensure their availability for medical needs .
Today , almost fifty years later , the promise of that agreement remains largely unfulfilled , particularly - but not only - in low and middle income countries .
In September 2008 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated that approximately 80 percent of the world population has either no or insufficient access to treatment for moderate to severe pain and that every year tens of millions of people around the world , including around four million cancer patients and 0.8 million HIV / AIDS patients at the end of their lives suffer from such pain without treatment .
The poor availability of pain treatment is both perplexing and inexcusable .
Pain causes terrible suffering yet the medications to treat it are cheap , safe , effective and generally straightforward to administer .
Furthermore , international law obliges countries to make adequate pain medications available .
Over the last twenty years , the WHO and the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) , the body that monitors the implementation of the UN drug conventions , have repeatedly reminded states of their obligation .
But little progress has been made in many countries .
Under international human rights law , governments must address a major public health crisis that affects millions of people every year .
They must take steps to ensure that people have adequate access to treatment for their pain .
At a minimum , states must ensure availability of morphine , the mainstay medication for the treatment of moderate to severe pain , because it is considered an essential medicine that should be available to all persons who need it and is cheap and widely available .
Failure to make essential medicines available or to take reasonable steps to make pain management and palliative care services available will result in a violation of the right to health .
In some cases , failure to ensure patients have access to treatment for severe pain will also give rise to a violation of the prohibition of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment .
There are many reasons for the enormity of the gap between pain treatment needs and what is delivered , but chief among them is a shocking willingness by many governments around the world to passively stand by as people suffer .
Few governments have put in place effective supply and distribution systems for morphine ; they have no pain management and palliative care policies or guidelines for practitioners ; they have excessively strict drug control regulations that unnecessarily impede access to morphine or establish excessive penalties for mishandling it ; they do not ensure healthcare workers get instruction on pain management and palliative care as part of their training ; and they do not make sufficient efforts to ensure morphine is affordable .
Fears that medical morphine may be diverted for illicit purposes are a key factor blocking improved access to pain treatment .
While states must take steps to prevent diversion , they must do so in a way that does not unnecessarily impede access to essential medications .
INCB has stated that such diversion is relatively rare . [ 4 ]
In many places , these factors combine to create a vicious cycle of under - treatment : because pain treatment and palliative care are not priorities for the government , healthcare workers do not receive the necessary training to assess and treat pain .
This leads to widespread under - treatment and to low demand for morphine .
Similarly , complex procurement and prescription regulations and the threat of harsh punishment for mishandling morphine discourage pharmacies and hospitals from stocking and healthcare workers from prescribing it , again resulting in low demand .
This , in turn , reinforces the low priority given to pain management and palliative care .
This low prioritization is not a function of low prevalence of pain but of the invisibility of its sufferers .
To break out of this vicious cycle , individual governments and the international community must fulfill their obligations under international human rights law .
Governments must take action to eliminate barriers that impede availability of pain treatment medications .
They must develop policies on pain management and palliative care ; introduce instruction for healthcare workers , including for those already practicing ; reform regulations that unnecessarily impede accessibility of pain medications ; and take action to ensure their affordability .
While this is a considerable task , various countries , such as Romania , Uganda and Vietnam , have shown that such a comprehensive approach is feasible in low and middle - income countries and can be successful .
In pursuing steps to improve pain treatment , countries should draw on the expertise and assistance of the WHO Access to Controlled Medications Programme and INCB .
The international community should address the poor availability of pain treatment with urgency .
The UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs that will take place in Vienna in March 2009 is a unique opportunity to begin to do so .
At the meeting , which will conclude a year - long review of the last ten years of drug policy , countries will set priorities for the next ten years of global drug policy .
In Vienna , the international community should recommit itself to the mandate of the 1961 Single Convention for states to ensure adequate availability of controlled medicines for the relief of pain and suffering .
For too long , the global drug policy debate has been strongly focused on prevention of the use and trade of illicit drugs , distorting the balance that was envisioned by the Convention .
In March 2009 , the international community should set ambitious and measurable goals to significantly improve access to opioid analgesics - pain medications made from opiates - and other controlled medicines worldwide over the coming ten years .
After March 2009 , global drug policy actors , such as the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs and INCB , should regularly review progress made by countries toward adequate availability of pain treatment medications , carefully analyzing steps taken to advance this important issue .
Donor countries and agencies , including the Global Fund to fight AIDS , Malaria , and Tuberculosis and the U.S. President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , should actively encourage countries to undertake comprehensive steps to improve access to pain relief medications and support those that do , including through support for the WHO Access to Controlled Medications Programme .
UN and regional human rights bodies should routinely remind countries of their obligation under human rights law to ensure adequate availability of pain medications .
Background : Pain in the World Today
Prevalence of Pain
Chronic moderate and severe pain is a common symptom of cancer and HIV / AIDS , as well as of various other health conditions . [ 5 ]
A recent review of pain studies in cancer patients found that more than fifty percent of cancer patients experience pain symptoms [ 6 ] and research consistently finds that 60 to 90 percent of patients with advanced cancer experience moderate to severe pain .
[ 7 ]
The intensity of the pain and its effect vary depending on to the type of cancer , treatment , and personal characteristics .
Prevalence and severity of pain usually increase with disease progression .
Although no population - based studies of AIDS - related pain have been published , multiple studies report that 60 to 80 percent of patients in the last phases of illness experience significant pain .
[ 8 ]
Even though the increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs in middle and low income countries is prolonging the lives of many people with HIV , pain symptoms continue to be a problem for a significant proportion of these patients . [ 9 ]
Several studies have found that between 29 and 74 percent of people who receive antiretroviral treatment experience pain symptoms . [ 10 ]
Experts believe that worldwide there are 24.6 million people who suffer from cancer annually , and that more than 7 million people die of it every year .
Overall , 12 percent of all deaths worldwide are due to cancer . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
WHO warns that these numbers will continue to grow over the coming years , with 30 million people projected to be living with cancer by 2020 .
[ 13 ]
UNAIDS estimates that about 32 million people live with HIV worldwide , that some 4.1 million people are newly infected each year , and that almost 3 million die of the disease . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
The Impact of Pain
Moderate to severe pain has a profound impact on quality of life .
Scientific research has demonstrated that persistent pain has a series of physical , psychological and social consequences .
It can lead to reduced mobility and consequent loss of strength ; compromise the immune system ; interfere with a person 's ability to eat , concentrate , sleep , or interact with others . [ 16 ]
The psychological consequences are also profound .
A WHO study found that people who live with chronic pain are four time more likely to suffer from depression or anxiety . [ 17 ]
The physical effect of chronic pain and the psychological strain it causes can even influence the course of disease .
According to WHO , " [ p ] ain can kill ... " [ 18 ]
Pain has social consequences for people experiencing it and often also for their care givers , who may face sleep deprivation and other problems as a result .
These social consequences include inability to work , care for children or other family members , and participate in social activities . [ 19 ]
Pain can also interfere with a dying person 's ability to bid farewell to loved ones and make final arrangements .
While the physical , psychological and social consequences of pain are measurable , the suffering caused by the pain is not .
Yet , there can be little dispute about enormity of the misery it inflicts .
People who experience severe but untreated pain often live in agony for much of the day and often for extended periods of time .
Many people interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had experienced severe pain in India , expressed the exact same sentiment as torture survivors : all they wanted was for the pain to stop .
Unable to sign a confession to make that happen , several people told us that they had wanted to commit suicide to end the pain , prayed to be taken away , or told doctors or relatives that they wanted to die . [ 20 ]
Pain Management : Elements , Effectiveness , Cost
According to WHO , " Most , if not all , pain due to cancer could be relieved if we implemented existing medical knowledge and treatments . " [ 21 ]
The mainstay medication for the treatment of moderate to severe pain is morphine , an opioid that is made of an extract of the poppy plant .
Morphine can both be injected and taken orally .
It is mostly injected to treat acute pain , generally in hospital settings .
Oral morphine is the drug of choice for chronic pain , and can be taken both institutional settings and at home .
Due to the potential for its abuse , morphine is a controlled medication , meaning that its manufacture , distribution and dispensing is strictly controlled both at the international and national levels .
The WHO Pain Relief Ladder is the basis for modern pain management .
Originally developed for treating cancer pain , it has since been applied successfully to HIV / AIDS - related pain . [ 22 ]
The ladder recommends the administration of different types of pain medications , or analgesics , according to the severity of the pain .
For mild pain , it calls for basic pain relievers like acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) , aspirin , or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are usually widely available and without prescription .
For mild to moderate pain , it recommends a combination of basic pain relievers and a weak opioid , like codeine .
For moderate to severe pain , it calls for strong opioids , like morphine .
Indeed , WHO has held that for managing cancer pain , opioids are " absolutely necessary " and , when pain is moderate to severe , " there is no substitute for opioids " such as morphine . " [ 23 ]
The Pain Relief Ladder also recommends various other medications , known as adjuvant drugs , that serve to increase the effectiveness of analgesics or counter their side effects , including laxatives , anti-convulsants and anti-depressants .
Pain medications vary greatly in terms of cost .
Basic oral morphine in powder or tablet form is not protected by any patent and can be produced for as little as US$ 0.01 per milligram . [ 24 ]
( A typical daily dose in low and middle - income countries ranges , according to one estimate , from 60 to 75 milligrams per day ) . [ 25 ]
Other pain medications , such as Fentanyl skin patches that gradually release the active substance , are very costly , and some protect by patent .
Because oral morphine can be produced cheaply , providing pain management should be possible at the community level even in developing countries .
However , a 2004 study by De Lima and others found that , for a variety of reasons ( see below , under Cost ) , opioid analgesics , including basic oral morphine , tend to be considerably more expensive in both relative and absolute terms in low and middle income countries than in industrialized nations . [ 26 ]
Chronic pain management often comes as a part of broader palliative care services .
Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with life - threatening illnesses , through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems , physical , psychosocial and spiritual . [ 27 ]
The World Health Organization recognizes palliative care as an essential component of a national response to HIV / AIDS , cancer and other diseases . [ 28 ]
The organization estimates that ,
despite an overall 5 - year survival rate of nearly 50 % in developed countries , the majority of cancer patients will need palliative care sooner or later .
In developing countries , the proportion requiring palliative care is at least 80 % .
Worldwide , most cancers are diagnosed when already advanced and incurable . [ 29 ]
For those with incurable cancers , the only realistic treatment options are pain relief and palliative care . [ 30 ]
Palliative care is often provided alongside curative care services . [ 31 ]
While palliative care providers may offer inpatient services at hospices or hospitals , their focus is frequently on home - based care for people who are terminally ill or have life - limiting conditions , thus reaching people who otherwise might not have any access to healthcare services , including pain management .
Widespread Consensus : Pain Relief Medications Must Be Available
For decades , there has been a consensus among health experts that opioid pain relievers like morphine and codeine must be available for the treatment of moderate and severe pain .
Almost fifty years ago , UN member states articulated that consensus as follows when they adopted the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs :
The medical use of narcotic drugs continues to be indispensable for the relief of pain and suffering and adequate provision must be made to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs for such purposes . [ 32 ]
The International Narcotic Control Board , the body charged with overseeing the implementation of the UN drug conventions , clarified in 1995 that the Convention " establishes a dual drug control obligation : to ensure adequate availability of narcotic drugs , including opiates , for medical and scientific purposes , while at the same time preventing illicit production of , trafficking in and use of such drugs . " [ 33 ]
The World Health Organization has included both morphine and codeine in its Model List of Essential Medicines , a list of the minimum essential medications that should be available to all persons who need them .
WHO has also repeatedly stated that palliative care and pain treatment are an essential - not optional - component of care for cancer and HIV / AIDS .
For example , in its guide on the development of national cancer control programs it observes that " a national disease control plan for AIDS , cancer and noncommunicable disorders cannot claim to exist unless it has an identifiable palliative care component . " [ 34 ]
Over the last twenty years , the INCB , WHO and other international bodies have repeatedly reminded countries of their obligation to ensure adequate availability of opioids for the treatment of pain .
· In 1986 , the WHO recommended the use of oral morphine for treatment of long term pain .
· In 1989 , INCB made a series of recommendations to states on the need to improve availability of opioid analgesics . [ 35 ]
· In 1994 / 5 , it conducted a survey to identify obstacles to improving such availability and assess the response of member states to its 1989 recommendations . [ 36 ]
· In 1987 and 1996 , the WHO issued guides to cancer pain relief with recommendations for countries on improving opioid analgesic availability . [ 37 ]
· In 1999 , INCB devoted a chapter in its annual report to the issue . [ 38 ]
· In 2000 , WHO developed a tool for governments and providers to use in evaluating national opioid control policies and recommendations on improving availability . [ 39 ]
· In 2007 , in consultation with INCB , WHO established the Access to Controlled Medications Programme , which aims to address all identified impediments to accessibility of controlled medicines , with a focus on regulatory , attitude and knowledge impediments . [ 40 ]
In its annual reports , INCB routinely expresses concern about the poor availability of pain treatment medications in many countries and calls on member states to take further steps .
Various other international bodies , such as the UN Economic and Social Council and the World Health Assembly , have also called on countries to ensure adequate availability of opioid analgesics . [ 41 ]
The Pain Treatment Gap
" Most , if not all , pain due to cancer could be relieved if we implemented existing medical knowledge and treatments …
There is a treatment gap : it is the difference between what can be done , and what is done about cancer pain . "
– World Health Organization [ 42 ]
Despite the clear consensus that pain treatment medications should be available , approximately 80 percent of the world population has either no or insufficient access to treatment for moderate to severe pain and tens of millions of people around the world , including around four million cancer patients and 0.8 million end - stage HIV / AIDS patients , suffer from moderate to severe pain each year without treatment , according to the World Health Organization . [ 43 ]
Approximately 89 percent of the total world consumption of morphine occurs in countries in North America and Europe . [ 44 ]
Low and middle income countries consume only 6 percent of the morphine used worldwide [ 45 ] - while having about half of all cancer patients [ 46 ] and 95 percent of new HIV infections . [ 47 ]
Thirty - two countries in Africa have almost no morphine distribution at all , [ 48 ] and only fourteen have oral morphine . [ 49 ]
However , inadequate pain management is also prevalent in developed countries .
In the United States , an estimated 25 million people experience acute pain as a result of injury or surgery , and between 70 and 90 percent of advanced cancer patients experience pain .
Surveys of subjects ranging from children to elderly patients have shown that over one third are not adequately treated for pain . [ 50 ]
Lack of access to pain medication in pharmacies and fear of addiction on the part of both patients and providers are significant limiting factors in the United States . [ 51 ]
Studies in Western Europe also document under - treatment of pain .
A study of people living with HIV in France found that doctors underestimated pain severity in over half of their patients and under - prescribed both opioids and antidepressants . [ 52 ]
Up to 85 percent of people living with HIV have untreated pain , twice the proportion of people with cancer whose pain is untreated . [ 53 ]
A study in the U.S. found that less than 8 percent of AIDS patients who reported severe pain were treated according to official treatment guidelines , and women , less - educated patients , and patients with histories of injection drug use were most likely to report inadequate treatment for pain . [ 54 ]
Pain Treatment , Palliative Care and Human Rights
Health as a Human Right
Health is a fundamental human right enshrined in numerous international human rights instruments . [ 55 ]
The International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) specifies that everyone has a right " to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health . "
The Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the body charged with monitoring compliance with the ICESCR , has held that states must make available in sufficient quantity " functioning public health and health - care facilities , goods and services , as well as programmes " and that these services must be accessible .
Because states have different levels of resources , international law does not mandate the kind of health care to be provided .
The right to health is considered a right of " progressive realization . "
By becoming party to the international agreements , a state agrees " to take steps … to the maximum of its available resources " to achieve the full realization of the right to health .
In other words , high income countries will generally have to provide healthcare services at a higher level than those with limited resources .
But all countries will be expected to take concrete steps towards increased services , and regression in the provision of health services will , in most cases , constitute a violation of the right to health .
But the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights has also held that there are certain core obligations that are so fundamental that states must fulfill them .
While resource constraints may justify only partial fulfillment of some aspects of the right to health , the Committee has observed vis -à - vis the core obligations that " a State party cannot , under any circumstances whatsoever , justify its non-compliance with the core obligations … , which are non-derogable . "
The Committee has identified , among others , the following core obligations :
· To ensure the right of access to health facilities , goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis , especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups ;
· To provide essential drugs , as from time to time defined under the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs ;
· To ensure equitable distribution of all health facilities , goods and services ;
· To adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action , on the basis of epidemiological evidence , addressing the health concerns of the whole population . [ 56 ]
Pain Treatment and the Right to Health
As morphine and codeine are on the WHO List of Essential Medicines , countries have to provide these medications as part of their core obligations under the right to health , regardless of whether they have been included on their domestic essential medicines lists . [ 57 ]
They must make sure that they are both available in adequate quantities and physically and financially accessible for those who need them .
In order to ensure availability and accessibility , states have , among others , the following obligations :
· Since manufacturing and distribution of controlled medicines like morphine and codeine are completely in government hands , states must put in place an effective procurement and distribution system and create a legal and regulatory framework that enables healthcare providers in both the public and private sector to obtain , prescribe and dispense these medications .
Any regulations that arbitrarily impede the procurement and dispensing of these medications will violate the right to health .
· States must adopt and implement a strategy and plan of action for the roll out of pain treatment and palliative care services .
Such strategy and plan of action should identify obstacles to improved services as well as steps to eliminate them .
· States should regularly measure progress made in ensuring availability and accessibility of pain relief medications .
· The requirement of physical accessibility means that these medications must be " within safe physical reach for all sections of the population , especially vulnerable or marginalized groups , such as…persons with HIV / AIDS . " [ 58 ]
This means that states must ensure that a sufficient number of healthcare providers or pharmacies stock and dispense morphine and codeine , and that an adequate number of healthcare workers are trained and authorized to prescribe these medications .
· Financial accessibility means that , while the right to health does not require states to offer medications free of charge , they must be " affordable for all . " [ 59 ]
In the words of the Committee :
Payment for health - care services … has to be based on the principle of equity , ensuing that these services , whether privately or publicly provided , are affordable to all , including socially disadvantaged groups .
Equity demands that poorer households should not be disproportionately burdened with health expenses as compared to richer households . [ 60 ]
Countries also have an obligation to progressively implement palliative care services , which , according to WHO , must have " priority status within public health and disease control programmes . " [ 61 ]
Countries must ensure an adequate policy and regulatory framework , develop a plan for implementation of these services , and take all steps that are reasonable within available resources to execute the plan .
Failure to attach adequate priority to developing palliative care services within healthcare services will violate the right to health .
Pain Treatment and the Right to Be Free from Cruel , Inhuman and Degrading Treatment
The right to be free from torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment is a fundamental human right that is recognized in numerous international human rights instruments . [ 62 ]
Apart from prohibiting the use of torture , cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment or punishment , the right also creates a positive obligation for states to protect persons in their jurisdiction from such treatment . [ 63 ]
As part of this positive obligation , states have to take steps to protect people from unnecessary pain related to a health condition .
As the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture , Cruel , Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment wrote in a joint letter with the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in December 2008 ,
Governments also have an obligation to take measures to protect people under their jurisdiction from inhuman and degrading treatment .
Failure of governments to take reasonable measures to ensure accessibility of pain treatment , which leaves millions of people to suffer needlessly from severe and often prolonged pain , raises questions whether they have adequately discharged this obligation . [ 64 ]
Obstacles to Provision of Pain Treatment and Palliative Care
There is no lack of information about the reasons why so many people who suffer from severe pain cannot get access to adequate pain treatment .
In dozens of publications spanning several decades , the World Health Organization , the International Narcotics Control Board , healthcare providers , academics and others have chronicled the barriers in great detail . [ 65 ]
A common theme of many of these publications is the failure of many governments around the world to take reasonable steps to improve access to pain treatment and palliative care services and to strike the right balance between ensuring availability of controlled medications for legitimate purposes and preventing their abuse .
In its 2007 Annual Report , the INCB repeated its previous calls for improvement :
The low levels of consumption of opioid analgesics for the treatment of pain in many countries … continue to be a matter of serious concern to the Board .
The Board again urges all Governments concerned to identify the impediments in their countries to adequate use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of pain and to take steps to improve the availability of those narcotic drugs for medical purposes ... [ 66 ]
To date , these calls have largely fallen on deaf ears .
Because of countries ' failure to act on the recommendations of WHO and INCB , many of the same obstacles that the organizations identified two decades ago remain today .
These barriers include the failure of many governments to put in place functioning drug supply systems ; the failure to enact policies on pain treatment and palliative care ; the existence of unnecessarily restrictive drug control regulations and practices ; fear among healthcare workers of legal sanctions for legitimate medical practice ; poor training of healthcare workers ; and the unnecessarily high cost of pain treatment .
While there is no doubt that it will not be easy to overcome some of these barriers and implement comprehensive pain treatment and palliative care services , particularly for countries with limited resources , much progress could be made if governments took the action required of them by international human rights standards and the UN drug conventions .
Indeed , the governments of countries like Romania , Uganda and Vietnam - each of which have adopted comprehensive approaches to improving availability of pain treatment - have shown that much can be done to comply with the basic standards required , even by countries with limited resources .
While each of these countries still has much to do to make pain treatment and palliative care fully available they are all moving in the right direction .
Failure to Ensure Functioning and Effective Supply System
Opioid analgesics are controlled medicines .
As such , their manufacture , distribution and prescription are strictly regulated ; these medications cannot be traded freely on the market .
The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has created a system to regulate supply and demand .
Every year , countries submit estimates of their need for morphine and other controlled medications to INCB , which then approves a quota for countries and authorizes producing countries to grow a specified amount of raw material .
Once INCB has approved their quota , countries may then purchase morphine up to the approved amount .
Each individual transaction across international borders must be authorized and registered by INCB .
On a national level , special drug control agencies are responsible for communicating with INCB about the need for morphine , imports and exports , and for regulating and overseeing all domestic transactions involving controlled medications .
Under the UN drug conventions , countries have an obligation to ensure a functioning and effective supply system for controlled medications .
The INCB has held that
… an efficient national drug control regime must involve not only a programme to prevent illicit trafficking and diversion but also a programme to ensure the adequate availability of narcotic drugs for medical and scientific purposes . [ 67 ]
Such drug availability programs must be capable of ensuring that adequate amounts of morphine and other controlled medicines are available in the country at any given time , that an effective system of distribution is in place to provide healthcare providers and pharmacies with a continuous and adequate supply of the medications , and that a sufficient number of pharmacies and health facilities stock them so that healthcare providers and patients around the country can reasonably gain access to them at need .
As the World Health Organization has noted , good communication between health workers and drug regulators is crucial to meet these goals . [ 68 ]
Because the production , distribution and dispensing of controlled medicines is under exclusive government control , governments have a particularly strong responsibility to ensure their availability and accessibility .
With medications that are not controlled , private actors , including healthcare providers , pharmaceutical companies and nongovernmental organizations , can produce or import medications themselves without limited or no government facilitation .
That is not the case with controlled medications –if a government does nothing to ensure an adequate supply and a functioning distribution system , they will simply not be legally available .
Yet , many governments , particularly in low and middle income countries , have failed to put in place functioning and effective supply systems for controlled medicines .
Indeed , judging by the fact that in dozens of countries almost no morphine is used , it appears that many do not have a functioning supply system at all .
In 1999 , the INCB noted that this is not just the result of resource limitations but also of " a lack of determination on the part of Governments and their services . " [ 69 ]
Research that the African Palliative Care Association ( APCA ) conducted in 2006 illustrates the lack of commitment of some African countries to ensuring availability of controlled medicines .
The organization tried to conduct a survey among palliative care providers and drug control authorities in twelve African countries to identify challenges in implementation of palliative care and pain treatment services .
The organization succeeded in securing the participation of drug control agencies in five of the twelve target countries in the survey .
The survey findings suggest a considerable disconnect between drug control authorities and the healthcare system .
Three of the five drug control agencies - from Kenya , Tanzania and Ethiopia - stated that they believed the regulatory system worked well , even though morphine consumption in each of these countries is far below estimated need and the palliative care providers surveyed identified myriad problems with the regulatory system . [ 70 ]
Furthermore , the survey suggested that drug control agencies in each of the five countries listed controlled medicines as available in healthcare settings when none of the palliative care providers actually had access to them .
In its report , APCA wrote :
In every country without exception INCB competent authorities cited specific opioids that they believed to be available in - country that were never cited by any [ palliative care ] service within that country . [ 71 ]
Estimating National Need
Many countries do not submit estimates for their need for controlled substances based upon careful assessment of population needs to the INCB , as required by the UN drug conventions .
Some countries submit no estimate or estimates that are only symbolic in nature .
For example , the West African nation of Burkina Faso estimated that it will need 49 grams of morphine in 2009 . [ 72 ]
Using Foley 's estimate that the average terminal cancer or AIDS patient who suffers from severe pain will need 60 to 75 mg of morphine per day for an average of about 90 days , this amount would suffice for about 8 patients .
As a result , countries like Burkina Faso receive quotas from INCB for morphine that are so low that they cannot possibly ensure adequate availability of morphine for pain treatment in the country . [ 73 ]
Many other countries submit estimates that vastly understate the actual medical need for morphine .
Often , these estimates are not based on actual need but on morphine consumption during the previous year .
Some countries appear to simply reproduce the same estimate each year , regardless of demographic changes or true estimates of need . [ 74 ]

INCB has repeatedly reminded countries of their obligation to submit estimates based upon population need and has encouraged all countries to review their methods for preparing estimates so as to ensure that they actually reflect the need for controlled medications . [ 79 ]
Ensuring Effective Distribution
Without an effective distribution system , accessibility of morphine to those who need it can not be assured .
As controlled medications may only be transferred between parties that have been authorized under national law , governments play a key role in putting in place such a distribution system .
They must ensure that a sufficient number of pharmacies are licensed to handle morphine .
They must also ensure that procedures for procuring , stocking and dispensing it are workable ; in other words , they must strike the appropriate balance between ensuring pharmacies can obtain it without unnecessarily cumbersome or expensive procedures and preventing abuse .
Yet , in many countries few hospitals or pharmacies actually stock morphine .
In some cases , this is due to government regulations that allow only specific institutions to stock the medication .
The APCA study , for example , found that in Zambia only hospitals can stock morphine and that in Nigeria oral morphine is available only from one pharmacy , the National Drug Store . [ 80 ]
Similarly , in Cameroon only one pharmacy prepares oral morphine . [ 81 ]
In some countries , excessively burdensome procedures for procurement , dispensing and accounting discourage health institutions from procuring morphine .
In India , Human Rights Watch found that many hospitals do not stock oral morphine because they must obtain a number of different licenses for each order of morphine that is procured and these licenses are often very difficult to obtain .
In Mexico City , a city of 18 million people , only nine hospitals and pharmacies stock morphine , apparently due to regulatory requirements around controlled medications . [ 82 ]
Restrictions on licenses or cumbersome handling procedures that are not necessary for preventing abuse of these medications violate the right to health , and should be reformed .
As countries are under the obligation to ensure adequate availability of opioid analgesics , they must take steps to ensure that a sufficient number of pharmacies or hospitals stock them .
Recognizing this obligation , Vietnam adopted a new opioid prescription regulation in February 2008 which obliges district hospitals to stock opioids if no pharmacies in the district do . [ 83 ]
Where hospitals and pharmacies do stock morphine , problems with inefficient distribution systems are common .
In India , for example , Human Rights Watch found that the excessively burdensome procurement procedures in many states can lead to stock - outs and delays in dispensing . [ 84 ]
In Colombia , morphine has regularly been out of stock in the province of Valle del Cauca over the last several years , resulting in numerous patients being unable to obtain morphine to treat their pain .
By contrast , other prescription medications have been widely available . [ 85 ]
APCA 's survey of palliative care providers in twelve African countries found " massive delays between scripts [ physician prescription ] and dispensing " due to problems with supply and distribution systems . [ 86 ]
Failure to Enact Palliative Care and Pain Treatment Policies
A core obligation under the right to health holds that countries must " adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action , on the basis of epidemiological evidence , addressing the health concerns of the whole population . "
As part of this obligation , countries must develop a strategy and plan of action for the implementation of palliative care and pain treatment services .
While these do not have to provide for the immediate implementation of the full range of services , they must set out a road map for their progressive implementation .
There will be a strong presumption that any cost neutral steps will have to be taken immediately . [ 87 ]
In 1996 , WHO identified the absence of national policies on cancer relief pain and palliative care as one of the reasons why cancer pain is so often not adequately treated . [ 88 ]
In 2000 , the organization noted that pain treatment continued to be a " low priority " in healthcare systems .
In its 2002 book on cancer control programs , WHO noted that although governments around the world have endorsed the integration of palliative care principles into public health and disease control programs , " a yawning gap is evident between rhetoric and realization . " [ 89 ]
Two leading experts on palliative care stress the importance of having a comprehensive strategy , pointing out that some policies have failed because they omitted community involvement in the provision of palliative care services . [ 90 ]
Yet , as these experts have observed , most countries do not have palliative care and pain treatment policies , whether as stand - alone policies or as part of cancer or HIV / AIDS control efforts . [ 91 ]
In a 2007 report on palliative care and HIV / AIDS , the UK government 's Department for International Development found that palliative care was often not " integrated into health sector policies and National AIDS Frameworks . " [
92 ]
Many countries have even failed to take relatively cost - neutral steps that are crucial to improving access to pain treatment and palliative care , such as adding oral morphine and other opioid - based medicines to their list of essential medicines or issuing guidelines on pain management for healthcare workers .
For example , respondents to APCA 's 2007 survey of palliative care providers from four countries - Kenya , Namibia , Nigeria and Rwanda - reported that oral morphine was not on their country 's list of essential medicines . [ 93 ]
According to Anne Merriman , a leading palliative care advocate in Africa , only fourteen African nations have oral morphine - all others only have injectable morphine , which is primarily used to treat acute pain in hospital settings . [ 94 ]
INCB has recommended that national drug control laws must recognize the indispensible nature of narcotic drugs for the relief of pain and suffering as well as the obligation to ensure their availability for medical purposes .
Its 1995 survey found that the laws of 48 percent of responding governments contained the former and of 63 percent the latter . [ 95 ]
Although it is not known exactly how many countries still do not have the relevant language in their legislation , it is telling that the model laws and regulations on drug control that the UN Office on Drugs and Crime has developed for the use of countries in developing national drug control laws and regulations themselves do not contain these provisions . [ 96 ]
A new draft drug control law that is currently under consideration in Cambodia makes no reference to the fact that controlled medications are indispensible for the relief of pain and suffering or of the obligation to ensure their availability . [ 97 ]
Lack of Training for Healthcare Workers
One of the biggest obstacles to provision of good palliative and pain treatment services in many countries around the world is a lack of training for healthcare workers .
As Brennan and others put it , " for too long , pain and its management have been prisoners of myth , irrationality , and cultural bias . " [ 98 ]
While misinformation about oral morphine remains extremely common among healthcare workers , knowledge about how to assess and treat pain is often absent or deeply inadequate .
The combination of ignorance among healthcare workers with myths about opioids results in failure to treat patients , who are suffering from severe pain , with opioid analgesics .
Some of the most common myths hold that treatment with opioids leads to addiction - the most frequently cited impediment to the medical use of opioids in INCB 1995 study ; [ 99 ] that pain is necessary ; that it is essential for diagnosis ; that it is unavoidable ; and that it has negligible consequences .
Each of these myths is inaccurate .
[ 100 ]
Numerous studies have shown that treatment of pain with opioids very rarely leads to addiction ; [ 101 ] most pain can be treated well ; [ 102 ] pain is not necessary for diagnosis ; [ 103 ] and pain has considerable social , economic and psychological consequences as it keeps people who suffer from pain and often their caregivers out of productive life . [ 104 ]
Ignorance about the use of opioid medications is the result of a failure , across much of the world including in some industrialized countries , to provide healthcare workers with adequate instruction on palliative care and pain management .
A survey by the Worldwide Palliative Care Alliance among healthcare workers in 69 countries in Africa , Asia and Latin America found that 82 percent of healthcare workers in Latin America and 71 percent in Asia had not received any instruction on pain or opioids in undergraduate medical studies .
In Africa , the figure was 39 percent .
[ 105 ]
In a 2007 African Palliative Care Association survey , 33 out of 56 participating healthcare providers felt that there were insufficient training opportunities on palliative care and pain treatment .
Twenty - one of the twenty - three providers that said that there was adequate opportunity for training were based in South Africa and Uganda , two countries where considerable training is available . [ 106 ]
Even in industrialized countries instruction on palliative care and pain treatment remains a considerable challenge .
A 1999 review of literature regarding barriers to effective cancer pain management in industrialized nations found , for example , that considerable numbers of healthcare workers surveyed had insufficient factual knowledge about pain management . [ 107 ]
Under the right to health , governments must take reasonable steps to ensure healthcare workers have appropriate training on palliative care and pain management .
As an integral part of care and treatment for cancer and HIV , two key diseases around the world , countries need to ensure that basic instruction on palliative and pain management is part of undergraduate medical studies , nursing school , and continuing medical education .
Specialized instruction should be available for healthcare workers who pursue a specialization in oncology , HIV and AIDS and other disciplines where knowledge of pain management and palliative care is an integral part of care .
Excessively Restrictive Drug Control Regulations or Enforcement Practices
The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs lays out three minimum criteria that countries must observe in developing national regulations regarding the handling of opioids :
· Individuals must be authorized to dispense opioids by their professional license to practice , or be specially licensed to do so ;
· Movement of opioids may occur only between institutions or individuals so authorized under national law ;
· A medical prescription is required before opioids may be dispensed to a patient .
Governments may , under the Convention , impose additional requirements if deemed necessary , such as requiring that all prescription be written on official forms provided by the government or authorized professional associations .
[ 108 ]
However , as WHO has observed , " this right must be continually balanced against the responsibility to ensure opioid availability for medical purposes . " [ 109 ]
Therefore , any regulations that unnecessarily impede access to controlled medications will be inconsistent with both the UN drug conventions and the right to health , which requires countries find a similar balance between ensuring availability for legitimate medical use and preventing abuse .
WHO has developed guidelines for the regulation of health professionals who handle controlled medications that government can use to develop what WHO has called a " practical system . " [ 110 ]
Yet , many countries have regulations that are unnecessarily strict , creating complex procedures for procurement , stocking and dispensing of controlled medications .
In some cases , drug control authorities or health systems go even beyond the strictures of regulations in their implementation and which limit access to those who need them .
The effect of these unnecessarily strict regulations or implementation practices is that pharmacies and health facilities do not procure and stock opioids , that doctors do not prescribe them because of the hassle or fear of criminal sanction , and that prescription is so impractical that many patients cannot realistically obtain them on an ongoing basis .
One explanation for the existence of excessively strict regulations is the fact that many of these regulations were put in place before 1986 , when WHO first recommended the use of oral morphine for long - term pain management .
[ 111 ]
Before that , most countries used only injectable morphine to treat acute pain , which is mostly used in hospital settings over short periods of time .
As WHO has noted , " The science and best practices of opioids have progressed more rapidly than the legal structures governing them , leaving many antiquated and overly restrictive legal policies . " [ 112 ]
Since the 1980s , WHO and INCB have repeatedly called on countries to review their drug control regulations and implementation practices , and make sure they do not unnecessarily impede the use of oral morphine .
While INCB has repeatedly reminded states that they must continue to take steps to prevent diversion [ 113 ] - controlled medications being diverted for illicit use - it has also noted that :
Diversion of narcotic drugs from the licit trade into illicit channels remains relatively rare and the quantities involved are small in comparison to the large volume of transactions .
That holds true for drugs in the international trade as well as in domestic wholesale circuits . [ 114 ]
Some countries have taken important steps in this regard .
Uganda , for example , has approved nurse - based prescribing of oral morphine .
Several countries have lifted restrictions on the amount of oral morphine that can be prescribed .
Yet , in many countries problematic regulations continue to be in place .
A number of common problems in these regulations include :
Overly Restrictive Licensing of Healthcare Institutions
Some countries impose licensing procedures for pharmacies and healthcare providers that make it impossible or overly complicated for them to procure and dispense opioids .
Palliative care providers that do not have inpatient facilities but offer home - based care services often have a particular difficulty getting licenses to dispense morphine , even though this is vital to their mission and they can provide a low - cost way of reaching large numbers of people in need of pain treatment .
In its 2007 report , the African Palliative Care Association observed for example that :
Although in theory many countries permit importation and distribution of the drugs , it can be impossible in practice to obtain the necessary authority from regulation bodies to prescribe the drugs . [ 115 ]
Palliative care providers in Kenya surveyed by APCA noted , for example , that oral morphine is " mostly dispensed in hospitals and hospices so many patients [ who are not in such institutions ] do not get access . " [ 116 ]
A 2007 report by the Worldwide Palliative Care Alliance quotes a healthcare worker as saying that
Palliative care doctors have a right to prescribe morphine but cannot obtain it if they work in a hospice which is not registered in the Ministry of Health as a medical organization . [ 117 ]
In India , regulations in some states make it practically impossible for palliative care providers to obtain a license to prescribe oral morphine , while in other states regulations establish a straight - forward procedure that has allowed palliative care providers to play a key role in making pain treatment available at the community level . [ 118 ]
Some countries allow only certain types of medical institutions to prescribe opioids .
For example , in China , only hospitals above Level 2 - hospitals in China are ranked from Level 1 to 3 depending on the jurisdiction they fall under - have the right to prescribe opioids , which means that hospitals in many cities and towns cannot dispense opioids and people may have to travel long distances in order to be able to obtain oral morphine . [ 119 ]
These licensing requirements significantly impede access to oral morphine .
Countries need to ensure that all healthcare providers and pharmacies are either automatically licensed to procure , stock , and dispense by virtue of their registration as a healthcare institution , or have access to a rational and transparent procedure for obtaining a special license .
There is no rational reason for denying palliative care programs that provide mostly home - based care services the right to prescribe and dispense oral morphine .
Licensing of Health Workers
Many countries require special licenses for healthcare workers who want to prescribe opioids , and these licenses are often difficult to obtain .
For example , the Worldwide Palliative Care Alliance reported in its 2007 report that in Mongolia , Peru , Honduras , Kyrgyzstan and a state in India only palliative care specialists and oncologists are authorized to prescribe oral morphine ; that in the Philippines doctors must obtain two special licenses to be able to prescribe ; and found that seventeen percent of locations ( countries and sub-national regions ) covered by the survey required special licenses that were hard to obtain . [ 120 ]
At the 2008 Eastern European and Central Asian AIDS Conference , a Russian AIDS doctor told conference delegates that he could not treat a patient who suffered from severe pain because he was not licensed to prescribe morphine and that oncologists , who are , would not be able to provide her with morphine because she was not a cancer patient . [ 121 ]
While medical doctors in many countries can prescribe morphine by virtue of their professional license , this is not the case for nurses .
This is a considerable problem in many middle and low income countries around the world where there are few medical doctors .
For example , in Malawi there is only one doctor per 100,000 people . [ 122 ]
In 2004 , Uganda introduced nurse - based prescribing of oral morphine .
According to its amended regulations nurses with a certificate in specialized palliative care are permitted to prescribe and supply certain types of opioid analgesics , including oral morphine . [ 123 ]
Prior to 2004 , many people in rural Uganda - where there is one physician per 50,000 people - did not have realistic access to medications for moderate to severe pain .
INCB praised Uganda for this important step . [ 124 ]
Under the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs , states do not have to require that healthcare workers obtain a special license to handle opioids .
WHO has recommended that " physicians , nurses and pharmacists should be legally empowered to prescribe , dispense and administer opioids to patients in accordance with local needs . " [ 125 ]
As special licensing procedures impede accessibility of opioids for patients who need them , countries should strive as much as possible to allow healthcare workers to handle opioids by virtue of their professional license or establish rapid rational and transparent procedures for obtaining special licenses .
Burdensome Prescription Procedures
Some countries have established special prescription procedures for opioids that are cumbersome and discourage healthcare workers from prescribing them .
A common example is the requirement to use special prescription forms and to keep multiple copies of the prescription .
The WHO Expert Committee on Cancer Pain Relief and Active Support Care has observed that special multiple - copy prescription requirements " typically … reduce prescribing of covered drugs by 50 percent or more . " [ 126 ]
Yet , countries ranging from Cote d'Ivoire to Ukraine require such special prescription forms . [ 127 ]
In 1995 , INCB found that 65 percent of countries that participated in its survey had special prescription procedures . [ 128 ]
Another common problem is that prescriptions by healthcare workers must be approved by their colleagues or superiors or that dispensing must be witnessed by multiple healthcare workers .
In Ukraine , for example , decisions to prescribe morphine have to be made by a group of at least three doctors , one of whom must be an oncologist . [ 129 ]
In South Africa , two nurses must observe the dispensing of opioids .
[ 130 ]
In Guatemala , every prescription must be authorized through an ink seal and a signature that are only issued in the central office of the Narcotic Control Agency . [ 131 ]
In Colombia , the National Fund follows up every prescription with phone calls to the prescribing doctor . [ 132 ]
In Vietnam , some hospitals mandate that all doctors and nurses return empty morphine ampoules to the chief pharmacist or otherwise be investigated for opioid diversion , even though Vietnam 's drug control regulations do not so require . [ 133 ]
Many of these special prescription procedures go well beyond what is required by the 1961 Single Convention and are unlikely to be necessary for preventing diversion .
WHO has recommended that " if physicians are required to keep records other than those associated with good medical practice , the extra work incurred should be practicable and should not impede medical activities . " [ 134 ]
Requirements that do not need meet those criteria will violate the right to health .
Prescription Limitations
Regulations in some countries impose limitations on the dose of oral morphine that can be prescribed per day or unnecessarily restrict the number of days that it can be prescribed and dispensed for at once .
These restrictions impede access to adequate pain management .
WHO has recommended that " decisions concerning the type of drug to be used , the amount of the prescription and the duration of therapy are best made by medical professionals on the basis of the individual needs of each patient , not by regulation . " [ 135 ]
The 1995 INCB survey found that 40 percent of countries participating set a maximum amount of morphine that could be prescribed at one time to a hospitalized patient , and 50 percent did so for patients who lived at home . [ 136 ]
INCB noted that some governments had set the maximum amount " as low as 30 milligrams " – or approximately half the average daily dose in low and middle income countries .
[ 137 ]
WPCA reported in 2007 that Israel limits morphine prescription to 60 milligrams per day for non-cancer patients .
[ 138 ]
It is unclear how many other countries maintain dosage limitations today .
Dosage limitations make no medical sense as patient need varies considerably from person to person , and some people require very large doses to achieve adequate pain control .
They are therefore not consistent with the right to health .
The 1995 INCB report found that 20 percent of countries participating in the survey imposed a maximum length of time that a hospitalized patient could receive morphine , and 28 percent of governments had such restrictions for patients at home .
In some cases , patients could only receive morphine for three to seven days at once and sometimes that was not renewable . [ 139 ]
Although no comprehensive overview of countries that impose these kinds of limitations today is available , they continue to be widespread .
WPCA reported in 2007 that Honduras and Malawi do not allow morphine to be dispensed for more than three days at a time . [ 140 ]
In China , prescriptions can only be given for seven days at a time . [ 141 ]
In Israel , prescriptions can only be given for ten days at a time unless the doctor confirms that the patient lives far away from a pharmacy . [ 142 ]
While there are good reasons , including preventing diversion , for certain limitations on the length of time medications can be dispensed , the kinds of restrictions mentioned above make it impractical or impossible for many patients to have continuous access to them .
Many patients live far away from pharmacies or healthcare centers and repeated travel is a considerable burden because of expense and difficulty of travel for people who are ill .
It also puts a drain on healthcare workers who are already overworked in many parts of the world .
Any limitations on the amount of time morphine can be described or dispensed for should be reasonable - the limitations should be necessary for preventing abuse and not result in the medication becoming practically inaccessible for people who need them - otherwise they will violate the right to health .
In recent years , an increasing number of countries have relaxed the length of time for which oral morphine can be prescribed at once , with many settling on about a month .
These countries include Romania ( from 3 to 30 days ) , France ( from 7 to 28 days ) , Mexico ( from 5 to 30 days ) , Peru ( from 1 to 14 days ) , and Colombia ( from 10 to 30 days ) . [ 143 ]
Fears of Legal Sanction
In some countries , a key reason for the low consumption of opioid medications is fear among healthcare workers that they may face legal sanctions for prescribing them .
INCB has recommended that
health professionals … should be able to …[ provide opiates ] … without unnecessary fear of sanctions for unintended violations [ including ] … legal action for technical violations of the law … [ that ] … may tend to inhibit prescribing or dispensing of opiates . [ 144 ]
Almost fifty percent of countries participating in the 1995 INCB survey cited such fear as an impediment to medical use of opioids .
[ 145 ]
In APCA 's survey of national drug control authorities , four out of five cited fears among healthcare professionals as one of the key reasons for low use of opioid medications .
The drug control authority in Kenya stated that " due to the punitive nature of the 1994 Act , most providers have shied away from selling opioids . " [ 146 ]
Ambiguity in regulations , poor communication by drug regulators to healthcare workers about the rules for handling opioids , the existence of harsh sanctions are some of the reasons for this persistent fear among medical professionals , and , in some countries , actual prosecutions of healthcare workers for unintentional mishandling of opioids .
In China , for example , regulations that were adopted in 2005 - and have significantly improved accessibility of opioids - hold that healthcare workers can prescribe opioids for " reasonable need " but the rules do not clearly define reasonable . [ 147 ]
In INCB 's 1995 survey some countries reported that failure to comply with laws and regulations governing opiate prescribing could result in a 22 - year prison sentence .
Almost fifty percent of participating countries reported mandatory minimum sentences , some as high as 10 years in prison . [ 148 ]
In some cases , these are sentences for unintentional mistakes in handling opioids , not for drug dealing .
In the United States , many physicians are reported to fear unjustified prosecution or sanctioning for prescribing opioids for pain and , consequently , tend to under - prescribe . [ 149 ]
While a recent survey of criminal and administrative cases between 1998 and 2006 found that the number cases had grown from 17 in 1998 to 147 in 2006 , the study also concluded that " the widely publicized chilling effect of physician prosecution on physicians concerned with legal scrutiny over prescribing opioids appears disproportionate to the relatively few cases in which convictions and regulatory actions have occurred . " [ 150 ]
The authors suggested that
[ I ]t seems likely that physicians react to frightening or inconsistent public policy statements .
Likewise , they are sensitive to experience with , or lore about , investigations that were ultimately dismissed but which disrupted a medical practice and produced fear and possibly panic .
Thus , the chilling effect may be , in part , related to public relations and communications problems on the part of regulators as well as to how law enforcement handles the full number of its investigations , not just those that lead to conviction or discipline .
Thus , these data may be extrapolated to suggest that regulators and law enforcement may do well to improve how they craft their public messages to physicians and how they handle routine investigations of medical practice .
These phenomena deserve greater study . [ 151 ]
Unfortunately , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 's public message to physicians who prescribe opioids has been ambiguous .
After initially supporting a series of Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) for physicians about the use of pain management medications that had been developed by a panel of clinicians and regulators , including DEA officials , it abruptly pulled the FAQ from its website in August 2004 , creating confusion over what acceptable prescribing practices are . [ 152 ]
It has not been re-posted since .
While countries have a right - and an obligation under the drug conventions - to take legal action against medical professionals who dispense opioids for non-medical uses , criminalizing unintentional mistakes in opioid prescription is not consistent with the right to health .
Furthermore , countries must ensure that regulations are unambiguous and that complete information about them is readily available for healthcare providers .
Cost
Cost is a frequently cited impediment to improving access to pain treatment and palliative care services , particularly for low and middle income countries .
Under the right to health , governments do not have to offer medications such as oral morphine free of charge .
However , they must strive to ensure that they are " affordable to all . "
In some countries and for certain sections of countries ' populations that will mean that it must be provided at no or very little charge .
In any case , governments must take all reasonable efforts to ensure that medications are available at a reasonable price that is affordable for patients .
Basic oral morphine should be very cheap .
Cipla in India makes 10 mg morphine tablets that sell at US $ 0.017 cents each .
[ 153 ]
Foley and others estimate that generic morphine should not cost more than US$ 0.01 per milligram . [ 154 ]
An average month 's supply of morphine would cost US$ 9 to 22.5 per month per patient . [ 155 ]
In reality , however , morphine is often much more expensive .
A study by De Lima and others found that the average retail cost of a monthly morphine supply in 2003 ranged from US $ 10 in India to US $ 254 in Argentina .
The study found that median cost of a month 's supply of morphine was more than twice as high in low and middle income countries ( US $ 112 ) as in industrialized countries ( US$ 53 ) . [ 156 ]
The study suggested that a number of factors might explain the discrepancy : the fact that most industrialized countries subsidized medications while low and middle income countries did not ; that several industrialized governments regulated the price of opioids ; taxes , licenses and other costs related to import of finished product ; large overhead of local production ; poorly developed distribution systems ; low demand ; and regulatory requirements that drive up cost . [ 157 ]
A 2007 report of the W0rldwide Palliative Care Alliance also found that the promotion of non-generic - and costly - forms of opioid analgesics has made pain treatment medications unaffordable in some areas .
It stated that " when expensive formulations of opioids appear on the market , inexpensive immediate - release morphine often becomes unavailable " as pharmaceutical companies withdraw basic oral morphine from the market .
It cited India as an example of a country where in some places hospitals have costly sustained release morphine or transdermal fentanyl but no immediate release morphine , even though the regulatory barriers are the same for both . [ 158 ]
Governments have an obligation to explore ways to ensure that basic morphine is available at low cost to people who are in need of pain treatment .
A number of countries have successfully sought ways to create capacity for local production of basic oral morphine , in tablet or liquid form , at low cost .
For example , in the state of Kerala in India , a small manufacturing unit has been set up at a hospital that produces low cost immediate release morphine tablets from morphine powder that is purchased from a factory at Ghazipur . [ 159 ]
In Uganda , the ministry of health commissioned charitable procurement and manufacturing facility to produce morphine solution which could be distributed to hospitals , health centers and palliative care providers .
Before deciding on this option , the ministry of health had approached commercial manufacturers but these were not interested in producing morphine solution due to lack of profitability .
[ 160 ]
In Vietnam , a new opioid prescription regulation allows the ministry of health to mandate state and para - state pharmaceutical companies to produce oral and injectible opioids . [ 161 ]
Breaking Out of the Vicious Cycle of Under - Treatment
Comprehensive steps to address all barriers simultaneously are needed in countries where a vicious cycle of under - treatment exists .
Governments have the responsibility to lead this process .
They need to develop plans for the implementation of palliative care and pain treatment , adopt relevant policies , introduce instruction for healthcare workers , and ensure adequate availability of morphine and other opioid medications .
The WHO , INCB , and donor community must assist in these efforts .
A number of countries have begun such efforts , with some success .
Uganda and Vietnam with the support of the international community , have made important progress in improving pain treatment and palliative care services for the population . [ 162 ]
But both still have a long way to go .
Morphine consumption in both continues to be low , certain regulatory barriers remain , and large numbers of people suffering from moderate to severe pain still do not have access to adequate treatment .
But the steps these countries have taken are laying the foundation for replacing the vicious cycle of under - treatment of pain with a positive cycle in which simpler drug control regulations and better knowledge among healthcare providers leads to increased demand for morphine , reinforcing the importance of pain management and palliative care and leading to greater awareness among healthcare workers and the public .
Uganda
Uganda , an East African country of about 31 million , has made considerable progress in tearing down barriers that have traditionally impeded the ability of people to access pain treatment medications .
In 1998 , Ugandan government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations , and WHO sat down together at a conference entitled " Freedom from Cancer and AIDS Pain " to discuss ways in which pain treatment could be made available to the population .
At the meeting , participants agreed to take a series of simultaneous steps to deal with key barriers :
The Ministry of Health and WHO were to develop a national palliative care policy , and cancer and AIDS pain relief policies .
Although Hospice Africa Uganda had taught palliative medicine in the medical , nursing and pharmacy schools and to practicing post graduate health professionals since 1993 , the Government initiated meetings which resulted in the endorsement of a 9 - month full time course training at Hospice Africa Uganda , to increase the number of prescribers .
The drug control authority was to develop new drug regulations , update the essential drug list , conduct estimates of the medical need for morphine , and request an increased national allowance from INCB .
In addition , a commitment was made to ensure coordination of palliative care activities for AIDS and cancer , to set up multidisciplinary clinics for cancer patients , to increase awareness of palliative care among the population , and to identify a demonstration project in Uganda 's Hoima District where Little Hospice Hoima , a branch of Hospice Africa Uganda was already active . [ 163 ]
In its five - year Strategic Health Plan for 2000 - 2005 , the governmentstated that palliative care was an essential clinical service for all Ugandans , becoming the first nation in Africa to do so .
It also added liquid morphine to its essential drug list , adopted a new set of Guidelines for Handling of Class A Drugs for healthcare practitioners - also a first in Africa - and , in 2003 , authorized prescribing of morphine by nurses who have been trained in palliative care .
By early 2009 , 79 nurses and clinical officers had received training on pain management and been authorized to prescribe oral morphine ; several thousand healthcare workers had attended a short course on pain and symptom management ; and 34 out of 56 districts in Uganda had oral morphine available and in use .
Despite this impressive progress , many challenges remain , including ensuring availability of oral morphine throughout Uganda ; keeping it affordable ; preventing stock - outs ; and training all relevant healthcare workers . [ 164 ]
Vietnam
Since 2005 , Vietnam , a country of 84 million people , has made considerable progress in expanding access to palliative and pain treatment services .
This progress started with the creation of a working group on palliative care .
This working group , which consisted of ministry of health officials , cancer and infectious disease physicians , and experts from NGOs supported by the US President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , decided to conduct a rapid situation analysis to assess the availability of and the need for palliative care in Vietnam , and to subsequently develop a national palliative care program based on its findings .
The rapid situation analysis found , among others , that :
· Severe chronic pain was common among cancer and HIV / AIDS patients ;
· Availability of opioid analgesics and other key medications was severely limited ;
· Palliative care services were not readily available to the population ; and
· Clinicians lacked adequate training . [ 165 ]
Based on these finding , the working group recommended that national palliative care guidelines be developed , a balanced national opioid control policy be developed , training for healthcare workers be expanded , and that availability and quality of palliative care services be improved at all levels .
In September 2006 , the ministry of health issued detailed Guidelines on Palliative Care for Cancer and AIDS Patients , which provide guidance to practitioners on palliative care and pain management .
In February 2008 , it issued new guidelines on opioid prescription which have eased a number of key regulatory barriers .
For example , the maximum daily dose has been abolished ; prescriptions can now be issued for 30 days , rather than 7 ; [ 166 ] and district hospitals and commune health posts are now authorized to prescribe and dispense .
The ministry has also approved a package of training courses for practicing physicians and two medical colleges now offer instruction on palliative care to undergraduate medical and nursing students .
Yet , numerous challenges remain as only a few hundred healthcare workers have received training so far , understanding of palliative care among healthcare officials continues to be limited , various regulatory barriers persist , [ 167 ] and few pharmacies and hospitals stock oral morphine .
Recommendations
The pain treatment gap is an international human rights crisis that needs to be addressed urgently both at the international and national level .
Therefore , Human Rights
Watch makes the following recommendations :
To governments around the world
General
· Establish , where this has not yet been done , a working group on palliative care and pain management .
This working group should include all relevant actors , including health officials , drug regulators , healthcare providers , nongovernmental palliative care providers , and academics , and develop a concrete plan of action for the progressive implementation of pain treatment and palliative care services .
· Assess both the availability of and the need for pain management and palliative care services .
· Develop a comprehensive plan of action that addresses the various barriers that impede availability of pain management and palliative care , including government policy , education , and availability of medications .
· Invite the WHO Access to Controlled Medications Programme to assist them in implementing the above recommendations .
· National human rights commissions or ombudsman offices should , where possible , investigate obstacles to availability of pain management and palliative care services , and request that their governments take urgent measures to address them .
Ensuring an Effective Supply System
· Submit , in a timely fashion , realistic estimates for the need of controlled medications to the INCB .
· Ensure an effective distribution system for controlled medications .
While procurement , transportation and stocking regulations should be able to prevent potential abuse , they should not arbitrarily complicate these processes .
· Countries must ensure that in each region at least a minimum number of pharmacies and hospitals stock morphine .
Developing and Enacting Pain Management and Palliative Care Policies
· Recognize human rights obligation to provide effective / adequate palliative care programs .
· Develop official policies on pain management and palliative care , including as part of cancer and HIV / AIDS control programs ;
· Develop practical guidelines on pain management and palliative care for healthcare workers ;
· Include oral morphine and other essential pain treatment medications in national lists of essential medicines ;
· Ensure that drug control laws and regulations recognize the indispensible nature of opioid and other controlled medications for the relief of pain and suffering , as well as the obligation to ensure their adequate availability ;
Ensuring Instruction for Healthcare Workers
· Ensure adequate instruction for healthcare workers , including doctors , nurses , and pharmacists , at both undergraduate and postgraduate level .
· Instruction should also be offered to those already practicing as part of continuing medical education .
Reforming Drug Regulations
· Review drug control regulations to assess whether they unnecessarily impede accessibility of pain medications .
Healthcare providers should participate in conducting this review .
· If regulations are found to impede access , they should be amended .
Recommendations of WHO and healthcare providers should lay at the foundation of revised drug control regulations .
· Requiring special licenses for healthcare institutions or providers to handle morphine should be avoided as much as possible .
In other cases , transparent and simple procedures should be established for obtaining such special licenses .
· Special prescription procedures for controlled medications should be avoided as much as possible .
Where they are nonetheless in place , they should be minimally burdensome .
· Limitations on the amount of morphine that can be prescribed per day should be abolished .
· Unnecessary limitations on the amount of morphine that can be prescribed or dispensed at once should be abolished .
Ensuring Affordability of Medications
· Countries should seek to ensure the affordability of morphine and other opioid analgesics .
To global drug policy makers
· Restore the balance between ensuring availability of controlled medications and preventing abuse , as provided for by the UN drug control conventions , in global drug policy debates .
Access to controlled medications should be a central and recurring agenda item at the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and other meetings on global drug policy .
· At the UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs in March 2009 , countries should make improving availability of pain treatment medicines , and controlled medications generally , a priority .
They should set ambitious and measurable goals to significantly improve access to these medicines worldwide over the coming ten years .
· After March 2009 , relevant international agencies , such as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and INCB , should regularly review progress made by countries toward adequate availability of pain treatment medications , carefully analyzing steps taken to advance this important issue .
·INCB should significantly increase its efforts to encourage and assist states in improving availability of opioid analgesics .
·UNODC should amend the model laws and regulations it has developed to include recognition of the indispensible nature of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes , and the obligation for states to ensure their availability .
To WHO , UNAIDS , and the donor community
· WHO should continue to treat access to controlled medications with urgency through its Access to Controlled Medications Programme .
· Donor countries and agencies , including the Global Fund to fight AIDS , Malaria , and Tuberculosis and the U.S. President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , should actively encourage countries to undertake comprehensive steps to improve access to pain relief medications and support those that do , including through support for the WHO Access to Controlled Medications Programme .
·UNAIDS should work with governments to identify and remove obstacles to availability and accessibility of pain management and palliative care services .
To the global human rights community
·UN and regional human rights bodies should routinely remind countries of their obligation under human rights law to ensure adequate availability of pain medications .
· Human rights groups should include access to pain treatment and palliative care into their work , including by submitting shadow reports to UN treaty bodies , providing information to the UN Special Rapporteurs on the Highest Attainable Level of Health and on Torture , Cruel , Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment , to the Human Rights Council .

Held in place by reinforced levees , the swollen Red River snakes through Fargo , North Dakota , and Moorhead , Minnesota , in this image captured by the Advanced Land Imager on NASA ’s EO - 1 satellite on March 28 , 2009 .
The river ’s usual s-shaped curves north and south of Interstate 94 had been swallowed in a bulge of water .
The main channel of the river is slightly darker than the flooded land in these areas , hinting at how extensive the floods are .
On the east side of the river , residents of Moorhead immediately north and south of the Interstate had evacuated by March 28 .
Some residents in Fargo near the top of the s- bend were also evacuated .
In this region , the river is encroaching on the tiny , neat squares that indicate neighborhoods .
U.S. Highway 10 frames the top of the image .
The road crosses the Red River via the southernmost of the cluster of bridges .
All of the bridges were closed , according to the city of Moorhead .
The bridges clearly had not seen traffic or a snowplow since the most recent snowstorm , since a strip of white covers the bridges .
The bridge immediately above U.S. Highway 10 ( probably a rail bridge ) may be flooded .
A small section of the bridge is the same dark blue color as the water .
The Red River reached a record high of 40.82 feet in this region on March 28 , when this image was taken .
By March 30 , water levels had started to recede .
Flood stage for the river is 18 feet , says the National Weather Service .
A wider view of the Red River basin on March 28 shows significant flooding north and south of Fargo and Moorhead .

" The fact is , the marijuana law in the U.S. is a big lie .
It 's racist and classist .
White rich people can smoke marijuana with impunity and poor black people get a record , can't get education , ca n't get a loan , and all of sudden go into a life of desperation and become hardened criminals .
Why ?
Because we 've got a racist law based on lies about marijuana .
There 's 80,000 people in jail today for marijuana .
We arrested 800,000 people in the last 12 months on marijuana .
Even in my rich little white suburban community of Edmonds , Wash. , 25 percent of police action is marijuana - related .
Everybody knows it 's silly .
I 'm not saying I 'm pro-drug .
I 'm just saying it 's parallel to alcohol prohibition .

I ’ve just found this fascinating case study in American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation about a man who lost conscious control over one of his hands after brain injury and suffered involuntary public masturbation episodes as a result .
Involuntary masturbation as a manifestation of stroke - related alien hand syndrome Ong Hai BG , Odderson Am J Phys Med Rehabil .
2000 Jul - Aug;79 ( 4):395 - 8 .
Alien hand syndrome is a perplexing and uncommon clinical diagnosis .
We report an unusual manifestation of alien hand syndrome in a 73 - yr - old man with a right anterior cerebral artery infarct affecting the right medial frontal cortex and the anterior portion of the corpus callosum .
We conclude that alien hand syndrome should be considered in patients who present with a feeling of alienation of one or both upper limbs accompanied by complex purposeful involuntary movement .
We tend to think of the cognitive impairments after brain injury as the most disabling – things like loss of memory or speech or language impairment , but we often neglect what we might call social impairments .
Especially when the effect is embarrassing , these can have just as strong an impact because many people massively restrict their lives to prevent causing social discomfort to themselves or others .

The leaders of the western world are wringing their hands in despair at the sight of the horrors inflicted on Gaza ( Gaza crisis , 16 January ) .
The UN general secretary , the French president and others are holding intensive discussions with some of the leaders of the Middle East in an attempt to put an end to the carnage in Gaza .
Word , words , words .
Meanwhile , hundreds of Palestinian civilians get killed , thousands are bleeding to death , tens of thousands are uprooted and wandering in vain in search of some shelter to protect them .
The Israeli army bombs hospitals and Unrwa relief centres , and , defying international convention , it uses white phosphorus bombs against civilians .
" What else can we do ? " these leaders keep asking .
Well , here is what you can do : move from words to deeds .
Only immediate , decisive and strict sanctions against the state of Israel and its limitless aggression will make it realise that there 's a limit .
We , as Israeli citizens , raise our voices to call on EU leaders : use sanctions against Israel 's brutal policies and join the active protests of Bolivia and Venezuela .
We appeal to the citizens of Europe : please attend to the Palestinian Human Rights Organisation 's call , supported by more than 540 Israeli citizens ( www.freegaza.org/en/home/): boycott Israeli goods and Israeli institutions ; follow resolutions such as those made by the cities of Athens , Birmingham and Cambridge ( US ) .
This is the only road left .
Help us all , please !

The distinguished academics introduce their letter ( 16 January ) by stating " ... a war that Israel has been waging against the people of Palestine for more than 60 years ... " .
May I remind the writers that when the state of Israel was established - by the UN , in 1948 - it was five Arab armies and all the Palestinian militias who invaded Israel and not the reverse .
May I also remind them that Israel only obtained the territories in 1967 - after having to fight a third war for survival .
And that within a week of winning that war - and occupying the territories - Israel offered to return them in exchange for peace , an offer echoed in UN resolution 242 ( and delivered with the return of lands to Egypt in 1979 ) .
The emphatic Arab response came at the conference in Khartoum in 1968 , with the famous three nos : no recognition of the state of Israel , no negotiation with Israel and no peace with Israel .
The Palestinians - and many Arab states - have sustained that belligerency ever since and in every forum : military , economic and diplomatic .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Washington Mutual Inc , the failed U.S. savings and loan , has sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp for well over $ 13 billion in connection with the loss of its banking operations , which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co .

In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , the thrift ’s former parent accused the FDIC of having on January 23 made a “ cryptic disallowance ” of its claims , prompting the lawsuit .
It also accused the FDIC of agreeing to an unreasonably low price in arranging the a $ 1.9 billion sale of the banking business to JPMorgan on September 25 , when regulators seized Washington Mutual and appointed the FDIC as receiver .
JPMorgan did not buy the parent holding company , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the following day .
In its complaint , Washington Mutual seeks to recover as much as $ 6.5 billion of capital contributions it said it made to its banking unit from December 2007 through the seizure .
Washington Mutual also seeks the return of $ 4 billion of trust preferred securities it said were wrongfully transferred to the banking unit , and said it may be entitled to as much as $ 3 billion of tax refunds .
It also seeks damages of $ 177.1 million related to unpaid loans made to the banking unit .
The company also made claims on several other matters that together could add to any recovery .
Washington Mutual is seeking a jury trial .
In the January 23 letter , the FDIC said it disallowed Washington Mutual ’s claims because they lacked documentation or specificity , failed to state grounds to recover , appeared to be made against third parties , or had no legal basis .
FDIC spokesman David Barr said the regulator does not comment on lawsuits .
Seattle - based Washington Mutual failed after mortgage losses soared , and following a 10 - day bank run when customers withdrew $ 16.7 billion of deposits .
It had about $ 307 billion of assets , and remains by far the largest U.S. lender to fail .
The parent is seeking to pay off creditors with amounts it recovers in the Chapter 11 proceedings .
The case is Washington Mutual Inc v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , No. 09-00533 .
Paludis represents an ebuild ’s homepage as a dependency - style heirarchy , since PMS allows use - conditional blocks like :
HOMEPAGE = " http://example.org/foo gtk ? ( http://example.org/foo-gtk ) "
Given this , we want a quick way of extracting the URLs using the Ruby bindings .
One could of course use a function :
def extract_homepage_recursively ( spec ) case spec when AllDepSpec , ConditionalDepSpec spec.each { | child | extract_homepage_recursively ( child ) } when SimpleURIDepSpec puts spec end end extract_homepage_recursively (id.homepage_key.value ) if id.homepage_key
But that ’s rather crude .
It would be much nicer to use a lambda , since we do n’t need a new name for something we ’re only using once .
Unfortunately , recursive lambdas are sometimes rather pesky .
There are various solutions , most of which involve passing the lambda as a parameter to itself .
In the general case , there ’s the infamous Y combinator , but since Ruby has language - level recognition for recursion there ’s no need to resort to that kind of silliness .
We could just use a variable :
recurse = lambda do | recurse , spec | case spec when AllDepSpec , ConditionalDepSpec spec.each { | child | recurse.call ( recurse , child ) } when SimpleURIDepSpec puts spec end end recurse.call( recurse , id.homepage_key.value ) if id.homepage_key
But that ’s still a pointless waste of a name .
We can do better than that .
Ruby 1.9 adds an Object#tap method , which is rather nifty .
Ruby 1.8 does n’t have it , but we can provide it easily :
if not Object .respond_to ?
: tap class

Banking trojans are inundating the Internet .
These malicious programs lay in wait on your hard drive for an opportune moment to crack your online banking account — usually just as you log on .
You can get them by clicking on a viral link to a greeting card or video that arrives in e-mail spam .
Or by clicking to a web page that ’s been corrupted by hackers .
By now , most Internet users are savvy about “ phishing ” e-mail scams that try to trick them you into typing login information at fake bank websites .
So cyber thieves have shifted to spreading invisible banking trojans , which can steal data mulitple ways and require no action by the victim .
“ It ’s bascially phishing 2.0 , ” says Patrik Runald , security specialist at F - Secure .
“ Instead of giving you a fake page to get your logon credentials , they steal it directly from you . ”
F -secure tallied 59,177 unique banking trojans circulating on the Internet in 2008 , up from 15,969 in 2007 and 6,690 in 2006 .
The escalation partly underscores how intensively criminal hackers churn out new variants to escape detection by antivirus programs .
Brazilian spawning grounds
If you think the USA has it bad , consider Brazil .
Ã‚Â
The latest , greatest banking trojans invariably spawn in Brazil and subsequently spread world wide , much like the latest strain of flu virus often starts in Asia and circles the globe .
Here ’s why : Back in the 1970s and 1980s , hyperinflation and economic chaos led Brazil to streamline its basic system for completing financial transactions .
The new system , called Sistema de Pagamentos Brasileiro , or SPB , helped the South American nation restore its transactions infrastructure .
But it also accelerated its citizenry ’s dependence on online banking .
Today 60 % of Internet users in Brazil are online banking patrons , versus 23 % in the United States , according to Colin Groudin , CEO of Grail Research .
What ’s more , Brazilians use their debit cards and file electronic tax returns much more than we do , Groudin says .
Quite naturally , the best - and - brightest malicious software coders and thieving cyber gangs swarmed Brazil like flies to honey .
Brazil has emerged as one of the most hostile online environment in the world ; in particular , it has become a hotbed for innovation in banking trojans , says Gunter Ollmann , of IBM Internet Security Systems .
Brazilian banks have not just stood pat .
Brazil is home to some of the most sophisticated security countermeasures on the planet .
Banks have literally figured out how to conduct secure online transactions working under the assumption that 100 % of customer machines are infected , says Ollmann
Criminals tool kits
The bad guys have had to keep innovating .
Meanwhile , pioneering schemes that no longer work well in Brazil have found their way into underground commodity markets .
Banking trojans that were cutting - edge in Brazil two years ago can be purchased today in commodity tool kits with names like “ Turkojan Constructor ” or “ TrojanToWorm Creation Kit . ”
So any Joe Blow with average tech aptitude can become an online John Dillinger .
“ Off the shelf technology give anyone the abilityÃ‚Â to create a piece of malware and launch a banking trojan attack , ” says Ollmann .
“ For a few hundred dollars you can purchase a tool kit and create your own customized malware to target a financial institution of your choice . ”
The toolkits come with everything a criminal needs to carry out a basic attack , including software for spreading viral links in email spam or corrupting trusted web pages .
The idea is to slip your banking trojan onto the hard drive of anyone who clicks on that viral email link or tainted web page .
A typical banking trojan remains dormant waiting for an opportune moment , usually when the victim logs on to a banking website .
It then steals usernames and passwords by capturing keystrokes or copying the log - on page after the victim has filled it out .
So - called “ man - in - the - middle ” trojans go further .
One type injects additional form boxes asking the user to type in a Social Security number , mother ’s maiden name , and other valuable data .
Another type reproduces a copy of the web page showing account balances – except with the balances altered to show the numbers the victim expects to see .
This buys time for the thief to drain the account and hide his trail , says Ollmann .
Yet another type of man - in - the - middle trojan displays an official - looking banner notice asking the account holder to call a number to resolve a problem ; a con artist answers and talks the victim into divulging Social Security numbers , mother ’s maiden name and other data useful for future scams , says Mickey Boodaei , CEO of security firm Trusteer .
“ You think you ’re calling your bank , ” he says .
“ A criminal gets all the information , then they can use this information to open a banking account or do a transaction on your behalf .
And they got all this information from you . ”
Modest protections
How effective are popular consumer antivirus suites in protecting against banking trojans ?
“ Modest , ” says Jose Nazario , senior researcher at Arbor Networks .
“ The volume of malware and the technology they employ – and the incentive to avoid detection at all costs – means that most AV has only modest detection of these variants . ”
There are other effective defense mechanisms available to U.S. consumers .
But the U.S. banking industry , for the moment , is choosingÃ‚Â not to promote them widely .
Doug Johnson , vice president of risk management policy for the American Bankers Association , told me that financial institutions are required to have “ additional levels of security , ” and that most banks are meeting this requirement with technologies that “ are transparent to the user . ”
When I askedÃ‚Â Johnson for specific examples , Ã‚Â he cited a couple of systems banks use to make sure that online banking customer is logging on from his or her usual PC .
He could not cite any specific protections against man - in - the - middle attacks , nor give me an estimate of how much the U.S. banking industry loses each year in unauthorized online banking transactions .
“ Online banking , on balance , is safe , ” insists Johnson .
YetÃ‚Â U.S. banks continue to make it easy for crooks .
Ã‚Â
Most online accounts require only a username and password to gain access .
Major banks in Brazil , across Europe and in parts of Asia additionally require a unique code generated by a key fob token or smart card , or sent via text message to the account holder ’s cell phone .
So - called “ multiple factor authentication ” Ã‚Â systems are available – Ã ‚ Â but not widely promoted — in the U.S .
“ Username and Password still rule the earth .
It ’s not that there are n’t better methods for authentication - there are , but stronger authentication schemes still come at the cost of added complexity , added cost , or both , ” says Brian Chess , chief scientist at Fortify Software . ” Since many users do n’t understand the risks they face , more complex authentication schemes can come off as an inconvenience .
It would be great see wider adoption of token - based authentication schemes such as PayPal ’s Security Key , but for true widespread adoption , the cost has to be lower and the benefits have to be better understood by the public . ”
Trusteer has a nifty anti-theft system that works in the browser directly preventing man - in - the - middle attacks , Ã‚Â which it supplies to customers of ING Direct and several other banks .
“ Basically what it does is to block , specific types of attempts to access information and tamper withÃ‚Â informationÃ‚Â in the browser , ” says Boodaei .
You can actually use a free version of Rapport and set up basic browser protection for the specific set of online banking and shopping websites you regularly use .
This technology sounds like a silver bullet , at least in terms of protecting against banking trojans .

With confirmation of the first death from swine flu in the United States , public - health officials are struggling to find the way to put preventive measures in place without fueling unnecessary fears .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) Tuesday morning said a 23 - month - old boy in Texas has died of swine flu .
The child , who was Mexican , had traveled to the US for treatment .
Four students in Delaware are also being tested for the virus .
To date , authorities have confirmed 64 swine - flu cases in the United States , in five states .
President Obama said Tuesday he is monitoring the situation .
The first confirmed swine - flu death indicates that " this is obviously a serious situation – serious enough to take the utmost precautions , " he said .
" My thoughts and prayers and deepest condolences go out to the family [ of the Texas child ] , as well as those who are ill and recovering from this flu . "
Most reported incidents of flu in the US have been mild so far compared with those in Mexico , where the health secretary said Monday that seven deaths have been confirmed and perhaps 150 more are suspected .
Thousands have become ill .
[ Editor 's note :
The original text stated a higher number of deaths , which
Mexican officials have revised downward . ]
In the US , the outbreak 's epicenter is in New York , where health officials have confirmed 45 cases and suspect hundreds more .
Two schools have been closed , and officials are considering closing a third .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg says the city is acting out of an abundance of caution , although he does expect to see other cases .
" So far , the swine flu here looks like the garden variety we see every year , " says Mayor Bloomberg .
The outbreak in New York was detected last week at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens , after several students returned from spring break in Cancún , Mexico .
Hundreds of students there eventually came down with symptoms , according to Thomas Frieden , New York City health commissioner , but most of the cases were mild and the students are recovering .
Students at two other schools , one public and one parochial , are also being tested for swine flu .
Because most cases involve only mild symptoms , the city has decided not to test every student with a sore throat , cough , and runny nose .
" Our focus now is to very , very carefully look to see if there are any cases of severe illness tied to swine flu , " says Dr. Thomas Frieden .
" All we 're seeing now is a flu season that 's a lot later than our usual flu season . "
So far , two New Yorkers have been hospitalized : a young boy in the Bronx and a woman from Brooklyn .
Both are recovering well , according to Dr. Frieden .
Experts so far applaud the way the federal government and the CDC have reacted , noting the uncertainties that face officials in responding to a new strain of flu .
" We need a sound public - health response , and I worry that people are reading into this rather small problem their horror fantasies about a big problem that has n't happened yet , " says Philip Alcabes , author of " Dread : How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics From the Black Death to the Avian Flu . "
" We have a public - health system that is capable of controlling these things , and we should take reassurance from a long history of the system being able to do that . "

1977 : Two Boeing 747s collide on a fog - shrouded runway at Tenerife in the Canary Islands , killing 583 people in the worst accident in aviation history .
Sixty - one people survive .
The planes – Pan Am flight 1736 originating in Los Angeles and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight 4805 , a charter from Amsterdam – crashed into each other on Los Rodeos Airport 's single runway .
Visibility on the ground was poor , limited to 1,000 feet or so , but many other factors led to the disaster .
Muddled instructions , malfunctioning runway lights and an overcrowded airport played roles , too , but perhaps the major factor was pilot error , specifically the bad judgment exercised by the Dutch captain .
The KLM jumbo was under the command of Capt .
Jacob Veldhuyzen van Zanten , a seasoned pilot so popular and photogenic that the airline used him both in its marketing materials and as a de facto company spokesman .
Although van Zanten was KLM 's most experienced 747 pilot , he had spent most of his time recently in simulators , training other pilots for the service .
When news of the disaster reached KLM officials they tried to find van Zanten , only to discover he had been the pilot involved .
Pan Am 1736 was piloted by Capt .
Victor Grubbs , who came aboard when the plane made an intermediate stop in New York .
The chain of events leading up to the crash began earlier in the day at another airport in the Canary Islands .
A militant separatist group set off a small bomb at Las Palmas Airport on Gran Canaria , closing that field and rerouting air traffic to the much - smaller Los Rodeos Airport on Tenerife .
With the apron at Los Rodeos full of airplanes , overworked controllers began directing incoming flights onto taxiways that intersected the main runway .
Both Pan Am 1736 and KLM 4805 were sent to taxiways .
Van Zanten took the opportunity to refuel his aircraft , which took about 35 minutes .
As soon as refueling was completed , he fired up his engines .
Both captains were eager to get going , especially Grubbs , who had already flown for eight hours and was tired .
Their anxiousness , coupled with the tower 's occasionally unclear instructions of how to proceed through the morass , helped set the stage for what happened next .
In an attempt to move Pan Am 1736 off the main runway , controllers instructed Grubbs to turn onto taxiway 3 ( although taxiway 4 would have been better logistically to set up for takeoff ) .
In any case , the weather was deteriorating .
Grubbs was unfamiliar with Los Rodeos and had trouble locating the correct taxiway in reduced visibility .
Van Zanten , in KLM 4805 , had gassed up and was maneuvering toward takeoff himself .
He was aware of the Pan Am jumbo , but had no visual contact .
He asked for takeoff clearance and was told to stand by .
Whether he misheard the instruction , or ignored it , van Zanten proceeded to go .
What he did n't know was that Pan Am 1736 was taxiing down the runway directly toward him , still looking for its assigned taxiway .
As the cockpit voice recorder later revealed , Pan Am first officer Robert Bragg spotted the KLM jumbo's landing lights through the fog and screamed to Grubbs , who tried to steer his plane off the runway .
It was too late .
KLM 4805 , at full throttle and lifting off , struck the other plane just aft of the starboard wing .
Propelled by its forward momentum , the Dutch plane rose to an altitude of roughly 100 feet before nosediving into the runway and exploding in a fireball .
Pan Am 1736 also burst into flames and broke into several pieces .
Most of the survivors from that aircraft were seated forward of the wings .
All 248 people aboard KLM 4805 were killed .
On Pan Am 1736 , seven of the 16 - member flight crew , along with two company employees and 61 passengers , survived , although nine later died of their injuries .
Grubbs was not among the survivors .
Despite the various factors feeding into the disaster , the official inquiry laid the entire blame on van Zanten .
The veteran pilot 's most egregious sin , caused either by impatience or miscommunication , was to take off without having received clearance from the tower .
Had van Zanten waited , the worst aviation accident in history would never have happened .

The Fiction Circus Interviews James Grimmelmann About the Google Books Settlement
THE FICTION CIRCUS INTERVIEWS PROFESSOR JAMES GRIMMELMANN
The Fiction Circus combed its hair , sharpened its teeth , and tracked down James Grimmelmann last week , the law professor responsible for New York Law School 's critical amicus brief which will address antitrust concerns regarding the Google book settlement , in addition to the settlement 's impact on orphan book legislation and the creation of a Book Rights Registry which will " take over " copyright for rightsholders who can't be found .
If you are a writer or publisher , if you KNOW a writer or publisher , or if you hope to someday BE a writer or publisher , you should check out this interview to get your mind around the evolving shape of publishing and to begin coping with the direction of this country 's copyright legislation .***
Transcript in HTML
Transcript in plain text
***
We spent a good hour discussing the pressing issues with Professor Grimmelmann , getting him to explain tricky legal matters to us , and oscillating wildly between ignorance and indignance before settling -- finally -- on simple , honest worry as the dominant emotion regarding Google 's settlement .
Before he finishes his brief ( it is due May 5th ) , we also got Professor Grimmelmann to consider the idea of a two - year long rights auction for orphan books , where anyone in the world could bid on the right to display scans of out - of - print , in - copyright literature without being sued , a right that under the current terms of the settlement only Google will have .
Under the Fiction Circus scheme , the rights would default to Google if no one bids on a particular title .
However , the auction would serve to raise up the prices on more valuable properties so that rightsholders will be adequately compensated for their stolen scans .
Additionally , the auction could create a whole new market for orphan literature , giving birth to small electronic publishers who will be able to compete with Sony , Amazon , Apple , and Google because they will now have exclusive works that they will be able to advertise , promote , and display in ways that the big companies have neither the aptitude nor inclination to pursue .
Moreover , a rights auction could create a speculation market for orphan books , driving up settlement revenues for authors and letting books be appraised by a shrewd marketplace as opposed to Google 's arbitrary ranking system .
During the course of the interview , we also discovered several other troubling facts that makes an auction seem absolutely necessary :
Google will have the right to manage the content of its scans in the same way that it manages YouTube videos , deleting content that it deems " inappropriate " without any clear editorial guidelines .
Since no one else has the right to put this literature up without being sued , the literature that Google deems " inappropriate " will effectively be banned from the internet for decades until it becomes public domain .
Under a rights auction , people who WANT the rights to that " inappropriate " literature will be able to buy them like you can buy old copies of Gallery and Hustler on any Manhattan street corner .
All those cheap porn novels published in the seventies written by angry heroin addicts who are now dead could finally see the light of day again in a huge , sleazy archive run by a goddamn degenerate , IF YOU WISH UPON A STAR .
NOTE : As of this interview , the Internet Archive 's bid to be included in Google 's settlement as a party defendant has been struck down by the judge presiding over the settlement , sending a message to others who may want to try the same strategy .
Additionally , a lawyer representing the estates of John Steinbeck and Philip K. Dick ( among others ) has pushed for a four month extension of the settlement , claiming that they do n't know what the fuck is going on and that one week is not nearly enough time to figure it out .
The Judge has approved the request , and the settlement will be extended until September .
Moreover , the Justice Department has now opened an inquiry into the settlement to investigate antitrust claims .
Any AUTHOR , PUBLISHER , or other RIGHTSHOLDER included in the settlement 's class who has problems with the ruling must submit objections before September 7th , or be damned .

Why did the fried - chicken maker cross the road ?
To fill the potholes , of course .
The folks at KFC recently cooked up an appetizing offer for cash - strapped cities :
The restaurant chain will fix crater - ridden streets for free if they 're allowed to brand repairs with a chalked - on message saying that the road has been " Re- Freshed by KFC . "
Company president Roger Eaton put the deal on the table last week in an open letter to America 's mayors .
KFC intends to select four towns to receive " a smooth drive that is fit for a colonel . "
KFC started the project in its hometown of Louisville , Ky. , to market its " Fresh Tastes Best " campaign .
A " professional road repair crew " performs all of the work , filling the holes with .$?.$?. well , we can only assume that it 's some sort of secret recipe .
It 's a tempting opportunity .
Let 's see if Cleveland or other Northeast Ohio towns bite on it .
Checkups :
Do you have car insurance ?
In Ohio , that 's a $ 728,603.20 question .
That 's the amount of cash set aside this year for a mailing program asking random motorists to verify coverage .
Records show that the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles allocated enough dollars to send out more than 5,400 proof of insurance forms per week .
Roughly one in 20 motorists can expect a " Dear Vehicle Owner " letter , which orders a snappy response with the requested documentation in order to avoid a license suspension .
The program started a decade ago .
It 's time for it to go , according to some lawmakers .
A pair of state representatives -- Bob Hagan , a Democrat from Youngstown , and Matt Huffman , a Republican from Lima -- introduced a bill last month seeking to eliminate the hit - and - miss mailings .
The goal , Hagan said , is to create a simpler system to confirm that Ohioans follow the law and carry insurance .
One idea may be for motorists to show proof of insurance whenever they renew license plates or their driver 's license .
" We need to rearrange the verification program in a way that is cheaper and does n't harass people , " Hagan said .
It 's hard to argue with that .
Vanishing act :
There 's certainly a reason for the marker facing Parkland Boulevard motorists turning onto Lander Road in Mayfield Heights .
What is it ?
Sorry , Road Rant 's drawing a blank .$?.$ ?. just like the sign .
The full text on what certainly started out as a No Parking notice faded long ago .
All that remains is a bisected letter P on the top portion of the weathered marker .
Given the lean of this street - side marker , it qualifies as worn out in more ways than one .
It 's time to retire this sign , Mayfield Heights .
That message seems clears .
Bulb planting :
Cleveland greened up State Road .
City workers replaced a burnt - out bulb in a traffic signal at State and Burger Avenue , adding some needed shine -- and motorist guidance -- to the intersection just north of Interstate 480 .
Road Rant reported on that no - go green light earlier this month .
Blank lights , by the way , appear to be popping up like spring daffodils .
Do n't worry , Cleveland :
We 'll let you know where they are .
Here are two more in need of fixing .
The green is out facing northbound lanes on State at Biddulph Avenue .
The red is out facing northbound lanes on West Boulevard at Clifton Road .
Illuminating :
Power to the people .
Cleveland repaired out - of - order street lights along Carnegie Avenue between Stearns Road and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive .
The work took place after a note on the outage appeared in Road Rant .
" Hooray , " e-mailed the tipster who passed along the initial complaint .
A MUSLIM fundamentalist leader spoke this weekend of his vision of Britain under Sharia law .
Anjem Choudary said he wanted the “ flag of Allah ” flying over Downing Street , all women wearing burkhas and caning for drunkenness .
He is the leader of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah , founded as a successor to the banned fundamentalist sect al - Muhajiroun , which was led by now - exiled preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad .
Choudary , 41 , who fancies himself a “ judge ” in some pathetic outfit called the “ Sharia Court of the UK ” admitted his followers had organised protests against British soldiers in Luton , waving placards which called them “ murderers ” for their conduct in Iraq .
The Islamic whackjob said he was proud to be reviled :
It ’s inevitable that when you offer an alternative morality and way of life many people will hate you for it .
His vision of an “ alternative morality ” would mean :
A pure Islamic state with Sharia law in Britain .
Every woman , whether Muslim or non-Muslim , would have to wear a traditional burka and cover everything apart from her face and hands in public .
In matters to do with the judicial system and the penal code , one male witness is sufficient to counter the testimony of two females .
People who commit adultery would be stoned to death .
Choudary , a father of three , admits he lives off benefits despite objecting to the British state .
He rejected suggestions of hypocrisy , saying :
I do n’t think it ’s of any importance .
Choudary spoke out just a week after 600 demonstrators – many of them Muslims or former Muslims – sent a strong message to the Government that sharia was wholly unwelcome in the UK and other Western democracies .
The One Law for All demonstration was the first rally Â of its kind in London , and was organised to warn that shariaÂ posed a dangerous threat to community cohesion in the UK .
One speaker , National Secular Society President Terry Sanderson , denounced the policy of accommodation and appeasement of the political Islamic movement .
He said :
We do not need another legal system running in parallel … sharia is creeping into our legal system and society and we must stop it in its tracks now !
Philosopher professor A C Grayling told the crowd :
Once you start fragmenting society , once you start allowing different groups in society to apply different standards , you get very profound injustices – and it is almost always women who suffer these injustices .
We have to fight hard to keep one law for everybody .
To end with – thanks to Mike of the USA who sent us the link – here is an entirely appropriate YouTube video

Obama exonerates CIA torturers
By Patrick Martin
17 April 2009
President Barack Obama announced Thursday that CIA agents who engaged in torture of prisoners over the past seven years will not be prosecuted or punished .
As the Justice Department released memos documenting in grisly detail the interrogation guidelines set down by the Bush administration , the White House made it clear that neither those who ordered the torture nor those who carried it out would face justice .
The four memos released Thursday were written by the Office of Legal Counsel , an arm of the US Department of Justice , in 2002 and 2005 .
Their release was compelled by a court - established deadline in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
The ACLU denounced the Obama White House statement barring any prosecution of torturers .
ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said the memos “ provide yet more incontrovertible evidence that Bush administration officials at the highest level of government authorized and gave legal blessings to acts of torture that violate domestic and international law . ”
The memos document in detail the methods employed against as many as 30 prisoners — a much larger number than previously admitted — including waterboarding , beating and kicking , slamming a prisoner ’s head into the wall , slapping , forced standing , forced nakedness , prolonged shackling , sleep deprivation , deprivation of food and threats against a detainee ’s family members .
Attorney General Eric Holder , chief US law enforcement officer , defended the decision not to enforce the laws against torture , saying , “ At a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . ”
CIA Director Leon Panetta , a former Democratic congressman and former White House chief of staff in the Clinton administration , sent a message to CIA employees which declared that the CIA under the Bush administration had “ repeatedly sought and repeatedly received written assurances from the Department of Justice that its practices were fully consistent with the laws and legal obligations of the United States .
Those operations were also approved by the president and the National Security Council principals , and were briefed to the congressional leadership . ”
Panetta ’s statement underscores one of the principal considerations of the Obama White House .
Any serious effort to prosecute torture at the CIA “ black sites ” — the secret prisons established as part of the Bush administration ’s “ war on terror ” — would inevitably expose leading congressional Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , to criminal sanctions , because they knew of and approved the brutal methods ordered by Bush and Cheney .
Not only will the Obama administration refuse to prosecute CIA officers , Panetta said , but the Department of Justice will provide free legal counsel to anyone “ subject to investigations relating to these operations . ”
This means that the US government will represent and defend CIA torturers if they face congressional investigation , civil lawsuits by their victims , or prosecution under international law , such as the International Convention on Torture , to which the United States is a signatory .
The US government will also pay any judgment against CIA agents if they lose a suit for damages .
Obama himself sent a letter to all CIA employees explaining his decision to release the torture memos , an action that was opposed by Panetta and former CIA Director Michael Hayden .
He wrote , “ the release of these memos is required by our commitment to the rule of law . ”
This commitment extends only to producing pieces of paper — released with names and other incriminating details redacted — but not to any actual sanctions against those who committed horrific crimes .
The text of the statement Obama issued from the White House is typical of the mix of hypocrisy , demagogy and lying that characterizes the major pronouncements of the new president .
Obama never uses the word torture , substituting a series of euphemisms that were then parroted in media coverage , where the word “ torture ” appears only in quotations from critics of the White House decision .
Obama claims that “ In one of my very first acts as president , I prohibited the use of these interrogation techniques by the United States because they undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer . ”
In fact , this prohibition is not absolute and is essentially a cosmetic gesture , aimed at restoring the “ moral authority ” of an imperialist power which has carried out massive war crimes .
Profusely apologizing to the CIA for releasing the documents , Obama hastens to reassure the intelligence agencies that he still supports them , declaring , “ in a dangerous world , the United States must sometimes carry out intelligence operations and protect information that is classified for purposes of national security .
I have already fought for that principle in court and will do so again in the future . ”
Obama describes the CIA torturers as people “ who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . ”
This echoes the “ just - following - orders ” defense that was rejected by the Nuremberg Tribunal when Nazi war criminals sought to use it .
No one needed a memo to tell them that the methods employed in the CIA “ black sites ” were brutal , repugnant and criminal .
That is why the CIA and its protectors have stonewalled the courts , long after the details have become public through leaks to the press based on the accounts of those who survived the interrogations , as well as the findings of the International Committee of the Red Cross .
The bulk of the Obama statement is devoted to glorifying the “ intelligence community , ” in language that would be echoed word for word by Bush and Cheney : “ The men and women of our intelligence community serve courageously on the front lines of a dangerous world .
Their accomplishments are unsung and their names unknown , but because of their sacrifices , every single American is safer .
We must protect their identities as vigilantly as they protect our security , and we must provide them with the confidence that they can do their jobs . ”
The truth is that US intelligence agencies carry out assassinations , torture , subversion and provocation in the interests , not of the American people , but of the American corporate - financial ruling elite .
The CIA is reviled all over the world as the American “ Murder Inc. , ” which has overthrown governments targeted by Washington , instigated civil wars and established military dictatorships in country after country .
Obama ’s statement combines abject cowardice , as he bows before the power of the military / intelligence apparatus , and an embrace of its history of violence and counterrevolution , as he pledges in the statement , “ I will always do whatever is necessary to protect the national security of the United States . ”
In closing , the US president declares , “ This is a time for reflection , not retribution ... nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past .
Our national greatness is embedded in America 's ability to right its course in concert with our core values , and to move forward with confidence .
That is why we must resist the forces that divide us , and instead come together on behalf of our common future . ”
What cynical rubbish !
As if torture can be stopped by exonerating the torturers and concealing their crimes from the public !
The message is clear : anyone who demands accountability for the crimes committed under the Bush administration ( and continued under the Obama administration ) is acting to “ divide ” the nation .
By declaring an amnesty for those who carried out actions that — even according to the Obama administration — constituted torture and were illegal , the White House is sanctioning criminal activity by the state .
This amounts to a carte blanche to the military and intelligence apparatus to utilize whatever illegal methods they choose to employ .
Obama ’s kowtowing to the most reactionary forces within the state underscores the vast and ever - growing power that this “ state within a state ” exerts over all aspects of government policy .
It is one more demonstration of the terminal decay of American democracy .
More people are out of work in a third of constituencies across Britain than when the Conservatives left power , new figures revealed yesterday .
The striking statistic emerged as the Government braces itself for unemployment to pass two million this week .
An analysis of unemployment in parliamentary seats shows that the problem is cutting deep into all areas of the country .
The highest rises are in the South and Midlands , in many Tory seats and Labour marginals , underscoring the battle facing Gordon Brown to win the next election .
Unsurprisingly , major manufacturing centres in the Midlands have seen dramatic rises in the past 12 years .
But sharp increases have also taken place in Tory areas .
Wokingham in Berkshire has seen a 61 per cent rise in jobless since May 1997 , while it has risen 60 per cent in South Holland and the Deepings in Lincolnshire .
Labour marginal seats include Rossendale and Darwen , with a 46 per cent rise , Swindon North , up 44 per cent , and Corby , up 37 per cent .

Last month it emerged that unemployment for the last quarter of 2008 reached 1.97 million , an increase of 148,000 .
Since January , tens of thousands of people have been laid off , suggesting the total will surpass two million , the highest for 12 years , when the Office of National Statistics publishes unemployment data on Wednesday .
Last week Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell promised help for jobless white - collar workers .
But the Tories claimed that last year one job centre was closed every week .
Theresa May , the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary , said : " Labour 's failure to tackle the skills gap has left too many people ill - prepared for the recession . "

The Spartans , located 90 miles up the road in East Lansing , will certainly have the crowd on their side .
The talent gap , though ?
Eek .
They 'll have to be at least 35 points better than they were in December when the teams met in this same building -- a 98 -63 UNC romp .
" They had a couple players that were hurt and came off a long road stretch , " Lawson said .
" We know they 're a better team right now . "
Meanwhile , Villanova ( 30 - 8 ) ends a successful season two wins short of its first title since 1985 , when Rollie Massimino coaxed one of the greatest upsets in sports history out of his guys -- 66 - 64 over Patrick Ewing , John Thompson and Georgetown .
Thompson was on press row doing radio and Massimino was chomping his gum nervously behind the Villanova bench , part of the record crowd of 72,456 at Ford Field -- half gone and streaming toward the exits with 5 minutes left .
But James Naismith himself probably could n't have helped ' Nova out of this one .
North Carolina simply had too much talent .
" They played a great game and are playing extremely well , " Villanova coach Jay Wright said .
" They 've got all the pieces , and we have great respect for them .
We 've been getting better every game , and we did not get better tonight . "
Carolina did .
Last season , in one of the more inexplicable performances in Final Four history , the Tar Heels trailed Kansas 40 - 12 midway through the first half .
This time , they led 40 - 23 .
" I 've been there .
I was there a year ago , " North Carolina coach Roy Williams said .
" It feels like somebody jerks your heart out and shakes it . "
Ellington made five of his first six shots , including a 3 - pointer after a perfect crosscourt pass over the top from Danny Green .
Nobody had an answer for Hansbrough , who once found himself bodied up with Dante Cunningham , faked left , then spun to the baseline and saw no more resistance -- a way - too - easy layup .
Lawson , he of the injured toe and the successful trip to the craps table in downtown Detroit a few nights previous -- well , he stayed on a roll , going 5 - for - 11 with eight assists and seven rebounds .
Had he shot better than 10 - for - 17 from the line , this game might have been more lopsided .
And so , what began as a tournament with great potential for the Big East -- three top seeds , two in the Final Four -- will end with the conference on the sideline .
" Right now , Carolina proved that regardless of conference , they 're playing the best basketball in the country right now , " Wright said .
" So did Michigan State . "
No disrespect to Villanova , which did , in fact , make this interesting for a brief time .
The Wildcats cut the deficit to five early in the second half .
It could have been three , but Cunningham 's jumper went halfway in before cruelly rimming out .
Green answered with a 3 - pointer , then the Tar Heels got a steal and layup from Lawson to push the lead back to 10 .
That took all of 64 seconds .
" Big - time players make big - time shots in big - time games , " Ellington said of the Green 3 .
Though the rest of the second half was a jumbled mess for both teams -- which allowed Villanova to stay in shouting distance -- the Wildcats never got it back under double digits .
It was a typical no -quit effort from Wright 's group of seasoned upperclassmen , who battled through the Big East and started putting it together come tournament time .
Scottie Reynolds will always have that indelible end - to - end game - winning layup against Pittsburgh last weekend that got Villanova to its Final Four since ' 85 .
His first basket in this one , however , did n't come until more than 9 minutes were gone and the deficit was in double digits .
He finished with 17 points on 6 - for - 18 shooting .
Cunningham , the Wildcats ' leading scorer and rebounder this season , had 12 and 12 .
Reggie Redding had 15 points , and Corey Fisher scored 13 in 5 - for - 19 shooting .
A lot of the Villanova stats did n't look so bad .
They got five more rebounds and were even in the turnover battle .
They hustled and dove on the floor all night .
But as the game was getting out of reach early , they simply could n't defend .
North Carolina shot 67 percent while opening that 17 - point lead in the first half .
The Tar Heels led 49 - 40 at halftime .
And the Wildcats could n't shoot .
' Nova shot 33 percent from the floor , not exactly the 78.6 percent from that " perfect game " back in ' 85 .
They were even worse from 3 - point range -- 5 - for - 27 .
And there were way too many scenes reminiscent of big brother vs. little brother :
Where the Villanova player would drive the middle , make a few head fakes and the Carolina guy would just stand there , wait for the histrionics to end and block or alter the shot .
" Even when shots do n't fall , we pride ourselves on find a way to win , " senior Dwayne Anderson said .
" We did n't find a way tonight . "
What resulted was , quite simply , what it looks like when a roster of very good college players goes up against a team full of NBA - caliber talent .
Hansbrough .
Freshman forward Ed Davis .
Lawson .
Green .
Ellington .
The last three in that group actually considered the NBA after last season but did n't get the right feedback from scouts .
Another year of seasoning could n't hurt , they figured , and that made the Tar Heels the team to beat starting in preseason , when they were the unanimous No. 1 in The Associated Press poll .
The last time the Heels were No. 1 at the beginning and the end was 1982 -- when a guy named Michael Jordan wore Carolina Blue .
Yes , there were hiccups along the way this season , such as when the Tar Heels lost their first two ACC games , and when Lawson missed three games with the toe -- one of an assortment of injuries they endured .
But none of it was enough to derail this ride from Tobacco Road to Motown .
Carolina has won every tournament game by 12 or more .
Now , Williams finds himself one win away from leading his alma mater to its fifth national championship .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Add another economic worry to inflation and deflation : ecoflation , the rising cost of doing business in a world with a changing climate .
Ecoflation could hit consumer goods hard in the next five to 10 years , according to a report by World Resources Institute and A.T. Kearney , a global management consulting firm .
Companies that make fast - moving consumer goods , everything from cereal to shampoo , could see earnings drop by 13 percent to 31 percent by 2013 and 19 percent to 47 percent by 2018 if they do not adopt sustainable environmental practices , the report said .
The costs of global warming are showing up now in the form of worse heat waves , droughts , wildfires and possibly more severe tropical storms but they are not yet reflected in consumer prices , said the institute ’s Andrew Aulisi after the report ’s December 2 release .
Instead , these costs are paid by governments and society , Aulisi said in a telephone interview .
That could change if President - elect Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress push for a system that puts a price on the emission of climate - warming carbon dioxide , Aulisi said .
This is unlikely to happen next year in time for a December 2009 deadline to craft an international pact to fight climate change but it is more likely to happen in 2010 .
These rising costs and possible tightening regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are not necessarily a bad thing , he said .
“ The message we do n’t see in this study is that regulation is going to cost ... a lot of money , ” Aulisi said .
“ We think the analysis is a catalyst to convince companies to take greater action on these important issues . ”
LESS PLASTIC
In fact , some companies are already looking at ways to cut their emissions in advance of any new regulation , said Daniel Mahler of A.T. Kearney .
One example is consumer giant Procter & Gamble , which has a team looking across the company ’s varied laundry , hair - care and health - care businesses to see how they can use less plastic , a fossil - based material , Mahler said by telephone .
But the changes may need to go deeper and wider , he said , spreading to the basics of how supply chains are managed .
For instance , companies that presumed U.S. transportation costs would be low and U.S. labor costs would be high had their goods made in countries where employees would work for less .
But a new cost to the carbon emitted by long - distance transport could change that equation , making foreign manufacturing less attractive , Mahler said .
Within the United States , there could be a move away from big , centralized manufacturing plants to smaller , more widely dispersed ones , according to Mahler .
“ That is not a little tactical change , ” he said .
“ It is an infrastructure change that we see companies ... addressing much more aggressively than they had been in the past . ”
Under the ecoflation scenario , the world ’s major economies are likely to set a price on carbon emissions of $ 50 a tonne , Aulisi said .
That is between five and 10 times the price of carbon being traded on voluntary markets in the United States now .
There is no mandatory U.S. carbon market , though the first regional market will begin trading in January .
From littleredbook : “ Chinese netizens express mixed responses to seeing Mao Tze - Tung ’s image used in condom advertisement . ”
If seeing this advertisement alone , it will take me some time to find out that is Mao Tze - Tung .
Huangqiu.com news article : German experts denounced advertisement insulting Mao Tze - Tung
A German condom advertiser used deceased Chinese former chairman Mao Tze - Tung as the protagonist in their condom advertisement , this series of advertisement also features Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden , in order to show their “ creativity ” .
After this advertisement was published in March , it has been wildly challenged in Germany , especially the anger from oversea Chinese .
A local scholar stated that the advertiser despised of discrediting China in order to be outstanding and renowned , this is “ unacceptable ” .
Adolf Hitler
Lately , a lot of Chinese reported to journalist of Global Times that they saw an advertisement posted on “ Ads of the World ” website insulted Chinese leader Mao Tze - Tung .
After getting the information , the journalist went to the website and found the advertisement which was titled as “ Doc Morris Pharmacy : Mao Tze - Tung ” .
It used Chinese leader ’s image , together with Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden to advertise the condom product from a Dutch pharmacy shop .
Osama bin Laden
After that , the Global Times journalist also found out that this advertisement was actually produced by Grey Worldwide , the 2nd largest advertising agency in German .
Grey Worldwide has been founded for 50 years , and already set up 428 offices in 97 different countries , which includes Shanghai , China .
The journalist tried to call Grey Worldwide on 13th , but since during Easter , no one answered the phone .
Nobody knows whether it was Grey Worldwide did n’t know the advertisement would lead to this kind of consequence or they did it in purpose .
Ying
Shen , a lady who lives in Berlin expressed her anger to the journalist , she said this advertisement hurt Chinese people ’s emotion , and the other party had to apologize .
Readers of “ Ads of the World ” also scored very low for this advertisement , which is 4.5 out of 10 .
“ Associate Chinese leader with Hitler ?
This is scandalous ! ” A netizen called Ruipi said .
Alter Burce , an expert of German international media institute explained this advertisement ’s original idea in an interview , he said it was created to convert a message as “ there is nothing to be afraid of even if it is something as strong as Mao Tze - Tung ” ; in order to show the condom can provide very strong secure protection .
But by doing this , it not only obviously against the base principle in advertising , but also hurt Chinese ’s feeling .
Alter Burce also stated that “ messing up ” Chinese leader who is adored by Chinese people with Hitler and Laden was “ unacceptable ” .
Apparently , Grey Worldwide wanted to be different and famous , even at the cost of embarrassing China .
According to “ Holite Daily ” ( Sherry : transliteration ; a German newspaper ) , Deutsche Bank has rejected to work with Grey Worldwide because of dissatisfaction of their creative .
This is not the first time that German companies use Chinese leader images in their advertisement .
A German insurance company once used Chinese leader as the main character in a TVC ; a radio station once even illustrated ornament on a leader ’s eyes ; some other companies , like Grey Worldwide , juggled Chinese leader images in order to achieve their publicizing purpose .
In January 2008 , a French company , Citroen , because of juggling Chinese leader Mao Tze - Tung ’s image in their advertisement in Spain , made their apology at last ( Sherry : did n’t hear about this ?
Here is a BBC news on it ) .

Does it really matter about putting whom onto the condom advertisement ?
Did n’t French still made Sarkozy ’s pig head into a WuduDoll ( a cursing doll in China ) ?
Even as a prime minister of a nation , he will still lose this case .
Change to another view point , this represented the democracy of western countries , can you do that in China ?
We should n’t always think in the Chinese way ( which means being used to durance , being used to speaking highly , being used to kingship , being used to idol adoration ) , and deny other ’s acts .
I once read an article written by a westerner , which said that as a dictator , Mao and Hitler were viewed similarly by many western people .
Although we ca n’t treat westerner ’s opinion as standard , but as a country who is becoming internationally day by day , we need to share thoughts instead of only aiming at convincing others , is n’t it ?
I do n’t think it is an insult !

Nowadays , Europe and U.S. worship “ 百无禁忌 ( Sherry : means nothing can be forbidden ) ” .
This kind of speech and opinion freedom is not what can be easily understood by Chinese , especially by Mainland Chinese base on the education they received .
It is an objective truth that the difference of civilian culture is mostly influenced by different polity and media channels .
Westerners misunderstand us is because they do n’t really know nowadays China , and the reason why Chinese has hatred towards Japan and French etc. is also directed by some political media channels .
As we always say that the world is a big family , but no matter how developed the internet is , emotional distance is way more than the real distance .
Appropriate nationalism is patriotic , but too much nationalism will destroy the world peace .

It was the end of this June when amateur photographer Sandra Critelli , who was looking for whale sharks , found herself in the right place at the right time to experienced nature at its best .
Her boat was surrounded by thousands of rays swimming together like autumn leaves floating in a sunlit pond ... gently moved by the wind .
The images speak for themselves .
The spectacular scene was captured as the magnificent creatures made one of their biannual mass migrations to more agreeable waters as they follow the clockwise current from Mexico 's Yucatan peninsula to western Florida in schools of as many as 10,000 .
These particular kind of rays are known as Cow - nose rays ( Rhinoptera bonasus ) due to their distinctive , highdomed heads , giving them a curiously bovine appearance .
They measure up to 7ft ( 2.1 metres ) from wing - tip to wing - tip and have a long poisonous sting on their tail capable of killing a human even though they are pretty shy and rarely become dangerous .
This is Kristin ’s third calf and marks the sixth calf sired by Floyd at the San Francisco Zoo .
This is the second giraffe birth this year for the herd .
A female named Bititi gave birth to a calf , Camilla , on January 26 , 2009 .
The Zoo ’s veterinary team completed a visual exam this morning and the calf is off to a great start .
It has not been determined whether it is a male or female .
The calf is standing on all fours and is walking and moving well alongside his mother .
There is a strong suckling reflex and nursing has been seen at least once this morning .
The keepers will continue to monitor the pair closely over the next few days to ensure Kristin ’s offspring is nursing regularly .
“ The first 24 hours after any birth are always vital , ” said Jacqueline Jencek , DVM , chief of veterinary services at the San Francisco Zoo .
“ We want to see the calf nursing , walking , sitting down and standing up .
It ’s part of early development and allows us to ensure the calf is progressing well . ”
Reticulated giraffes are found in Central and South African regions and are the tallest of all living land animal species .
There are eight giraffe sub-species and reticulated giraffes are listed as near - threatened .
Population of the species continues to decline due to poaching , habitat loss environmental degradation and human encroachment .
The San Francisco Zoo is actively participating with the Association of Zoo ’s and Aquariums ’ Population Management Plan to help breed and maintain a strong genetic line for the species .
Giraffe gestation lasts between 14 and 15 months and the female gives birth standing up , a six foot drop for the calf ’s grand entrance into the world .
Newborn giraffes can be up to six feet tall when born .
Life span for a giraffe is between 20 and 25 years in the wild and up to 28 years in captivity .
This newest addition is one of many rising stars that will help celebrate the Zoo ’s upcoming Baby Bonanza event that kicks - off May 2 and 3 , 2009 .
This four month bonanza will showcase some of the cutest babies around including the Zoo ’s infant gorilla , two giraffe calves , howler monkey and more .
The Zoo invites visitors to bring their babies to see the Zoo ’s babies during Baby Bonanza in May , June , July and August at the San Francisco Zoo !

An atmosphere of suspicion persists on both sides of the border North Korea has accused the South of " serious provocation " for moving a marker post on their common border .
The claim comes amid a sharp worsening in relations between the two Koreas ; rare bilateral talks broke up on Tuesday after just 22 minutes .
Seoul has also said it will appeal to the UN to secure the release of a South Korean citizen detained in the North .
The man worked for a joint industrial project and was arrested in March for criticising the North 's government .
' Premeditated action ' North Korea said that the alleged move of a border marker by South Korea was " a deliberate and premeditated action to escalate tension " and a " vicious criminal act " .
It said the " South Korean warmongers will be held entirely accountable for all the ensuing consequences " if the marker is not returned to its original place .
South Korea 's defence ministry said it was investigating the claim .
Seoul has also decided to seek UN intervention to free a South Korean worker detained since 30 March at the joint Kaesong industrial plant .
Some 30,000 North Koreans are employed by South Korean companies at the complex , which is located near the border .
Some 30,000 workers are employed in the Kaesong complex Kaesong opened in 2005 as a symbol of reconciliation between two countries , but is often a lightening rod for wider political tensions .
North Korea said on Tuesday that it would consider ending " benefits " for the 101 South Korean companies there .
It also called for " realistic " wages for the 38,300 North Koreans who work there .
South Korean business representatives responded by saying the key to Kaesong 's viability was its cheap labour .
Rocket row Tensions have been high on the Korean peninsula since the North launched a rocket on 5 April .
The UN Security Council criticised the launch , and in response North Korea said it was leaving six - party talks on nuclear disarmament , expelling international monitors and restarting its nuclear facility at Yongbyon .
North Korea is particularly angry at the South , after it announced its intention to join a US - led Proliferation Security Initiative , to prevent the sea transit of weapons of mass destruction .
The North raised the issue again at Tuesday 's meeting , and warned that if the South joined the initiative the move would be seen as a declaration of war .
Russia 's foreign minister is due to arrive in Pyongyang on Thursday in a bid to reduce tensions .

TRAMP ( Transparent Remote Access , Multiple Protocols ) is a package for editing remote files , similar to AngeFtp or efs .
Whereas the others use FTP to connect to the remote host and to transfer the files , TRAMP uses a remote shell connection ( rlogin , telnet , ssh ) .
It can transfer the files using rcp or a similar program , or it can encode the file contents ( using uuencode or base64 ) and transfer them right through the shell connection .
Tramp was formerly called RCP or rcp.el .
It allows you transparent access to files on remote access .
“ Transparent ” means that usually the user does n’t have to worry about anything .
All that changes is the filename convention to indicate that the file resides on a remote system .
One of the neat things about using Tramp via a remote shell , is that Emacs will then automatically invoke other remote shell commands directly on that server , e.g. when viewing a remote file , try M-x shell , M-x rgrep , etc .
You can speed up Tramp by using ssh ’s “ ControlMaster ” feature — see http://linux.com/feature/54498 .
( Note that this is used automatically in recent versions of Tramp . )
Tramp Documentation :
Quick - start tramp
Faster than the default scp
( setq tramp - default - method " ssh " )
For GNU Emacs ( if you do n’t give a filename , syntax still requires an appended colon )
C-x C-f / remotehost : filename RET
( or / method : user @remotehost : filename )
Newer or customized emacs installations may require prepending `ssh : `
C-x C-f /ssh : remotehost RET
For GNU Emacs 26.1 or newer with Tramp 2.3 or newer , the method is required .
If you prefer the older syntax :
( customize - set - variable ' tramp - syntax ' simplified )
see this stackexchange article
For XEmacs use the syntax
C-x C-f /[ method/user@remotehost ]/ filename
You can also edit local files as root with either of the following ( note the double colon , which is required )
C-x C-f /su::/etc/hosts C-x C-f / sudo::/etc/hosts
Windows with Cygwin tools installed , assuming no password is required :
( setq tramp - default - method " sshx " )
Windows
Windows issues are discussed on a separate page : Tramp on Windows .
Alternatives
A good alternative to Tramp that does n’t do anything at the Emacs level is sshfs .
Sshfs allows mounting on the fly a remote filesystem via ssh on a local mount point and to copy from it ( see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sshfs).
It could be as simple ( under emacs ) : ‘ sshfs host : localmountpoint ’ or , if username , id and gid are different as complex as ‘ sshfs usernameathost@host : localmountpoint -o idmapfile , uidfile=uid , gidfile=gid ’ .
Troubleshooting
Older emacs versions
( require ' tramp )
SELinux issues
If you do something like this
C-x C-f / sudo::/etc/sysconfig/iptables
with a default install of Tramp ( well the one bundled with Emacs23 ) and have SELinux enabled then Tramp will overwrite the SELinux context with “ user_u:object_r:tmp_t ” from whatever it was .
In the case of iptables having a system context it will prevent your firewall from restarting !
This is likely to be due to intermediate tmp files ( guessing here ) with the Tramp / sudo interaction .
Not sure how one might configure around this .
Tramp hangs
If you ’re wondering why tramp just hangs first check if you can connect to the host using the terminal ( you should make sure that the server ’s fingerprint has been added to the ~ /.ssh / known_hosts file ) .
Otherwise check that ssh has n’t just suddenly died .
This may be due to pppd , routers or whatever .
In any case neither ssh on the client nor sshd on the server notice that the connection has disappeared .
When the next command is sent , however , ssh notices that the line has been dropped and exits .
And now you have a problem - however , just hitting C-g and then attempting the save / get / whatever operation again should just work ( until the next time ssh is dropped ) .
Another thing that can cause tramp to hang ( I saw this with Solaris at the remote end ) is using an ancient / bin / sh as the remote shell .
Switching to bash fixed it .
I had a hang when I saw “ Sending the Perl ‘ mime - encode ’ implementations . ”
Setting my default method to “ scp ” fixed it ( though now it ’s slower ) .
If Tramp hangs with Solaris at the local end , try using “ scpx ” as your default tramp method .
Also check that the hostname you are invoking Tramp with , matches what is in the ~/.ssh / known_hosts file ; e.g. if the known_hosts file specifies the host with an IP , use an IP in the Tramp invocation .
If you ’re using SVN or DARCS ( or likely other things ) with VC , see below for problem descriptions .
Tramp hangs # 2
If you are a victim of the following :
tramp : Waiting for remote host to process data ...
It could be a problem with sending large chunks to the remote host .
Please type C-h v tramp - chunksize RET and follow the instructions shown there .
You could also ( setq tramp - chunksize 500 ) to see if that helps .
Tramp hangs # 3
If you use zsh and Tramp hangs every time you try to connect , try placing this in your .zshrc :
[ [ $ TERM == " dumb " ] ] && unsetopt zle && PS1 = '$ '
Make it foolproof by putting it at the very top of your .zshrc and adding a return to ensure that nothing later in your .zshrc re-enables PS1 :
[ [ $ TERM == " dumb " ] ] && unsetopt zle && PS1 ='$ ' && return
Even better , avoid changing your dumb terminal ’s prompt ( eg , in M - x shell ) , and instead use a specific TERM : set tramp - terminal - type to " tramp " , and then check for that in your .zschrc :
[ [ $ TERM == " tramp " ] ] && unsetopt zle && PS1 ='$ ' && return
Alternatively , I had success using the following in my .zshrc :
unsetopt prompt_cr
I ’ve noticed that preexec and precmd call also be noxious if they do fancy stuff .
I ’ve ended up with :
if [ [ " $ TERM " == " dumb " ] ] then unsetopt zle unsetopt prompt_cr unsetopt prompt_subst if whence -w precmd >/ dev/ null unfunction precmd fi if whence - w preexec >/ dev/null unfunction preexec fi PS1 = '$ ' fi
We recently enabled some kind of paste support in zsh for remote hosts , which further broke Tramp .
Adding unset zle_bracketed_paste to the above block of ~/.zshrc work - arounds solves this problem .
None of the above worked for me so I decided to just change the SHELL environment variable .
There is no added benefit from running zsh inside tramp anyway .
( eval - after - load ' tramp '( setenv " SHELL " " / bin/bash " ) ) -- EzeBirman
None of the methods above have had success for me , because later parts in my zsh config overwrote it .
But one can easily inhibit loading them : if [ $ TERM = tramp ] unset RPROMPT unset RPS1 PS1= " $ " unsetopt zle unsetopt rcs # Inhibit loading of further config files fi
This is at the very top of my ~/.zprofile .
-- ThomasSchneider
Tramp hangs # 4 : UTF8 LANG
To connect to a very old system I had to switch the remote , default LANG to a non -utf8 one ( in /etc/sysconfig / i18n )
Otherwise tramp would hang right after sending exec / bin /sh .
Tracing showed any utf8 LANG to somehow output extra CRs characters , causing tramp to wait the prompt forever .
This could be locale bug .
To test , try disabling setting of locale :
( add - to - list ' tramp - connection - properties ( list " . * " " locale " " LC_ALL=C " ) )
Tramp hangs # 5 : Control - j .inputrc mapping
If you have Control - j mapped in your ~/.inputrc to something e.g. like this :
Control -j : menu - complete
it can cause tramp to never finish recognizing the shell prompt .
Tramp hangs # 6 : Not recognising the remote shell prompt
If you are using a customised prompt in your shell , tramp can hang if it does n’t recognise the remote shell prompt .
The obvious symptom is that tramp hangs with the message “ Waiting for prompts from remote shell ” , but it can also hang or freeze up after this , before successfully opening the requested file .
To detect the remote prompt , tramp first tries the variable shell - prompt - pattern ; if that fails , it tries tramp - shell - prompt pattern .
You should try modifying tramp - shell - prompt - pattern first .
The default for tramp - shell - prompt - pattern in some recent tramps is :
\\ (? :^ \\ | \r \\ ) [ ^ ] # $ %>
] *# ? [ ] # $ % > ] * \\ ( ^ [ \ \ [ [ 0 -
9
( Note that the ^ [ is a real control -[ , and the \r may be a control - m. )
My system ( NixOS ) recently made fancy coloured prompts the default .
An ANSI escape sequence immediately follows the $ , which breaks the default expression .
Adding .* to tramp - shell - prompt - pattern is an easy fix :
\\ (? :^ \\ | \r \\ ) [ ^ ] # $ %>
] *# ? [ ] # $ % > ].* * \\ ( ^ [ \ \ [ [ 0 -
9

Tramp tries to connect to remote hosts on emacs startup
This happens when you used ido to browse directories on a remote host and it saved them in `ido - dir - file - cache` .
Ido will then save this cache to `ido - save - directory - list - file` which is loaded when emacs starts up .
You can use the following code to clean the cache of tramp entries when emacs quits :
( defun ido - remove - tramp - from - cache nil " Remove any TRAMP entries from ` ido - dir - file - cache '.
This stops tramp from trying to connect to remote hosts on emacs startup , which can be very annoying . " ( interactive ) ( setq ido - dir - file - cache ( cl - remove - if ( lambda ( x ) ( string - match " / \\ ( rsh \\ |ssh \\ |telnet \\ |su \\ |sudo \\ |sshx \\ |krlogin \\ |ksu \\ |rcp \\ |scp \\ |rsync \\ |scpx \\ |fcp \\ |nc \\ |ftp \\ |smb \\ |adb \\ ) : " ( car x ) ) ) ido - dir - file - cache ) ) ) ( defun ido - kill - emacs - hook ( ) ( ido - remove - tramp - from - cache ) ( ido - save - history ) )

Tramp overwrites / dev/ null causing many problems
If your shell history is full , and you use tramp a lot , it sometimes overwrites / dev/ null which causes lots of problems .
See here : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gnu.emacs.bug/1wJG_qVU_K4
To fix it run the following shell commands :
sudo rm / dev/ null sudo mknod / dev/null c 1 3 sudo chmod 666 / dev/null

Tips and tricks
The NEW ( Emacs 24.3 + ) ad - hoc multi- hop syntax -- the replacement for multi :
Note that some of the Tips and tricks below still refer to the old multi : syntax , which was removed in Emacs 23 ( in Emacs 23 you must configure proxies manually to facilitate multi-hops ) .
As of Emacs 24.3 , an analog of the old multi : syntax has been layered on top of the modern ‘ tramp - default - proxies - alist ’ approach , meaning that you can once again perform multi-hops without any prior configuration .
For details , see :
C-h i g ( tramp ) Ad- hoc multi-hops RET
With the new syntax , each ‘ hop ’ is separated by | .
The example in the manual is :
C-x C-f / ssh : bird @bastion|ssh : you @remotehost :/ path
Which connects firstly as bird@bastion , and from there to you@remotehost :/ path
/ su : or / sudo : on remote hosts
You can also use this syntax to sudo / su to root ( or of course any other user ) on a remote host :
C-x C-f /ssh : you @remotehost|sudo :remotehost :/ path/to/file RET
Important : be sure to specify the hostname explicitly : sudo : remotehost : rather than sudo : : ( see below ) .
As this still uses the proxy mechanism underneath , ‘ tramp - default - proxies - alist ’ should now include the value ( " remotehost " " root " " / ssh:you@remotehost : " )
Meaning that the proxy / ssh : you@remotehost : is going to be used whenever you request a file as root@remotehost .
root is the default user for these methods , but you can of course also change to a non -root user with :
C-x C-f /ssh : you @remotehost|sudo : them @remotehost:/ path/to/file RET
Always specify the remote hostname explicitly
You are probably used to using sudo : : or su : : and omitting the hostname .
If you are staying on the localhost then this is still fine , but if you are hopping to a remote server then you must specify the hostname for every hop – even if it is the same as for the previous hop .
Always use sudo : hostname : or su:hostname : with remote hosts .
The trap here is that sudo : : does actually appear to work – however when you do that the HOST for the dynamic proxy entry will be the hostname you originated from rather than the host you connected to .
This will not only look confusing ( as the wrong host will be displayed in the file paths ) , but it will also mean that any subsequent attempt to use sudo : : on your localhost will instead be proxied to the remote server !
( and the proxy would also presumably be clobbered if you did the same thing on a second server , causing further issues ) .
In short , do n’t use :: when you multi-hop !
Using Tramp to open files sudo'd to root
One lazy afternoon , one “ sudo vi foo ” too many ( or rather “ udo vi foo ” , while my term was blocked because of the stupid ^S handling ) , I came up with this and was , subsequently , happy :
It may be worth knowing that the sudo method and tail.el does n’t get along .
At least on bkhl ’s machine , opening stuff with / sudo : wont work if tail.el is loaded .
( defvar find - file - root - prefix ( if ( featurep ' xemacs ) " /[sudo/root@localhost ] " " / sudo : root @localhost : " )
" * The filename prefix used to open a file with ` find - file - root '. " ) ( defvar find - file - root - history nil " History list for files found using ` find - file - root '. " ) ( defvar find - file - root - hook nil " Normal hook for functions to run after finding a \ " root \ " file . " ) ( defun find - file - root ( ) " * Open a file as the root user .
Prepends ` find - file - root - prefix ' to the selected file name so that it maybe accessed via the corresponding tramp method . " ( interactive ) ( require ' tramp ) ( let * ( ( file - name - history find - file - root - history ) ( name ( or buffer - file - name default - directory ) ) ( tramp ( and ( tramp - tramp - file - p name ) ( tramp - dissect - file - name name ) ) ) path dir file ) ( when tramp ( setq path ( tramp - file - name - localname tramp ) dir ( file - name - directory path ) ) ) ( when ( setq file ( read - file - name " Find file ( UID = 0 ) : " dir path ) ) ( find - file ( concat find - file - root - prefix file ) ) ( setq find - file - root - history file - name - history ) ( run-hooks ' find- file-root - hook ) ) ) ) ( global - set - key [ ( control x ) ( control r ) ] ' find-file-root )
This rebinds C-x C-r .
I do n’t have any use for find - file - read - only , so I guess that ’s the closest to C-x C-f you can come , QWERTY - keymap - wise .
(-; -- AndreasFuchs
You ’ll be pleased to note that it ’s good Dvorak - wise too :D -- ErikBourget
Great stuff Andreas !
I edited the above suggestion to improve the handling of history list and added a “ find - file - root - hook ” .
The latter is very useful for doing some system file specific things .
For example , the following can help to discourage careless editing of system files : ( defface find - file - root - header - face '( (t ( : foreground " white " : background " red3 " ) ) )
" * Face use to display header - lines for files opened as root . " ) ( defun find - file - root - header - warning ( ) " * Display a warning in header line of the current buffer .
This function is suitable to add to ` find - file - root - hook '. " ( let * ( ( warning " WARNING : EDITING FILE AS ROOT ! " ) ( space (+ 6 (- ( window - width ) ( length warning ) ) ) ) ( bracket ( make - string ( / space 2 ) ?-) ) ( warning ( concat bracket warning bracket ) ) ) ( setq header - line - format ( propertize warning ' face ' find- file-root - header - face ) ) ) ) ( add - hook ' find - file - root - hook ' find - file - root - header - warning ) – KahlilHodgson
( defun find - file - hook - root - header - warning ( ) ( when ( and buffer - file - name ( string - match " root@localhost " buffer - file - name ) ) ( find - file - root - header - warning ) ) ) ( add - hook ' find - file - hook ' find - file - hook - root - header - warning )
Using find - file - hook is better , I think .

The code above depends on function tramp - file - name - path , which appears to me not to be defined anywhere in the current release of TRAMP ( 2.1.13 ) nor in any of four random earlier releases I downloaded and checked .
No luck on google ( some usages , no definition ) , koders or krugle either .
– PhilHudson
tramp - file - name - path has been replaced by tramp - file - name - localname in CVS on 2003 - 02 - 15 .
I updated the above snippets .
From the commit message : [ … ]
Replace term ‘ path ’ with ‘ localname ’ unless it is used for a search path .
In GNU , the word ‘ path ’ is reserved for search paths . [… ]

And the following can help us maintain a record of any changes we make to system files : ( defvar find - file - root - log " ~/system/root - log " " * ChangeLog in which to log changes to system files . " ) ( defun find - file - root - log - do - it ( ) " Add an entry for the current buffer to ` find - file - root - log '. " ( let ( ( add-log-mailing - address " root@localhost " ) ( add - log - full - name " " ) ( add - log - file - name - function ' identity ) ( add - log - buffer - file - name - function ( lambda ( ) ( tramp - file - name - localname ( tramp - dissect - file - name ( or buffer - file - name default - directory ) ) ) ) ) ) ( add - change - log - entry nil find - file - root - log ' other - window ) ) ) ( defun find - file - root - log - on - save ( ) " * Prompt for a log entry in ` find - file - root - log ' after saving a root file .
This function is suitable to add to ` find - file - root - hook '. " ( add - hook ' after - save - hook ' find - file - root - log - do - it ' append ' local ) ) ( add- hook ' find - file-root - hook ' find - file- root - log-on - save )
Or we may just have some personal preferences : ( defun my - find - file - root - hook () " Some personal preferences . " ( setq buffer - auto - save - file - name nil ) ( set ( make - local - variable ' backup - by - copying ) nil ) ( set ( make-local - variable ' backup - directory - alist ) '( ( " . " ) ) ) ) ( add - hook ' find - file - root - hook ' my - find - file - root - hook ) – KahlilHodgson
I often view or edit file remotely and extended the above procedure to handle files already open with tramp .
The code is a bit ugly but it is working .
It is meant to replace toggle - read - only function .
I have only tested it on Emacs .
( defun really - toggle - read - only ( &optional force ) " Change whether this buffer is visiting its file read - only by really trying to acquire the rights with sudo ( and tramp ) " ( interactive " P " ) ( let* ( ( currentfilename buffer - file - name ) ( newfilename ;;
We first check that the buffer is linked to a file ( if ( not currentfilename ) ;;
If not , we just toggle the read - only mark nil ;;
What is the current state ( if buffer - read - only ;;
The buffer is read - only , we should acquire rights to edit it ( if ( and ( not force ) ( file - writable - p currentfilename ) ) ;;
The file is writable , we do n't need to acquire rights nil ( if ( buffer - modified - p ) ( error " Buffer is read - only and has been modified .
Do n't know what to do . " ) ;;
To acquire rights , we need to use sudo ;;
Do we have a tramp file name ?
( if ( eq ( string - match tramp - file - name - regexp currentfilename ) 0 ) ;;
Yes , we add sudo to it ( let* ( ( v ( tramp - dissect - file - name currentfilename ) ) ( l ( tramp - file - name - localname v ) ) ) ( if ( or ( string= " sudo " ( let ( ( m ( tramp - file - name - method v ) ) ) ( if ( not ( stringp m ) ) ( car ( last ( append m nil ) ) ) m ) ) ) ( eq ( string - match " ^sudo : : " l ) 0 ) ) ( error " This file is already opened with sudo " ) ;;
We add sudo ( let ( ( toarray ( lambda ( a ) ( if ( and ( not ( stringp a ) ) ( arrayp a ) ) a ( vector a ) ) ) ) ) ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name " multi " ( vconcat ( apply toarray ( list ( tramp - file - name - method v ) ) ) [ " sudo " ] ) ( vconcat ( apply toarray ( list ( tramp - file - name - user v ) ) ) [ " root " ] ) ( vconcat ( apply toarray ( list ( tramp - file - name - host v ) ) ) [ " localhost " ] ) l ) ) ) ) ;;
It is not a tramp file - name ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name nil " sudo " nil " " currentfilename ) ) ) ) ;;
The buffer is not read - only , we must drop rights ( if ( buffer - modified - p ) ( error " Buffer is modified , save it first first . " ) ( if ( eq ( string - match tramp - file - name - regexp currentfilename ) 0 ) ;;
We should remove sudo ( let* ( ( v ( tramp - dissect - file - name currentfilename ) ) ( l ( tramp - file - name - localname v ) ) ( m ( tramp - file - name - method v ) ) ) ;;
Two cases , either sudo is in local file name part or in the methods ( if ( eq ( string - match " ^sudo : : " l ) 0 ) ;;
Necessary , we have a multi ( otherwise , sudo would not have been ; ; in the localname ) ;;
Do we have more than one method left ?
( if (> ( length m ) 1 ) ;;
Yes , still multi ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name " multi " m ( tramp - file - name - user v ) ( tramp - file - name - host v ) ( progn ( string - match " ^sudo : :\\ ( .*\\ ) $ " l ) ( match - string 1 l ) ) ) ;;
We do n't need multi anymore ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name nil ( car ( append m nil ) ) ( car ( append ( tramp - file - name - user v ) nil ) ) ( car ( append ( tramp - file - name - host v ) nil ) ) ( progn ( string - match " ^sudo : :\\ ( .*\\ ) $ " l ) ( match - string 1 l ) ) ) ) ;; sudo should be in the methods ( if ( and ( stringp m ) ( string= m " sudo " ) ) l ( if ( and ( not ( stringp m ) ) ( string= ( car ( last ( append m nil ) ) ) " sudo " ) ) ;;
Do we still need multi ? ( if (> ( length m ) 2 ) ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name " multi " ( apply ' vector ( butlast ( append m nil ) ) ) ( apply ' vector ( butlast ( append ( tramp - file - name - user v ) nil ) ) ) ( apply ' vector ( butlast ( append ( tramp - file - name - host v ) nil ) ) ) l ) ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name nil ( car ( append m nil ) ) ( car ( append ( tramp - file - name - user v ) nil ) ) ( car ( append ( tramp - file - name - host v ) nil ) ) l ) ) ;;
No sudo found nil ) ) ) ) ;;
This is not a tramp file nil ) ) ) ) ) ) ( if newfilename ( find- alternate - file newfilename ) ( toggle- read - only ) ) ) )
There are some bugs : for example , you need to always use the former user@host ( and not just host ) .
This is because tramp - make - tramp - file - name with multi as the first paremeter does not accept nil as one of the member of the user vector .
-- VincentBernat
I use ido , it ’s very handy .
So I always open the file use ido - find - file and then open it with TRAMP : ( defun find - alternative - file - with - sudo ( ) ( interactive ) ( when buffer - file - name ( find - alternate - file ( concat " / sudo : root @localhost : " buffer - file - name ) ) ) ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " C- x C- r " ) ' find-alternative - file-with- sudo )
I really like the above .
It does n’t work when you run it more than once on a buffer , so made it toggle .
Also it works on dired buffers .
( defun find - alternative - file - with - sudo ( ) ( interactive ) ( let ( ( fname ( or buffer - file - name dired - directory ) ) ) ( when fname ( if ( string - match " ^/ sudo : root @localhost : " fname ) ( setq fname ( replace - regexp - in - string " ^/ sudo : root @localhost : " " " fname ) ) ( setq fname ( concat " / sudo : root @localhost : " fname ) ) ) ( find- alternate - file fname ) ) ) )
How do you set up TrampMode to make multi- hop methods less painful to work with ?
Say I can ssh to node ‘ secret ’ only from ‘ remote ’ , I ’d use :
/ multi :ssh : foo @remote :ssh : bar @secret:~/.emacs
Can I set TrampMode up so that a method like :
/ secret:~/.emacs
would access the same file in the same manner ?
I.e. , can I set it up to use an abbreviated path ?
– Dirk
How do you do a three - step multi ? - or -
Why does n't multi work ?
This works in debian lenny ( 2009 ) , which comes with emacs 22.2 and tramp 2.0.55 :
/ multi : ssh : me @localhost : ssh : other @localhost : # gets me to dired on other / multi : ssh : me @foo : ssh : me @bar : sudo : me @localhost : # edits
It is awesome !
Multi-hops seems like an obsolete format .
The current documentation ( May 2005 ) says stuff about proxies .
First set up a proxy triplet :
; host + user > proxy ( add - to - list ‘ tramp - default-proxies - alist ‘( ”
`.*
. firewalled
.site
.edu
’ ” nil “ / ssh: proxy
. firewalled
.site
.edu : ” ) )
Then use as normal :
C-x C-f /hidden.firewalled.site.edu :
I am also interested in being able to use prefixes / abbrebiations as Dirk asked .
So I raise this question again in order to let this page pop up in RecentChanges , so that smart people will notice it ;-) – Jurijs Oniscuks
One way of doing this would be to define your own function to add to ‘ FILE - NAME - HANDLER - ALIST ’ , to be invoked instead of tramp : something like : ( defvar my - tramp - abbrevs ' (( " secret " .
" some-long - method " ) ( " host2 " . " some - other - method " ) ) ) ( defun my - file - name - handler ( filename &rest rest ) ( setq filename ( catch ' done ( loop for ( abbrev . name ) in my - tramp - abbrevs if ( string= abbrev ( something - to - extract - filename ) ) ( throw ' done ( substitute - abbrev-with - full - name ) ) ) ( throw ' done filename ) ) ) ( let ( ( file - name - handler - alist ( cdr file - name - handler - alist ) ) ) ( find - file filename ) ) )
This is rather rough , and most probably needs some serious testing , since it ’s done without recourse to an Emacs installation .
Basically , you add your own handler to the front of file - name - handler - alist , then , check the filename to see if it matches one of the abbreviations you ’ve defined .
If yes , the abbreviation is substituted .
Then , we reinvoke find - file , and let the other file - name - handlers kick in .
– LawrenceMitchell
By the way , it might be worth asking on the tramp list to see if anyone else has a fully - fledged , and working , abbreviation scheme .
I just use AbbrevMode .
It works well for me .
– JoelHolveck
Here ’s a method proposed by bojohan on #emacs , that involves using environment variables : ( setenv " SECRET " " / ssh :user @secret.tld : " )
Then you only need to load : /$ SECRET / path / to/file – MichelValdrighi
I find using a bookmark works quite well : just open a frequently accessed file / directory using tramp and type C-x r m .
Then you can give it as short a name as you like .
See BookMarks for more details .
-- EmorySmith
Why is multi :… an obsolete format ?
Was it deemed too easy or something ?
Why should I have to set up a proxy variable just to open a file once ?
I understand the desire to add more features ( and the proxy thing looks like a useful feature ) but not at the expense of existing simplicity .
I hope there ’s a sensible explanation .
I would love to be pointed to a logical explanation of why trying to open / multi:ssh : foo:ssh : bar : will cause the heat death of the universe but I fear there may be no such thing .

Editing files via sudo doesnt work with vc-svn.el .
I get this in Subversion Output :
svn : '/ sudo : root @localhost :/home /elements ' is not a working copy
In Messages :
apply : Error running Subversion to check status of ` shadow '
And in my .emacs I have :
( add - to - list 'vc - handled - backends ' SVN )
-- HenrikHolmboe
If you do n’t need to use vc-svn at all - i use psvn ( http://www.xsteve.at/prg/vc_svn/)
exclusively - here ’s a quick fix to effectively disable vc - svn entirely so that you can edit files with tramp / sudo .
Find the function ‘ vc - svn- registered ’ in vc-svn.el ( should be around line 112 ) and replace it with the following : ( defun vc- svn- registered ( file ) nil ) -- EmorySmith
I use this in my .emacs to disable vc-svn on files accessed with tramp : ( defadvice vc- svn- registered ( around my - vc - svn - registered - tramp activate ) " Do n't try to use SVN on files accessed via TRAMP . " ( if ( and ( fboundp ' tramp - tramp - file - p ) ( tramp - tramp - file - p ( ad - get- arg 0 ) ) ) nil ad - do - it ) ) -- MartinKuehl
This is a similar advice for DVC mode ( thanks to folks at ru_emacs ) : ( defadvice dvc-current - active - dvc ( around dvc- current - active - dvc - no - tramp activate ) " Do n't try to use DVC on files accessed via TRAMP . " ( if ( and ( fboundp ' tramp - tramp - file - p ) ( tramp - tramp - file - p ( dvc- uniquify - file - name default - directory ) ) ) nil ad - do - it ) )
Editing files not under DARCS version control via TRAMP does n’t work when using Jorgen SchÃ Â¤fer ’s vc-darcs.el v1.3 or earlier , please upgrade to 1.4 .
See VcDarcs
I want to completely turn off backups for Tramp .
I guess the simplest way would be a hook , but I ca n’t figure out what the name of the Tramp hook is .
tramp - mode - hook does n’t seem to work – bkhl
how about just overwriting tramp - auto - save ?
– Gyom ( require ' tramp ) ( defun tramp - set - auto - save ( ) ( auto - save - mode - 1 ) )
Helpful variables you can set for debugging
( require ' tramp ) ( setq tramp - debug - buffer t ) ( setq tramp - verbose 10 )
– CarsonReynolds ( adopted from PhilSuh )
See also ‘ How to Customize Traces ’ in the TRAMP info manual ( ‘ C - h i’ ) .
The tramp - debug - buffer variable seems to be missing and , I guess , deprecated in GNU Emacs 23 .
Connecting to a different port
Use the self - described “ kludgy ” hostname ( see documentation for tramp - open - connection - rsh function ) : C-x C-f /ssh:test@host#2222:/tmp
– BradRobelForrest
Using CVS on the remote server
If you are using editing files remotely on CVS , and that CVS server is itself a remote machine requiring passphrase via ssh , try this trick .
Add “ - A ” to your argument list for ssh .
“ - A ” will forward your SSH keys to the remote machine ( say remotemachine1 ) , which can then use those keys for the authentication to the remote CVS server ( say remotemachine2 ) .
Check this from the command line first :
$ ssh - A remotemachine1 $ cd < to- working - checkout-using-remotemachine2-as-repository > $ cvs log file
If this is working , you should not be prompted for a passphrase .
( You will need to ensure your SSH key on your local machine is also on the remote CVS server remotemachine2 ) .
To setup TRAMP to use these options : use “ M - x customize - option tramp - methods ” , then insert a “ - A ” in “ ssh ” in the “ tramp - login - args ” just before “ - e ” and “ none ” .
A simpler solution if you do n’t mind all of your SSH commands forwarding the SSH keys ( this has security implications , so be careful ) , is to add :
ForwardAgent yes
in your ~/.ssh / config file .
( Tested with Emacs from CVS 22.0.50 and Tramp 2.0.47 ) .
Using sftp or psftp without ssh
Because tramp uses plink to login with all putty variants , and ssh to login with all openssh variants , its not possible to use psftp or sftp connection using Tramp .
There ’s not a way to override the tramp - login - program aspect of the alist tramp - methods .
Unfortunately , nothing ’s changed since 2004 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Tramp can only do SFTP over SSH , and AngeFtp does n’t currently support SFTP , and with no plans to handle it , since Tramp supports SFTP over SSH .
This is problematic with hosting accounts where access is only via sftp … other protocols ( such as ssh ) are disabled .
Using tramp to quickly edit files as root
I find the following shortcuts to be highly useful for quickly editing files as root ; esp via emacsclient ( i.e. as an alternative to sudo vi )
( eval - after - load " tramp " '( progn ( defvar sudo - tramp - prefix " / sudo : : " ( concat " Prefix to be used by sudo commands when building tramp path " ) ) ( defun sudo - file - name ( filename ) ( concat sudo - tramp - prefix filename ) ) ( defun sudo - find - file ( filename &optional wildcards ) " Calls find - file with filename with sudo - tramp - prefix prepended " ( interactive " fFind file with sudo " ) ( let ( ( sudo - name ( sudo - file - name filename ) ) ) ( apply ' find - file ( cons sudo - name ( if ( boundp ' wildcards ) ' ( wildcards ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defun sudo - reopen - file ( ) " Reopen file as root by prefixing its name with sudo - tramp - prefix and by clearing buffer - read - only " ( interactive ) ( let * ( ( file - name ( expand - file - name buffer - file - name ) ) ( sudo - name ( sudo - file - name file - name ) ) ) ( progn ( setq buffer - file - name sudo - name ) ( rename - buffer sudo - name ) ( setq buffer - read - only nil ) ( message ( concat " Set file name to " sudo - name ) ) ) ) ) ( global - set - key " \ C - x + " ' sudo - find - file ) ( global - set - key " \ C - x ! " ' sudo - reopen - file ) ) )

I fixed Stefan ’s example to make sudo work with local and remote files with the following :
( set - default ' tramp - default - proxies - alist ( quote ( ( " .* " " \\ `root \\ ' " " / ssh : %h : " ) ) ) ) ( eval - after - load " tramp " '( progn ( defvar sudo - tramp - prefix " / sudo : " ( concat " Prefix to be used by sudo commands when building tramp path " ) ) ( defun sudo - file - name ( filename ) ( set ' splitname ( split - string filename " : " ) ) ( if (> ( length splitname ) 1 ) ( progn ( set ' final - split ( cdr splitname ) ) ( set ' sudo - tramp - prefix " / sudo : " ) ) ( progn ( set ' final - split splitname ) ( set ' sudo - tramp - prefix ( concat sudo - tramp - prefix " root@localhost : " ) ) ) ) ( set ' final - fn ( concat sudo - tramp - prefix ( mapconcat ( lambda ( e ) e ) final - split " : " ) ) ) ( message " splitname is %s " splitname ) ( message " sudo - tramp - prefix is %s " sudo - tramp - prefix ) ( message " final - split is %s " final - split ) ( message " final - fn is %s " final - fn ) ( message " %s " final - fn ) ) ( defun sudo - find - file ( filename &optional wildcards ) " Calls find - file with filename with sudo - tramp - prefix prepended " ( interactive " fFind file with sudo " ) ( let ( ( sudo - name ( sudo - file - name filename ) ) ) ( apply ' find - file ( cons sudo - name ( if ( boundp ' wildcards ) ' ( wildcards ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defun sudo - reopen - file ( ) " Reopen file as root by prefixing its name with sudo - tramp - prefix and by clearing buffer - read - only " ( interactive ) ( let * ( ( file - name ( expand - file - name buffer - file - name ) ) ( sudo - name ( sudo - file - name file - name ) ) ) ( progn ( setq buffer - file - name sudo - name ) ( rename - buffer sudo - name ) ( setq buffer - read - only nil ) ( message ( concat " File name set to " sudo - name ) ) ) ) ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " C- c o s " ) ' sudo - reopen - file ) ) )

Using sudo to edit the current file
A simple version of the ones above .
Designed to allow you to reopen an existing file with sudo , without needing to navigate to it or loose your place in the file .
Also works on local or remote files .
( set - default ' tramp - default - proxies - alist ( quote ( ( " .* " " \\ `root \\ ' " " / ssh : %h : " ) ) ) ) ( require ' tramp ) ( defun sudo - edit - current - file ( ) ( interactive ) ( let ( ( position ( point ) ) ) ( find - alternate - file ( if ( file - remote - p ( buffer - file - name ) ) ( let ( ( vec ( tramp - dissect - file - name ( buffer - file - name ) ) ) ) ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name " sudo " ( tramp - file - name - user vec ) ( tramp - file - name - host vec ) ( tramp - file - name - localname vec ) ) ) ( concat " / sudo : root @localhost : " ( buffer - file - name ) ) ) ) ( goto - char position ) ) )

Dired sudo edit current file ( 24.3 + ) updated for ( 26 + )
Hi .
I had trouble getting the above to work with my emacs 24.3 with this new multi syntax for tramp .
Always got the “ sudo is only for local file ” error .
I also wanted to press s-return in dired mode to open file using sudo .
So here is the modified above code which works for me .
( defun sudo - edit - current - file ( ) ( interactive ) ( let ( ( my - file - name ) ( position ) ) ( if ( equal major - mode ' dired - mode ) ( progn ( setq my - file - name ( dired- get- file - for - visit ) ) ( find - alternate - file ( prepare - tramp - sudo - string my - file - name ) ) ) ( setq my - file - name ( buffer - file - name ) position ( point ) ) ( find - alternate - file ( prepare - tramp - sudo - string my - file - name ) ) ( goto - char position ) ) ) ) ( defun prepare - tramp - sudo - string ( tempfile ) ( if ( file - remote - p tempfile ) ( let ( ( vec ( tramp - dissect - file - name tempfile ) ) ) ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name " sudo " ( tramp - file - name - user nil ) ( tramp - file - name - host vec ) ( tramp - file - name - localname vec ) ( format " ssh : %s@%s| " ( tramp - file - name - user vec ) ( tramp - file - name - host vec ) ) ) ) ( concat " / sudo : root @localhost : " tempfile ) ) ) ( define - key dired - mode - map [ s - return ] ' sudo-edit- current - file ) With Emacs 26 + ( maybe also before )
The tramp version did some changes to the " tramp - make - tramp - file - name " and " tramp - file - name- user " .
So here is a fixed version that works with Emacs 26.X+ ( defun prepare - tramp - sudo - string ( tempfile ) ( if ( file - remote - p tempfile ) ( let ( ( vec ( tramp - dissect - file - name tempfile ) ) ) ( tramp - make - tramp - file - name " sudo " " " ( tramp - file - name - domain vec ) ( tramp - file - name - host vec ) ( tramp - file - name - port vec ) ( tramp - file - name - localname vec ) ( format " ssh : %s@%s| " ( tramp - file - name - user vec ) ( tramp - file - name - host vec ) ) ) ) ( concat " / sudo : root @localhost : " tempfile ) ) )

Plink by keyfile without Pageant
After upgrading to tramp 2.2.13 - pre(emacs GNU Emacs 25.0.50.1 ( x86_64-w64-mingw32 ) of 2015 - 11-10 ) , it ’s not able to redefine the ‘ plink ’ tramp - methods with again .
Or a default version will prepend to the header .
But fortunately , it ’s able to define one with a new method name .
With following configuration , it ’s able to define our own keyfile .
Note that , it ’s required to define the ‘ HOME ’ environment variable .

Tramp and nixos
The recommended way of connecting to a nixos machine with tramp is to add / run / current - system / sw / bin to ‘ tramp - remote - path ’ , this reportedly works with newer versions of tramp , but did n’t work for me with tramp version “ 2.2.13.25.2 ”
Instead I had to create some symlinks in / bin on nixos to get it working :
sudo ln -s /run/ current - system/sw/bin/ls /bin/ls sudo ln -s /run/current- system/sw/bin/uname /bin/uname sudo ln -s /run/current - system/sw/bin/base64 /bin/base64 sudo ln -s /run/wrappers/bin/sudo /bin/sudo
This can be done automatically on each invocation of nixos - rebuild by adding the following snippet to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix file :
# Create symlinks to allow older versions of emacs tramp to connect to this computer system.activationScripts.tramp = '' for bin in ls uname base64 if [ ! -e / bin /$bin ] ln -s /run / current - system /sw/ bin/$bin / bin / $ bin fi done if [ !
-e /bin/sudo ] ln -s /run / wrappers / bin/sudo / bin/sudo fi ''

Addicted to fake outrage DAVID SIROTA
I 'm not sure if it 's because we 're strung out on " Lost " episodes , or if it 's because we 're still suffering from a post - 9/11 stress disorder that makes us crave " breaking news " alerts , or if it 's because the economy has turned us into distraction junkies .
But one thing is painfully obvious after Michael Phelps ' marijuana " scandal " erupted last week :
Our society is addicted to fake outrage - and to break our dependence , we 're going to need far more potent medicine than the herb Phelps was smoking .
If you have n't heard ( and I 'm guessing you have ) , the Olympic gold medalist was recently photographed taking a toke of weed .
The moment the picture hit the Internet , the media blew the story up , pumping out at least 1,200 dispatches about the " controversy , " according to my LexisNexis search .
Phelps ' sponsors subsequently threatened to pull their endorsement deals , and USA Swimming suspended him for " disappointing so many people . "
America is a place where you can destroy millions of lives as a Wall Street executive and still get invited for photo - ops at the White House ; a land where the everyman icon - Joe Sixpack - is named for his love of shotgunning two quarts of beer at holiday gatherings ; a " shining city on a hill " where presidential candidates ' previous abuse of alcohol and cocaine is portrayed as positive proof of grittiness and character .
And yet , somehow , Phelps is the evildoer of the hour because he went to a party and took a hit off someone 's bong .
As with most explosions of fake outrage , the Phelps affair asks us to feign anger at something we know is commonplace .
A nation of tabloid readers is apoplectic that Brad and Jen divorced , even though one out of every two American marriages ends the same way .
A country fetishizing " family values " goes ballistic over the immorality of Paris Hilton 's sex tape ... and then keeps spending billions on pornography .
And now we 're expected to be indignant about a 23 - year - old kid smoking weed , even though studies show that roughly half of us have done the same thing ; most of us think pot should be legal in some form ; and many of us regularly devour far more toxic substances than marijuana ( nicotine , alcohol , reality TV , etc. ) .
So , in the interest of a little taboo candor , I 'm just going to throw editorial caution to the wind and write what lots of us thought - but were afraid to say - when we heard about Phelps .
Ready ?
Here goes : America 's drug policy is idiotic .
Doctors can hand out morphine to anyone for anything beyond a headache , but they can't prescribe marijuana to terminal cancer patients .
Madison Avenue encourages a population plagued by heart disease to choke down as many artery - clogging Big Macs and Dunkin ' Donuts as it can , but it 's illegal to consume cannabis , " a weed that has been known to kill approximately no one , " as even the archconservative Colorado Springs Gazette admitted in its editorial slamming Phelps .
Indeed , it would be perfectly acceptable - even artistically admirable in some quarters - if I told you that I drank myself into a blind stupor while writing this column , but it would be considered " outrageous " if I told you I was instead smoking a joint ( FYI - I was n't doing either ) .
That said , what 's even more inane than our irrational reefer madness is our addiction to the same high that every pothead craves : the high of escapism .
Nerves fried from orange terror warnings , Drudge Report sirens and disaster capitalism 's roller - coaster economics , our narcotic of choice is fake outrage - and it packs a punch .
It gets us to turn on the television , tune in to the latest manufactured drama , and drop out of the real battle for the republic 's future .
In the spirit of Nick Sieger 's short statement on the recent uproar over Matt Aimonetti's " pr0n star " talk , I 'm posting my one and only blog response to the whole thing .
Unlike Nick , I too often have used this blog as a soapbox .
And too often I 've ground my personal axe against projects that may or may not have deserved it .
I 'm human , I 'm passionate and proud of my work , and I 'm defensive of what we 've accomplished , so I do n't think this is surprising .
I also see the same passion and pride in the Ruby community at large , and it's why I 'm much more interested in attending Ruby conferences than Java conferences , where many attendees just seem to be going through the motions .
And I know I 've crossed a line at times , making or taking things too personal , and hopefully I 've apologized or corrected myself whenever that 's happened .
If not , mea culpa .
But there 's a disturbing trend in the Ruby community I have n't had to deal with since high school : in preference to open inclusion , more and more Rubyists seem to choose exclusivity .
This recent firestorm has continued in large part , I believe , because of the poor initial response by folks involved .
Rather than recognize that there are people with different views , taking offense at different ideas and images , some decided to say " fuck you , this is who I am " and further alienate those people .
I certainly do n't expect we as passionate individuals wo n't commit occasional faux pas , especially when trying to be funny or provocative and especially when coming from different backgrounds that may be more or less accepting of certain behaviors .
But to claim no responsibility for an obvious mistake , indeed to claim it 's somehow the fault of the offended , or American sensibility , or political correctness ... well that 's just sophomoric .
I think to some extent we can understand ( but not excuse ) such behavior by realizing that the Ruby ( or perhaps the Rails ) community is largely a very * young * community .
That 's a large part of why this community is so passionate , why they 're so committed to their ideals , why they 're so opinionated , why they 're so much more fun to hang out with than many 30 - year programmers from other communities who've had the life sucked out of them .
It 's also a reason so many in the Ruby ( or perhaps the Rails ) community seem to act like they 're in high school , forming cliques , sitting at their own tables , snubbing the new kids or the weird kids or anyone they perceive as " trying to be cool .
" Have you been invited to any exclusive Ruby communities ?
I 've been invited to a couple , and without exception I 've found the idea offensive every time .
In some cities , there are now multiple tiers of Ruby group : one for the proles , where anyone is welcome and everyone is either new to Ruby , a little weird , or both ; and then perhaps one or two levels of more " exclusive " groups , usually more " advanced " and sometimes invite - only but generally exclusionary in some way .
There 's also a technical " coolness " exclusivity many projects have had to cope with .
Folks working on JRuby and IronRuby , for example , have had to deal with perceptions that they 're either less " cool " because of their platform of choice or at least somehow less " Ruby " because they 're not following the same golden path everyone else follows .
Or perhaps their employers are out to take over Ruby , or they 're going to infect Ruby with a bunch more " new " people who do n't " get it " .
All the while the folks that use and work on these projects are working just as hard as anyone else to bring Ruby to the world , staying true to what makes Ruby special , and largely going against the grain in their original communities as well .
Being snubbed , mocked , or attacked is often their reward .
You start to see a pattern here , yes ?
So let 's spell it out .
I like the Ruby community because it 's filled with people who love playing with new technology , without biases and prejudices getting in the way .
My closest friends in the community are people like me , who find it repugnant that being opinionated has been too often equated with being rude and boorish , exclusionary and sophomoric , or simply mean .
We are all here because of our love of technology , all here because we did n't feel like we fit in other places that were n't so passionate about beautiful code and fresh ideas .
We are all here because we do n't care if you 're male or female , religious or irreligious , young or old , experienced or inexperienced , beautiful or plain , conservative or liberal , tall or short , fat or thin , foreign or domestic , gay or straight , black or white , or any grey areas in - between .
We are all here because we love that more and more people like us join the community every day ... the same people some of us immediately judge and box into their own subcool subgroups .
I do n't want to join your damn clique .
I do n't think it 's ok to set people aside or treat them like dirt because they do n't believe what you believe or because they have their own way of thinking and acting or because they 're not as worldly and mature and oh - so - smug as you are .
I do n't believe in " rock stars " and I do n't believe that dubious title gives anyone the right to be an asshole to others or to have free reign to act any way they choose .
I do n't care what kind of car you drive , what house you live in , or what clothes you wear ... and I sure as hell do n't care how many people follow you on Twitter .
What I do care about is whether you 're interested in sitting down and hacking out some code , looking at new projects with an open mind , helping someone new ( maybe me ) improve their skills , being part of something larger than yourself .
If you promise not to treat me like a weirdo or a rock star , I promise to talk openly about your ideas , to show you the heart and soul of my code , and to freely share my thoughts ... no matter who you are .
I hope you 'll attend my presentations and / or try out my projects , and in exchange I 'll try to do the same the same for you .
I hope you 'll walk up to me at conferences and tell me about whatever " crazy " or " stupid " idea you have , and I guarantee to listen since it 's probably not as crazy or stupid as you think .
And I expect you to do the same for everyone else in the community and not treat me or anyone else any differently .
Now , let 's move forward and get back to hacking and having fun !
Mr. Keller said Times management was to meet with the Guild Thursday afternoon to discuss the requested cuts .
Calls to Guild officers were not returned .
At smaller parts of the company , including About.com and a chain of small papers , wages will be cut 2.5 percent and employees will get five days off .
The layoffs announced Thursday represent almost 5 percent of the more than 2,000 employees in the business operations of The Times newspaper .
The company laid off 27 people in The Times ’s advertising department last month , and about 500 people in January , with the closing of City and Suburban , a newspaper and magazine distribution subsidiary .
At the end of 2008 , the company had 9,346 employees , down from 10,710 working in the same operations two years ago .
Last fall , Times executives said they did not anticipate any news staff reductions in 2009 .
Similarly , Mr. Keller said on Thursday that with a pay cut , management expects “ that the newsroom will get through the year without a round of layoffs . ”
“ I wish I could make that a promise , ” he added .
“ I can ’t . ”
In 2008 , The Times eliminated 100 newsroom jobs through buyouts and layoffs .
But with hiring for new positions , the net reduction was about half that .
It has the largest news staff of any paper in the country , and one of few that has not contracted sharply .
Newspaper companies have been drastically shrinking payrolls in the last two years .
And in recent months , several have resorted to mandatory unpaid leave , or furloughs , to reduce the number of layoffs .
The Times Company is characterizing its move with nonunion employees as a pay cut rather than a mandatory leave  though in practice , there may be little difference  to avoid strict federal rules governing furloughed employees .
Other companies that have used furloughs have told workers , for instance , that they cannot make work - related phone calls or check work e-mail messages while on leave .
Whether a cut for union employees is called a furlough will be subject to negotiation .
Separately ,
The Times newspaper will do away with the expanded index to its articles , created last year , that appears on the second and third pages , returning to something like the smaller guide that used to appear on the second page , saving several millions dollars annually on newsprint .
Analysis
FCW Analysis : Kundra 's job is now in question
Updated : March 16 , 2009 at 1:50 p.m .
Just Thursday morning , Vivek Kundra was the ascending rock star of the government technology world .
In his public speaking debut as President Barack Obama ’s new chief information officer , Kundra mesmerized a standing - room only crowd at the FOSE trade show in downtown Washington with his spirited talk of adapting Web 2.0 social - networking tools to bring transparency and accountability to the federal procurement system .
By the end of the day , Kundra 's future had become murky .
After the FBI arrested one of his former employees on allegations involving contract kickbacks , Kundra , 34 , agreed to take a leave of absence for an unspecified time .
The White House confirmed his leave Friday , only days after Obama , with great fanfare , had appointed Kundra to be the first governmentwide federal CIO .
Former government officials from the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations , speaking on background , say Kundra ’s ability to serve as overseer of U.S. government technology policy and practices is in question .
The fact that Kundra himself is not accused of any wrongdoing is beside the point , they said .
As the District of Columbia ’s chief technology officer since 2007 , he was responsible for the actions of his 300 employees .
The federal CIO ’s role , as defined by Obama , includes bringing transparency and oversight to massive federal acquisition programs and the formulation of policy .
Although Kundra has committed no crime and apparently is not a target of the FBI investigation into his former D.C. government office , it does look as though he may have not noticed a scheme in his office that involved contract kickbacks and paychecks for nonexistent workers , according to the FBI ’s charges .
The White House has not indicated any intent to revoke Kundra 's appointment .
However , Obama has had trouble filling key appointments .
Tom Daschle , his choice for Health and Human Services secretary , withdrew in early February after it came to light that he had been delinquent in paying some income taxes .
Then Nancy Killefer , Obama ’s pick for chief performance officer , withdrew due to her own past tax problems , even though they had been resolved years ago .
Charles Freeman , who was to become director of the National Intelligence Council , withdrew last week following allegations that he had questionable ties to Middle Eastern nations .
Also last week , lawyer H. Rodgin Cohen , the leading candidate to become deputy treasury secretary , withdrew for unstated reasons .
Several other candidates for various administration positions have also been forced to pull out during the vetting process .
D.C. city officials have survived scandal before .
After a tax scandal came to light in 2007 that cost the city an estimated $ 50 million in lost tax revenues , D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty expressed support for Chief Financial Officer Natwar Gandhi , who remains in the position today .
However , Kundra ’s office has been under scrutiny for some time .
The District ’s Office of Inspector General was investigating contracting problems in 2008 , according to the office ’s report on its 2008 activities .
The report states : " Contracting problems experienced by the District continue to be exacerbated by the structural deficiencies and ineffective methodologies used to award and administer contracts .
An absence of basic systems for contract records management and data retrieval present formidable challenges for managing procurement functions spread over 80 - plus agencies , and for planning procurements , fostering competition among prospective bidders , and ultimately obtaining best value in terms of price and quality . "
The investigation into the Office of the Chief Technology Officer was expected to continue into 2009 , according to the report , but it was not clear what has happened since or whether the IG probe was related to the FBI arrests .
Last summer , Kundra implemented a program called Information Technology Staff Augmentation to improve transparency and accountability in the city ’s contracting , according to a Washington Post report .
“ Kundra hired a company to help the city weed out unqualified résumés , established a central online database to advertise contracts and disclose who won each one , and posted video solicitations for jobs online , ” the Post reported .
Last week , the FBI arrested Yusuf Acar , an information security specialist who worked for Kundra , and charged him with bribery , conspiracy , money laundering and conflict of interest .
The FBI also arrested Sushil Bansal , president and chief executive officer of Advanced Integrated Technologies Corp. , on charges of bribery and money laundering .
AITC has done more than $ 13 million in contract work for D.C. since 2004 , according to a report in Computerworld .
Although Kundra joined the office in 2007 , at least one AITC contract was awarded in 2008 , according to the report .
It ’s possible , however , that all the alleged illegal activity happened before Kundra took the leadership role , said Gary Bass , executive director of watchdog group OMBWatch .
If that ’s the case , his appointment to Obama ’s administration should n’t suffer , he said .
Even if did not all predate Kundra , “ It ’s very hard for an administrator to review the detailed work of every staff person , ” Bass said .
“ That ’s why you have an audit process and why you have whistlebolower protections , which is apparently what brought this case to light .
Now if there are systemic problems , that ’s different .
That ’s an administrator ’s problem . ”
If Kundra is not in any way under suspicion , the authorities should make that clear , but the FBI rarely issues statements to say that someone is not a target of an investigation , Bass said .
That leaves Kundra “ in a very nasty limbo , where he ’s not a target , but it ’s not clear that he can go back to work . ”
Bass said he hopes Kundra will stay in this new federal role .
“ I think in the short time he has been on the job at the federal level , he has really shaken things up , in a good way , ” he said .
Rising sea levels pose a far bigger eco threat than previously thought .
This week 's climate change conference in Copenhagen will sound an alarm over new floodings - enough to swamp Bangladesh , Florida , the Norfolk Broads and the Thames estuary
Scientists will warn this week that rising sea levels , triggered by global warming , pose a far greater danger to the planet than previously estimated .
There is now a major risk that many coastal areas around the world will be inundated by the end of the century because Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are melting faster than previously estimated .
Low -lying areas including Bangladesh , Florida , the Maldives and the Netherlands face catastrophic flooding , while , in Britain , large areas of the Norfolk Broads and the Thames estuary are likely to disappear by 2100 .
In addition , cities including London , Hull and Portsmouth will need new flood defences .
" It is now clear that there are going to be massive flooding disasters around the globe , " said Dr David Vaughan , of the British Antarctic Survey .
" Populations are shifting to the coast , which means that more and more people are going to be threatened by sea- level rises . "
The issue is set to dominate the opening sessions of the international climate change conference in Copenhagen this week , when scientists will outline their latest findings on a host of issues concerning global warming .
The meeting has been organised to set the agenda for this December 's international climate talks ( also to be held in Copenhagen ) , which will draw up a treaty to replace the current Kyoto protocol for limiting carbon dioxide emissions .
And key to these deliberations will be the issue of ice - sheet melting .
The International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) - when it presented its most up - to - date report on the likely impact of global warming in 2007 - concluded that sea -level rises of between 20 and 60 centimetres would occur by 2100 .
These figures were derived from estimates of how much the sea will increase in volume as it heats up , a process called thermal expansion , and from projected increases in run-off water from melting glaciers in the Himalayas and other mountain ranges .
But the report contained an important caveat : that its sea - level rise estimate contained very little input from melting ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland .
The IPCC forecast therefore tended to underestimate forthcoming changes .
" The IPCC felt the whole dynamics of polar ice - sheet melting were too poorly understood , " added Vaughan .
" However , we are now getting a much better idea of what is going on in Greenland and Antarctica and can make much more accurate forecasts about ice - sheet melting and its contribution to sea- level rises . "
From studying satellite images , scientists have watched the sea ice that hugs the Greenland and Antarctic shores dwindle and disappear .
Sea-ice melting on its own does not cause ocean levels to rise , but its disappearance has a major impact on land ice sheets .
Without sea ice to prop them up , the land sheets tip into the water and disintegrate at increasing rates , a phenomenon that is now being studied in detail by researchers .
" It is becoming increasingly apparent from our studies of Greenland and Antarctica that changes to sea ice are being transmitted into the hearts of the land - ice sheets in a remarkably short time , " added Vaughan .
As a result , those land sheets are breaking up faster and far more melt water is being added to the oceans than was previously expected .
These revisions suggest sea - level rises could easily top a metre by 2100 - a figure that is backed by the US Geological Survey , which this year warned that they could reach as much as 1.5 metres .
In addition , in September , a team led by Tad Pfeffer at the University of Colorado at Boulder published calculations using conservative , medium and extreme glaciological assumptions for sea - level rise expected from Greenland , Antarctica and the world 's smaller glaciers and ice caps .
They concluded that the most plausible scenario , when factoring in thermal expansion due to warming waters , will lead to a total sea level rise of one to two metres by 2100 .
Similarly , a commission of 20 international experts , called on by the Dutch government to help plan its coastal defences , recently gave a range of 55 cm to 1.1 metres for sea - level rises by 2100 .
" Equally important , this commission has highlighted the fact that sea - level rise will not stop in the year 2100 , " said Professor Stefan Rahmstorf of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research .
" By 2200 , they estimate a rise of 1.5 to 3.5 m unless we stop the warming .
This would spell the end of many of our coastal cities . "
This point was backed by Dr Jason Lowe of the Hadley Centre , the UK 's foremost climate change research centre .
" It is still not clear exactly how much the sea will rise by the end of this century , but it is certain that rises will continue for hundreds of years beyond that - even if we do manage to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions and halt the rise in atmospheric temperature .
The sea will continue to heat up and expand .
In addition , the Greenland ice sheets will continue to melt , " he said .
This latter effect could , ultimately , have a particularly destructive impact .
Scientists have calculated that if industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases eventually produce a global temperature increase of around 4C , there is a risk that Greenland 's ice covering could melt completely .
This could take several hundred years or it might require a couple of thousand .
The end result is not in doubt , however .
It would add around seven metres to the planet 's sea levels .
The consequence would be utter devastation .
Such a scenario is distant , but real , scientists insist .
However , at present , the most important issue , they argue , is that of short - term sea - level rises : probably around one metre by 2100 .
When that occurs , the Maldives will be submerged , along with islands like the Sunderbans in the Bay of Bengal , and Kiribati and Tuvalu in the Pacific .
The US - which has roughly 12,400 miles of coastline and more than 19,900 square miles of coastal wetlands - would face a bill of around $ 156bn to protect this land .
Cities such as London would require massive investments to provide defences against the rising waters .
Others , such as Alexandria , in Egypt , would simply be inundated .
Rising oceans will also contaminate both surface and underground fresh water supplies , worsening the world 's existing fresh - water shortage .
Underground water sources in Thailand , Israel , China and Vietnam are already experiencing salt - water contamination .
Coastal farmland will be wiped out , triggering massive displacements of men , women and children .
It is estimated that a one - metre sea - level rise could flood 17 % of Bangladesh , one of the world 's poorest countries , reducing its rice - farming land by 50 % and leaving tens of millions without homes .
Such destruction would not be caused merely by rising sea levels , however .
Other effects of global warming will also worsen the mayhem that lies ahead : in particular , the increase in major storms .
" When we talk about the dangers of future sea - level rises , we are not talking about a problem akin to pouring water into a bath , " added Dr Colin Brown , director of engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineering .
" Climate - change research shows there will be significant increases in storms as global temperatures rise .
These will produce more intense gales and hurricanes and these , in turn , will produce massive storm surges as they pass over the sea . "
The result will be the appearance of the super - surge , a climatic double whammy that will savage low - lying regions that include Britain 's south - eastern coastline , in particular East Anglia and the Thames Estuary , along with cities such as London , Portsmouth and Hull , which are rated as being particularly vulnerable to sea - level rise .
In addition to these hotspots , the country will also face massive disruption to its transport and energy systems unless it acts swiftly , according to a report - Climate Change , Adapting to the Inevitable - published last month by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers .
Many rail lines run along river valleys that will be flooded with increased regularity while bridges carrying trains and lorries often cross shipping lanes and may have to be redesigned to accommodate rising water levels .
" Power supplies will also be affected , " added Brown .
" The Sizewell B nuclear plant has been built on the Suffolk coast , a site that has been earmarked for the construction of several more nuclear plants .
However , Sizewell will certainly be affected by rising sea levels .
Engineers say they can build concrete walls that will keep out the water throughout the working lives of these new plants .
But that is not enough .
Nuclear plants may operate for 50 years , but it could take hundreds of years to decommission them .
By that time , who knows what sea - level rises and what kinds of inundations the country will be experiencing ? "
Most scientists believe Britain remains relatively well placed to combat sea - level rises .
" The government has been fairly far - sighted over this issue , with projects such as Thames Estuary 2100 being set up to prepare flooding defence projects , " said Professor Robert Nicholls , of Southampton University .
This does not stop the controversy , however .
In its report , the Institution of Mechanical Engineers warned that many areas would have to be abandoned because they are simply too expensive to protect .
In particular , large areas of the Norfolk coastline would be left to be inundated , a massive loss of human habitat .
But this approach represents an abrogation of national duty to many people - particularly those whose homes will be destroyed , individuals such as Martin George , former chairman of the Broads Society .
" A country that has the technological know - how to extract oil and coal from below the North Sea should surely be capable of finding a way to protect a concrete sea wall against the effects of climate change .
We should do our damnedest to safeguard our heritage , " he said .
• Additional research by Lisa Kjellsson
Why the sea is rising
• Thermal expansion .
All bodies expand when they are heated , and that is true for the water that covers 70 per cent of the planet .
The oceans are expanding - upwards .
It is estimated this increase in volume will raise levels by 10 - 40 cms .
• Melting glaciers and mountain ice caps - outside Greenland and Antarctica - are also adding water to rivers that flow to the oceans .
However , these remain a modest source of sea - level rise .
Possibly around 10 cms .
• The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets represent vast reserves of frozen fresh water .
The former would add 7 m to sea levels if melted completely ; the latter would bring a further 60 m rise to the levels of the world 's oceans .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Americans are exposed to seven times more radiation from diagnostic scans than in 1980 , a report found on Tuesday as experts said doctors are overusing the tests for profit and raising health risks for patients .

The findings , issued by National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement , add to already mounting evidence that doctors are ordering too many diagnostic tests , driving up the cost of healthcare in the United States and potentially harming patients .
While diagnostic scans give doctors valuable information and many times are necessary , doctors fear too much radiation exposure can cause cancer , especially in younger people .
“ Imaging has literally become the guiding hand of medical practice , ” said Dr. James Thrall , chair of the American College of Radiology ’s Board of Chancellors , who was not part of the study .
“ Unfortunately , one of the things we have seen in the imaging world is that many physicians look at imaging as the solution to their financial problems , ” Thrall , head of radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , said in a telephone interview .
He said imaging technology has created a financial incentive for some doctors to cash in by referring patients to get imaging tests on equipment in their own practices .
This is one place the federal government and Congress can look in enacting healthcare reform , Thrall added .
A study by the Government Accountability Office in July found Medicare spending on medical imaging doubled to about $ 14 billion a year between 2000 and 2006 , driven largely by increases in high - tech imaging .
In November , a 10 - year study by a team at the University of California , San Francisco , found use of computed tomography or CT scans , an advanced type of X - ray , doubled among patients in a large managed care plan between 1997 and 2006 .
Thrall said advanced diagnostic scans have revolutionized the way doctors can treat patients , eliminating the need for unnecessary exploratory surgery and improving patient care .
NON - RADIOLOGISTS
But hundreds if not thousands of non-radiologists have purchased imaging equipment for their offices , and many studies suggest this has helped to drive up medical costs .
The GAO report , for example , found that from 1998 to 2005 , the number of self - referred , in - office CT , MRI and nuclear medicine scans done on Medicare patients grew at triple the rate of the same exams performed in all other settings , such as hospitals or stand - alone imaging centers .
“ There is a fundamental problem when the person ordering the study has a direct financial interest in maximizing the use of a particular piece of equipment , ” Thrall said .
The Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance , an industry group , rejected the notion that financial incentives are driving the increased use of imaging in medicine .
“ The GAO report shows that past efforts to cut medical imaging reimbursement , such as the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act , have significantly slowed imaging growth , suggesting further cuts could endanger the availability of these services , ” Ilyse Schuman , managing director of the group , said in a statement .
Thrall said the American College of Radiology is working with other radiology groups to craft standards about the appropriate use of imaging , which , when used properly , can improve patient care and help cut medical costs .

In 1999 The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society published a paper by David Aldous and Persi Diaconis entitled : “ Longest Increasing Subsequences : From Patience Sorting to the Baik - Deift - Johansson Theorem ” .
In case that sounds heavy going , the authors kick off with a card game .
Take a deck of cards labeled 1 , 2 , 3 , … , n .
The deck is shuffled , cards are turned up one at a time and dealt into piles on the table , according to the rule A low card may be placed on a higher card ( e.g. 2 may be placed on 7 ) , or may be put into a new pile to the right of the existing piles .
At each stage we see the top card on each pile .
If the turned up card is higher than the cards showing , then it must be put into a new pile to the right of the others .
The object of the game is to finish with as few piles as possible .
And if this still sounds too mathematical ( when did you last find a deck of cards labelled 1 through n ? )
Aldous and Diaconis suggest .
To play with real cards one needs to linearly order the 52 cards , e.g. by putting suits in the bridge - bidding order ♣ ♦ ♥ ♠ .
This mindless form of solitaire is then quite playable , perhaps while watching television .
As a target they recommend aiming for 9 piles , which , combined with an optimal strategy , gives you roughly a 5 % chance of winning .
In what follows I ’ll also be adopting the bridge convention that Aces are high .
A greedy strategy turns out to be optimal — otherwise you ’d probably need to switch off the TV in order to concentrate .
What ’s more , this same strategy discovers the longest increasing subsequence of cards contained within the shuffled deck .
In computer science a greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at that particular moment .
Typically greedy algorithms are easy to understand and swift to operate — but that does n’t make them optimal .
A traveling salesman might greedily pick the closest unvisited city at every stage of his journey .
The graphic shows a busy bee zig - zagging from flower to flower , always choosing the closest , when clearly a looping route would be better .
For the patience sort card game a greedy strategy would be to place each card on the leftmost pile on which it can go , according to the rules of the game .
A clever argument proves this strategy leads to an optimal solution .
The argument hinges on increasing subsequences of cards within the shuffled deck .
For example , if we restrict our attention to the spades suit , then given the sequence :
an increasing subsequence would be :
and a longest increasing subsequence is :
( Note in passing that there may be more than one longest increasing subsequence — we could replace the 5 for the 6 in the example above .
This is why I ’ll try to say a longest increasing subsequence instead of the longest increasing subsequence . )
If we define L( π ) to be the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a permutation of our card deck , π , then Aldous and Diaconis show the following holds .
Lemma 1 .
With deck π , patience sorting played with the greedy strategy ends with exactly L( π ) piles .
Furthermore , the game played with any legal strategy ends with at least L ( π ) piles .
So the greedy strategy is optimal and cannot be improved by any look - ahead strategy .
Proof .
If cards a 1 < a 2 < … < a l appear in increasing order , then under any legal strategy each a i must be placed in some pile to the right of the pile containing a i - 1 , because the card number on top of that pile can only decrease .
Thus the final number of piles is at least l , and hence at least L ( π ) .
Conversely , using the greedy strategy , when a card c is placed in a pile other than the first pile , put a pointer from that card to the currently top card c′ < c in the pile to the left .
At the end of the game , let a l be the card on top of the rightmost pile l .
The sequence a 1 ← a 2 ← … ← a l - 1 ← a l obtained by following the pointers is an increasing subsequence whose length is the number of piles .
What a fabulous result !
Despite the mathematical language , this proof actually consists of an algorithm for finding L( π ) , and indeed for determining an actual longest increasing subsequence of π .
Coding this up in Python we get :
import bisect import defaultdict #
We want a maximum function which accepts a default value from functools import partial , reduce maximum = partial ( reduce , max ) def patience_sort ( xs ) : ''' Patience sort an iterable , xs .
This function generates a series of pairs ( x , pile ) , where " pile " is the 0 - based index of the pile " x " should be placed on top of .
Elements of " xs " must be less - than comparable . ''' pile_tops = list ( ) for x in xs : pile = bisect.bisect_left( pile_tops , x ) if pile == len( pile_tops ) : pile_tops.append(x ) else : pile_tops [ pile ] = x yield x , pile def longest_increasing_subseq_length( xs ) : ''' Return the length of the longest increasing subsequence of xs. >>> longest_increasing_subseq_length(range( 3 ) )
3 >>> longest_increasing_subseq_length ( [ 3 , 1 , 2 , 0 ] ) 2 ''' return 1 + maximum ( ( pile for x , pile in patience_sort ( xs ) ) , - 1 ) def longest_increasing_subsequence(xs ) : ''' Return a longest increasing subsequence of xs . ( Note that there may be more than one such subsequence . ) >>>
longest_increasing_subsequence(range( 3 ) ) [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] >>> longest_increasing_subsequence ( [ 3 , 1 , 2 , 0 ] ) [ 1 , 2 ] ' '' # Patience sort xs , stacking ( x , prev_ix ) pairs on the piles .
# Prev_ix indexes the element at the top of the previous pile , # which has a lower x value than the current x value .
piles = [ [ ] ]
# Create a dummy pile 0 for x , p in patience_sort ( xs ) : if p + 1 == len( piles ) : piles.append ( [ ] ) # backlink to the top of the previous pile piles [p + 1 ] .append ( ( x , len ( piles [p ] ) - 1 ) ) # Backtrack to find a longest increasing subsequence npiles = len( piles ) - 1 prev = 0 lis = list ( ) for pile in range ( npiles , 0 , - 1 ) : x , prev = piles [ pile ] [ prev ] lis.append(x ) lis.reverse( ) return lis
The patience sort algorithm has been separated from from the subsequent processing of the moves it generates .
I ’ve shown a couple of clients of patience_sort ( ) .
The first simply counts the number of piles used .
The second maintains the back - link infrastructure required to recover a longest increasing subsequence , and returns such a subsequence .
I also wrote a third client which generates some of the graphics on this page .

The bisect module provides Pythonic support for binary searching sorted sequences .
In this case , the cards on top of the piles remain in sorted order .

You may be wondering why longest_increasing_subseq_length ( ) does n’t just check the length of xs to handle the empty input case .
That ’s because patience sort is a greedy algorithm , which is happy to process any iterable , not just a sequence of known length .

That ’s because patience sort is a greedy algorithm , which is happy to process any iterable , not just a sequence of known length .
Patience_sort ( ) relies on the elements of the input sequence xs being less than comparable .
Well , obviously we need to be able to compare things to sort them !
Usually , though , it ’s more flexible to allow clients to pass in a comparison function , as modelled by standard Python functions like sort ( ) and max ( ) .
I ’ve not done this here because the bisect module does n’t ( yet ) allow clients to pass in custom less - than functions .
Although the cards which end up on top of the piles at the end of the sorting phase do form an increasing sequence , this sequence may not be a subsequence of the original shuffled deck .
We need to maintain back - pointers , implemented here as list indices , to recover an actual longest increasing subsequence .
At the end of the patience sort phase our deck of cards is not fully sorted : typically , we ’d expect to end up with a dozen or so sorted piles , which we ’d need to merge to complete the sorting .
The card with the lowest value ( the 2 of clubs for a full deck ) should always ends up on top of the left - most pile — a simple sanity - check on any patience sorting routine .
A deck of cards contains no duplicated values , but patience sorting works perfectly well without this restriction .
Use bisect_left ( ) in patience_sort ( ) ( as shown ) to find a strictly increasing subsequence ; bisect_right ( ) would find a sequence which never decreases .
The patience_sort ( ) function yields results as soon as it finds them .
This stream - based approach works nicely with a greedy algorithm .
For example , an impatient player hoping to complete the game using just 9 piles would give up as soon as a 10th pile gets created .
def win( deck ) : ''' Return True if the input deck wins at patience sort , False otherwise . ''' # ( Note : piles are zero based ) return all ( pile < 9 for card , pile in patience_sort ( deck ) )
We can combine this function with random shuffling to experimentally investigate the claim that aiming for 9 piles gives roughly a 5 % chance of winning .
def psort_win_ratio( deck ) : ''' Patience sorts a deck of cards , yielding ( wins , tries ) pairs .''' wins = 0 for tries in itertools.count ( 1 ) : random.shuffle( deck ) if win( deck ) : wins += 1 yield wins , tries
How many tries before we win 1000 times ?
On this occasion , 18539 , suggesting a slightly better than 5 % chance of winning .
>>> results = psort_win_ratio( list ( range ( 52 ) ) ) >>> next ( ( w , t ) for w , t in results if w > 999 ) ( 1000 , 18539 )
The animation at the top of this article combines jQuery with CSS positioning .
If it does n’t work in your browser , my apologies .
It demonstrates patience sorting using the optimal greedy strategy , then back - tracks to find the longest increasing subsequence .
I have n’t shown the back pointers which need to be placed on the piles alongside the cards , and are then used during the back - tracking .
You ’ll have to imagine that , as each card is placed on a pile , a back - arrow connects it to the card on top of the pile to its left — a card which it succeeds in the sequence and exceeds in value .
Click on the graphic above to shuffle and patience sort a full deck of cards .
This patience sort algorithm processes each card immediately .
That does n’t make it a linear algorithm — but it ’s not that much worse .
Selecting the pile on which to place each card involves a binary search through the P piles , giving an O ( N log P ) sorting phase .
The final track back through the piles to determine the longest increasing subsequence is O ( P ) .
In the worst case the deck would already be in order , leading to N piles and O ( N log N ) performance .
Wikipedia points to some improvements to this if we know more about the distribution of input values .
Space requirements are also O ( N ) .
You might be wondering : why bother with a binary search to locate the pile for a particular card ?
Surely it would be just as easy to scan the piles from left to right , stopping as soon as we reach one whose top card is higher than the one currently in play ?
Well , yes , and in fact I ’ve taken this approach in my Javascript implementation — as far as I know , Javascript has no built - in binary search function , and when you ’ve got an input size fixed at 52 items efficiency is not a major issue .
For larger inputs though , scanning through the piles from left to right would be O( P ) , and we ’d end up with a quadratic longest subsequence algorithm .
Let ’s now consider a larger input sequence : the 38096 runners who completed the 2008 New York City marathon .
If we have a list of these runners , ordered by finishing time , what would be the longest sublist comprising runners who are getting younger ?
Below I ’ve highlighted just such a sublist of the 8 athletes who clocked under two and a quarter hours .
MARILSON GOMES DOS SANTOS , 31 , M , 2:08:43 ABDERRAHIM

I ’ve been considering this very problem over the course of a mini-series of four articles .
In the most recent episode I showed how a solution could be found as a special case of the more general longest common subsequence problem .
That generality came at a price : a rough Python implementation took over an hour to run and even a C++ implementation took over 18 seconds .
How does our new longest_increasing_subsequence ( ) function shape up ?
To try it out , all we need is a suitable less - than function .
class AgingRunner : ''' Class to represent runners keyed by age .''' .... def __lt__( self , other ) : ''' Return True if this runner is * older * than the other . ''' return self.age > other.age
Finding the longest age - decreasing sublist took 430 milliseconds on a laptop computer with a 2GHz processor .
The resulting sublist had 60 entries .
How about the longest sublist of athletes who are n’t getting any older ?
We could change patience_sort ( ) to use bisect_right ( ) instead of bisect_left ( ) , or , as shown below , we can tweak our less than function .
class AgingRunner : ... def __lt__( self , other ) : " Return True if this runner * is n't younger * than the other . " return self.age >= other.age
This second sublist has length 1724 , and took 630 milliseconds to find .
The longest increasing subsequence provides a measure of how close a sequence is to being sorted .
In the general case , computing this length using the algorithms discussed in this article will be more efficient than finding the edit distance between the sequence and a sorted version of itself .
Wikipedia ’s entry on patience sorting pointed me at the Bazaar version control system , which uses patience sorting in its differencing routines rather than the more commonly used edit distance algorithms .
I ’m not entirely sure what the code is up to but there ’s certainly some patience sorting in there .
I generated the playing card graphics from Ryan Neaveill ’s shareware playing card font .

Michael Everson has formally submitted a paper to the Unicode Technical Committee entitled “ Proposal to encode dominoes and other game symbols in the UCS ” ( PDF ) — a paper which also makes use of Ryan Neaveill ’s playing cards font for illustrations .
This article is the fourth in a mini-series .
Its predecessors are :

In addition to ending a ban on stem cell research funding , President Barack Obama issued a potentially landmark memo Monday declaring a new era of " scientific integrity " across government .
In no uncertain terms , Obama signaled that the federal government would be guided by science , not the other way around .
In offering a repudiation of the previous administration , he also promised a new era of transparency .
The Sci-Tech Presidents :
Jefferson , the Paleontologist
Lincoln , the Inventor
" Political officials should not suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions , " Obama wrote in an official memorandum .
" If scientific and technological information is developed and used by the federal government , it should ordinarily be made available to the public . "
After the Bush years , during which scientists of many stripes — from former Surgeon General Richard Carmona to a host of climate change scientists — claimed their results had been ignored , misconstrued or downright changed , the new memo brought cheers from groups dedicated to advancing scientific research .
" [ President Obama and this Congress ] have already made the choice that they are going to fully support science and invest in science to the solve the big problems — health care , science , and education , " said Dr. Stacie Propst , vice president of science policy and outreach at Research !
America .
" They are going to focus on a science - based economy for us . "
Though the memo was released in conjunction with the repeal of a Bush - era ban on stem cells , many saw a broader significance to the memorandum , which directed the
Office of Science and Technology Policy to " develop recommendations for presidential action designed to guarantee scientific integrity throughout the executive branch , " within 120 days .
The memo also required that " the selection and retention of candidates for science and technology positions in the executive branch should be based on the candidate 's knowledge , credentials , experience and integrity . "
The Bush administration , by contrast , was dogged by allegations that key posts were filled with ideologues or political cronies .
Propst said that this common - sense approach to hiring for science positions offered " a stark difference from what many considered to be the more ideological approach " of the Bush administration .
However , some observers said that it's not always easy to separate politics from science , especially on hot - button issues like climate change or stem cell research .
On some issues , following the scientific line might be tougher than it sounds , said Aaron Levine , a public policy professor at Georgia
Tech who studies how ethical controversy influences science .
For instance , if Obama decides to form a bioethics committee , as previous administrations have , it could be difficult to find the right composition of technocrats for the job .
With most bioethicists " on the record " about the hot - button issues of cloning , embryonic stem cell research , genetic modification and euthanasia , it could be difficult to staff a committee in a balanced way .
Particularly with regard to embryonic - stem - cell research , where the Obama administration has a clear - cut position , they could run into political trouble .
" I think you can almost guarantee that there will be criticism of whoever Obama selects , " Levine said , from the left if he appoints opponents of embryonic stem cells , and from the right if the panel is too unanimous in support of his policies .
And what about when scientists can't come to a definitive conclusion about something , such as the impacts of certain types of advanced biofuel ?
" For the hot - button topics , it 's going to be tricky , " Levine said .
But he held out hope that on more technical , less politicized issues , it would be easier to find clear ground .
" In the more technical topics , levee design , for instance , we 'd like our experts to be fully focused on what can you do to build the levees you can , " he said .

The Hill of Crosses is a site of pilgrimage in northern Lithuania .
The first crosses were placed on the former hill fort in the 14th century .
Over the centuries , not only crosses , but giant crucifixes , carvings of Lithuanian patriots , statues of the Virgin Mary and thousands of tiny effigies and rosaries have been brought here by Catholic pilgrims .
The real reason for the Hill 's existence lies buried in Lithuania 's history .
Over the centuries , the place has come to signify the peaceful endurance of Lithuanian Catholicism despite the threats it has faced throughout history .
Invaded by Russia during the 1795 partition of the Polish - Lithuanian commonwealth Lithuania disappeared altogether from the map of Europe .
When the old political structure of Eastern Europe fell apart in 1918 , Lithuania once again declared its independence .
Throughout this time , the Hill of Crosses was used as a place for Lithuanians to pray for peace , for their country , and for the loved ones they had lost .
Most recently , the site took on a special significance during the years 1944 - 1990 , when Lithuania was occupied by the USSR .
Continuing to travel to the Hill and leave their tributes , Lithuanians used it to demonstrate their allegiance to their original identity , religion and heritage .
Although the Soviets worked hard to remove new crosses , and bulldozed the site at least three times , the new crossess continued to appear and by 1985 the authorities had given up .
On September 7 , 1993 , Pope John Paul II visited the Hill of Crosses , declaring it a place for hope , peace , love and sacrifice .
Disgraced CIA spy Jim Nicholson , serving time for espionage at the federal prison in Sheridan , groomed his son to collect debts from Russia with colorful letters that quoted the Bible , according to court records unsealed Thursday .
" ( D ) o not gloat over me my enemies ! " he wrote last April to Nathan J. Nicholson , quoting from the book of Micah .
" For though I fall , I will rise again . "
Father and son rose Thursday before a federal judge in Portland , both wearing leg shackles .
Harold James " Jim " Nicholson , a 58 - year - old native Oregonian convicted in 1997 of selling classified information to the Russian Federation , is now accused of using his son to collect the debts .
His son , Nathaniel James Nicholson of Eugene , a 24 - year - old disabled Army veteran , is accused of traveling the globe to collect .
Father and son were indicted Tuesday for conspiracy to act as agents of a foreign government ; acting as agents of a foreign government ; money laundering ; and conspiracy to commit money laundering , which carries a penalty of up to 20 years .
The government unsealed its indictment Thursday before they were arraigned separately before U.S. Magistrate Judge Janice M. Stewart .
Both pleaded not guilty to all charges .
" The case was not easy , " said David Ian Miller , special agent in charge of the FBI in Oregon .
" It was n't easy to bring allegations against such a worthy adversary . "
The new allegations against Jim Nicholson first came to the attention of the FBI in February 2002 , when a paralegal at a San Francisco law firm told a strange story about a bank robber serving time at Sheridan .
The paralegal told agents that the inmate , with whom she shared correspondence , had told her that Nicholson was trying to get information or documents to Russia , according to a search warrant affidavit authored by FBI Special Agent Jared J. Garth .
The inmate acknowledged in interviews with the FBI that Nicholson had described his arrangement with Russia as a kind of " pension " and that he planned to repatriate there after his release , Garth wrote .
The government accuses Nicholson of smuggling information out of the prison to the Russian Federation .
The former senior CIA officer took steps to prevent that information from getting to U.S. authorities , at one point tearing a typewriter ribbon to bits and flushing it down the toilet , according to the FBI 's affidavit .
Nicholson also persuaded a cellmate to take an envelope with him when freed in July 2002 , telling him it contained his memoirs .
The former cellmate mailed the inch - thick package to Nicholson 's parents , Nick and Betty Nicholson of Eugene .
FBI tracks son
For the next few years , Jim Nicholson kept in regular contact with his family from the prison , which rises off a lonely stretch of highway in the shadow of Oregon 's coastal mountains .
He kept up with his oldest son , Jeremiah , who was in the Air Force in Florida , and his daughter , Astralena , in Beaverton .
But Nicholson kept closest contact with Nathan , according to the FBI .
" An analysis of written correspondence between Nicholson and Nathaniel indicates a concerted effort by Nicholson to use Nathaniel as his conduit for contact with representatives of the Russian Federation beginning in the fall of 2006 , " Garth wrote .
Nicholson buoyed his son with phrases from the books of Jeremiah and Micah .
What followed , according to the FBI affidavit , was an odyssey in which agents tracked virtually every move Nathan Nicholson made as he crisscrossed the globe .
He met with Russian officials in Mexico , Peru and Cyprus to collect tens of thousands of dollars in cash .
Agents watched the younger Nicholson , tapped his phones and Internet service , and planted a tracking device on his 2005 Chevy Cavalier .
On Dec. 13 , 2007 , Garth and Special Agent John M. Cooney stopped Nathan Nicholson at George Bush International Airport in Houston as he returned from Lima , Peru .
Border Protection inspectors detained Nicholson for a secondary search and questioning .
They found $ 7,013 in cash , most of it inside a PlayStation video game case .
Federal authorities detained the young man long enough to secretly photocopy his 80 - page notebook and business cards .
This provided agents a road map for his alleged communications with Russian officials .
Nicknamed " Batman "
According to the FBI affidavit , notes obtained by the agents suggest that Russian intelligence officials questioned the younger Nicholson about his father 's arrest and they acknowledged receipt of the package Jim Nicholson 's former cellmate carried out of Sheridan .
Some of Nathan Nicholson 's alleged cloak - and - dagger work sounds like that of his father , who earned the nickname " Batman . "
From 1980 to 1994 , the elder Nicholson was an operations officer for the CIA , assigned to posts across the globe .
He spied on foreign intelligence services , including those of the USSR and -- after the Soviet Union 's collapse -- the Russian Federation .
From 1994 to 1996 , he taught CIA trainees at the agency 's training center in northern Virginia .
Nicholson used his positions to sell classified national defense information to agents of the Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki Rossii , or SVRR ( successor to the KGB ) , meeting with them in Malaysia , India , Indonesia , Singapore and Switzerland , court records show .
He gave away information about CIA case officers , code names and secret reports .
Russia paid Jim Nicholson about $ 300,000 for his betrayals .
The government arrested him at Dulles International Airport in November 1996 .
Nicholson carried film canisters that held secret documents , which he planned to hand over to Russian agents in Zurich .
He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and was convicted in 1997 , when Nathan was 12
Nicholson was serving a 23 - year sentence when the latest allegations against him surfaced .
Federal authorities in Oregon said that if the allegations prove true , Nicholson might be the first convicted spy caught twice for betraying the United States .
Nicholson downplayed his espionage in the 1990s by telling a federal court official preparing his pre-sentence report that his criminal conduct stood in " great contrast " to his prior service .
Nicholson said he would " greatly appreciate the opportunity to offer some positive example to my children " before he dies .
" At the end of the day , " said Oregon FBI boss Miller , " this will prove to be a story of family , trust and betrayal . "

On Amazon.com two days ago , mysteriously , the sales rankings disappeared from two newly - released high profile gay romance books : “ Transgressions ” by Erastes and “ False Colors ” by Alex Beecroft .
Everybody was perplexed .
Was it a glitch of some sort ?
The very next day HUNDREDS of gay and lesbian books simultaneously lost their sales rankings , including my book “ The Filly . ”
There was buzz , What ’s going on ?
Does Amazon have some sort of campaign to suppress the visibility of gay books ?
Is it just a major glitch in the system ?
Many of us decided to write to Amazon questioning why our rankings had disappeared .
Most received evasive replies from customer service reps not versed in what was happening .
As I am a publisher and have an Amazon Advantage account through which I supply Amazon with my books , I had a special way to contact them .
24 hours later I had a response :
In consideration of our entire customer base , we exclude " adult " material from appearing in some searches and best seller lists .
Since these lists are generated using sales ranks , adult materials must also be excluded from that feature .
Hence , if you have further questions , kindly write back to us .
Best regards ,

Yes , it is true .
Amazon admits they are indeed stripping the sales ranking indicators for what they deem to be “ adult ” material .
Of course they are being hypocritical because there is a multitude of “ adult ” literature out there that is still being ranked – Harold Robbins , Jackie Collins , come on !
They are using categories THEY set up ( gay and lesbian ) to now target these books as somehow offensive .
Now in fairness I should point out that Amazon has also stopped ranking many books in the " erotica " categories as well which includes straight erotica .
But that 's a whole other battle that I 'll leave to the erotica writers to take on .
Now I could probably convince the automatons at Amazon that The Filly is YA and therefore not “ adult ” in the least , and I could probably even convince them to reinstate my ranking .
But if they are excluding books just on the basis of being “ gay ” then by all means exclude mine too because I do n’t want them just to reinstate the “ nice ” gay books , they need to reinstate all the gay books and if they are really going to try and exclude so - called “ adult ” material , then how come this has an Amazon ranking ?
Here is a screencap of the case log from Amazon .
Keep clicking on the image to make it bigger ************ For everyone who has commented on my blog - Thank you very much .
and everyone who has asked if they can use my name and link back to me .
YES please do .
Spread the word .
Amazon will be beside itself in the face of all this fury !******* UPDATE ************** Publisher 's
Weekly now has a story here , that an Amazon spokesperson claims this is all a glitch and they have no such new policy .
My caselog is still active in my Advantage account with the response from customer service rep Ashlyn D. Also I 'd like to point you to this blog of an author who received this same response from Amazon back in February .
Amazon has some ' splainin ' to do !*********** UPDATE #2****************** As of 8 AM this morning ( April 13th ) The Filly has had its ranking reinstated by Amazon .
I also noticed Alex Beecroft 's False Colors was reinstated as well .
Many others are not , so they have n't fixed the " so - called " glitch as of yet .*******FINAL UPDATE ****************** Amazon has released a statement of apology stating that it was an " embarrassing and ham - fisted cataloging error " that pertained to 57,310 listings .
They also say that It has been misreported that the issue was limited to Gay & Lesbian themed titles .
So it 's over .
Amazon admits they goofed , and I , for one , shall give them the benefit of the doubt and say I do not believe that there was any malicious intent .
Case closed .
Robbie Feather , managing director of Feather & Black said : “ Confidence in banks has hit an all - time low and fears of a recession crime wave have been raised by the Home Secretary .
As a result people genuinely seem concerned about the safety of their money .
Our new Safe bed began as a slightly tongue - in - cheek idea but we are now confident that it will appeal to home owners who want to store their money or valuable belongings in a safe place . "
Ummm , yeah ... you probably should n't do this if you are asked to take a breathalyzer test .
Rating the riders in Hell , April 10 , 2009 Racing to Hell : Roubaix 's hit list
It 's hell � rain or shine
Photo � : Roberto Bettini
After a tumultuous start to the 2009 season , the game of predicting the winner has been made more difficult .
The Cyclingnews staff used its collective Classics crystal ball to tackle the heady task of analysing who may come out on top in the 107th edition of l'Enfer du Nord .
With the absence of big hitters Stuart O'Grady and Alessandro Ballan , the ' semi- retirement ' of Magnus Backstedt and the bad luck Fabian Cancellara has been experiencing lately , the Paris - Roubaix game has changed in 2009 .
Perennial contender Steffen Wesemann has retired and wo n't be around this year , and Silence - Lotto's Leif Hoste is somewhat struggling with his form leading up to the big day .
It leaves the door open to emerging Classics rider Martijn Maaskant and the irrepressible ' Australian ' Heinrich Haussler .
Many people have said it 's Quick Step 's race to lose , and with Stijn Devolder scoring another emphatic win in last weekend 's Ronde Van Vlaanderen , they may have a point .
Do n't be fooled by the voices around you , however ; we certainly try not to , which is why we 've brought you a line - up of those who could provide a shakeup on the 28 sectors of pav� throughout Roubaix 's 259 kilometres .
Tom Boonen - Quick Step Tom Boonen ( Quick Step ) would love to add a third cobble stone to his collection
Photo � : Tim Van Wichelen P- R History : Boonen burst onto the scene back in 2002 with his third place behind Johan Museeuw and has n't looked back .
His quiet 2003 was followed by ninth in 2004 , then victory in 2005 as part of a spectacular Flanders - Roubaix double .
He was a controversial second behind Cancellara in 2006 ( Peter Van Petegem , Vladimir Gusev and Leif Hoste were disqualified from in front of him after they crossed a closed railway crossing ) .
Victory last year cemented his place in the race 's history .
RVV Performance :
He finished 20th , with Italian Filippo Pozzato glued to the Belgian 's wheel , Quick Step 's tactics quickly switched to Stijn Devoder .
Mud or Dust ?
Both .
' Tornado Tom ' can blow the rest away on either .
He was second in the last real mudfest here in 2002 , and has won in the dry .
Pros :
If this was basketball , we'd be saying , ' You the man , Tom ...'
Born for this race ; the fastest sprinter likely to get to the track in the front group .
He 's the defending champion , and likely to add another victory in this event to his palmar�s .
Cons :
There 's always a weight of expectation that may be heavy on his shoulders ; they are pretty broad shoulders , however .
Cyclingnews rating : Stijn Devolder - Quick Step Can Stijn Devolder do the double ?
Photo � : Sirotti P- R
History : Not much history here .
Has only finished inside the time limit once in a lowly 18th place last year .
He 's worth mentioning though because anyone who can win the Ronde has a chance here .
RVV Performance : Took a second consecutive Ronde crown in similar fashion to last year 's victory .
In better form than 2008 , if that 's possible , and very capable of taking the Flanders - Roubaix double .
Mud or Dust ?
He 's proven himself in either , and he 's Belgian , so the tougher the better .
Pros :
If you can win the Ronde , you can win Roubaix ; Part of super strong Quick Step team .
Cons : Boonen will be Quick Step 's number one ; Devolder has n't been on the Roubaix podium before .
Cyclingnews rating : Martijn Maaskant - Garmin- Slipstream
P - R History : Total surprise packet - one participation , one fourth place .
Impressive stuff from this young Dutchman .
RVV Performance : After a quiet buildup to the Classics season , Maaskant burst into reckoning for a Roubaix crown by finishing fourth in rainy , windy and generally disagreeable conditions .
Mud or Dust ?
Like his ' predecessor ' , Magnus Backstedt , Garmin - Slipstream 's Classics man can handle both
Pros : Seemingly fearless and uninimidated by the occasion , Maaskant has smarts beyong his years and the legs to match .
Cons :
Has n't proven himself over a longer period , which is necessary when it comes to this race , although he proved otherwise last year .
Cyclingnews rating : Fabian Cancellara - Team CSC P-R History : Winner in 2006 by nearly two minutes , which by modern standards is an absolute age .
A podium spot in last year 's edition increased interest in the Swiss strongman before the Spring had even begun .
This year 's campaign has n't gone to plan , however .
RVV Performance : A broken chain on the Koppenberg meant the Saxo Bank star registered a DNF .
Mud or Dust ?
His fourth place finish in 2004 was in a less - than - dry race , and his win in 2006 came in a dusty duel .
If it 's dry , he 's still a smart money bet for at least a podium .
Pros : Pedigree , strength , teamwork and character .
The reigning Olympic TT champion is capable of massive bursts of speed , and his run of bad luck may have ended .
Cons :
He 's definitely not in premium condition , and does n't seem to be able to avoid misfortune in '09 .
Cyclingnews rating : Juan Antonio Flecha - Rabobank Juan Antonio Flecha ( Rabobank ) has good cards
Photo � : Tim Van Wichelen P- R History : After an anonymous 23rd in 2002 , the Spaniard has been right up there every year without actually managing to win it .
His second place in 2007 improves on his previous bests of third in 2005 and fourth in 2006 , and you would n't put it past him to improve on that this year .
His Achilles heel may be his sprint , though .
RVV Performance :
No love for the Spaniard on a tough day in Flanders , and he finished well down in 30th .
Mud or Dust ?
Dust would suit him better , as he proved in the 2007 edition .
Pros : Rabobank is banking on the affable Spaniard to come through on Sunday , and the conditions should favour him .
A lack of spectacular form means he may slip under the radar , which will suit him well .
Cons : Mixed form thus far in 2009 may mean he won ' be at his peak .
Cyclingnews rating : Heinrich Haussler - Cerv�lo TestTeam Heinrich Haussler ( Cerv�lo TestTeam ) had an exceptional spring
Photo � : Sirotti P - R History : This will be his first .
RVV Performance : Could n't match up against Quick Step and Devolder , but escaped at the end of a long and gruelling race for second place .
Mud or Dust ?
He does n't mind adverse weather , because he has the mind to handle it .
The Australia - born can obviosuly deal with the sun , too .
Pros :
Had a fantastic spring with second places in Milano - Sanremo and the Ronde , plus three wins so far .
Cons : Starting to get tired .
He admitted that in the Ronde he did n't have the same legs he had in the weeks before .
Cyclingnews rating : Sylvain Chvanel - Quick Step P - R
History : Never really featured in this race , although given his form this year that may change on Sunday .
RVV Performance : Incredible team work could have see him win rather than his 31st place finish if the final would have developed differently .
Mud or Dust ?
Maybe the toughest French rider going round at the moment , Chavanel can handle the cold and wet , and is fast enough to stay with the rapid pace when the roads are dry .
Like Nuyens , look out for a gutsy move from him in either conditions .
Pros : Great form , a move to Quick Step and under the watchful eye of Patrick Lefevere , the former Cofidis rider will be one to watch .
Cons :
Has n't got the Roubaix pedigree as such ; unproven by virtue of his palmares .
Cyclingnews rating : Filippo Pozzato - Katusha Filippo Pozzato is always a factor
Photo � : Gregor Brown P - R History : Pretty unspectacular , although like Nuyens he has worked for Boonen in previous editions .
A 15th place in 2006 is the high point of his Roubaix experience so far .
RVV Performance : Having shadowed Tom Boonen all day ( much to the Belgian 's understandable chagrin ) , Pozzato finished fifth .
Mud or Dust ?
Hmm , well �this is a toughie .
The mud might mess up his pretty shoes , but then the dust could ruin his beautiful golden locks .
Seriously though , despite appearances , Pippo is n't afraid of a bit of rain or dirt .
Pros : Harder than he looks ; has had good form all spring and would do well in a sprint in the velodrome .
Cons : Lack of aggressiveness to initiate the decisive move .
Cyclingnews rating : George Hincapie - Columbia - Highroad Can George Hincapie ( Columbia - Highroad ) overcome bad luck from recent Paris - Roubaix races ?
Photo � : Sirotti P- R
History :
You name it , George has done it here �except win , that is .
He 's rarely outside the top 10 , but has only been on the podium once : second behind an unstoppable Tom Boonen in 2005 .
Luck does n't follow George to this race , and he 's been cruelly denied on many occasions .
The most memorable times have been his exhausted tumble into a ditch in the closing stages of the 2002 race , and a broken steerer tube causing him to fall and break his shoulder in 2006 .
RVV Performance : After a tough day at the office , Hincapie crashed in the group sprint for second , ending the day in 34th .
It was a game of chance last Sunday , and the American did n't get a slice of the good stuff .
Mud or Dust ?
Either .
Both .
Whatever .
George does n't care ; he 'd race through boiling oil to get hold of that cobblestone trophy .
Pros :
No one knows this race better than him ; can go well in the predicted muddy conditions ; Columbia - Highroad wants him to secure this crown and it'll move heaven and earth to help give it to him .
Cons :
Bad luck seems to follow him to this race every year ; years are n't on his side , although beware the experienced American with nothing to lose .
Cyclingnews rating : Leif Hoste - Silence - Lotto P- R
History : Not too bad , but nothing spectacular .
His only real threat in the race came in 2006 when he was second across the line behind Fabian Cancellara , but was later disqualified ( along with Peter Van Petegem and Vladimir Gusev ) for going through a railway crossing when the gates were down .
Otherwise he 's just failed to get into the top 10 .
RVV Performance : Having suffered several setbacks this season , Flanders was a bit of a turnaround .
He was in a promising move , but Quick Step reduced the quietly - spoken Belgian to finishing in a larger group behind Devolder , in 27th place .
Mud or Dust ?
Has gone well in the dust , but this guy 's from Flanders so the mud should be no problem .
Pros : Silence - Lotto has been criticised for lack of results , and this strong rider has a point to prove to many .
Cons :
A lack of form could hold him back , unfortunately .
Cyclingnews rating : Wild Cards - the best of the rest
No review of the likely contenders would be complete without mentioning the last Frenchman to win in Roubaix : Frederic Guesdon ( Fran�aise des Jeux ) .
That win was way back in 1997 , but Fred has the invaluable experience for any challenge from his teammates - but who they might be , we could n't say .
Other names worth a mention include former winner Servais Knaven ( Milram ) and � barring team tactics � the Columbia - Highroads Edvald Boasson Hagen and Marcus Burghardt .
Also watch out for Bj�rn Leukemans ( Vacansoleil ) , who may create a surprise .

Sarah wears a helmet outside to protect her from falls
Sarah Laslett 's diet includes cream , butter , nuts and eggs and is devised by Great Ormond Street Children 's Hospital in London .
As Sarah burns off the fat her body produces ketones which protect the brain against seizures .
Sarah , from Morval near Looe , no longer suffers scores of blackouts and seizures every day .
The youngster has Myoclomic Astatic epilepsy , a rare , drug - resistant form of epilepsy that triggers scores of blackouts and seizures every day .
Her exuberance is wonderful and she has been completely transformed
Teacher Sonia Barrett
The attacks started eight months ago and meant Sarah had to wear a helmet when she was playing .
Then her family found out about a trial at Great Ormond Street of the ketogenic diet .
The high fat , low carboydrate , low protein diet is so finely balanced it has to be carefully calculated by experts who are on hand for advice and support .
One of the key features is restrictions on high - sugar foods , breads , pasta , cereal and starchy vegetables .
Mealtimes are a well - practiced routine of measuring food to within a gramme .
Water regulated
For instance , breakfast could consist of 25 grammes of cream , mixed with water , 43 grammes of egg , mixed with another 25 grammes of cream and 15 grammes of butter , followed by 21 grammes of fruit .
Different types of fruit have different carbohydrate levels so that too has to be adjusted .
Sarah also drinks a carefully regulated 120 millilitres of water an hour , to keep her hydrated , but also to avoid constipation and kidney stones .
Teacher Sonia Barrett has been looking after her at school since she became ill last September .
It has been 24 days since Sarah 's last blackout but she still wears a helmet to play outside - just in case the fits return .
£ 25,000 raised
Ms Barrett said : " Only four weeks ago she would just sit very still .
There was no animation and she seemed very sleepy a lot of the time .
" Now she is full of life .
Her exuberance is wonderful and she has been completely transformed . "
Sarah 's family has also raised £ 25,000 to continue a trial at the hospital for another year and help other children like Sarah .
Her mother Alex said : " It 's brilliant because other children now hopefully will get the same chance that Sarah 's had to do this diet .
" I could n't believe how a diet could make such a dramatic difference but for Sarah , this has been a miracle . "
Great Ormond Street is recruiting children with severe epilepsy for the trial , although patients will need a referral from their paediatric consultant .
The last episode of “ The Jon Stewart Show , ” Stewart ’s old syndicated talk show , in 1994 , he had David Letterman , a longtime supporter and infrequent guest of other talkshows , on to cheer him up after he learned he was being canceled .
Dave encourages him : “ You ’ve got a smart audience .
Cancellation is not the same as failure . ”
Stewart seems less than encouraged , and he was right :
He never did anything , ever again .
A few other notes :
1 . Dave gets to smoke his cigar on set .
2 . They play Matthew Sweet as they go into commercial .
Awesome .
I loved 1994 .
3 . Dave tells the same story about Paul Newman that he would after Newman ’s death on his own show , 14 years later .

I hope it was this .
FREE PALESTINE !
ISOLATE APARTHEID ISRAEL !
The Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) and Palestine Solidarity Committee ( PSC ) launch Week of Action for Palestine supported by the Young Communist League and other progressive organisations
February 3 , 2009 --
In a historic development for South Africa , South African dock workers have announced their determination not to offload a ship from Israel that is scheduled to dock in Durban on Sunday , February 8 , 2009 .
This follows the decision by COSATU to strengthen the campaign in South Africa for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against apartheid Israel .
The pledge by the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) members in Durban reflects the commitment by South African workers to refuse to support oppression and exploitation across the globe .
Last year , Durban dock workers had refused to offload a shipment of arms that had arrived from China and was destined for Zimbabwe to prop up the Mugabe regime and to intensify the repression against the Zimbabwean people .
Now , says SATAWU ’s General Secretary Randall Howard , the union ’s members are committing themselves to not handling Israeli goods .
SATAWU ’s action on Sunday will be part of a proud history of worker resistance against apartheid .
In 1963 , just four years after the Anti-Apartheid Movement was formed , Danish dock workers refused to offload a ship with South African goods .
When the ship docked in Sweden , Swedish workers followed suit .
Dock workers in Liverpool and , later , in the San Francisco Bay Area also refused to offload South African goods .
South Africans , and the South African working class in particular , will remain forever grateful to those workers who determinedly opposed apartheid and decided that they would support the anti-apartheid struggle with their actions .
Last week , Western Australian members of the Maritime Union of Australia resolved to support the campaign for boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel , and have called for a boycott of all Israeli vessels and all vessels bearing goods arriving from or going to Israel .
This is the legacy and the tradition that South African dock workers have inherited , and it is a legacy they are determined to honour , by ensuring that South African ports of entry will not be used as transit points for goods bound for or emanating from certain dictatorial and oppressive states such as Zimbabwe , Swaziland and Israel .
COSATU , the Palestine Solidarity Committee , the Young Communist League and a range of other organisations salute the principled position taken by these workers .
We also take this opportunity to salute the millions of workers all over the world who have openly condemned and taken decisive steps to isolate apartheid Israel , a step that should send shockwaves to its arrogant patrons in the United States who foot the bill for Israel ’s killing machine .
We call on other workers and unions to follow suit and to do all that is necessary to ensure that they boycott all goods to and from Israel until Palestine is free .
We also welcome statements by various South African Jews of conscience who have dissociated themselves from the genocide in Gaza .
We call on all South Africans to ensure that none of our family members are allowed to join the Israeli Occupation Forces ’ killing machine .

Palestinian Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions National Committee ( BNC ) Salutes South African Dock Workers ' Action !
Palestine , February 3 , 2009 -- The Palestinian Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions National Committee ( BNC ) warmly salutes the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) , a member of COSATU , for its decision today not to offload an Israeli ship that is due to arrive in Durban , South Africa , on 8 February .
Coming weeks after the massive Israeli massacre in Gaza , this distinguished expression by SATAWU of effective solidarity with the Palestinian people in general , and with Gaza in particular , sets a historic precedent that reminds us of the first such action during the apartheid era taken by Danish dock workers in 1963 , when they decided not to offload ships carrying South African products , triggering a similar boycott in Sweden , England and elsewhere .
Last week , endorsing the Palestinian Call for Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) , the Maritime Union of Australia ( Western Australia ) resolved to boycott all Israeli vessels and all vessels bearing goods arriving from or going to Israel .
A few weeks before , Greek dock workers threatened to block a ship carrying weapons to Israel during its criminal war on Gaza .
Those actions , together with the SATAWU decision today , will most likely usher in a new , qualitatively advanced phase of BDS that goes well beyond symbolism .
We call on dock workers ' unions around the world to endorse similar sanctions against Israeli or Israel - bound cargo .
Support in South Africa for the Palestinian struggle against Israel 's colonial and apartheid policies and its war crimes is reaching new heights , with COSATU , the South African Council of Churches , the Palestine Solidarity Committee , the Young Communist League and many grassroots organisations and networks leading diverse forms of BDS campaigns , informed by the long and ultimately successful struggle of South Africans against apartheid .
The Palestinian and global BDS movement against Israel is indebted to the people of South Africa for their inspiring and morale - boosting solidarity .
If Gaza today has become the test of our universal morality and our common humanity , the fast spreading BDS movement around the world has passed the test with flying colors .
In fact , worldwide support for BDS against Israel in reaction to its war crimes and crimes against humanity in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank , including Jerusalem , has shown that international civil society fully recognises that Israel must be held accountable before international law and must pay a heavy price for its atrocities and ongoing willful destruction of Palestinian society .
In this context , the decision by each of Venezuela , Bolivia , Qatar and Mauritania to sever diplomatic ties with Israel was a particularly commendable way of challenging Israel 's impunity .
The shift from traditional , mostly symbolic , solidarity to BDS in Norway , Sweden , Britain , Ireland , Turkey , Canada , Belgium , Malaysia , Spain , USA , Brazil , New Zealand , among others , is a resounding endorsement of effective , morally and politically sound action to end Israel 's multi-faceted oppression of the indigenous people of Palestine and to bring about a just peace to Palestine and the entire region .
The Palestinian civil society Call for Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) against Israel , launched in 2005 by over 170 Palestinian political parties , unions and organisations , offers the vehicle for all people of conscience , organisations and institutions around the globe to join the collective effort to reaffirm the primacy of international law , human rights and dignity .
To replicate the strength and effectiveness of the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s , the BNC urges civil society institutions and every concerned citizen around the world to :
Integrate BDS in every struggle for justice and human rights , by adopting wide , context - sensitive and sustainable boycotts of Israeli products , companies , academic and cultural institutions , and sports groups , similar to the actions taken against apartheid South Africa ;
Ensure national and multinational corporations are held responsible and accordingly sanctioned for profiteering from Israel 's occupation and other violations of human rights and international law ;
Work towards cancelling and blocking free trade and other preferential agreements with Israel , including the EU - Israel and the Mercosur - Israel trade agreements ; and
Pressure governments to impose a direct and indirect arms embargo against Israel that guarantees end - user compliance with international law and human rights principles .
Our " South Africa " moment has arrived .
The time for BDS is now !

COSATU calls for intensified action against Israel
February 5 , 2009 -- COSATU , the Palestinian Solidarity Committee and all members of the Ad Hoc Coalition on Palestine call on all workers and activists for justice and peace to join the ever growing movement of people in solidarity with the suffering masses of Palestine .
In particular , we invite people to tomorrow 's protest outside the Zionist Federation office in Raedene Estate , Johannesburg , and the Picket in Cape Town .
( See details below . )
We note a recent threat by some Zionists : " Let us bombard the COSATU offices with phone calls to let them know our anger .
It is hard to ignore phone calls than emails .
Maybe we should start a policy that Israel - loyal Jews refuse to employ COSATU members in retaliation for COSATU 's evil actions . "
We warn all South African Zionists that COSATU will not allow any forms of apartheid practices and intimidation in South Africa , just as we fully support our comrades in Palestine in their struggle to remove these racist vestiges in their own land .
Employers , particularly Zionist employers who would want to try these old ( and failed ) tricks must be warned that we shall not hesitate to do all in our powers to deal decisively in protecting our members and the working class in South Africa .
The SA Zionist Federation 's Bev Goldman warned in a local newspaper last week that " a boycott would undermine relations between Israel and South Africa and result in a negative impact on the economy " .
This deserves our contempt .
Just as in the campaign against blood diamonds we put people before profits and solidarity before economic blackmail .
Let us never forget that the SA Zionist Federation supported trade , nuclear and security links between Apartheid SA and Israel !
COSATU also calls on workers in the rest of the world to follow the lead of our members in SATAWU who have vowed not to offload Israeli goods and our members who are planning a campaign not to handle any Israeli goods in supermarkets , and other stores .
We understand that the Israeli ship which was due to dock in Durban on Sunday February 8 may arrive earlier , but the SATAWU boycott and the Sunday demonstration will continue .
Workers of the world united to isolate the Apartheid South African state in 1970s and 1980s .
Workers need to stretch our hands across the seas and our continents to join together , now , to isolate the Apartheid Israeli state and to Free Palestine .
We have also received reports that there are about 20 ships carrying medical supplies , humanitarian aid , doctors , journalists , human rights activists and food waiting in Cyprus , destined for Gaza .
One ship was stopped by the Israeli navy and its crew arrested , confirming the inhumane character of apartheid Israel and its total disregard for the desperate situation of the suffering people of Gaza , the very victims of the latest holocaust by Israel .
We salute the crews and passengers on all the ships waiting to assist the people of Gaza .
We reiterate our determination to intensify our actions as we confirm our planned activities as follows ;
Friday , February 6 : A protest outside the offices of the South African Zionist Federation and the South African Jewish Board of Deputies , 2 Elray Street ( off Louis Botha Avenue into Main which becomes Elray ) , Raedene Estate .
Both these organisations unquestioningly supported the recent Israeli attacks against Gaza , and supported the massacre of civilians and the attacks on schools , mosques , ambulances and UN refugee centres .
Protestors will be addressed by , among others , SATAWU general secretary Randall Howard , and ex-minister Ronnie Kasrils .
Protest starts at 14:00 .
Friday , February 6 : A picket outside parliament in Cape Town .
COSATU members and solidarity activists will be joined by a number of members of parliament .
Picket starts at 09:30 .
Friday , February 6 : A mass rally in Actonville , Benoni , at the Buzme Adab Hall .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The founder of one of America 's largest pizza chains has offered unexpected advice to his customers to limit themselves to only one or two slices .
Pizza is not normally known for its health benefits ; thick , cheesy toppings push up the calorie count .
During an interview on BBC's Radio Four program in the United Kingdom , John Schnatter , said , " you ca n't eat five or six slices . "
He was responding to a question from presenter Adam Shaw about whether he was concerned about the impact of the British government 's anti-obesity drive on pizza sales .
" No .
Pizza 's actually healthy for you if you do n't eat too much of it , " Schnatter replied , adding , " You ca n't eat five or six slices but if you eat one or two slices it 's very nutritious . "
The pizza chain boss had just finished telling BBC listeners that the UK market was a " huge priority for Papa John 's International . "
The company has 118 outlets in the United Kingdom , its second biggest market outside the U.S. after China .
Sales in the UK jumped 60 % on Monday alone after heavy snowfalls were estimated to have encouraged around one in five workers to stay at home .
Schnatter is in the United Kingdom for the annual franchisee conference , a marketing tool to encourage more small business owners to buy into the Papa John 's brand .
While it 's impossible to know whether his comments have dissuaded anyone from investing in the company , BBC presenter Shaw suggested shareholders might take issue with his suggestion .
" I 'm not sure your investors would want to hear you tell people do n't eat too much of our pizzas , " he laughed before thanking Schnatter for his time .
Schnatter opened his first shop in 1985 , after selling his beloved Camaro to buy his first pizza oven .
There are now more than 3000 restaurants worldwide .

By R. D. Bradshaw Previous Goldsmiths have mentioned the media links to the Rothschild Cabal .
It doesn�t matter whether the Cabal owns the media sources outright or whether they are just linked for some other reason .
For sure , all of the US national media and much of the world media is categorically controlled by the Cabal .
I cannot think of any US national media source that is not linked in some way to the Cabal .
Numerous earlier Goldsmiths have broached the controlled media in manipulating the markets in order to support the work of the money changers .
While it might look like nothing further could be said , there is an aspect of this situation which has particular relevance in the case of the recent Chinese move to resurrect the importance of the Special Drawing Rights ( as I discuss in the Goldsmiths , Part LV , LVIII , LXII , LXIII , and LXVIII ) .
But in mentioning the possibility of trouble for gold , because of the SDR thing , I cautioned readers that much would likely depend on how the controlled media played it .
For example , in the Goldsmiths , Part LVIII , I addressed the Chinese move and said : � for gold and silver advocates , there is much room for concern over prices in the coming days .
If the plutocrats can build up some momentum among various so - called scholars and leaders , and if the Third World gets on board , there could be much publicity from the controlled media about replacing gold and silver .
As most of us know , media stories can help the plutocrats make or break markets .�
In the Goldsmiths , Part LXIII , I noted the possibilities of trouble for gold by saying � If the controlled media picks up on it , it could damage the price of gold .
Or at least , it could put some fear into the hearts of gold advocates .
This will not be good for the price of gold .�
The point I was making is that while there must be some concern over this development , there is a good chance that the controlled media would lead the way if the manipulators plan on making a world wide push to demonetize gold at this time .
The importance of this course is that it would give gold advocates a clue if the Cabal is making a push down on gold .
Frankly , I think that one day the Cabal will use this SDR threat to try to make a big downsize on gold .
And my take was that if they do that you can bank on it that the controlled media , and especially Bloomberg , will float a series of stories telling why the SDR thing is the answer for the global economy .
Since there is also a motion to bring about more IMF gold sales and since this thing has to have the approvals of certain governments ( like the US Congress ) , there is a chance that the manipulators will tie the SDR thing together with IMF gold sales to try to prove that gold is not needed in national monetary reserves .
While it is conceivable that the manipulators might be able to swing one or both of these things without extensive coverage from the controlled media , I doubt it .
From my perspective they will have to have some media coverage to convince the nation of the propriety of either or both of these proposals .
If the media starts playing up and reporting stories in support of either of these options , this will likely be a powerful clue that the manipulators are in the process of bringing one of both of these proposals to a head .
Of course , they could gain some temporary traction with extensive favorable coverage from the controlled media .
And they might get some sharp downturns in the price of gold .
But as I also have noted , I can�t fathom that such a move will totally succeed in the short term .
I anticipate and am convinced that it will take WWIII to bring on world government and a one world money system before we see any major changes in gold .
Undoubtedly , a breakout of any type of war will benefit the price of gold �that is until world government and a one world currency is on top of us .
Then , I am more fearful of a call in of gold than other courses .
Some Illustrations
Some weeks ago , I read a fascinating story on how to rig various stocks traded on US exchanges .
This story , by Tocque Deville on Jim Cramer Uses CNBC to Manipulate Stocks , as appearing at OpEdNews.com , had these intriguing words from Cramer himself : � We had it down to a science in 1992 : my wife would pick stocks that technically looked ready to go up , or she would keep track of merchandise to see what was down to tag ends .
She would then generate a list of stocks that could move quickly on good news .
Jeff would then go to work calling the companies to try to find anything good we could say about them .
I would call the analysts to see if they were hearing anything .
� When we found a stock that looked ready technically to break out , or where the supply had been mopped up , and Jeff found something positive at the company , and I knew the analyst community did n't know anything positive , we would load up with call options and common stock and then give the good news to our favorite analysts who liked the stock so they could go do their promotion .
That would get the buzz going and we would then be able to liquidate the position into the buzz for a handsome profit .�
( Confessions of a Street Addict , page 61 ) .
The article involved went on to offer the essence of Cramer 's big secret�as follows :
� He figured out early that the way to make money betting on stocks was to rig the game - control the news and you control a stock 's value . �
This should be obvious in today�s mesmerized and zombiized population where people can�t think beyond what ABC , CBS , NBC , CNN or Bloomberg tell them .
The controlled media provides the impetus for public opinion , elects politicians and assists the manipulators in their control of the financial markets .
The above remark is great in describing Cramer�s big secret �you can rig the game by controlling the news .
Of course , I have known for years now that the plutocrats controlled the news -- not only to elect the prostitute politicians , but to achieve about whatever they want to in the modern United States .
In their capacity to control and make profits from the financial markets , they have taken control of the media and use their expertise to feed the people a diet of slanted , twisted news to achieve their own objectives .
In Understanding Money and War�VII ( at www.anlysis-news.com ) , I wrote about the rise to power of Adolf Schicklgruber ( alias Hitler ) in Germany in the 1930s through the money and help of the Rothschild Cabal .
Yes it was the Rothschilds who put Adolf into power just like they selected and elected FDR in the US .
This Understanding Money and War presentation quotes writer David Icke who noted the Rothschild media support by saying � The Rothschilds also owned the German news agencies during both World Wars and thus controlled the flow of �information� to Germans and the outside world .�
At this same analysis - news website , there is a presentation of Bush and the Farmers which tells how Bush worked with the manipulators to crash the US grain markets in 2008 ( along with gold and other commodities ) .
The essence of this report was that Bush approved the sale of the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust Fund wheat on the open market to crash the price of wheat .
Bush used the excuse that he wanted to send $ 200 million in cash to certain impoverished Third World nations so that they could use the money to buy food .
So he sold the wheat on the open market .
By the way , I dug this story out of an AGweb.com website .
None of the controlled media even bothered to report it .
It was a no news item .
The tragedy about this whole scenario is that the Bill Emerson Trust was designed to help both starving people in the Third World and US farmers .
As Bush manipulated it , it will help Third World dictators and hurt the US farmers and taxpayers .
Of course , many social liberals will jump up and down and applaud Bush as a great humanitarian .
The truth is that Bush and his plutocratic bosses neither care one whit about the starving Third World or the people of the US .
The whole name of the game was to crash the US grain market and defraud US farmers ( which is precisely what they did ) .
More on How They Did it in 2008
In the Goldsmiths , Part VII , published in early Sep 2008 by goldseek.com , I noted : � Likewise , it should not take a genius to see at once how well the media supports the manipulators whenever they are busy striking things or boosting items in the financial markets .
The media , and particularly Bloomberg , Dow - Jones and the like , are notorious for slanting , twisting , distorting and outright lying about things in order to help the plutocrat manipulators .
� On many occasions , we have seen Bloomberg report bad news as good news to support the dollar and US stock markets .
They do this regularly whenever they report something as an improvement because the data being reported is not as bad as the forecasters had it or maybe because the reported data one month is not as bad as it was the prior month ( never mind that it might be one of the worse reports in history or certainly one of the worse in the last ten years or so ) .
� Take the situation with the floods in the mid west in the early summer .
The media hyped this thing up to being absurd ( all the while the big banks were selling grain options and futures contracts hand over fist ) .
Well , after pulling in the suckers , as much as possible , the manipulators reversed course in mid July and starting crashing grains .
Now , the media is flooding the news ways with the biggest stories of all about the US corn , wheat and bean harvests being some of the greatest in history .
� Just a few weeks ago ( in July , during the US floods ) , we read about the drought in Australia and prospects for a very poor harvest ( which has been on - going for years now ) .
Yet , in August , we read incredible reports about Australian wheat being up with a 90 % increase ( despite the fact that much Australian wheat was just then in the planting stage since it is in the Southern Hemisphere with its seasons reversed from ours ) .
� Do you actually believe that the Australian wheat could change that much in five weeks and especially so since all of it was not yet even in the ground ?
Or alternatively , would you allow that fat cat manipulations in the US in July and August might have something to do with the media reports ?�
As a follow - up to this thing from Australia , the Australian wheat harvest in 2008 was hurt again by the on - going drought .
So all the hype about a super harvest fell to the wayside .
It was all hype to convince the financial markets that wheat was overpriced in the summer of 2008 .
Back to the SDRs
In the context of the Chinese words on SDRs , I said in the above quotations from the Goldsmiths , Parts LVIII and LXIII , that we would have to watch the controlled media to get a clue that the Cabal will use the SDR thing / the sale of IMF gold to crash gold .
Bloomberg is part of the Cabal and might lead the way on this thing .
While the media doesn�t lead the way on all things , it is sometimes very important on some issues .
Therefore , when the media is hopping on something like the alleged IMF gold sales / SDR replacing gold , it could be an indicator of what the plutocrats are planning for gold in the coming days .

Han sido los tres secuestros de sus hermanos en menos de 10 días lo que obligó a José de Jesús Esparza , originario de Cuencamé , Durango , a darles refugio en San Antonio Texas , donde él radica , a su madre María de los Ángeles Chairez y a sus tres sobrinos .
“ Si no lo estuviera viviendo , de verdad pensaría que estoy contando una película .
El 30 de enero unos encapuchados secuestran a uno de mis hermanos y el 6 de febrero a otros dos ; es imposible ” , dice José de Jesús Esparza , vía telefónica .
Estas fechas marcaron la vida de José de Jesús y anularon sus intenciones de regresar a México por la crisis financiera de Estados Unidos .
“ Nunca regresaré a Cuencamé , pero exijo saber qué ha pasado con mis hermanos Pablo Aníbal , José Manuel y Yovana ” .
Para José de Jesús , que ha vivido esta pesadilla desde San Antonio , la inacción de las autoridades locales de Durango y federales ante el seguimiento del crimen organizado ha rebasado fronteras y ha creado un muro del silencio desde el 11 de febrero pasado , fecha en la que levantó la denuncia formal por el secuestro de sus hermanos .
José de Jesús relata que las propias autoridades de Cuancamé han expresado su temor ante los acontecimientos que en los últimos meses se han registrado .
El mismo 30 de enero , cuando secuestraron a su primer hermano , habían sido raptadas otras cuatro personas en el municipio vecino de Peñón Blanco .
La característica común de los secuestrados ha sido simple : personas trabajadoras que tenían pequeños negocios en Cuencamé .
Ante el primer secuestro , la respuesta inmediata de la presidenta municipal de Cuancamé , Rocío Patricia Sotelo , fue visitar a la madre de José de Jesús para calmarla .
“ Le dijo que no tenía nada de qué preocuparse , pues se trataba de negociantes y que lo único que se podía hacer era esperar a saber cuáles eran sus exigencias ” .
Pasaron siete días y esa llamada nunca llegó .
Sin embargo , lo que sí llegó una vez más fue el terror a la familia , pues el 6 de febrero un grupo de hombres armados y embozados irrumpió en un negocio familiar de venta de cervezas , llevándose a sus hermanos Pablo Aníbal y Yovana .
“ Aproximadamente a las 11:00 de la noche estos sujetos , encapuchados , tiraron a toda la clientela al piso .
Golpearon brutalmente y torturaron con toques eléctricos al trabajador del billar .
Finalmente , después de golpearlos , se llevaron secuestrados a mis hermanos ” .
Al enterarse de lo sucedido , el resto de la familia , la madre de José de Jesús , su abuela de 95 años y los niños , corrieron a refugiarse a la alcaldía , donde les impidieron la entrada y les dijeron que no les podían proteger , porque la misma autoridad tenía mucho miedo de los criminales .
Ese mismo día , desde San Antonio , José de Jesús hizo lo imposible para que su mamá y sus sobrinos se refugiaran con él y estuvieran a salvo de cualquier agresión .
Hasta hoy , a pesar de que José de Jesús envía correos electrónicos y llama diariamente por teléfono a las autoridades , no ha recibido respuesta de las autoridades .
“ Las autoridades han llegado al colmo ” , señala .
En una llamada sostenida con la Procuraduría General de la República ( PGR ) , personal de la institución le dijo que por su propia seguridad se presentara en las instalaciones de la Procuraduría General de la República para recibir información del caso , porque vía telefónica no era posible hacerlo .
José ha decidido no viajar a México .
No por falta de interés para saber qué ha pasado con sus hermanos , sino porque no confía en que su presencia en las instalaciones de la PGR agilice las investigaciones .
“ Llevo más de 19 días lidiando con autoridades que simplemente se echan la bolita ” .

71 % of Americans are in favor of an investigation into the possible misuse of the Department of Justice by the Bush administration according to a Gallup poll released yesterday .
The Bush administration has been accused of using the Department of Justice for political maneuvering including the firing of U.S. attorneys and the investigation and conviction of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , a Democrat .
Of the 71 % who believe Bush should be investigated , 41 % want a criminal investigation while 30 % are in favor of investigation by an independent panel .
71 % is a very high percentage of the American population .
Though President Obama has shown little inclination to get involved in an investigation and possible prosecution of officials in the Bush administration , it seems the nation wants the former President Bush to be held accountable for his crimes .
Another 63 % of Americans are in favor of investigating the Bush administration in connection with illegal wiretapping .
62 % of Americans believe the Bush administration should be investigated for the use of torture .
As a nation that holds its citizens accountable for their actions , we should not let the President and those who acted with him , go unpunished for activities that would see the average American citizen in prison for committing torture , illegal wire - tapping or misuse of the Justice Department .
A House committee led by Representative John Conyers has already issued subpoenas of former Bush administration officials .
Earlier this week , Senator Patrick Leahy announced he would like to see a special commission to investigate the Bush administration for alleged torture of terrorist suspects and the abuse of the Department of Justice .
The persecution of Democratic Governor Don Siegelman has been widely criticized by U.S. attorneys across the nation , both Democrats and Republicans and there is mounting evidence of political maneuvering aided by Karl Rove in a falsely created investigation and subsequent prosecution of the former Alabama Governor .
There is also a great deal of evidence in the case against the Bush administration for its use of torture as the former Vice - President has all but bragged about his role in the use of illegal torture .
Though the new Obama administration does n’t appear to be in a hurry to investigate crimes committed by the Bush administration , Americans are keen to see the former President investigated .
President George W Bush was sworn to uphold the constitution of the United States but did not .
He ignored Geneva conventions that America has held to since WWII .
To simply give a pass to those who break our nation ’s laws and rules sets a frightening precedent .
If officials in the Bush administration should n’t be held accountable for their crimes , then who should be ?

( CNN ) --
A young blogger arrested in Iran for allegedly insulting supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an Internet posting has died in prison , his attorney said Friday .
The blogger had been jailed for allegedly insulting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an internet posting .
Attorney Mohammad Ali Dadkhah said Omid Mir Sayafi , reported to be in his 20s , died in Evin prison , which is located in Tehran and known for its wing that holds political prisoners .
Dadkhah said a fellow inmate , Dr. Hessam Firouzi , called him Wednesday night with the news -- and said he believed Sayafi would have lived if he received proper medical care .
Dadkhah said Firouzi , an imprisoned human - rights activist , said that he carried a semi-conscious Sayafi to a prison doctor but that he did n't receive the care he needed .
" It was Dr. Firouzi 's opinion that if he would 've received proper medical attention , he would not have died , " Dadkhah said .
He said Sayafi was buried on Thursday and that his calls to the prison asking for an explanation have not been returned .
Dadkhah said Sayafi " sounded OK " at about 2 p.m. on Wednesday when he last spoke to him by telephone .
He said the blogger asked for a book about Nowruz , the Iranian New Year , which begins Friday .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , which advocates for activists in the country , quoted Firouzi on its Web site as saying Sayafi suffered from depression and had taken extra doses of medication on Wednesday .
The group blamed Iran 's government for unsafe conditions in its prisons .
" Iranian leaders have relegated the administration of the prison system to a group of incompetent and cruel officials who are showing their utter disregard for human life , " said Hadi Ghaemi , spokesman for the campaign .
" If the authorities do not move quickly to hold negligent officials responsible , they are reinforcing impunity and the lack of accountability . "
Sayafi was first arrested in April , then released for 41 days before being arrested again .
He was sentenced to 2 ½ years in prison for comments on a blog that his lawyer argued was intended only for a few friends to read .

Progressive Corporatism and the Resistance By Arnold Kling
Glenn Reynolds comments on the plight of Freddie Mac as reported in today ’s Washington Post .
[ The Post reports ]
When Freddie Mac ’s executives concluded a few weeks ago that they had to disclose that the government ’s management of the McLean company was undermining its profitability and would cost it tens of billions of dollars , the firm ’s regulator urged it not to do so , according to several sources familiar with the matter .
Freddie Mac executives refused to bend .
The clash grew so severe that they threatened to go to the Securities and Exchange Commission , which oversees corporate disclosures , to secure a ruling that the regulator ’s request was out of line .
The company ’s regulator backed down , the sources said .
Remember , when a private company wants to cover up billions in losses and the responsibility for them , that ’s a major scandal and proof of the evils of capitalism .
But when a government regulator does the same thing , hat ’s just how people are , these things happen , whaddyagonnado …
Read the whole thing .
You can see how the U.S is going to function under what I call Progressive Corporatism .
Another post you should read is one that was written last month by Pete Boettke .
Perhaps a more timely book to read than even Hayek would be Mises ’s Omnipotent Government and in particular the sections on the German economic model of national socialist policy .
Our current policy path seems more along those lines , [ rather than ] outright expropriation of private property by the government .
In the German model , Mises argued , private ownership was nominally maintained and the appearance of normal prices , wages and markets was kept .
But in reality entrepreneurs were replaced by government - appointed shop managers , and the government dictated how the “ capitalist ” must use his funds and what wages workers must work for .
Government effectively controlled production and distribution .
At this point , I think that the relevant political divide is not between the two parties .
It is between the forces of Progressive Corporatism and the ( much smaller ) forces of The Resistance .
Boettke quotes a woman who resisted the Nazis and ultimately was executed .
Sophie Scholl wrote the following about the damage to the German people caused by fascism : “ The real damage is done by those millions who want to ‘ survive . ’
The honest men who just want to be left in peace .
Those who do n’t want their little lives disturbed by anything bigger than themselves .
Those with no sides and no causes .
Those who wo n’t take measure of their own strength , for fear of antagonizing their own weakness .
Those who do n’t like to make waves or enemies .
Those for whom freedom , honour , truth , and principles are only literature .
Those who live small , mate small , die small .
It ’s the reductionist approach to life : if you keep it small , you ’ll keep it under control .
If you do n’t make any noise , the bogeyman wo n’t find you .
But it ’s all an illusion , because they die too , those people who roll up their spirits into tiny little balls so as to be safe .
Safe ?!
From what ?
Life is always on the edge of death ; narrow streets lead to the same place as wide avenues , and a little candle burns itself out just like a flaming torch does .
I choose my own way to burn . ”
For now , I think that mockery is the most useful form of resistance .
The Weak Force
One of the four fundamental forces , the weak interaction involves the exchange of the intermediate vector bosons , the W and the Z .
Since the mass of these particles is on the order of 80 GeV , the uncertainty principle dictates a range of about 10 - 18 meters which is about 0.1 % of the diameter of a proton .
The weak interaction changes one flavor of quark into another .
It is crucial to the structure of the universe in that 1 .
The sun would not burn without it since the weak interaction causes the transmutation p -> n so that deuterium can form and deuterium fusion can take place .
2 . It is necessary for the buildup of heavy nuclei .
The role of the weak force in the transmutation of quarks makes it the interaction involved in many decays of nuclear particles which require a change of a quark from one flavor to another .
It was in radioactive decay such as beta decay that the existence of the weak interaction was first revealed .
The weak interaction is the only process in which a quark can change to another quark , or a lepton to another lepton - the so - called " flavor changes " .
" By emitting a W boson one kind of fermion can change into another kind : a down quark can spit out a W - and change into an up quark .
..
None of the other forces can change the identity of the particles they interact with . " ( Carroll )
The discovery of the W and Z particles in 1983 was hailed as a confirmation of the theories which connect the weak force to the electromagnetic force in electroweak unification .
The weak interaction acts between both quarks and leptons , whereas the strong force does not act between leptons .
" Leptons have no color , so they do not participate in the strong interactions ; neutrinos have no charge , so they experience no electromagnetic forces ; but all of them join in the weak interactions . " ( Griffiths ) Show Feynmann diagrams

CONCERNS about Harley ’s future grew after the departures of its two top executives were announced .
In December , Jim Ziemer , 59 , said he planned to retire as C.E.O. this year .
In early January , the company announced that Saiyid Naqvi , the head of the finance unit , was resigning after less than two years at Harley .
Since September , Harley ’s stock has plunged 70 percent , to under $ 13 , compared with a 36 percent decline for the Standard & Poor ’s 500 .
Like many cash - tight companies , Harley , based in Milwaukee , is finding that borrowing is difficult  and expensive .
In early February , Harley announced that Berkshire Hathaway , Warren E. Buffett ’s company , would buy $ 300 million of its unsecured debt .
( Harley reported total debt of $ 3.9 billion last year , more than double what it held in 2007 . )
In exchange for his good name and millions , Mr. Buffett demanded 15 percent interest from Harley on his investment ( similar to deals he received from Goldman Sachs and General Electric when he invested in those companies last fall ) .

Harley - Davidson
Harley ’s largest investor , Davis Selected Advisers , matched Mr. Buffett ’s deal , pumping $ 300 million more into the company , also at 15 percent interest .
But even $ 600 million is n’t enough to enable the financial arm to continue making loans through year - end .
Company executives announced that the finance unit needed a total of $ 1 billion for loans .
While that ’s one - third lower than last year , the executives are bracing for plummeting sales and continued frozen securities markets .
Congress included the motorcycle industry in a Treasury Department program intended to unclog financial markets by lending to investors buying securities backed by mortgages and other types of loans .
It was uncertain , however , how much Harley would receive  and when  making this an unreliable source of capital .
And while Mr. Bergmann said he had met with several banks since doing the Berkshire and Davis deals , he had not yet announced any new loans .
Harley ’s road has perhaps never looked so hazardous .
If the company ca n’t obtain new sources of money to offer loans to customers , they will have to try to borrow elsewhere .
But in this credit crisis , qualifying for a loan is n’t easy .
A lack of credit would probably depress bike sales even further , which in turn would make it harder for Harley to repay Berkshire and Davis .
I saw Watchmen Friday night , and thought it was very good , if not great .
Since then , I 've been trying to figure out why I so badly wanted to see it in the first place .
I was a huge comic book geek in the mid ' 80s , and bought and devoured each issue of the Moore - Gibbons masterpiece as soon as it hit the stands .
The comic book side of my geekiness has waned considerably in the last two decades , but I 've read Watchmen so many times it 's embedded in my brain .
Leading up to the film 's debut , I 'd been watching every trailer , reading every review ( even ones from people who obviously do n't know what they 're talking about ) , even downloading the iPhone app .
This was a movie I was going to see as soon as I could , and I was thrilled that my recovery from surgery was going well enough that I could handle a trip to the theater on opening day .
If you 're as big a fan of the original graphic novel as I am , I 'm willing to bet you felt the same way : elated that the movie was supposed to be remarkably faithful to the source material , and anxious to see for yourself .
The question is , then , why ?
Without this movie , Watchmen was pure — a groundbreaking , iconoclastic event in comic book history .
It was a unique , brilliant piece of work that needed no embellishment .
No matter how good a movie was made from it , then , it could n't really improve upon the original — so why have so many people tried to make it ?
And why did all these fans of the original , including me , want so very badly to go see it ?
Is it just that we wanted to see if it was possible to make a good film out of something that 's been called " unfilmable " so many times ?
Did we just want the chance to flex our critical muscles by picking apart the things we thought did n't work ?
Or did we just want the opportunity to immerse ourselves in the world of Watchmen without having to take the time to reread the graphic novel ?
I 've pondered this question before , especially with really faithful adaptations .
I disliked the first two Harry Potter movies , for instance , because they were too faithful to the books .
I felt that they added absolutely nothing to the source material , and moreover had less content due to time restrictions , and were therefore completely pointless .
I liked the other three movies ( thus far ) better , because I thought the directors took the source material and ran with it , rather than treating it as a bible .
In general , I like adaptations that find something different to do with the story .
That 's why Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were so good : they took the stories you already knew and twisted them into something recognizable but different enough to grab your interest and hold it .
It does n't always work as well as that , as anyone who 's seen Spider - Man 3 can attest , but when it works it can be phenomenal .
But then I return to Watchmen .
Unlike nearly every other adaptation , this one has source material considered sacrosanct by its fans .
Every difference between the movie and the graphic novel has already been identified , analyzed , and criticized ( not necessarily negatively ) .
We fans have been fairly generous in doling out praise for the things they got right — in my case , I 've been marvelling at how amazing a job Jackie Earle Haley did as Rorschach .
But even that praise is tempered by the fact that we started out with a set limit in our minds of how good anything could be , because we venerate the source material so .
The director and actors never had a chance to do better than Moore and Gibbons did ; the best they could hope for was to do as well , and nobody would dare give them that much praise lightly .
So , please , help me understand :
What was really the point ?
Was it really just laziness , because the nearly - three hours of the movie is still a lot less time than it takes to read the graphic novel ?
Why make an adaptation when you know nobody will ever think of it as better than the original ?
And why go see it ?
I went opening night , and enjoyed myself , and I 'm not really sure I know why .

Hey there GAS readers !
AskTheAdmin here guest posting on how to recover YOUR Windows password .
This is not meant as a how - to hack your friend , girlfriend , dog or lover ’s computer , but as a way to get you back into your Windows machine as a last resort .
If you have another username and password on this machine , use that .
If you can have your administrator reset it for you – do that .
But when all else fails there is always a back door !
First we will go over how to recover your password from a Windows XP / Vista/2000/2003 / NT machine .
I have heard that it also works on Server 2008 but I have not had a chance to test it for myself .
You have to have physical access to the machine and be able to boot to a CD or Floppy drive .
You also have to be able to download and burn the boot disk – meaning you will need another computer to get you into the machine whose password you somehow cannot remember .
So if you ’ve warped your brain trying to remember that password and it just does n’t come back to you , then you are ready to visit this website :
That is the home of the infamous Offline NT Password & Registry Editor .
I have been using this guy for years now and it has always gotten me out of trouble .
I ’ve had plenty of late nights doing server rollouts , and in the morning , one machine ’s password just seemed to elude me … but I digress .
So go and download yourself the latest version , which was 080802 at the time of this article .
You can grab either the CD or Floppy image from the download page here .
Once you have your image , you will need to burn it to a CD or write it to a floppy disk .
Remember , whatever format you create , you need to be able to boot to it on the machine in question .
The CD download is a zip file containing a single ISO file .
You will need a burning tool to burn this to disk .
You can use Nero , ECDC or any of the free ISO burners like Free Iso Burner .
The floppy zip file contains three files – a BIN , a BAT , and an EXE .
You need to extract all three , then run the BAT file with a empty formatted floppy in the drive .
Now that we have created our rescue tool , we need to restart the machine and boot on the CD or floppy .
We also have to make sure the computer ’s bios is set to check the drives for a bootable source .
This can normally be done by pressing F2 ( On Dell systems ) or another key during boot .
It is usually displayed on the screen right after the BIOS logo .
When your machine recognizes the boot CD , it might ask you to press any key to boot on it .
Normally , the floppy disk will boot without intervention .
This is when the magic starts .
You will see a small Linux - like operating system booting off of your media .
This is called a “ LIVE ” operating system .
This is how we will be able to access and modify your password on the partition .
NOTE : If you are on a Windows XP machine or newer , the user for which you will be changing the password cannot have any EFS encrypted files in his profile because they will become unreadable after the procedure … or at least until you can remember the original password .
But having said that , let ’s go change your password !
We will just hit enter to continue the booting process .
This command prompt is there in case you need to load additional drivers to support your installation – this is usually not necessary , and 9 times out of 10 , we just boot into our Linux environment .
First , we need to tell the program where our Windows installation is .
Let ’s just hit “ l ” to show probable NTFS partitions .
Next , it will return a prompt if it finds multiple installations .
If you only have one installation , you will see something like the following screen .
In this case just hit enter to accept the default registry location .
Next , it will ask us what we want to do .
We want access to our machine !
We will choose 1 from this menu to allow us to recover or remove a password .
We can also unlock accounts using this option .
Then , we will select 1 again to go to the password reset option as seen below
Now we will see all the user accounts on our windows installation .
We will use the guest account in this instance and we will be BLANKING the password instead of changing it .
This almost always works whereas changing the password does not always .
So take it from me – just use a blank password and change it when you get back into the system !
The less chances of failure , the better .
Type Guest and hit enter .
Hit 1 to blank the password , 2 to edit it , and 3 to promote the user to the “ administrator ” level .
Option 4 will unlock a locked account .
You hit 1 and your account ’s password is now blank .
Do n’t go restarting the computer yet though !
We need to write the modifications back to the NTFS partition .
At this point the changes are in memory but have not been applied .
Back out of the menus .
I believe it is “ ! ” then “ Q ” to quit .
You will then be prompted to write the changes back to the partition .
Write your changes , reboot your system , log into your Windows installation with a blank password and GO CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING YOU WILL REMEMBER !
Do you have a better way of doing this ?
Another tool or method ?
Well then share it with our readers in the comments !
If we were to get lost in Alexander Jansson 's world it would be a little creepy but a whole lot of fun .

Last week I let loose my thoughts on America ’s culture war , specifically how Republicans are enslaved to the notion that any money going to the arts is money unwisely spent , that nothing good can come of the humanities .
It seems that column got blogger ( and occasional Splice Today contributor ) Robert Stacy McCain rather upset .
In a post titled “ Andrew Sargus Klein is an arrogant elitist douchebag , ” he lets the spittle fly ( emphasis added ) :
Listen up , punk : I majored in drama and minored in art and managed to squeeze in two semesters of music theory along the way .
Right now , I 've got a day gig as a documentary film editor .
I 've got more culture in the tip of my pinkie than you 've got in your entire swinish soul .
So do n't you tell me about my " knee - jerk reaction . "
Klein gives us a splendid insight into the central conceit of the liberal mind : Nothing exists -- or has existed , or ever will exist -- unless it 's funded with federal taxpayer dollars .
Therefore , to oppose federal funding for " the arts " is to be anti-art , just as opposing federal funding for public schools is to be anti-education .
Such is the shriveled state of the liberal psyche that it never even occurs to these dimwits to let people keep their own money to spend on whatever they want .
You want to renovate a theater ?
Go renovate a theater .
But do n't bring the IRS down on my back to force me to pay for your tastes in architecture .
His main point is valid .
It would take a liberal with bigger balls than me to argue that the federal government is the be-all and end - all of anything of worth in our society , and such a point deserves as swift and elegant a counter - argument as McCain can offer .
We can extend this to the government funding a renovation of a theater , too .
Let the market — and liberal wallets — dictate architectural taste .
So McCain ’s argument is valid .
What ’s unfortunate is that he ’s attacking arguments I , quite simply , do n’t make .
Let ’s take this slow , so as not to offend anyone or leave anyone behind .
McCain focuses on a single passage in my column , a summary of my disgust with conservative knee - jerk reactionism to the humanities :
The right has developed a visceral knee - jerk reaction to anything involving culture , and their " loyal opposition " stranglehold does n’t seem to be loosening anytime soon .
Bombs make jobs , but renovations and building projects and part - time jobs or anything else within a stones throw of a — gasp — opera house do not .
This is government as violent adolescent child .
Note the phrase , “ bombs make jobs . ”
Now note the 855 words that lead up to this passage .
My point — my actual , debatable point — is that , in the context of stimulating the economy , funding the arts can be as effective as , say , dropping billions on a bomber that no one — save generals and the senators of states where the thing is made — seems to support .
Now , let ’s move on toward the end of the column , a section sometimes referred to as a conclusion , to look and see if I sum up my arguments in any way :
I ’m not ultimately that upset about losing billions for the arts and humanities and education ( and science and culture ) from the stimulus package .
Straight up , there are more important things in the immediate sense .
Nor do I believe the arts and humanities will wither on the vine without a taxpayer - backed bailout .
But the sector ’s potential for growth — growth in jobs , cultural output , international respect — is undeniable .
There ’s no denying my support of arts funding to a general , tactful and useful degree .
The column leaves plenty of room for debate .
But not only does McCain completely blow his argumentative load , he feels the need to strut his cultural bona fides , as if they have anything to do whatsoever on the issues at hand .
But when I was your age , punk , I was driving a forklift in a warehouse on Atlanta 's Fulton Industrial Boulevard , saving up money to buy a P.A. rig for my rock band .
So exactly what right do you have to lecture me about " culture " ?
I 've put my own sweat into culture , pal .
This is Christians and lions territory .
These are “ unzip your fly and pull out your B.A. that has nothing to do with your current profession ” waters .
McCain quotes an old article of mine from my college newspaper days — again , the excerpt has nothing to do with either my original column or McCain ’s response ; it ’s a bit of whining over the lack of political art at my former campus .
He fails to note the irony in the fact that it ’s a fine arts column , written by the paper ’s fine arts editor .
What he does n’t know ( though given his propensity to snoop through years - old campus writing , I ’m glad I ’ve always had to - the - hilt privacy settings on Facebook ) is that I was managing arts editor for two years ; that I majored in art history and creative writing ; I wrote , directed and acted in plays ; and played in a blues band for years .
So if he wants to have a meaningless “ I love the arts more than you ! ” pissing contest , then McCain and I now have our all - important college extracurriculars on the table .
But McCain is enjoying this ; he ’s enjoying the fact that I ’ve been forced to move out of my cave and respond to his shitbrick of a counter - argument .
That ’s the blogging life , I suppose .
This issue is a good one , and I wish we could have sparred on actual policy and politics , rather than through Googling and personal attacks .
In what must be either a deft use of cultural irony or stark evidence as to McCain ’s lack of actual cultural bona fides , he tells us toward the end of his post that his son came in the room to show him he learned how to play an Avenged Sevenfold song on the guitar .
If the former , I take my hat off to you , sir ; if the latter , I guess cultural bona fides skip a generation .
But in the spirit of dredging up some old fashioned ad hominem name - calling , I googled McCain .
Here ’s what I came up with :
So , let ’s take a look at the views and not - so - hidden agenda of one of the actual editors of the paper , specifically , assistant national editor Robert Stacy McCain , who has a habit of posting commentary on message boards and elsewhere around the Internet :
" [ T ]he media now force interracial images into the public mind and a number of perfectly rational people react to these images with an altogether natural revulsion .
The white person who does not mind transacting business with a black bank clerk may yet be averse to accepting the clerk as his sister - in - law , and THIS IS NOT RACISM , no matter what Madison Avenue , Hollywood and Washington tell us . "
Yes , you read that right : a " natural revulsion " and " THIS IS NOT RACISM . "
Well , that ’s strange .
McCain , an editor and sometimes commentator at a paper that the gay Andrew Sullivan , the African - American Thomas Sowell and other right - leaning members of minority groups are only too happy to write columns for and take cash from , believes that Abraham Lincoln was a " war criminal " who should have been tried for " treason . "
( His reasoning , he writes , is that Lincoln and the Northerners were the true racists ; something tells me–actually , studying his other comments and affiliations is what tells me–that that is not the real reason at all . )
And , um :
In his Web postings McCain has stated that Harvard president Lawrence Summers should be " persecuted and run out of town " for supporting gay rights .
He also believes that the civil rights movement directly resulted in " black criminality " because people were encouraged to break the law by getting arrested at demonstrations !
So the only real question left is , " Robert Stacy McCain : Hack witch - hunting blogger , white supremacist , or both ? "
An Avalanche of negative reaction has hit The Incline Village General Improvement District after this North Lake Tahoe , Nevada resort town voted last month to rescind health care insurance benefits to domestic partners of its employees .
According to Incline Village General Improvement District financial research , the move to take back domestic partnership benefits will only save the district about $ 1,500 in expenses , the estimated amount the district would pay through the end of the fiscal year , which ends June 30 , 2009 .
The district board will review their actions on March 11th , but whether they take action to reverse their decision is unknown .
Lez Get Real and other LGBT activists are calling for a boycott of Lake Tahoe until the district reverses this discriminatory and unnecessary position .

Iniopterygians are extinct relatives of modern ratfishes , also known as " ghost sharks " or chimaeras .
Chimaeras are obscure relatives of sharks and rays that were extensively described by Museum Curator Bashford Dean in 1906 and number about 40 species .
But in the late Paleozoic , relatives of chimaeras were relatively common in the oceans of the world with a huge diversity of shapes and sizes , and iniopterygians were a bizarre part of this radiation .
Known at first only from completely flattened fossils ( which is partially why the complete braincases described now are so stunning ) , these fishes had several unusual features : massive skulls with huge eye sockets , shark - like teeth in rows , tails with clubs , enormous pectoral fins that were dorsalized or placed almost on their backs , and bone - like spikes or hooks on the tips of their fins .
Most iniopterygians were fairly small , averaging about 6 inches in length .
The new research looked at four 3 - dimensional braincases of iniopterygians found in shales from Kansas and Oklahoma .
The specimens share several features with living ratfishes , which means that these skull features have been conserved in the group for the last 300 million years .
Complete reconstructions of these skulls were made with a CAT scan and X - ray synchrotron microtomography , and the imaging of one skull showed a dense , symmetrical object sitting within the large braincase .
This was the mineralized brain .

The specimen that included the brain was imaged as a holotomography by Paul Tafforeau and colleagues at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility .
This more powerful scan brought the brain to light in great detail .
It is a tiny ( about 1.5 mm by 7 mm in size ) , symmetrical shape that sits within a large braincase ; as in many lower vertebrates , the brains of these fish ceased to grow as their skulls continued to expand .
The brain has a large lobe for vision and an optic nerve that stretches to the correct place on the braincase ; both of these features correlate well with the large eye sockets .
The auditory section of the brain is reduced , and this information reflects observations of the inner ear in iniopterygians .
Unlike typical ear canals that regulate orientation and balance with three big loops , the ear canals in this extinct group are all pulled into a horizontal plane .
This means that the fish could detect side to side movements , but not up and down .
" There is nothing like this known today ; it is really bizarre , " says Maisey .
" But now that we know that brains might be preserved in such ancient fossils , we can start looking for others .
We are limited in information about early vertebrate brains , and the evolution of the brain lies at the core of vertebrate history . "

Pradel agrees and will next look for possible brains of spiny rayed fish found in the same fossil beds from Kansas , Oklahoma , and Texas .
" This fossilized brain allows for real paleo - neuroanatomical studies of fossil vertebrates , " he says .
" Now that we have fossilized soft tissue in addition to bone , we can see that there is no general correspondence between the morphology of the brain and that of the endocranial cavity and that past paleo - neuroanatomical studies must be taken with caution . "
In addition to Pradel , Maisey , and Tafforeau , coauthors on this paper include Philippe Janvier and Didier Geffard - Kuriyama of the Muséum National d'Historie Naturelle in Paris , and Max Langer and Peter Cloetens of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble .

Michelle and Mark Colley , who died in the blaze along with their son Louis , on their wedding day in July 2004
Neighbours said they could see heavily - pregnant Michelle at an upstairs window , screaming ' please save my kids ' - but police said they had to wait for firemen to arrive .
Family friend David Davis , 38 , said : ' It was the most harrowing thing I have ever seen .
' Michelle was at the bedroom window and we wanted to help but the police were pushing us back and not allowing us near .
' We were willing to risk our own lives to save those children but the police just would n't let us - and there was no way they were going to try themselves .
Flowers and teddy bears placed outside the home .
Mark and Michelle Colley died alongside their three - year - old son in the blaze , their five - year - old daughter has now also died
Neil Cotterill : People were shouting to bring ladders
' Tempers were running high but the police were saying we have to wait for the fire brigade because of health and safety rules . '
He added : ' When a family is burning to death in front of your eyes , rules should go out of the window - especially when children are involved . '
Neil Cotterill said he heard another neighbour shouting for people to bring ladders .
' We could have helped , ' he said .
The fire broke out shortly after midnight on the ground floor of the family 's three - bedroom terraced home in Highfields , near Doncaster .
Mrs Colley , 25 , who was expecting her third child in a fortnight , and her husband had spent a quiet evening at home before going to bed .
They were woken by the fire and a 999 call was made at 12.26 am .
Police were the first to arrive .
Mr Davis said : ' There were four or five officers .
We heard the sirens and went across to help but they would n't let us .
' I thought the police were there to protect lives .
Years ago they would have gone inside themselves to try a rescue .
But all they seemed bothered about was health and safety rules .
' It 's unbelievable that it could happen like that .
Everybody wanted to try and help .
You can't have respect for police if they have no respect for other people 's lives .
It might have been different if it was one of their own .
' Mark and Michelle were a great couple .
A real family - they loved their kids and the kids were smashing .'
Tragedy : Firefighters were called to the house in Highfield , Doncaster , early on Monday morning
Another witness said some friends and neighbours ignored the police warnings and tried to reach the family with ladders and a hosepipe .
But again the police intervened and stopped them .
Chris Richardson , 37 , said : ' It was shocking .
I could n't believe the police were acting like that .
' One woman climbed over the garden fence and went to the house but there was a policeman at the back who stopped her . '
Firemen using breathing apparatus found Mr Colley , a DIY store supervisor , in the master bedroom with his wife .
Sophie was in another bedroom and Louis on the landing .
Witnesses said police arrived ' several minutes ' before firemen but South Yorkshire police refused to give the exact time , citing ' data protection ' rules .
Detective Superintendent Peter McGuinness said : ' I would like to commend our officers .
The Fire Brigade were only minutes away but our officers were faced with a raging fire .
They handled the incident as professionally as we would expect and then worked long into the night . '
Experts said the blaze was not suspicious .
In popular thought , disputing sodium 's link to high blood pressure is equivalent to questioning whether the earth is round .
However , some experts now believe that salt will not raise blood pressure in everyone , just in people who are " salt sensitive . "
Only 10 percent of the population is salt sensitive , according to BioMarkers by Professor William Evans and Dr. Irwin H. Rosenberg .
Of course , far more than 10 percent of us suffer from hypertension , meaning that if these experts are correct , salt intake cannot be the only factor contributing to America 's high blood pressure epidemic .
In fact , according to Gayle Reichler 's book , Active Wellness , only half the people with hypertension have high blood pressure because of their salt intake , making cutting down on the amount of salt you eat a good step toward lower blood pressure , but not a cure - all .
Scientists are still unsure why some people 's bodies respond to salt more drastically than others ; however , most theories focus on sodium 's in vivo interaction with potassium , magnesium and calcium .
In fact , some experts believe that these nutrients play more of a role in these individuals ' salt sensitivity than sodium itself .
Deficiencies in these complementary minerals may actually be the larger culprit in hypertension .
" The problem is just as likely to be too little potassium , calcium and magnesium , " emphasizes Alice Feinstein in Healing with Vitamins .
Most experts agree that you would do well to consume sodium in balance with potassium in order to maintain healthy blood pressure , but they are still unsure about how this potassium mechanism works .
Some experts believe that potassium lowers blood pressure by relaxing small blood vessels , while others think that it works by helping the body expel excess sodium and water .
Another interesting theory asserts that these people actually have hypertension because of calcium deficiency , rather than an excess of sodium .
However , as Jean Carper explains in Food : Your Miracle Medicine , proponents of this theory have multiple theories about how it might operate : " One theory is that such individuals retain water when they eat too much sodium , and that calcium acts like a natural diuretic to help kidneys release sodium and water , thus reducing blood pressure .
Another , more complex explanation is that calcium works by preventing release of the parathyroid hormone that can raise blood pressure . "
As is often the case with uncharted health territory , when it comes to the salt sensitivity explanation for hypertension , theories often pile upon theories .
This is n't a bad thing ; rather , it makes the intellectual environment ripe for new discoveries .
On the other hand , it 's important to remember that not all experts agree with the salt - sensitivity theory .
" There 's no question about it : A great number of comparative studies of people who use no salt and those who use great quantities have proved that high salt equals high blood pressure , " writes Gary Null in his Complete Guide to Health and Nutrition .
Dr. William Castelli , director of the famous Framingham Heart Study , also cites demographic studies as support for the mainstream medical viewpoint that consuming excess sodium leads to hypertension , a perspective that some naturopaths also share .
Furthermore , in Food Politics , Marion Nestle questions the ethical roots of some of the salt - sensitivity theory 's proponents , pointing out some objectionable financial backing : " ' There is reason to be concerned that lowering NaCl [ salt ] intake may have long - term metabolic risks that have not been fully identified . . . we do not have solid evidence that lower NaCl intake prospectively will prevent or control high blood pressure . "
However , the review in which this appears was funded in part by The Salt Institute , a trade association for the salt industry .
This is n't to say that all experts who believe in salt sensitivity are funded by the salt industry .
Like any theory , the salt sensitivity explanation for why some people have high blood pressure and others do n't has both its proponents and opponents .
A simple test to determine if you are low in the enzyme renin will show you whether you are salt sensitive , according to Reichler .
Of course , an even simpler way is to cut down on your sodium intake for a few months  under the care of a doctor , or preferably a naturopath  and see if your blood pressure goes down .
If your numbers go down , then you are salt sensitive ; if not , you and your naturopath must then take extra steps to learn the cause of your hypertension .
The point is , as Dr. Bernard Lamport emphasizes in Food : Your Miracle Medicine , " Everyone can not count on sodium restriction to be a panacea for high blood pressure . "
In other words , as we all know , obtaining good health requires taking a holistic approach to your body , not just making one change and hoping that it will be a cure - all .
The experts speak on salt and high blood pressure :
Not everyone is " salt sensitive "
Now salt does n't raise blood pressure in everyone , only in those whom doctors describe as " salt- sensitive . "
But if you have high blood pressure , chances are that you are salt - sensitive .
Even if you 're not , reducing your salt intake is a good idea .
Conversely , if an individual is salt sensitive , sodium restriction will have a profound effect upon modulating blood pressure .
This is an example of matching an appropriate dietary program with the right genotype .
Disease Prevention And Treatment by Life Extension Foundation , page 473
Also , if you have high blood pressure , restricting salt may help curb it especially if you are one of the one - third to one - half of those who are particularly sensitive to blood pressure boosts from sodium .
Such " salt responders " are most apt to benefit from sodium cutbacks , say most experts .
But you usually only know if you try it .
There 's even evidence that restricting sodium can depress normal blood pressure .
Food Miracle Medicine by Jean Carper , page 93
Use salt judiciously .
In most people , eating salt does not increase the risk of high blood pressure , says Dr. Katz .
But for some reason , it may affect a few .
So if you have high blood pressure , it does n't hurt to use salt judiciously -- do n't add it to foods at the table , and limit super - salty foods like chips to a once - in - a - while indulgence .
The Doctors Book of Home Remedies for Women , page 609
Too much salt is even more problematic for overweight people , says Dr. Kenney .
" If you eat a lot of sugar and fat and you gain weight , your insulin levels go up , and it's hard for the body to get rid of salt when insulin levels are high , " he explains .
" That 's probably one reason that overweight people are more likely to have high blood pressure :
They may eat the same amount of salt as anyone else , but they have more trouble getting rid of it . "
The Complete Book Of Alternative Nutrition by Selene Y Craig , page 151
Lowering sodium is important because this mineral can raise blood pressure in those who are sensitive to it .
Unlike many physicians , though , Dr. Whitaker does n't tell patients to go on low - sodium diets .
Alternative Cures by Bill Gottlieb , page 353
" Some people can tolerate more salt than others , but everybody is sensitive to too much in the diet , " he says .
" Populations like the Eskimos and Masai , who eat a high - fat diet but have no access to salt , just do n't get high blood pressure .
Their pressures are virtually the same at age 60 as they were at age 20 . "
Populations like the New Guinea Highlanders and Yanomamo Indians of South America eat a low - fat , high - carbohydrate diet -- and no salt .
In these groups , too , there 's no sign of essential hypertension , notes Dr. Kenney .
The Complete Book Of Alternative Nutrition by Selene Y Craig , page 151
Part of the answer is that putting people on low - salt diets has not had the extensive impact on reducing the health consequences of high blood pressure that scientists had expected .
Healing With Vitamins by Alice Feinstein , page 299
That does n't mean you should immediately suck on a salt shaker or pig out on pretzels , pickles , and potato chips .
Many people with mild high blood pressure can indeed control their hypertension by restricting sodium intake .
But if you do n't suffer from high blood pressure , or if you are not salt sensitive , there is little reason to deprive yourself of some of life 's little pleasures -- like a delicious cup of chicken soup and a saltine cracker .
Graedons Best Medicine by Joe Graedon & Dr Terasa Graedon , page 57
For most people who are on the Reversal Diet , moderate salt wo n't raise blood pressure , according to Dr. Ornish .
He says it 's acceptable to use a small amount of salt when you 're cooking dishes that could use a little lift .
This can even help some people stick to a very low fat diet , Dr. Ornish notes , since a little salt can make a lean entree a lot more palatable .
That 's why many of the recipes in Dr. Ornish 's books call for a small amount of salt .
The Complete Book Of Alternative Nutrition by Selene Y Craig , page 131
Too much sodium can cause high blood pressure in salt - sensitive individuals .
( Most people excrete excess salt in urine , however some people may retain salt and excess fluid .
The body must work harder to pump excess fluid , resulting in a rise in blood pressure . ) sodium is found in table salt and occurs naturally in food , and is often added to processed foods .
The American Heart Association recommends that you limit your sodium intake to 2,400 milligrams daily .
Earl Mindells Soy Miracle Earl Mindel RPH PHD , page 123
In the West , the connection between salt and hypertension has been convincing enough that many patients with high blood pressure have been forbidden to eat any but the smallest amounts of salt .
This implied that salt was somehow an enemy .
Now it is known that such restrictions were too severe -- normal person can eat all the salt he wants without harm to his blood pressure .
Perfect Health by Deepak Chopra MD , page 238
Cutting sodium intake by half will lead to a drop of 5 points ( or more ) in blood pressure in about half the people with high blood pressure , according to Dr. Kaplan .
New Foods For Healing by Selene Yeager , page 84
Salt is basically safe when used in modest amounts .
Some people with salt - sensitive , high blood pressure must avoid it .
As a factor in causing high blood pressure , it is implicated in heart disease , as well as in kidney disease .
Though salt is safe , it is unwise to consume high - salt - content foods .
Staying Healthy With Nutrition by Elson M Haas MD , page 80
Theories on salt sensitivity
You 've probably heard that consuming too much sodium can raise your blood pressure .
But you may not realize that consuming too little vitamin C , potassium , magnesium , or calcium can have the same effect .
" Blood pressure control is no longer a single - nutrient issue , " says David McCarron , M.D. , director of the National Institute of Diabetes , Digestive and Kidney Disease clinical nutrition research unit at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland .
" For some people , salt may not be the real issue at all . "
The Complete Book of Alternative Nutrition by Selene Y Craig , page 376
Just as too much salt can raise blood pressure in some people , too little of certain minerals seems to be associated with an increase in blood pressure .
Home Remedies What Works by Gale Maleskey and Brian Kaufman , page 271
Because they provide potassium and calcium , experts recommend figs for people with high blood pressure .
Both minerals , in combination with eating less sodium , keep your blood pressure under control .
Eat and Heal by the Editors of FC&A Medical Publishing , page 159
How do these nutrients regulate blood pressure ?
The exact mechanisms continue to evade researchers .
But scientists suspect that they help the body slough off excess sodium and assist in controlling the workings of the vascular system .
Everyday Health Tips by Prevention Magazine , page 70
No one really knows exactly how potassium lowers blood pressure , reports Frederick L. Brancati , M.D. , assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins , who led the study .
One theory suggests that potassium relaxes small blood vessels , while another holds that it helps the body eliminate water and salt .
Healing With Vitamins by Alice Feinstein , page 302
Like sodium and potassium , calcium and magnesium are bodily partners in the battle against high blood pressure .
Some researchers even contend that calcium and magnesium are more important than sodium and potassium in controlling blood pressure .
Calcium plays an important role in regulating heartbeat ; magnesium helps to control how blood vessels dilate .

Potassium does a balancing act with sodium , which is one reason that it 's so vital in maintaining proper blood pressure , Dr. Tobian explains .
It works with sodium but also helps to keep it in check .
During nerve transmission and muscle contraction , potassium and sodium briefly trade places across the cell membrane .
Then they swap again , returning to their original positions ready for action .
Natures Medicines by Gale Maleskey , page 277
The sodium - to - Potassium Ratio Just as important as the total potassium content of food , sodium and potassium should be consumed in the proper balance .
Too much sodium in the diet can lead to disruption of this balance .
Numerous studies have demonstrated that a low - potassium , high - sodium diet plays a major role in the development of cancer and cardiovascular disease ( heart disease , high blood pressure , strokes , etc. )
Conversely , a diet high in potassium and low in sodium is protective against these diseases and , in the case of high blood pressure , it can be therapeutic .
Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine by Michael T Murray MD Joseph L Pizzorno ND , page 529
The body uses potassium to help eliminate excess sodium , which in large amounts can cause blood pressure to rise , says Dr. Webb .
The more potassium you eat , the more sodium you lose -- and the lower your blood pressure is likely to be .
This is particularly true in people who are sensitive to salt , he says .
New Foods For Healing by Selene Yeager , page 56
Unfortunately , most people get too much sodium and barely enough potassium .
This can raise your blood pressure and your potential for fluid retention , Dr. Young says .
Natures Medicines by Gale Maleskey , page 659
Ideally , potassium intake should be greater than sodium intake and , considering that people in North America may consume as much as 18,000 mg. of sodium daily and as little as 1,500 mg.
of potassium , it is easy to see that the great amount of sodium compared to potassium could have an adverse effect on blood pressure .
Earl Mindell 's Secret Remedies by Earl Mindell RPh PhD , page 160
Today , we 've reversed the ratio , consuming much more sodium and a lot less potassium .
We average 2,300 to 6,900 milligrams of sodium daily , and some people nibble on enough salty processed foods to boost sodium intake above 20,000 milligrams a day .
We are the only nonmarine animal to eat diets so high in salt .
Primitive cultures today , where people consume diets similar to our ancient ancestors ' with ten times the potassium to sodium , have low blood pressure rates , almost no incidence of hypertension , and their blood pressures do n't rise with age as ours do .
The Origin Diet by Elizabeth Somer , page 51
Unbalanced sodium and potassium consumption .
Those who can reduce their intake of sodium compounds , including table salt , while increasing their consumption of potassium are likely to reduce their high blood pressure .
Off The Shelf Natural Health How to Use Herbs and Nutrients to Stay Well by Mark Mayell , page 190
The balance of potassium and sodium is extremely important to human health .
Numerous studies have demonstrated that a diet low in potassium and high in sodium plays a major role in the development of cardiovascular disease ( heart disease , high blood pressure , strokes ) and cancer .
Conversely , a diet high in potassium and low in sodium can help prevent these diseases ; and in the case of high blood pressure , it can be therapeutic .
Natural Alternatives To Drugs by Michael T Murray ND , page 112
In order to reduce blood pressure , sodium intake must be restricted while potassium intake is increased .
Individuals with high blood pressure should be aware of " hidden " salt in processed foods .
Although their salt intake is comparable , vegetarians generally have less hypertension and cardiovascular disease than non-vegetarians because their diet contains more potassium , complex carbohydrates , polyunsaturated fat , fiber , calcium , magnesium , and vitamins A and C. According to Dr. Cowden , regular consumption of potassium - rich fruits such as avocados , bananas , cantaloupe , honeydew melon , grapefruit , nectarines , oranges , and vegetables such as asparagus , broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower , green peas , potatoes , and squash can lower high blood pressure .
Steaming rather than boiling vegetables helps prevent vital nutrient loss .
Alternative Medicine by Burton Goldberg , page 777
Most blood pressure pills deplete body potassium , thus exacerbating the problem they are designed to solve .
By eating three servings of potatoes , oranges , or bananas per day , you can lower sodium intake about ten percent and elevate potassium levels .
Ancient Healing Secrets by Dian Dincin Buchman PHD , page 107
Excessive salt ( sodium chloride ) consumption , coupled with diminished dietary potassium , greatly stresses the kidney 's ability to maintain proper fluid volume .
As a result some people are " salt - sensitive " , in that high salt intake increases blood pressure and / or water retention .
Patients who experience more water retention during the mid-luteal phase may be especially sensitive to salt intake .
However , it is simply not a matter of reducing salt intake , as potassium intake must be simultaneously increased .
This is easily done by increasing the intake of high - potassium foods ( i.e. fruits and vegetables ) and decreasing high - sodium foods ( most processed foods ) .
Total daily sodium intake should be below 1,800 mg .
Textbook of Natural Medicine Volumes 1 - 2 by Joseph E Pizzorno and Michael T Murray , page 1507
Potassium , especially in conjunction with a low sodium intake , helps keep your blood pressure under control .
It also lessens your chances of having a stroke .
Add all that fiber , which lowers your cholesterol and reduces your risk of heart disease and stroke , and you have a tiny but potent heart helper .
Eat and Heal by the Editors of FC&A Medical Publishing , page 141
Magnesium helps maintain the potassium in the cells , but the sodium and potassium balance is as finely tuned as those of calcium and phosphorus or calcium and magnesium .
Research has found that a high - sodium diet with low potassium intake influences vascular volume and tends to elevate the blood pressure .
Then doctors may prescribe diuretics that can cause even more potassium loss , aggravating the underlying problems .
The appropriate course is to shift to natural , potassium foods and away from high - salt foods , lose weight if needed , and follow an exercise program to improve cardiovascular tone and physical stamina .
The natural diet high in fruits , vegetables , and whole grains is rich in potassium and low in sodium , helping to maintain normal blood pressure and sometimes lowering elevated blood pressure .

One of the most powerful methods of producing less stress and more energy in the body is diaphragm breathing .
A recent study has shed some light on the effect of breathing in hypertension .
Volunteers with normal blood pressure were taught how to breath very shallow .
Measurement of the amount of sodium and potassium excreted in the urine indicated that shallow breathing led to the retention of sodium in the body .
It was suggested that this breathing pattern may play a causative role in some cases of hypertension due to the retention of sodium .
Textbook of Natural Medicine Volumes 1 - 2 by Joseph E Pizzorno and Michael T Murray , page 1307
Opponents of the salt - sensitivity theory / Proponents of traditional view that excessive sodium intake leads to hypertension
The first cure most people think of for high blood pressure is to cut down on salt .
It may or may not work , depending on your individual biological makeup .
Scientists have been arguing for years over the impact of salt on high blood pressure and the debate goes on .
It 's unlikely that salt is a major cause of high blood pressure , concluded a recent Harvard report .
Still , Dr. William Castelli , director of the famed Framingham Heart Study , notes that in the few areas of the world where salt intake is low , high blood pressure is rare and does not rise with age as it does among Americans .
If you have high blood pressure , the best way to reduce or eliminate your need for medication is by improving your diet , losing weight , exercising , and decreasing your salt and alcohol intake .
Mild hypertension can be controlled by proper nutrition and exercise .
If these measures do not lower your blood pressure enough and you need medication , hydrochlorothiazide , a water pill ( see thi- azide diuretics , p. 100 ) , is the drug of choice starting with a low dose of 12.5 milligrams daily .
It also costs less than other blood pressure drugs .

Excess salt is known to be a cause of high blood pressure , ulcers and cancer of the stomach , edema , fear , cravings , kidney damage , diminished absorption of nutrients , and calcium deficiency , resulting in weakened bones , nerves , muscles , and heart .
Early signs of excess salt intake are unusual thirst , dark urine and complexion , clenched teeth , and bloodshot eyes .

No matter what its size , the " tank " of your circulatory system can become " overfilled . "
This can occur when a high - salt diet causes the body to retain excess water , so that the blood volume exceeds the amount the vessels can safely hold .
The resulting " too full " tank can create excess pressure on the entire circulatory system .
When the " tank " becomes too full or too small or both , the blood pressure rises .
If the imbalance between the size of the tank and the volume that fills it becomes too extreme , hypertension results , and the life - giving pulsation of blood pressure turns into a relentless pummeling of blood vessels everywhere in the body .
Healing Moves by Carol Krucoff and Mitchell Krucoff MD , page 210
Most processed foods contain sugar or salt .
Although moderate amounts of either of these substances are not particularly harmful for most people , the amounts of sugar and salt in your everyday diet can add up quickly if your diet is composed primarily of packaged foods .
People with high blood pressure need to be particularly cautious about their intake of salt , and may find that a diet of processed foods goes beyond the level of salt intake recommended by their doctors .

Not all experts agree on the exact role of sodium , particularly sodium chloride .
Some believe that only a quarter of those with high blood pressure are sensitive to sodium .
But others , including Dr. Kenney , think that too much sodium is dangerous for everybody , especially when it's in combination with chloride , as in salt .
The Complete Book Of Alternative Nutrition by Selene Y Craig , page 151
Cut way back on salt .
It 's well known that sodium -- found in table salt and many processed foods -- can damage the heart by raising blood pressure .
Yet the average American still consumes 6,000 mg a day -- far more than the recommended 2,400 mg .
Bottom Line Yearbook 2002 by Bottom Line Personnel , page 10
The resulting epidemic of high blood pressure should be no surprise .
All this extra sodium can damage the kidneys .
Your kidneys filter waste materials from your blood and control blood pressure .
They need the right level of sodium to function well .

Yes , we all need sodium , but most of us get too much .
Too much sodium results in potassium deficiency and even more serious problems , such as stress , hypertension , muscular weakness and fatigue , liver damage , and pancreas disease .
Of these , hypertension is the most dangerous and is in fact one of the leading killer diseases in our country today .
One out of every ten Americans may be predisposed to high blood pressure , which is rearing its ugly head even in the lives of our children .

Most people are aware that lowering sodium intake can help reduce blood pressure .
It is by no means all that you can do , but it is nonetheless important .
Sodium draws water into the blood vessels , and too much water in the artery can lead to too much pressure .
Reducing salt intake is really quite easy , and we will go into that in more detail in chapter 9 .
Eat Right Live Longer by Neal Barnard MD , page 142
Too much salt at the expense of potassium results in high blood pressure .
It also leads to edema and water retention , especially in women during the last half of their menstrual cycle .
Excessive salt intake causes kidney stress , once again deregulating the body 's natural alkaline - to - acid balance .
Salt also disturbs digestion , and has been linked to stomach cancer .
Food Swings by Barnet Meltzer MD , page 56
We know that anyone with hypertension ( high blood pressure ) should avoid salt .
They should also avoid refined sugar .
Animal studies suggest that high blood pressure may even lead to blood - sugar disorders .

Because sodium usually is in excess , potassium has a curative role .
For example , if blood pressure is high because of excessive salt intake , one of the first remedies in Western allopathic medicine is to use potassium supplements while restricting salt .

If you 're sodium - savvy and watching your blood pressure , you already know to say no thanks to foods such as chips and salty pickles .
Yet sodium appears in many foods in which you might not expect it .
Baking soda and baking powder , for instance are both sodium bicarbonate .
Dried fruit contains sodium sulfite , and ice cream often has sodium caseinate and sodium alginate .

Innumerable scientific studies have connected fat intake to heart disease and cancer , and sodium intake to high blood pressure .
Nearly 3 million children between ages six and seventeen suffer from high blood pressure .
Many children of the new millennium are overweight , hyperactive , and deficient in the nutrients they need to grow into healthy adults .

The usual symptoms of high blood pressure are dizziness , headaches , and noises or ringing in the ears .
Along with any remedy used for hypertension , the following regime is generally recommended : sufficient rest ; regular exercise ; abstinence from tobacco , coffee , and alcoholic beverages ; a low - salt diet ; minimization or , if possible , avoidance of stress - provoking situations ; and control of the cholesterol count by correct diet or other means .

High blood pressure is not an inevitable part of aging as often thought .
There are some populations in which older people have the same blood pressure as the younger ones .
Diet appears to be a big factor .
Diets of these non-acculturated societies differ from acculturated societies -- containing less sodium , simple sugars and saturated fats ( meat , butter , whole milk ) and containing more complex carbohydrates , fibers and potassium .
Exercise also plays an essential role since indigenous cultures tend to live a more rigorous and active lifestyle .

Determining whether or not you are salt sensitive
Have your pressure taken again .
You can do the opposite if you 've been avoiding salt :
Try two weeks of a diet that does include salt and see what effect , if any , it has on your blood pressure reading .
Sodium restriction " not a panacea "
The researchers stated that " the higher the oats intake , the lower the blood pressure , " regardless of other factors such as age and weight , or alcohol , sodium , or potassium intake , which are known to affect blood pressure .
According to chief researcher Michael Klag , M.D. , it is oatmeal 's high content of water - soluble fiber ( beta glu - can ) that produces the heart benefits .
A six - year study involving 22,000 middle - aged Finnish males showed that consuming as little as 3 g daily of soluble fiber ( from the beta glucan fiber component of oats , barley , or rye ) reduced the risk of death from heart disease by 27 % .
Not every one , therefore , should follow the recommendation of the American Heart Association and reduce their intake of salt .
Everyone needs to have some salt in their diet , especially those with low blood pressure .
When salt is restricted or eliminated from the diet , people tend to have more infections and bone disorders .
Feed Your Body Right by Lendon H Smith MD , page 163
The same little blue pills that can help men get in the mood for love could be remade into little pink pills that do the same thing for women , scientists now suggest .
Although evidence that significant advances have been made into drugs that help treat male sexual dysfunction can be seen in everything from television commercials to Internet spam , much less progress has been made when it comes to female sexual dysfunction .
" We were doing a fair amount of work on erectile dysfunction in men , and during lab meetings the question came up of why we were just talking about the male side , and were we not foolish to not also think about the female side , " said researcher Kyan Allahdadi , a vascular physiologist at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta .
Past research suggests " between 40 to 60 percent of women complain of some sexual dysfunction , " he added .
There have been attempts at drug treatments for female sexual dysfunctions , including hormone therapies .
Even caffeine has been shown to motivate female rats to have more frequent sex .
However , Allahdadi explained that none have completed U.S. Food and Drug Administration clinical trials yet .
Now researchers suggest that medicines employed for male sexual dysfunctions could someday address some forms of female sexual dysfunction as well .
Male erectile dysfunction is often due to inadequate blood flow to the genitals , something that drugs for it seek to boost .
It turns out that female sexual dysfunction may at times have the same roots , and thus also be treated with erectile dysfunction medicines .
Erectile dysfunction drugs such as such as Viagra ( sildenafil ) , Levitra ( vardenafil ) and Cialis ( tadalafil ) work by inhibiting a molecule known as PDE5 .
Doing so dilates blood vessels and enhances blood flow .
Allahdadi and his colleagues tested such PDE5 inhibitors on 10 male and 12 female rats .
They focused on their internal pudendal arteries , which supply blood to the penis in male rats and to the vagina and clitoris in female rats .
( The same arteries in humans provide the same functions for us . )
The researchers found that sildenafil , vardenafil and tadalafil could all dilate female and male rat internal pudendal arteries .
Although the male arteries reacted more effectively to vardenafil , the female arteries responded more strongly to sildenafil .
There have been trials of Viagra in women , but these have proved highly disappointing .
" Our findings suggest that what works in males might not work the same way in females , " Allahdadi said .
" Future research designed for females could come up with a therapy that does work . "
Although such research into sexual dysfunctions could help people have more sex , Allahdadi explained that sexual dysfunctions are often linked with more serious conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes .
" So further investigations into this could open a window into cardiovascular health as well , " he said .
" We 're just getting started in this , " Allahdadi added .
" It 's pretty exciting .
There 's a great need in the population .
I think it 's going to become a pretty hot topic . "
Allahdadi and his colleagues will present their findings at the Experimental Biology 2009 conference on April 20 .

Body Quiz : What the Parts Do
How much better off would the Blazers be had they drafted Durant instead of Oden ?
No one can fault the job that Portland GM Kevin Pritchard has done so far .
In 2005 , when he was the Blazers ’ interim coach , he reportedly advised then - GM John Nash and Steve Patterson to draft Chris Paul at # 3 , but the duo instead decided to trade the pick and ended up with Martell Webster at # 6 .
He was promoted to assistant GM in 2006 , and was involved in a series of deals that resulted in the acquisition of the draft rights of Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge .
In 2007 , he was promoted to general manager .
That summer , in addition to drafting Greg Oden , he turned Zach Randolph into a trade exception that he used to steal Rudy Fernandez from the Phoenix Suns .
Other than an ill - advised threat to sue anyone that tried to sign Darius Miles , it ’s tough to second - guess anything that Pritchard has done in Portland .
But what if he had drafted Kevin Durant instead of Greg Oden ?
How much better off would the franchise be with Durant on the roster ?
Look , I like Greg Oden and I ’m really rooting for him to bounce back from his knee problems and go on to have the NBA career he was supposed to have .
Two years ago , I advocated drafting him # 1 over Durant , though it was a tough call .
I was really impressed with how Oden handled his wrist injury early on at Ohio State and his dominating performance against Florida in the NCAA tournament .
No one could have predicted the kind of injury trouble that the big man would have , and if he had stayed healthy , he ’d probably be entrenched as a top 10 center .
( By the way , as fond as Bill Simmons is of saying that he thought Durant was the pick back then , he does n’t really pick a side in his June ’ 07 column . )
I ’m sure that after the Fernandez acquisition , Pritchard had dreams of a Roy - Fernandez - Aldridge - Oden lineup dancing in his head , so drafting a small forward was n’t a priority .
But almost three years later , it ’s clear that Durant ’s career is on a much higher trajectory than Oden’s .
Durant is averaging 26.0 points , 6.6 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game .
He is shooting almost 49 % from the field and almost 44 % from long range .
( The fact that he shot just 43 % from the field and 29 % from three - point range in his rookie season shows just how far he has come in one year . )
He has the # 17 PER in the league , which is the seventh - best amongst wings .
And he ’s been pretty durable , missing just nine games in two seasons .
Not bad for a 20 - year - old who ’s weighing in at just 215 pounds and has n’t yet reached his ideal weight .
Imagine building around a core of Durant , Roy and Aldridge .
And with the Blazers cap flexibility , they ’d have a great shot at landing Chris Bosh or Amare Stoudemire next summer .
Throw in a pass - first point guard ( Steve Blake ? ) and you ’d have one of the most dangerous lineups in the West .
The Blazers just blew out the Lakers the other night – imagine if they added Durant and Bosh to that lineup !
Moreover , Portland owner Paul Allen ( the 12th - richest American with a net worth of $ 16 billion ) would have the dough to keep that group together as long as he wanted .
When I plug a straight Durant - for - Oden swap into the ESPN Trade Machine , it shows that the Blazers ’ win total would increase by two while the Thunder ’s wins would drop by five .
Assuming those are for - the - rest - of - the - season numbers , that would equate to about nine additional Blazer wins over the course of the entire season .
They ’re projected to win 52 games at their current pace , but with Durant in the lineup that number would rise to 61 .
That would make the Blazers the fourth - best team in the NBA ( behind the Cavs , Celtics and Lakers ) and the second - best team in the West .
And that ’s without Bosh or Stoudemire .
What ’s even more amazing is the lineup Pritchard would have if he had had his way back in 2005 and the Blazers had drafted Paul .
Can you imagine a lineup of CP3 , Roy , Durant and Aldridge , with the potential to add a free agent big in 2010 ?
Granted , had Portland drafted Paul , they probably would n’t have been in a position to draft those other guys in subsequent years , but it ’s still fun to think about .
Pritchard has justifiably built a reputation for being a genius , but if Oden ca n’t get his career back on track and the Blazers can’t capitalize on all that potential , then he might be remembered for the one mistake he made in his first few years on the job .
Dampening my snickering glee at being ranked among Movements and Periods is the news that Amazon seems to be stripping the sales figures and accompanying rankings from GLBTQ books , erotica , and romance novels , particularly those with what they term “ adult content . ”
In short : someone in Amazon has utter shit for brains .
Authors such as Jaci Burton , Maya Banks , Larissa Ione and Stephanie Tyler have reported that since being stripped of their sales rankings , their titles are no longer found in searches on Amazon.com .
MetaWriter is also compiling a list of titles that have been stripped of their sales rank .
When pressed for a reason , Amazon.com ’s customer service department told YA author Mark Probst :
In consideration of our entire customer base , we exclude “ adult ” material from appearing in some searches and best seller lists .
Since these lists are generated using sales ranks , adult materials must also be excluded from that feature .
What , I ask , the fucking fuckhell ?
Many an Amazon customer is infuriated , and the #amazonfail hashtag on Twitter has pretty much become the only thing worth following .
What to do , what to do ?
It ’s time to hit ‘em where it hurts .
No , not a boycott .
When you want someone to pay attention , you hit ‘em in the PR .
It ’s Google Bomb Time !
We did it for Bill Napoli .
Now it ’s Amazon ’s turn .
As always , fuckwittery should not go unrewarded .
We propose the following entry be entered into the lexicon :
Amazon Rank amazon rank
Function : verb
Inflected Form(s ) : amazon ranked 1 .
To censor and exclude on the basis of adult content in literature ( except for Playboy , Penthouse , dogfighting and graphic novels depicting incest orgies ) .
2 . To make changes based on inconsistent applications of standards , logic and common sense .
Etymology : from 12 April 2009 removal of sales rank figures from books on Amazon.com containing sexual , erotic , romantic , gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgendered or queer content , rendering them impossible to find through basic search functions at the top of Amazon.com ’s website .
Titles stripped of their sales rankings include “ Bastard Out of Carolina , ” “ Lady Chatterly ’s Lover , ” several romance novels , GLBTQ fiction novels , YA books , and narratives about gay people .
Example of usage : “ I tried to do a report on Lady Chatterly ’s Lover for English Lit , but my teacher amazon ranked me and I got an F on grounds that it was obscene . ”
Alternate usage : “ My girlfriend wanted to preserve her virginity , and I was happy to respect that , then she amazon ranked and decided anal sex was okay . ”
Making this the top result , which is also dependent upon algorithms and shit , requires help from you savvy folks .
I ’ve created a page with the definition for “ amazon rank . ”
LINK TO http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/amazonrank with “ Amazon Rank ” as the anchor text .
The link should look like this :
Amazon Rank
This is known as Google - bombing .
Second of all : Urbandictionary.com .
We ’re creating a definition and if it ’s approved , you can vote on it to increase its prominence .
Vote early , vote often to increase the definition ’s power .
All you have to do is link to the page using these words : Amazon Rank .
The more you do it , the higher up in rank the page will go , and the more successful it will be .
One would hope .
The goal : that “ Amazon Rank ” points to the definition that underscores Amazon.com ’s shortminded censorship and inconsistent policing of what ought to be accessible to the book buying public .
ETA : As of 6:15 pm EST /2:25 pm SBTB
Time , we are number one in google results for Amazon Rank .
Holy smoke .
Behold the power of angry bookfolk , Twitter , and the interweb .
ETA : As of 7:54 pm EST , Amazon has given out a host of explanations , which I ’ve heard from Twitterers , along the lines of “ people complained ” to “ we will have more information tomorrow . ”
I smell a giant meeting in PR at Amazon HQ bright and early tomorrow .
We ’ll see what the morning brings .
But in my inbox , an email from Craig Seymour whose book , All I Could Bare , a memoir of his job as a stripper , was stripped of sales rank back in February 2009 , despite memoirs from prominent pornography actors remaining within the ranks .
So this has been creeping up insidiously , it seems , until massive delisting occurred over the last few days .
Pokes some mammoth stripper - pole sized holes in the “ we responded to customer complaints ” response .
Jane from DA has , of course has a template response letter to send , as well as links and a full - bodied explanation of why sales rank is important .
Carolyn Kellogg from the LA Times book blog also covered the story today .
We ’ll see what tomorrow brings in #amazonfail .
ETA 9:13 pm EST : Oh Noes !
It was a glitch !
One that ’s been in operation since February , according to Craig Seymour , and one that clearly should be blamed for a whole mess of other problems .

The Pirate Bay defendants may have been unsuccessful when they tried to compare their site to Google before a judge , but that did n't stop one anonymous web designer from launching The Pirate Google , a Google search gateway which tries to make the point that digital files can be accessed through Google as well .
Ars Technica scored an interview with the mysterious coder and he ( or she ) explained the site 's intention .
" The purpose of the site was simply to provoke discussion on issues such as piracy , net neutrality , and the power of the Internet as a disruptor of more traditional forms of media . "
While The Pirate Google does n't add any additional search functionality , it clearly demonstrates Google 's ability to satisfy a searcher 's thirst for torrents , both legal and otherwise .
A short mission statement on the fledgling site 's homepage reads :
This site is not affiliated with Google , it simply makes use of Google Custom Search to restrict your searches to Torrent files .
You can do this with any regular Google search by appending your query with filetype : torrent .
The intention of this site is to demonstrate the double standard that was exemplified in the recent Pirate Bay Trial .
Sites such as Google offer much the same functionality as The Pirate Bay and other Bit Torrent sites but are not targeted by media conglomerates such as the IFPI as they have the political and legal clout to defend themselves unlike these small independent sites .
Does the Pirate Google further the Pirate Bay 's cause or is it simply rehashing an already failed argument ?
Will Google be the next victim in the entertainment industry 's fight against the Internet ?

S.F. may crack down on ' flash mob ' antics SAN FRANCISCO

It 's not political , ideological or cultural , but San Francisco officials say they are seriously considering cracking down on one of the city 's most popular events in the growing " flash mob " phenomenon .
This year 's Valentine 's Day pillow fight was , quite simply , a mess .
Officials , only slightly amused , say the episode left the city holding the bag - or empty pillow case - with thousands of dollars in damage and cleanup costs due to mounds of wet , sticky feathers .
The promoters of the counterculture event , now in its fourth year , must take responsibility for future happenings or " otherwise we are going to have to find a way to shut it down , " said Lisa Seitz Gruwell of the Recreation and Park Department .
San Francisco 's pillow fight is part of an international fad , partly anarchistic , partly absurdist , in which a mob of participants suddenly materializes at a public place , engages in odd behavior and then disperses .
The events range from zombie marches to dances and pie fights , including a shaving - cream - on - paper - plate pie fight staged late Thursday afternoon at the cable car turnaround at Powell and Market streets .
They are organized via telephone text messages , Web sites like Laughingsquid.com and eatbrains.com , and just old - fashioned word - of - mouth .
They often have no identified leaders or sponsors .
A Web advertisement for this year 's pillow fight at Justin Herman Plaza said in part , " Rules : Tell Everyone you know .
...
Arrive with pillow hidden in bag .
...
Practice responsible fun and help clean up . ... "
It was the city 's biggest and longest flash mob pillow fight yet :
It drew an estimated 1,500 to 3,000 people and went on from about 6 p.m. until past midnight , according to officials .
As the crowd pounded each other with pillows , the cases split , releasing large volumes of feathers that the wind quickly spread .
And it was wet .
Intermittent rain plastered the feathers to everything they touched , forming a gray , feathery sludge that lined the lawn , the gutter , cars and buildings .
The soggy stuff clogged drains in nearby Four Embarcadero Center , flooding the Osha Thai Restaurant , said Norm Dito , a manager with Boston Properties , which owns the center .
He estimated his firm 's cleanup costs at more than $ 10,000 .
Feathers also filled the Vaillancourt Fountain and threatened to jam and burn out its pumps .
Workers had to drain the cubist fountain 's 12,000 gallons of water - it had only recently been filled - clean it out and refill it , said Dito .
The city had to dispatch two engineers to check the fountain along with a five - person crew that filled three pick - up trucks with feathers , all at a cost of more than $ 2,213 , said Dennis Kern , director of operations for the Recreation and Park Department .
" It was quite a mess , much more than we have experienced in previous years , " said Mohammed Nuru , deputy director of the Department of Public Works .
" Everywhere was feathers . "
DPW assigned three extra cleanup shifts - a total of 69 employees and an extra street sweeper truck - costing about $ 19,000 , Nuru said .
" It was really hard raking through the grass trying to get all those little feathers up , " he said .
Kern said officials want the organizers of such events to follow standard procedure : apply for a permit , pay a use fee ( at least $ 1,750 for the plaza ) and supply security , portable toilets and cleanup crews .
But he acknowledged that such conformance would be contrary to the flash mob 's decidedly decentralized , anti-bureaucratic principles .
Kern said Rec and Park does not even know how to contact the pillow fight 's anonymous organizers .
A series of e-mail and phone inquiries from The Chronicle seeking comment from pillow fight organizers went unanswered .
However , one of the pie fight organizers , who gave his name as Herbie Hatman , seemed unfazed by the concern .
Wearing a bowler hat and tuxedo and covered in shaving cream at Thursday 's event , he shrugged at the suggested rules .
" That seems like a natural response from the city , " he said .
Analysts added that the US and other nations would have to tread a fine line between ‘ punishing ’ the North for its irresponsible actions and driving it further into international isolation and a possible resumption of uranium enrichment for its nuclear weapons programme .

What is so grotesque is that Miss Hunt evidently thinks she has behaved in a perfectly reasonable way .
Miss
Thatcher had failed to recant in a manner acceptable to the BBC , which is , apparently , the self - appointed arbiter of what is appropriate behaviour .
If the Jonathan Ross affair confirmed how out of touch its executives have become from most viewers , this affair has exposed a McCarthyite world of denunciation and arbitrary punishment of those who do not hold an approved opinion .
No doubt Miss Hunt and her colleagues regarded her interview as a triumphant exposition of the progressive creed .
To many of us it was downright sinister .

BEIJING , April 5 ( Reuters ) - China urged calm and restraint on Sunday after North Korea 's launch of a rocket , which prompted condemnation from global powers and triggered an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council .
" We hope related parties stay calm and exercise restraint , appropriately deal with it and together maintain peace and stability in this region , " Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said in a statement that referred to the rocket as an " experimental communications satellite " .
" The Chinese side is willing to continue to play a constructive role , " Jiang said in the brief statement carried on the ministry 's website ( www.fmprc.gov.cn).
China , the closest North Korea has to a major ally and economic partner , kept above the diplomatic fray in the weeks leading to the launch of the rocket .
U.S. President Barack Obama said that North Korea , which tested a nuclear device in 2006 , had violated U.N. resolutions and increased its own isolation , and he urged Pyongyang to refrain from further " provocative actions " .
China is worried about the stability of North Korea given the risk of refugees flooding across its border if the impoverished state were to collapse , and analysts say Beijing is unlikely to back strong action at the United Nations against Pyongyang .

As the Senate Finance Committee reviewed Tom Daschle ’s financial records on Monday , Daschle himself apologized for “ the errors that required me to amend my tax returns . ”
But that apology did n’t turn out to be enough .
On Tuesday , Daschle withdrew his name from consideration as the Obama administration ’s Health and Human Services nominee .
Throughout all this , however , he offered no apologies for the riches he reaped quite legally by serving the interests of private health care companies .
There are plenty of things in Daschle ’s financial history that should have alarmed the White House and his former Senate colleagues a lot more than a car and driver he forgot to report to the IRS .
( Some of them are well documented by others here at Mother Jones . )
But no one seemed much concerned about such matters–a fact that in itself reveals the inherent weaknesses in President Obama ’s restrictions on former lobbyists serving in government .
Massachusetts Senator John Kerry was one of several leading Democrats who defended Daschle on the Sunday morning news shows .
Kerry declared that Daschle ’s tax issues were an “ innocent mistake ” that would not affect his ability to perform his job “ one iota . ”
Yes , it ’s probably true that being driven around in a Cadillac and not paying taxes on it wo n’t compromise Daschle ’s capabilities or independence as HHS secretary or “ health czar . ”
The same cannot be said about all the income that Daschle did report to the IRS .
As described by the New York Times :
As a politician , Mr. Daschle often struck a populist note , but his financial disclosure report shows that in the last two years , he received $ 2.1 million from a law firm , Alston & Bird ; $ 2 million in consulting fees from a private equity firm run by a major Democratic fundraiser , Leo Hindery Jr. ( which provided him with the car and driver ) ; and at least $ 220,000 for speeches to health care , pharmaceutical and insurance companies .
He also received nearly $ 100,000 from health - related companies affected by federal regulation .
Mr. Obama has instituted rules requiring former lobbyists in his administration to pledge not to deal with former clients …
As a strategic adviser to companies , Mr. Daschle did not have to register as a lobbyist , and is not technically covered by those rules .
“ He ’s never lobbied , therefore he ’s not in violation of the pledge , ” [ Press Secretary Robert ] Gibbs said .
“ The president is comfortable with Senator Daschle ’s variety of experiences and backgrounds .
It ’s why he believes he ’s best suited to the efforts to reform our health care system . ”
The Washington Post offered further details on how “ exactly how , without becoming a registered lobbyist , he made millions of dollars giving public speeches and private counsel to insurers , hospitals , realtors , farmers , energy firms and telecommunications companies with complex regulatory and legislative interests in Washington ” :
Daschle ’s expertise and insights , gleaned over 26 years in Congress , earned him more than $ 5 million over the past two years , including $ 220,000 from the health - care industry …
He also has been a trustee of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
For part of the $ 2 million he received from the law firm Alston & Bird over the past two years , Daschle also reported that he gave “ policy advice ” to United Health , a conglomerate that sells insurance , helps the government administer Medicaid , advises drug companies and physicians and dispenses prescriptions .
The 12 organizations or companies that paid Daschle speaking fees , ranging from $ 12,000 to $ 30,000 , included the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and America ’s Health Insurance Plans , an influential trade group .
The Health Industry Distributors Association , a trade association representing medical product distributors , wrote to Daschle last week to express concerns about proposed Medicare changes and reminded him of the $ 14,000 speech he delivered at its conference last year .
Daschle had pledged that for a year following his confirmation he would not have participated in any matters where “ a former client of mine is a party or represents a party . ”
But he never enumerated who all of those parties might be .
It appears , in fact , that InterMedia Advisors , the private equity firm that provided him with the car and driver , may be one of the few sources of Daschle ’s income that presented no possible conflict of interest ( although it does own a few questionable properties , including the magazines Guns & Ammo , Handgun , and Shooting Times . )
An earlier story in the New York Times illustrates just how far former officials can go without ever acquiring the status of “ registered lobbyist . ”
The Times described Daschle ’s role at the law and lobbying firm of Alston & Bird , which “ represents dozens …of pharmaceutical companies , health care providers , and trade groups for nurses and nursing homes ” :
Although not a registered lobbyist , Mr. Daschle , a South Dakota Democrat who was party leader in the Senate , provides strategic advice to the firm ’s clients about how to influence government policy or actions .
The firm ’s Web site declares , “ Our health care legislative and policy team has the significant advantage of including two former U.S. Senate majority leaders –Senators Bob Dole and Tom Daschle–both resident in our Washington office and champions of many health care issues in their Senate Finance Committee and leadership roles . ”
As examples of the firm ’s achievements the Web site lists matters involving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements , approvals of federally regulated drugs and medical products , fraud investigations , medical waste disposal , privacy and other compliance issues .
Daschle , of course , is no different from hundreds of other high - stature elected officials who use their political influence to provide what Alston & Bird calls “ significant advantage ” to private corporations dealing with the federal government .
Few of them ever become registered lobbyists — so few would be disqualified or impeded by Obama ’s pledge .
The future of health care reform depends largely on the Democrats ’ ability to stand up to the drug companies and insurance companies who drive up costs and drive down access and benefits .
If he ’d become HHS secretary and health czar , Daschle would have led this reform effort .
Personally , I was less concerned about his tax - free car rides than I was about his work on behalf of the very industries he would have been charged with reigning in for the good of the American public .

A
Time magazine story shortly after the incident notes , “ The unlikely incident confirmed all too publicly what security officials have long feared in private : the White House is vulnerable to sneak attack from the air .
‘ For years I have thought a terrorist suicide pilot could readily divert his flight from an approach to Washington to blow up the White House , ’ said Richard Helms , CIA director from 1966 to 1972 . ”
The article further notes that an attack of this type had been a concern since 1974 , when a disgruntled US Army private staged an unauthorized helicopter landing on the South Lawn .
Special communications lines were established between the Secret Service and Washington ’s National Airport control tower to the Secret Service operations center , but the line is ineffective in this case because no flight controller pays attention to the flight in time .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. researchers said on Thursday they have found a safer way to coax human skin cells into becoming powerful embryonic - like stem cells , taking a step closer to their potential use as treatments for diseases .

A team at the University of Wisconsin said they made the so - called induced pluripotent stem cells , or iPS cells , from human cells without using viruses or exotic genes , which leave behind genetic material that might pose risks if the cells were used as medical therapies .
James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin , whose study appears in the journal Science , said the finding represents the first time researchers have made human induced pluripotent stem cells without inserting potentially problematic new genes into their DNA .
Many teams are working on better ways to get ordinary skin cells to behave like embryonic stem cells , the body ’s master cells that give rise to all 220 cell types in the human body .
Scientists hope to harness the unique qualities of these cells to create new treatments for a variety of medical conditions .
Induced pluripotent stem cells promise many of the possible therapeutic benefits of embryonic stem cells without the ethics controversy because , unlike embryonic stem cells , they can be created without destroying a human embryo .
But earlier methods of making the iPS cells required the use of viruses as a vehicle , or “ vector , ” to carry genes into the cells and trigger cell reprogramming .
Thomson said the new method uses a circle of DNA called a plasmid , which carries the genes needed to transform a skin cell into an iPS cell .
NO HARMFUL GENES
Over time , the plasmid disappears naturally from the cell population , avoiding the danger posed by using viruses , which can insert harmful genes into the cells ’ genetic material .
“ That means they are less likely to form tumors , less likely to destroy the function of some important gene , ” Thomson said in a telephone interview .
Other teams have used different methods to do the same sort of thing in mouse cells , but not in human cells , said Jeremy Berg , director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences , part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health .
“ What Dr. Thomson has done for the first time in human iPS cells is created methods which do n’t involve inserting DNA into the host genome at all -- using plasmids which go into the cells but never get incorporated into the DNA , ” Berg said in a telephone interview .
Ultimately , Thomson thinks there will be several methods for creating iPS cells , and then scientists will start looking for the ones that produce the most consistent results .
Thomson said President Barack Obama ’s move earlier this month to lift Bush administration restrictions on federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research will make it easier to test the effectiveness of new iPS cells .
While they still hold promise for treatments , Thomson said some of the first benefits of iPS cells will be in testing the effects of new drugs on human tissue , rather than animals .

Kellogg 's Rice Krispies , Now with Mercury !
Let 's talk about Mercury poisoning .
We are now being told that mercury is good for us ... our children , even though for years we have been told that it causes brain damage .
Yet mercury destroys the brains neurons , and causes autism .
We should all be aware of how poisonous fluoride is by now .
Yet , Germany during the second world war used it as a way of controlling the population , and now our government is doing the same .
ADD and ADHD are caused by fluoride .
Not only this , but it reduces the IQ of our children and can cause sterility in women .
After years of accumulating in our bodies it can manifest itself in the form of unexplained aches and pains , such as fibromyalgia , a disease that was once considered an imaginary disease by doctors and has only recently been recognized as a real disease .
Surprised ?
Well , it has been well document and known by the CDC for years that fluoride was a toxic poison and still they put it into our drinking water , food .
Why ?
For the rich to stay in power they must be able to control the masses .
The only way to do that is to reduce their intelligence , to create a population of drones who can do the menial work without complaint .
The problem is , they are creating a population of idiots and children unable to live in a normal society .
More and more people are succumbing to the effects of the very controlling agents they have been using to control us .
The rest of us are controlled by fear .
Watch the video and see for yourself how easy it has been for our government to betray it 's populous .
Are you mad yet ?
Do n't get mad ... get even .
" CREATING A NATION OF ZOMBIES "
February 6th , 2009
Last month the European Commission stated its preliminary conclusion that “ Microsoft ’s tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers , undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice . ”
In my mind , there is absolutely no doubt that the statement above is correct .
Not the single smallest iota of doubt .
I ’ve been involved in building and shipping web browsers continuously since before Microsoft started developing IE , and the damage Microsoft has done to competition , innovation , and the pace of the web development itself is both glaring and ongoing .
There are separate questions of whether there is a good remedy , and what that remedy might be .
But questions regarding an appropriate remedy do not change the essential fact .
Microsoft ’s business practices have fundamentally diminished ( in fact , came very close to eliminating ) competition , choice and innovation in how people access the Internet .
Let ’s think back for a moment to the activities in question .
In the mid-1990s Microsoft began developing Internet Explorer in response to the success of the product known as Netscape Navigator .
In this period Microsoft developed a fine product ( particularly the version known as IE 4 ) .
Kudos to Microsoft for this .
Microsoft also promoted IE through activities that the US Department of Justice and the U.S. Courts determined to be illegal .
As result , Internet Explorer ended up with well over 90 % market share .
Once this happened , Microsoft stopped browser development ; even disbanding its browser team .
The product stagnated and then became a prime vector for bad actors to inject spyware onto consumers ’ computers .
There was no meaningful response or innovation from Microsoft .
Despite this , there was no effective competition from the marketplace , no commercial entities gaining success with other products .
This is not surprising — I do n’t think there has been a single example of anyone ever regaining market share from a Microsoft monopoly until Mozilla Firefox .
As it turns out , Microsoft has n’t succeeded in stamping out all competition .
Firefox has made a crack in the Microsoft monopoly .
And , given a choice , a significant part of the European Union citizens have opted to use Firefox .
This does not mean Microsoft ’s activities have n’t done significant damage , or are n’t still benefiting Microsoft in ways that reduce competition , choice and innovation .
Equally important , the success of Mozilla and Firefox does not indicate a healthy marketplace for competitive products .
Mozilla is a non-profit organization ; a worldwide movement of people who strive to build the Internet we want to live in .
I am convinced that we could not have been , and will not be , successful except as a public benefit organization living outside the commercial motivations .
And I certainly hope that neither the EU nor any other government expects to maintain a healthy Internet ecosystem based on non-profits stepping in to correct market deficiencies .
Second , non-profit or not , Mozilla Firefox is an anomaly — the only product so far to even dent the competitive advantage Microsoft created for itself through its tainted activities .
A single anomaly does not indicate a healthy , competitive , or innovative system .
Third , the damage caused by Microsoft ’s activities is ongoing .
Mozilla Firefox has made a crack in the Microsoft browser monopoly .
But even so , hundreds of millions of people use old versions of IE , often without knowing what a browser is or that they have any choice in the quality of their experience .
This makes it very difficult to bring innovation , choice or improved user experience to vast parts of the Internet .
The extent of the damage is so great that it makes it difficult to figure out an effective and timely remedy .
I believe it ’s worth some effort to try .
It ’s easy to look at Firefox market share and assume the problem is gone or the damage is undone .
But that ’s not the case .
The drag on innovation and choice caused by Microsoft ’s actions remains .
At Mozilla we work to reduce this drag through direct action , and the results are gratifying .
If the EC can identify an effective remedy that also serves to improve competition , innovation and choice , I would find it most welcome .
I ’ll be paying close attention to the EC ’s activities , both personally and on behalf of Mozilla .
Mozilla has enormous expertise in this area .
It ’s an extremely complex area , involving browsers , user experience , the OEM and other distribution channels , and the foundations for ongoing innovation .
An effective remedy would be a watershed event ; a poorly constructed remedy could cause unfortunate damage .
I ’d like to offer Mozilla ’s expertise as a resource to the EC as it considers what an effective remedy would entail .
I ’ll be reaching out to people I know with particular history , expertise and ideas regarding these topics .
If you ’ve got specific ideas or concerns please feel free to contact me .
I ’ll post more as the discussion develops .
In light of all the sensationalistic press coverage about a journal article that was n't publicly available last week , it 's worth taking a moment to look at the actual experiment .
Of course , the savvy skeptics know by now that the paper in question ( Immordino - Yang et al. , 2009 ) has absolutely nothing to do with Twitter ( see Recommended Reading below for a recap ) .
Instead , the authors conducted a neuroimaging study to examine the brain 's response to stories designed to elicit the emotions of admiration and compassion .
To do this , the participants ( n=13 ) first watched a series of mini- documentary narratives about real people ( who were not celebrities ) .
Each of the 50 narratives was 60 - 90 sec long , and incorporated audio , video , and still images to convey stories categorized as :
1. Admiration for virtue ( AV ) , which involved people performing highly virtuous , morally admirable acts .
The narratives emphasized the virtuous and morally admirable nature of the protagonist , such as dedication to an important cause despite difficult obstacles , and did not include displays of notable skill .
2 . Admiration for skill ( AS ) , which involved people adeptly performing rare and difficult feats , e.g. , an athletic or musical performance , with both physical and cognitive components .
No physically or socially painful acts were shown , and the skillful feats , although amazing , did not imply a virtuous protagonist or reveal a virtuous act .
3 . Compassion for social pain ( CSP ) , which involved people in states of grief , despair , social rejection , or other difficult psychological circumstances .
No physical pain was evident in these narratives , and the troubling circumstances were discerned from the descriptions , rather than being apparent in the images shown .
4 . Compassion for physical pain ( CPP ) , which involved people sustaining a physical injury .
The injuries were caused by sports and other mishaps and had no moral or social implications .
The injuries were not the result of malevolence , and the participants were reassured that the injuries had no long - term implications ....
5 . Control narratives , which involved comparable living , mentally competent people engaged in or discussing how they felt about typical activities under commonplace social circumstances .
These circumstances were engaging but not emotion provoking .
induce in themselves for each story , as strongly as possible , a similar emotional state to the one they had experienced during the preparation session and to push a button to indicate the strength of the emotion they achieved in the scanner ( from 1 to 4 ... ) .
Participants were asked to report candidly on the strength of their current feelings in the scanner , rather than on the strength of feeling they remembered from the preparation session .

post hoc
It is well known that basic emotions such as fear , sadness , and happiness and limited social emotions such as moral indignation engage neural systems concerned with sensing and regulating body function with varying patterns , and it has been hypothesized that among those systems , the insula plays an especially prominent role .
It is also known that engagement of social emotions and the consequent feeling for another ’s social / psychological situation are described by poets and lay people alike in visceral and bodily terms and in terms of their heightening effect on one ’s own self - awareness or consciousness .

If replicated , this finding could have important implications for the role of culture and education in the development and operation of social and moral systems ; in order for emotions about the psychological situations of others to be induced and experienced , additional time may be needed for the introspective processing of culturally shaped social knowledge .
The rapidity and parallel processing of attention - requiring information , which hallmark the digital age , might reduce the frequency of full experience of such emotions , with potentially negative consequences .

After each of the narratives , the subjects were asked to discuss how they felt about the protagonist 's situation .
This part of the study took 2 hrs , and was conducted outside the scanner .
For the fMRI portion of the protocol , 5 sec recaps of all 50 scenarios were presented , and the task was to :
OK , so the subjects were first asked to remember how they felt 2 hrs ago , then try to duplicate that feeling , and then report on how they feel ( rather than before ) .
So there 's a memory component and a decision component ( i.e. , to not confuse past feelings with the present ) .
Each trial was sortedon the strength of the reported emotion , and only the effective trials were included in the analysis .
The comparisons of interest were pain ( compassion ) vs. non-pain ( admiration ) , and emotional responses to other peoples ’ social / psychological conditions ( AV , CSP ) vs. to their physical conditions ( AS , CPP ) .
One of the first issues discussed is the recruitment of homeostatic mechanisms when experiencing these social emotions : Basically , people may have visceral responses to the circumstances of others .
How do these responses differ across physical vs. psychological situations ?
For example , admiring a gymnast 's skill on the balance beam vs. admiring a student 's charity work with Habitat for Humanity ?
Or feeling compassion for a single mother who loses her job vs. feeling compassion for one who sprains her ankle ?
Although it 's not mentioned in the paper , this idea draws on Antonio Damasio 's somatic marker hypothesis ( e.g. , Damasio , 1996 ) .
Perhaps this omission occurred because two of the main regions implicated -- the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC ) and the amygdala -- were not discussed in the paper .
The somatic marker hypothesis is succinctly described by the title of one of Damasio 's books : The Feeling of What Happens : Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness ( 1999 ) .
Other components in the somatic marker circuit include the insular cortex , a region implicated in interoceptive awareness of bodily states ( Craig , 2009 ) , and somatosensory cortices responsive to external stimuli .
Because activity in the anterior insula features primarily in the Twitter - warped distortion of the story , I 'll start here with the authors ' third hypothesis :
In a way , this is a trivial prediction , because one can evaluate the sprained ankle narrative more quickly than the job loss scenario .
In fact , I will argue below that simple behavioral response time might be a more precise measure of how long it takes to generate the emotion in question than is the hemodynamic response ( blood flow changes , measured by the BOLD signal in fMRI ) in the insular cortex .
One reason for this is because of the significant delay ( 5 - 6 sec at least ) between initial neural firing and the peak of the hemodynamic response , which is estimated using a procedure that is not trivial for something as complex as an emotional response ( for a more detailed discussion of this issue , I recommend this PPT file from Jodi Culham 's excellent fMRI 4 Newbies site ) .
Let 's start with a simpler example .
The figure below shows the averaged hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) in the primary visual cortex to a series of flashes .
The HRF peaks at ~ 5 sec after the flash , whereas neurons in primary visual cortex fire within 50 msec and drop off shortly thereafter .
Thus , the hemodynamic response to even a simple sensory stimulus lags behind neuronal firing by 5 sec .
The next example shows the HRFs in occipital regions and the insula while subjects viewed rotating objects .
The precise details are n't important here , but note the peak latency for the HRF in the insula is around 6 - 8 sec , with the later peak for novel objects ( compared to repeated objects ) .
That brings us back to Immordino - Yang et al. and the emotional narratives .
In the figure below , note that the HRF time course does peak earlier for the CPP condition compared to the others , as predicted .
However , the CSP condition rises at the same time , albeit with a later ( very broad ) peak .
It 's critical to note that the onset of a felt emotion is not as easy to determine as the onset of a visual object .
Although more detailed methods are in the Supplementary Materials not available as of this writing , it seems that respiration and heart rate data were obtained in 7 of the 13 subjects to help with this .
I would say these psychophysiological responses , in concert with the participants ' own reaction times for rating their subjective responses , would provide a more accurate measure of how long it takes to feel an emotion than the fMRI data .
It 's hard to know what an insular HRF of 6 sec vs. 10 sec means when watching a fast - paced movie or reading the CNN news crawl or yes , spending too much time on Twitter .
Nonetheless , on the basis of these imprecise latency measures , the authors speculate :
And there 's your " Twitter is evil " angle .
I 'll leave you with this final thought : where 's the line between admiration and envy , between compassion and schadenfreude ?
There actuallya recent paper on the Neural Correlates of Envy and Schadenfreude ( Takahashi et al. , 2009 ) , and for now I 'll refer you to this nice summary in Pure Pedantry Social media threats hyped by science reporting , not science ( Ars Technica )

A giant shed used to house airships during the First World War was given Grade II listed status by Culture Minister Barbara Follett today .
The " Beta Shed " at Farnborough Airport , one of only a handful of portable airship hangars to have survived across Europe , is to be protected because of its " unique " history .
The structure was created around 1892 - 1893 and erected at the Hampshire airbase between 1910 and 1911 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It was used during the war to house airships , or balloons , which provided air observation of German submarines , monitoring threats to shipping , including supply convoys , in the North Sea and the Channel .
The new listed status will provide the shed with enhanced protection against insensitive development .
Ms Follett said : " This is a most unusual and unique building and deserves preservation .
" Only six of these sheds existed at the beginning of the First World War , and this one has housed some truly remarkable examples of British engineering .
" Its links with the development of early aerial reconnaissance is a reminder of a critically important time in Britain 's aviation history and it deserves the extra protection that listing brings . "
Farnborough was the location of the first airship trials , including the first Sea Scout ( SS ) , but the base was abandoned by the Naval Airship Service because of the expanding aeroplane squadrons there , and the personnel and airships were transferred to Kingsnorth , Kent , which became the airship headquarters .
Japan today threatened to shoot down a satellite that North Korea plans to launch early next month if it shows any signs of striking its territory .
Tokyo's warning that it would deploy its multibillion - dollar missile defence system raised tensions in the region after North Korea said that it had identified a potential " danger area " near Japanese territory along the rocket 's flight path .
The regime told the International Maritime Organisation that the missile would be launched during daylight between 4 and 8 April , and that its boosters would fall into the Sea of Japan – about 75 miles ( 120 km ) from Japan 's north - west coast – and the Pacific Ocean .
Officials in Tokyo said they reserved the right to destroy any threatening object in mid-flight , despite North Korean warnings that it would consider such a move an act of war .
" Under our law , we can intercept any object if it is falling towards Japan , including any attacks on Japan , for our security , " Takeo Kawamura , the chief cabinet secretary , told reporters .
Despite repeated assurances from Pyongyang that the rocket is a vital part of North Korea 's space programme , other countries in the region suspect the hardware is a Taepodong - 2 ballistic missile .
South Korean intelligence has reported a build - up of activity in recent days near the missile 's launch pad at Musudan - ri base on its neighbour 's north - east coast .
Any missile launch , even one intended to put a satellite into orbit , would represent a snub to the US administration , which has repeatedly invited the communist state to return to negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme .
Last month the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , urged the north to cancel the launch , which US officials say would be in violation of a 2006 UN security council resolution .
The South Korean foreign ministry said in a statement : " If North Korea goes ahead with the launch , we believe there will be discussions and a response by the security council on the violation of the resolution . "
The UN secretary - general , Ban Ki-moon , said a missile or satellite launch would " threaten the peace and stability in the region . "
After Japan 's transport ministry ordered airlines and shipping companies operating in the area to take precautionary measures , Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways said they would alter flight paths on several European and other routes .
Speculation has been mounting for weeks that North Korea was about to put its hitherto unreliable missile technology to the test .
The regime suffered a setback in 2006 when a Taepodong - 2 missile – theoretically capable of reaching Alaska – blew up moments into its flight .
Japan has intensified efforts to protect itself against conventional missile attacks since 1998 , when the north test - launched a long - range rocket over its territory without warning .
In response , Japan and the US have jointly developed a ballistic missile defence system that includes interceptor missiles on board ships and Patriot missiles dotted around Tokyo .
But experts believe that a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit may be too high to intercept .
Random House , Simon & Schuster and several other publishers announced a wide - ranging partnership Wednesday with Scribd to begin to release an increased number of best sellers as free e-books — a major marketing push to harness the long tail of a literate social network that boasts some 50 million loyalists .
The publishers have already been conducting trials for a few months , offering a few books ( around 8 - 10 ) and some excerpts on a limited time basis .
But this new partnership is a sign that they view the platform as much more than simply another testing ground , and that they plan to include a much greater flow of content which they hope will boost both print and e-book sales through e-book sharing and word of mouth on sites like Twitter .
It ’s less about creating a new revenue stream for e-books on Scribd and more about enhancing existing print and e-book channels by using the crowd as the new tastemaker .
" When we ’ve done these free books , we ’ve seen a significant amount of people microblogging about that promotion and saying how much they enjoy the books , and basically that gets the author ’s name and book title out there among many different people , " said Matt Schwartz , director of digital strategy for Random House Publishing Group .
Scribd , which launched in 2007 , allows anyone to publish a document online in its signature embeddable iPaper viewer .
Along with navigation features like search and zoom , the books can be download ( as a .pdf ) and viewed on compatible e-book readers or shared across numerous social networks including Digg , Facebook and Twitter .
There are also links around the free books where readers can purchase works from the same author directly from the publisher .
" Its unique approach provides us with the desired flexibility to determine how our content is viewed and used on a case by case basis , and is proving to be an effective tool for creating excitement for our books , " said Ellie Hirschhorn , executive vice president and chief digital officer of Simon & Schuster .
Shwartz said along with the viral component , a major factor for Random House in choosing Scribd was its massive audience .
The site boasts around 50 million unique readers , more than 50,000 documents are uploaded daily , and it is ranked fairly high at 73 on Quantcast which does n’t include traffic from embeds on other sites .
“ This readership just keeps attracting more and more publishers , and then more publishers come and they put more content on the site and then that just in turn attracts more readers and creates this nice viral loop that ’s just growing organically , ” said Scribd CEO Trip Adler .
One way they are leveraging this readership is by pushing slightly older books out as teasers to generate buzz for an author in hopes that they will buy the rest of the books .
" Random House put up this book by the author Tess Garretson , and within a few weeks it got over 30,000 views on Scribd .
They really could n’t get that kind of exposure anywhere else on the Internet , " said Adler .
A number of major news organizations like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal
use the service to upload and embed documents in stories , and President
Barack Obama used it during his campaign to share documents with voters and uses it now to share public information from the White House like the 2010 budget proposal .
For book publishers , Scribd is not the only platform they are utilizing with the rising e-book hype , but the viral components are limited elsewhere .
Random
House also offers a collection of free books on Lexcycle ’s Stanza iPhone app , and publishers have allowed excerpts of many of their books as a preview - before - buying on Google ’s book search .
A mobile Scribd site already exists as well that allows readers to view all of the documents , and Adler says they are also working on an iPhone application .

Introduction : Our heating element can beat up your heating element ...
Anyone who has taken two seconds to survey the breadth of the vaporizer market quickly notices that various brands tout their heating element as " the best available " while pointing out health risks associated with their competitors ' models .
Evaluating all these ( sometimes conflicting ) statements can be quite a task .
The purpose of this article is not to endorse a specific type of heating element , but instead to gather the available information about heating elements in one place to aid people in making informed decisions when buying a vaporizer .
Why Do Heating Elements Matter ?
The heating element is the most integral part of any vaporizer .
It regulates the temperature of the air that catalyzes the active ingredients as the air passes through it .
A note : the air passing through the heating element may be either propelled by a pump in balloon - style models i.e. the Volcano Vaporizer or by one 's own in direct - inhalation style vaporizers i.e. the VaporCannon .
Some models , such as the herbalAire , are capable of both balloon and direct - inhale style vaporization .
A primary requirement for all heating elements is precision  you want your vaporizer to actually be at the temperature you set  but health considerations may also play when people shop for vaporizers .
Types of Heating Elements :
# 1 : Ceramic
Ceramic heating elements are the most commonly type of heating elements .
Their proponents argue that they are the cleanest and therefore healthiest option .
This statement holds some truth : ceramics can withstand very high temperatures ( about 3000 * F ) before the material starts to transform to a gas and are therefore very clean and healthy .
Some companies take this logic a step further and argue that since other types of heating elements have lower boiling points  they are dirtier and less healthy .
This argument is somewhat flawed : while other heating elements have lower boiling points , these points are usually still well in excess of typical vaporizing temperatures .
Read about the specific types below for more info .
[ At right : the ceramic heating element used in the Phedor vaporizer . ]
Another important consideration when evaluation vaporizers with ceramic heating elements is the quality of the ceramic unit because the term " ceramic " is used to describe types of elements that are quite different in design .
This is due to the fact that " ceramic " merely refers to whether or not the unit incorporates some ceramic into the heating elements design , it does not mean that the air only touches ceramic material .
This makes buying vaporizers with ceramic heating elements difficult unless one knows the specifics of the designs used by each manufacturer .
As a general rule of thumb cheaper vaporizers are more likely to have exposed low - quality wire or solder within the heating elements ceramic structure that can emit toxins .
So steer clear of that digi vape if you want quality vapor .
While the only definitive test is to take an element completely apart to see how it is constructed , some manufacturers will address these questions if you contact them .
The manufacturers of the low quality models will dodge them .
Low quality ceramic elements reflect poorly on all ceramic heating elements , which is unfortunate because a well - designed ceramic element is very clean .
Top of the line ceramic heating elements are very precise too , although precision is also a function of the circuitry and computer chip technology used with the heating element .
Examples of vaporizers with good ceramic heating elements : Phedor , VaporBrothers , Hotbox
Pictures of the VaporCannon 's Ceramic Heating Element
# 2 : Aluminum
Some of the best vaporizers on the market use aluminum heating elements .
Manufacturers say that aluminum is more precise than ceramic elements because it responds faster the temperature changes [ At right : the aluminum heating element from the herbalAire ] :
" One reason the Volcano maintains such perfect temperature control is because it uses an aluminum element and block , and aluminum has different properties than potential practical designs using ceramics .
An aluminum element and block can more rapidly adjust for effects of air pressure and flow over plant material the key to vaporization is maintaining control over temperature and flow , which ultimately leads to more perfect control over vapor density . " ( link to press release )
Critics of vaporizers with aluminum heating elements cite health risks associated with exposure to aluminum , namely an increased risk of Alzheimers .
It is important to note two things here .
The first is from the Storz & Bickel FAQ page :
" Q. Does the aluminium heating block emit any substances which are subsequently inhaled by the user ?
A. No. the top temperature reached in the heating block 240 °C ( 464 °F ) is by far below the temperature that is needed to emit any substances out of the aluminum alloy AlMgSi , melting point 660 °C ( 1220 °F ) ; boiling point 2519 °C ( 4566 °F ) used by us .
This is documented by an analysis of the air produced by the Volcano on top temperature made by the University of Leiden , Netherlands . "
So well designed aluminum heating elements seem to be quite clean .
As for the increased risk of Alzheimer 's : it 's hard to be certain whether something does or does not play a role in the development of Alzheimer 's because the illness itself is not completely understood , but aluminum does not appear to significantly increase a persons susceptibility .
These articles from Scientific American and Alzheimers.org discuss this conclusion in depth .
Examples of vaporizers with good aluminum heating elements : Volcano , herbalaire
# 3 : Glass
Glass is basically the same as ceramic when it comes to heating elements .
Only one vaporizer with an all - glass heating element is currently available : the Vapolution .
Conclusion : Picking a Vaporizer with the Right Heating Element
In the end picking a heating element is a matter of personal choice .
Health considerations are paramount for some , while precision may dictate the choices of others .
Those worried about health should be advised that the type of plastic hosing used and type of plastic tubing used inside different models are also very relevant , but this is a topic for a different article .
The most expensive vaporizers obviously have the best heating elements  this is a large part of what you are paying for  but some mid-range models also offer quite viable ( usually ceramic ) options .
Do a little research before you buy too , it will pay off .
Hopefully this article has given you a place to start .

Ah yes , St. Paddy ’s Day has arrived .
A day of Irish reconciliation in America where , for a day , everyone has at least one drop of Irish blood alcohol level , thus qualifying them to drink liberally and slur their best Irish accents among their 1/32nd Irish friends .
For the record : I ’m half Irish , but I ’m not entirely sure which half – the bottom or top half .
Although I inherited a number of Irish traits from my father ’s side ( green eyes , reddish hair , and a soft spot for Bono ) , I did not inherit his Irish taste buds .
I cannot stand Irish cuisine and feel blessed my grandfather immigrated to America , where he drank himself , probably to kill the taste of corned beef and cabbage , to an untimely death .
I plan on celebrating by wearing green all day , not because I need to profess or celebrate my Irish heritage , rather so nobody pinches me .
Moreover , to celebrate St. Patrick ’s
Day this year , I thought I would serve up some tasty limericks as either appetizers or chasers for those of you who plan on indulging in Ireland ’s favorite pastime : Guinness green beer .
( Note : To fully appreciate these limericks , it ’s recommended that you read them aloud in private , using your best Irish accent , before you start knocking down the beers in a public pub . )
There ’s No Place Like Ireland on St. Paddy ’s Day in America
St , Paddy ’s Day rolls ‘ round but once a year
As Americans quest for green beer ,
Pour on thick accents ,
Spew yarns of nonsense ,
And long for a home they ’ve never been near .
Just Say No to Me Lucky Charms
There once was a leprechaun named Lucky

There once was a saint named Patrick
Who chased off Ireland ’s snakes with a stick .
They boarded a plane ,
Drove the crew insane —
Inspiring this muthufuckin ’ snakes on a plane lim’rick .
Saint Patricia ’s Night at the Roxbury
There once was a lassie from Listerine
Who dipped her whole body in green .

Until recently , an earnest public debate in London on the state of the global economy might have attracted an audience of a couple of dozen : some enthusiasts with an ideological axe to grind and a few elderly citizens looking for somewhere to keep warm .
I half expected a similar turnout when I volunteered to debate the subject last week with John Micklethwait , editor of the Economist , under the chairmanship of the BBC ’s Evan Davis .
But 800 people turned up at the Royal Geographical Society in Kensington , and paid an entry fee .
Such events are growing and attracting big numbers .
There is an extraordinary mobilisation taking place , the biggest since the Iraq War .
But the mood is very different : anxious rather than angry ; curious rather than committed ; interested rather than ideological .
In the event , there was not much debate .
We agreed on the deadly threat of economic nationalism as a response to the crisis and that , for all the greed , follies and instability of capitalism , there is not a viable alternative system .
There has been an enormous response to the stories which appeared in the Guardian and the Sunday Times earlier this month , based on information passed to me by a whistleblower , who alleges extensive , systematic tax dodging by the leading banks , Barclays in particular .
When the banks are queuing up at the Treasury rattling their begging bowls and looking for taxpayers ’ cash or guarantees , it is simply inexcusable to be devoting huge human resources to outwitting the UK tax authorities .
The head of Barclays ’s tax division is reportedly on £ 40 m a year and he “ saves ” for the bank ( ie , avoids ) vastly more in UK tax .
Occasionally , critics ask : “ What is wrong with dodging taxes , provided it does n’t involve breaking the criminal law ?
We all seek to minimise our tax bills , do n’t we ? ”
Leaving aside the large grey area where legal avoidance and illegal evasion overlap , there is a basic ethical point : do n’t businesses and individuals have a duty to the society whose domicile and public services they use ?
And when they want British government money or guarantees , the problem is a “ no - brainer ” .
The issue is not just for Britain .
Last week I hosted a meeting in the Commons for the campaigning group Global Witness , which has just produced an impressive report documenting the ways in which some of the world ’s leading banks are complicit in helping several of the nastiest dictators loot their economies and line their pockets using offshore tax havens .
The G20 must get to grips with tax - havens abuses .
But much can and should be done at UK level to make companies and rich individuals pay their dues .
In midweek I met a group of schoolboys from Hampton School in my constituency to deliver a petition to No 10 .
The pupils have compiled a remarkably eloquent collection of writings on the Rwandan genocide and the petition is to raise awareness of that horrific event in 1994 .
It would be too easy to let the memories fade .
As we went in to Downing Street , delegates from a G20 preparatory meeting were coming out .
I could n’t help but feel that the solidarity and humanity shown by the boys provided a sounder foundation for a future international order than the G20 communiqué being prepared in advance by the official “ sherpas ” .
Friday is set aside for constituency duties .
I have to get my head around a set of alternative proposals for a derelict site on the Twickenham riverside , one of those neuralgic planning issues which , in this case , has led to paralysis for more than a quarter of a century .
Then I was trying to help resolve a parking issue which has created bitterness between a world - beating , hi-tech small company and local residents whose cars are trapped in narrow streets when deliveries are made .
And then , a very long weekly advice surgery with around 20 , mainly complex , problems : asylum - seekers from Palestine , Kosovo and the Congo ; a Child Support Agency case ; a cowboy - builder problem ; a man who thinks I am a free tax accountant ; a disputed house benefit claim ; a homeless man who lives in a garage ; a couple driven mad by a wild young man next door , when he is not in prison ; a neighbouring borough ’s cemetery charges ; an equity release “ rip - off ” ; an elderly , disabled man fined for parking in a bus lane while collecting medication .
Nothing – not performing at PMQs , not interviews with Jeremy Paxman – is quite as emotionally draining as the weekly surgery .
The weekend is a tour of mid-Wales : a 400 - mile round trip in support of three of my parliamentary colleagues .

When designing a user interface or doing a usability review of an existing website , simplicity is an extremely important goal .
When I get to your interface , do n’t force me to spend time thinking .
Make it easy for me to do what I want to do .
Here ’s a perfect example : ever wish you had remote controls that looked like this ?
Like anything else , though , do n’t take the drive for simplicity and turn it into an inflexible dogma .
Make sure your UI simplification efforts stop before your interface is :
… so simple it does n’t give users any cues .
This is a classic Web2.0 sandtrap – yes , your site looks very modern and clean with one giant button , but what does the button do ?
… so simple it does n’t do what the user wants .
Here ’s a great example of oversimplification from Tim and Eric Awesome Show :
It ’s great – users have expressed frustration in getting calls when they ’re at dinner or trying to enjoy a relaxing round of golf – so they ’ve taken away the ability to get incoming call .
Problem solved .
… so simple that important efficiency gains are lost , requiring users to expend repetitive manual effort .
The Cinco Fone example above fits this one as well , but here ’s another fun satire from the Onion News Network about the Macbook Wheel :
I ’d love to hear any example of websites that you think might be committing one of the three sins of over - simplicity , please add a comment below .
Also , ff the title of this post is familiar , it ’s because it ’s based on a quote often attributed to Albert Einstein .
The actual quote is :
It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience .

The Salty Tears Of Phoenix Show Liquid Water On Mars
Droplets on a leg of the Mars Phoenix lander are seen to darken and coalesce .
Nilton Renno , a professor in the Department of Atmospheric , Oceanic and Space Sciences says this is evidence that they are made of liquid water .

Ann Arbor MI ( SPX ) Mar 19 , 2009
Salty , liquid water has been detected on a leg of the Mars Phoenix Lander and therefore could be present at other locations on the planet , according to analysis by a group of mission scientists led by a University of Michigan professor .
This is the first time liquid water has been detected and photographed outside the Earth .
" A large number of independent physical and thermodynamical evidence shows that saline water may actually be common on Mars , " said Nilton Renno , a professor in the U - M Department of Atmospheric , Oceanic and Space Sciences and a co-investigator on the Phoenix mission .
" Liquid water is an essential ingredient for life .
This discovery has important implications to many areas of planetary exploration , including the habitability of Mars . "
Renno will present these findings on March 23 , 2009 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston .
Previously , scientists believed that water existed on Mars only as ice or water vapor because of the planet 's low temperature and atmospheric pressure .
They thought that ice in the Red Planet 's current climate could sublimate , or vaporize , but they did n't think it could melt .
This analysis shows how that assumption may be incorrect .
Temperature fluctuation in the arctic region of Mars where Phoenix landed and salts in the soil could create pockets of water too salty to freeze in the climate of the landing site , Renno says .
Photos of one of the lander 's legs show droplets that grew during the polar summer .
Based on the temperature of the leg and the presence of large amounts of " perchlorate " salts detected in the soil , scientists believe the droplets were most likely salty liquid water and mud that splashed on the spacecraft when it touched down .
The lander was guided down by rockets whose exhaust melted the top layer of ice below a thin sheet of soil .
Some of the mud droplets that splashed on the lander 's leg appear to have grown by absorbing water from the atmosphere , Renno says .
Images suggest that some of the droplets darkened , then moved and merged - physical evidence that they were liquid .
The wet chemistry lab on Phoenix found evidence of perchlorate salts , which likely include magnesium and calcium perchlorate hydrates .
These compounds have freezing temperatures of about - 90 and - 105 Fahrenheit respectively .
The temperature at the landing site ranged from approximately - 5 to - 140 Fahrenheit , with a median temperature around - 75 Fahrenheit .
Temperatures at the landing site were mostly warmer than this during the first months of the mission .
Thermodynamic calculations offer additional evidence that salty liquid water can exist where Phoenix landed and elsewhere on Mars .
The calculations also predicts a droplet growth rate that is consistent with what was observed .
And they show that it is impossible for ice to sublimate from the cold ground just under the strut of the lander 's leg and be deposited on a warmer strut , a hypothesis that has been suggested .
Certain bacteria on Earth can exist in extremely salty and cold conditions .
" This discovery is the result of the talent and dedication of the entire Phoenix team and NASA , whose strategy for Mars exploration and the Phoenix mission is ' follow the water , ' " Renno said .
Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 , 2008 , and transmitted data back to Earth until Nov. 10 .
Scientists are still analyzing the information Phoenix gathered .
The mission was led by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Arizona .
Among its preliminary findings , Phoenix verified that water ice exists in the just beneath the surface of Mars .
It sent back more than 25,000 photos and deployed the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth .
The lander was the first Martian spacecraft to document a mildly alkaline soil and perchlorate salts .
It also observed snow falling from clouds on the Red Planet .
A paper on this research , written by Renno and dozens of his colleagues on the Phoenix mission , including principal investigator Peter Smith , is under review at the Journal of Geophysical Research .
Other U - M contributors to this research are Manish Mehta and Jasper Kok , doctoral students in the Department of Atmospheric , Oceanic and Space Sciences .
An unidentified creature in the english channel ?
visit AMR website for updated news
Exceptional video footage of the Boulogne sighting
" We are calling for all witnesses of sightings of any strange phenomena in the English Channel to contact the AMR immediately via our website www.thechannelcreature.com .
A reward is being offered for evidence leading directly to proof of this creature ’s existence . "
.
As you may know one of my favourite subjects as a blogger are stories related to the sea , the weirdest the better .
Today however I 'm going to set a new personal record with regard to weirdness .
I 've been contacted by AMR ( Association of Marine Research ) , an association created in 1901 aimed to promote a better understanding of deep - sea life , and , to make a long story short , they have provided me some incredible footage about a series of sightings that have recently occurred in the English Channel area .
The first sightings started on 20th April 2009 .
A passenger departing from the port of Dover took the picture at the top of the post , but probably the best sighting has been made by a couple at the harbour of Boulougne - sur - mer , a nice french city near Calais .
Thierry and Sophie , were enjoying a walk filming the boats sailing out of the harbour when Thierry spotted a large shape on the horizon .
Being an amateur expert about the sea and marine life , he knew this was not simply the outline of a whale or any similar creature and was convinced that he had sighted some phenomenon as yet unseen by man .
He decided to contact the AMR who are pursuing further investigations .
From that moment on AMR has collected a substantial number of testimonials from different areas .
The strong similarities between the descriptions seem to confirm the existence of a ‘ gigantic ’ and extremely ‘ fast - moving ’ creature off english shores .
I 'm sure many people will immediately think about an hoax ( have you thought to Nessie .. have n't you ? ) but AMR has taken the whole thing pretty seriously ( The AMR ’s success in identifying this marine phenomenon is dependent upon the participation of the general public .
As the first report came from Dover they have put in place a multimedia campaign calling for witnesses to come forward .
This will include the distribution of flyers , radio , press and online communications . )
and have even offered a reward as they stated in this note : Visit AMR website for any further info .
You 'll find also an updated map with the sightings and the first hypothesis that scientists are making !
Taxing Sugared Beverages : Good for Health or Too Much Big Brother ?
New Proposal Could Sweeten Tax Revenues , Waistlines
As with every disaster , the state of our economy highlights opportunities for good health and risks of doing more damage .
Desperate for revenue , states are considering taxes on sugared beverages , those drinks with added sugar , high fructose corn syrup or other caloric sweeteners .
Forty states now have taxes on soft drinks or snack foods , all too small to affect consumer decisions .
But bigger changes may be on the way with recent proposals , most notably an 18 percent tax on sugared beverages put forward by the governor of New York .
Nobody likes the idea of more taxes , so the bar must be set high to consider such action , particularly given the strenuous objections of the beverage industry .
The first question is , " Why pick on sugared beverages ? "
There are many contributors to ill health ( genes , environment , physical inactivity and more ) .
Even considering foods leaves many possibilities ; fast food and snack foods would be examples .
Enter the science : Sugared beverages , more than any other category of food , have been shown time and again to be linked with poor diet overall and to risk for obesity and diabetes .
Most of the studies that do not make this link are funded by the beverage or sugar industries .
Recent studies show that lowering soft drink consumption leads to healthier weights .
Upward Trend in Sweet Beverage Consumption
In the 1970s , the average American consumed 70 calories per day from sweetened drinks , rising to 141 calories in the 1990s and 190 calories as this century began .
Sugared beverages now account for 10 to 15 percent of all calories consumed by children and adolescents .
There is no sign that these additional calories are being offset by changes people make elsewhere in their diets .
Studies show that people compensate less well in subsequent meals when extra calories are consumed in liquid than in solid foods , so there does seem something special about sugar in beverages .
A study of children by researchers at the Harvard Medical School found that with each additional serving of sugared beverage consumer per day , the likelihood of obesity rose by 60 percent .
Sugared Beverages a Good Place to Start on Obesity
For these reasons , nutrition experts argue that the very high consumption of sugared beverages is a logical place to address the toll that chronic diseases take on the country .
Obesity , which is only one of many diseases affected by poor diet , carries massive health care costs ( $ 79 billion annually ) , about half of which are covered by Medicare and Medicaid .
Furthermore , these estimates do not include the cost to society of lost work days , diminished school performance and even the fitness of military recruits .
The Case for New Taxes
Would taxes help ?
Certainly they have with tobacco ; smoking in the U.S. has declined dramatically , and high taxes have been established as the top driver .
Economic studies on soft drinks show that a 15 percent tax on sugared beverages should drop consumption by 12 to 15 percent , and higher taxes would have stronger effects .
This is enough to make a real difference to the public 's health .
If the government were to create educational programs with this goal in mind , billions could be spent and the goal might never be achieved .
A tax would generate revenue , and a lot of it .
A penny per ounce tax in New York state alone would raise $ 1.2 billion annually .
It is common to think of sales taxes , but these have several disadvantages .
One is that consumers do not see the increased price on the shelf and the other is that it encourages consumers to buy large containers ( because the cost per ounce is lower , the tax per ounce is lower ) .
An excise tax of a penny per ounce would be better .
Polls show that consumer support for taxes varies , depending on how the issue is presented .
Support can be as low as 37 percent if a " fat tax " or " obesity tax " is suggested in isolation .
A recent poll in New York state found that 52 percent of consumers were in favor of a soda tax , but the number rose considerably -- to 72 percent -- if the revenue generated by the tax would be used for obesity prevention programs for children and adults .
Great Need for Sugared Beverage Tax
The idea of taxing sugared beverages is highly controversial but is probably here to stay .
The need for revenue and to control health care costs are just too pressing .
Kelly Brownell is director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University .
This article is based in part on an article written by Brownell with Dr. Thomas Frieden , published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine .

Matthew Yglesias at the Internet Food Association blog writes that it 's really a matter of overnight cold - brewing and straining .
First , gather up 1 cup of coarse - ground coffee and stir it into 4 1 / 2 cups of water , or strengthen the mix to taste .
After that :
... Stick it in the fridge for , ideally , a 12 hour overnight brew .
In the morning , strain the mixture .
If your strainer is n't fine - meshed enough ( mine is n't ) you can supplement it with a paper coffee filter .
Now you 've got a delicious pitcher of coffee concentrate .
Pour some over an ice cube and enjoy !

Limbaugh repeats his wish : ' I want Barack Obama to fail ' Jeremy Gantz
Published : Saturday February 28 , 2009
Print This Email This Rush Limbaugh wants America to know that there 's nothing wrong with wanting President Barack Obama to fail .
In fact , the conservative talk show host said Saturday , wanting the new U.S. president to fail is " nothing more than common sense . "
" This notion that I want the president to fail , this shows you a sign of the problem we 've got , " Limbaugh said during a long speech in Washington D.C. at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference , which was cosponsored by a long list of organizations including AT&T , Google and The Heritage Foundation .
" This is nothing more than common sense , " he said .
" And to not be able to say it ?
Why in the world would I want ... rampant government growth , indebtedness ... welfare that is not being created yet is being spent ?
What is in this , what possibly is in this that any of us want to succeed ? "
Limbaugh , who referred to his desire for Obama to fail as " mysteriously controversial , " in part defended his comments by saying that Democrats wanted the war in Iraq and former President George W. Bush to fail .
" So what is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation ? "
A huge standing ovation in the packed ballroom followed .
Limbaugh was expounding on what he said on Fox News last month just after Obama 's inauguration : " I shamelessly say , no , I want him to fail , if his agenda is a far - left collectivism , some people say socialism ...
Why would I want socialism to succeed ? "
Conservative pastor Pat Robertson denounced Limbaugh for his remarks earlier this month , saying : " That was a terrible thing to say ...
If [ Obama ] succeeds , the country succeeds .
And if he does n't , it hurts us all .
Anybody who would pull against our president is not exactly thinking rationally . "
Comedy Central show host John Stewart labeled that remark " arguably treasonous . "
During his remarks Saturday , Limbaugh painted a broad picture of an America under attack by liberalism and ballooning government , changes that directly threaten Americans ' liberty and way of life .
" We are in for a real battle .
We are talking about the United States of America ... remaining the country we were all born into and reared and grown into , " Limbaugh said , according to the Huffington Post .
And it is under assault , it has always been under assault .
But it has never been under assault like this , from within . "
President Obama began his presidency last month with the highest approval rating since John F. Kennedy took the office in early 1961 .
As of yesterday , Obama 's approval stood at 67 percent , up 8 percent since his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday , according to a Gallup poll .

The post repeats many things I have said before , but I wanted to bring more of the pieces together into more of an overview article .
This is a link to a PDF version of the presentation .
This is a link to the Powerpoint version .
I believe this assumption is basically incorrect .
The current financial crisis is a direct result of peak oil .
There may be oscillations in the economic situation , but generally , we can't expect things to get much better .
In fact , there is a very distinct possibility that things may get very much worse in the next few years .
Nearly all of the economic analyses we see today have as their basic premise a view that the current financial crisis is a temporary aberration .
We will have a V or U shaped recovery , especially if enough stimulus is applied , and the economy will soon be back to Business as Usual .
Our One - Way Economy
Our economy is very much a one way economy -- because of its heavy reliance on debt , it needs to grow .
It is easy to overlook the importance of debt .
Most businesses would not be able to build new factories without debt .
Businesses would tend to be much smaller than they are today without debt .
International trade would be much more difficult without debt .
Even at a personal level , debt is very important .
How many citizens would be able to purchase homes without a mortgage , or go to college without a student loan ?
In order for our debt - based system to work as planned , the economy needs to grow .
Otherwise , there are way too many defaults .
In a growing economy , many debtors find that their financial situation has improved by the time it becomes necessary to pay back the loan .
Even though it is necessary to pay back the loan plus interest , the debtor still has plenty of funds left over for other things , because of the growth of the economy , and his or her improved circumstances .
The reverse is true in a shrinking economy .
When the time comes to repay the loan , many debtors find that they have been laid off or their incomes have declined .
Repaying the debt becomes much more difficult .
Default rates rise .
Those who do repay debt often find they do not have funds left for all of their other obligations .
For a business , a declining economy makes capital planning difficult , because one does n't know whether there will be sufficient demand for a product , or sufficient raw materials for the product , for the full lifetime of capital equipment that is being purchased .
One would like to think that a new factory , or a new machine , will be usable for its planned lifetime , say 40 years .
But in a declining economy , it is just as likely that some necessary element will be missing , 10 or 20 years from now .
In this environment , how does one amortize costs ?
Why would a lender be willing to make a long - term loan ?
There is an academic paper called This Time is Different : A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crises .
The paper finds that throughout history , government defaults on debt have occurred very frequently .
The paper notes ( page 15 ) :
It is notable that the non-defaulters , by and large , are all hugely successful growth stories .
This is precisely the effect we would expect .
When economies of countries are able to grow rapidy , they can repay their debt with interest .
But as growth wanes , it becomes much more difficult to repay debt , and many more defaults occur .
Our debt - based financial system needs growth to continue .
It is not a Ponzi scheme , but it has the same problem with not being sustainable without growth .
The inability of the financial system to continue without growth becomes a separate risk factor to the economy , greatly magnifying the effect of even a slight long - term slowdown .
The need for growth is the reason why Bernanke and Geithner are working so hard to get the economy to grow again .
The Energy Stumbling Block
If all of the raw materials we need continue to grow rapidly , then there is a chance the growth paradigm can continue .
But increasingly , this is not the case .
A major stumbling block is cheap energy :
Cheap energy keeps our cars and factories running .
It leaves homeowners with money to repay their mortgages , and permits the long - distance transfer of goods needed for globalization .
We live in a finite world .
Cheap energy can't go on forever .
Eventually it runs out , and we have to move on to expensive energy .
This is precisely what has been happening , for both oil and natural gas .
The OECD can be thought of as the organization of oil consuming nations .
It includes the United States , Canada , Europe , Japan , and Australia .
On this graph , Rune Likvern has plotted :
• The amount of oil consumed by the OECD
• The price of oil
What we see on this graph is that the oil consumed by OECD reached a peak in 2005 , and has started to decline since then .
Prices started to rise about the same time the amount of oil OECD was able to purchase began to decline .
What was happening at this time was that world oil production reached a plateau , about 2005 .
There were more and more bidders for what oil was available , and prices started to rise .
OECD wanted more and more oil , but the oil producing nations also wanted more oil , and developing nations like China and India also wanted more oil .
In response to all of this demand , the price of oil went up and up , but total world supply barely budged , and the amount of oil that OECD was able to buy started to drop .
The first pains of the higher prices started being felt in 2006 , and rose in a crescendo until a major breaking point was hit in July 2008 .
In that month , the highest world oil production of all time and the highest price of all time both occurred , followed by a major break in the financial markets .
Let 's go back first to 2006 .
Even prior to 2006 , mortgage payments were a very vulnerable portion of the economy .
Families had been encouraged to take on large amounts of debt , and the increased demand for homes had sent housing prices upward .
Once prices of oil started to rise , the higher gasoline and diesel prices helped push a system which was inherently unsustainable over .
By 2006 , families had become less able to maintain high mortgages , and home prices started to decline .
This started the decline in home prices that we are seeing today .
One can see from the graph that home prices in 2009 are still very high by historical standards , so this process is likely not yet over .
If people are out of work and too many houses have been built , the ultimate level of home prices may even drop below historical norms .
This graph is a scatter diagram which plots the quantity of oil produced in a month and the price of oil in that month over a several year period .
As the price of oil went up , the quantity of oil produced went up -- but not by very much .
The price finally hit the high point on the graph of $ 147 a barrel in July 2008 , in the same month world oil production hit its maximum point .
At this point , a break occurred .
Commercial credit started becoming much less available , which reduced demand .
With the reduced demand caused by the lack of credit , prices dropped very quickly from $ 147 barrel to a low of $ 31 barrel in December 2008 .
The financial crisis as we know it had started .
This financial crisis is precisely what many of us had forecast would be the outcome of peak oil , because resources need to be level to increasing in order for the economy to keep growing .
( One can disguise the lack of growth for a time by expanding credit , and Greenspan used precisely that approach in the early 2000s . )
Once available resources start declining , growth begins to decline , debt defaults start rising , and soon after that , credit availability starts to decline .
We can summarize what happens in the following chart :
All of these problems lead us to the current financial crisis , caused by trying to continually expand our economy in a finite world .
Lack of low - priced oil was a major limiting factor .
Even if we had managed to get past the need for low - priced oil , there were other limits as well that we were reaching , like fresh water and cheap natural gas .
I wo n't be able to talk much about these today , but these limits would also tend to have the same impact on a financial system that requires growth -- cause massive debt unwind , and possible collapse of the system .
The Underlying Problem of Peak Oil
Nearly all readers of this site are familiar with Peak Oil Theory .
US oil production reached its peak in 1970 .
M. King Hubbert had long predicted a peak in US oil production about that time , but few believed him .
At the time of the peak , the US was producing oil only in the 48 states .
When the need for more production became clear , we were able to bring Alaska production on , after building a pipeline .
We were also able to ramp up oil production in the North Sea and in Mexico , soon after US oil production started to decline .
These sources are now beginning to decline as well .
One can see from these graphs that the shape of production curves varies depending on location .
It is not always symmetric .
This is a graph from a recent OPEC publication .
The graph is a bit confusing , because it shows two things on it -- OPEC oil production , using the scale on the left hand side , and world oil production , using the scale on the right hand side .
Once prices dropped from the high levels obtained in July 2008 , companies suddenly became a great deal less interested in producing oil .
New projects were put off , because the available price of oil dropped below the cost most companies needed to bring on new production .
The graph indicates that production fall immediately after the drop in price .
( Note : Companies by and large did n't " shut in " existing production , because much of the cost for existing production had already been incurred , and the marginal cost for maintaining production was quite low .
The continuing production from these older wells is the reason that we are temporarily able to buy oil cheaply now , even though we can't expect this long term .
Production from these older wells declines each year , and must be made up for by new wells , if production is to even remain flat . )
( Note : The drop in world oil production in September 2008 was the result of two hurricanes in the US Gulf of Mexico . )
Tony Eriksen ( " ace " ) made this forecast of oil production based on an analysis of likely future production for individual large fields , from this database .
Prior to the drop in price , it looked like world oil production would continue on a plateau for a while longer , or possibly even increase a bit .
Once companies understood the drop in price , they started deferring production plans until prices were better .
But existing fields continue to decline due to depletion .
The result of the cutback in new production , and the decline due to depletion in existing fields , is the expected pattern of decline Tony shows in this graph .
Where is the Energy Sector Headed ?
As I indicate on this slide , I see the major factor affecting the energy sector to be the credit unwind .
Pretty much all sectors are affected , because the collapse of the credit market affects the entire economy .
The problems of the credit unwind are pervasive .
There are both the direct problems of not having credit , and the indirect problems of low prices and low funds available for investment .
The result of this is that net investment drops considerably .
There seems to be lots of supply out there , but there is n't a good way to get to it .
The situation with natural gas is n't too much different from that with oil .
Conventional natural gas is the inexpensive natural gas .
It has been declining in supply .
Unconventional natural gas is generally quite a bit more expensive .
At today 's prices , it does n't make much sense to drill new unconventional wells , because the costs exceed the likely price that will be available .
Most unconventional gas is too expensive to produce at today 's prices , so decline is likely in the next few years .
Small companies are leaving the business , and not likely to come back , even if the price of gas goes up again .
This graph shows the number of drilling rigs in operation in the US , both for oil and for natural gas .
These drilling rigs are leased , so a company cannot easily stop drilling until its contract is up for renewal .
Even with this limitation , the number of drilling rigs has dropped almost in half from the high point , for both oil and gas .
The drop in drilling rigs does n't immediately affect production , but one can be certain it will affect production long - term .
We are living in the calm before the storm .
Lack of growth is causing the credit unwind .
There is nothing Bernanke or Geithner or the G20 meetings can do to fix the lack of growth -- it is closely related to the lack of cheap oil and cheap natural gas , now that these have been depleted .
Growth is not possible any more -- at best , we will get oscillation .
Prices will drop , as it has recently .
Demand will start to pick up again .
Prices will rise rapidly , until a new lower production limit is reached , and more defaults on debt will occur , starting the cycle over again .
There is a real possibility that the whole system may crash .
The value of the dollar may drop , or countries may become afraid of international trade , for fear that trading partners will not be able to make good on their promises .
It may be necessary to start over with a new financial system that does not permit much debt .
( This would not be easy .
Governments are often overthrown when currencies fail . )
It seems to me that the amount of investment is likely to drop , even below the level it is today .
The reason that investment is likely to drop is because the credit unwind is only part way finished .
Without growth , the credit unwind can only continue .
With low credit availability , prices will stay low .
The amount of cash flow oil companies and other energy companies will have will stay low .
With little opportunity for borrowing , there will not be very much income available for investment .
With little investment , even forecasts such as the one I showed by Tony Eriksen may prove to be optimistic .
Instead of oil production declining slowly , it may decline much more quickly :
Such a drop in production might occur if there is a major financial crash .
( See Where Is Oil Production Headed ? : An Adverse Scenario . )
Long Term Prospects
Even the good scenario is not very good .
Oil , gas and other commodity prices may fluctuate , but there will be little credit and little funds for investment .
The economy will be doing no better than today , and quite probably worse .
In the bad scenario , there will be a major financial crash , and the United States will somehow need to replace our currency ( and the currency of other countries around the world ) with a currency that is less tied to debt -- perhaps a currency tied to natural resources of some kind .
Countries may cease to trust each other , and there may be a rise in protectionism .
If new currencies are not adopted immediately , it may be difficult to carry on business .
Planning for the future , we need to assume that credit will be much less available than it is today .
Cash will be king .
In planning , cash flow will be more important than discounted present value .
Economic growth will be something remembered fondly from the past .
The closest approximation will be a temporary upswing while the world is oscillating between shortages at high prices and low prices with little credit availability .
The world is likely to become more localized in all of this .
Successful companies will emphasize long - term relationships with local customers .

On February 27 , 2009 President Barack Obama delivered his much - anticipated policy speech on Iraq .
The important point in his announcement was the withdrawal of some U.S. troops from Iraq by August 31 , 2010 .
However , it did not mean an end to the American occupation of Iraq , or an end to an illegal genocidal war that the Bush - Cheney administration had started .
Despite his high - blown rhetoric about withdrawing from Iraq , Obama did not deal with many important questions .
Thus what was not said cannot be regarded as an oversight but rather as an indication of how the new administration intends to pursue its policy objectives .
Those who had wished to see a break by the new administration with the Bush - Cheney administration ’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are concerned because they detect the continuation of the goal of the U.S. domination , which the American rulers usually refer to as the ‘ U.S. interests ’ in the region .
At present the U.S. has 142,000 combat troops in Iraq .
But what is often glossed over is the fact that there is almost a parallel army of American mercenaries and private military contractors whose numbers range from 100,000 to 150,000 .
Thus both the regular fighting force and these mercenaries are virtual foreign occupiers .
However , the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops will not amount to ending the U.S. occupation of Iraq .
Obama wants to keep more than 50,000 occupying troops in Iraq .
His innovation , if we can call it so , lies in classifying them as ‘ non - combat ’ troops or a ‘ transitional force ’ .
And what will they be doing ?
It is worth noticing how Obama formulates the policy objective that shows the real intentions of the occupiers : ‘ we will retain a transitional force to carry out the three distinct functions : training , equipping , and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non-sectarian ; conducting targeted counterterrorism missions ; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq . ’
So , instead of ‘ combat brigades ’ , the re-labelled ‘ transitional force ’ will carry on the ‘ targeted counterterrorism missions ’!
This can not fool anyone .
What this in effect means is that that the 50,000 soldiers will continue to accomplish the ‘ mission ’ that the former U.S. president George W. Bush had laid out for them .
President Obama has plans to remove all such remaining U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011 .
But things are far from certain .
What will happen if the resistance against the occupier and its puppet regime in Baghdad continues and the U.S. policy - makers and military planners conclude that the challenge to American hegemony and its geopolitical interests in Iraq persists ?
In that case , this plan can be replaced with a new one neatly drafted by the Pentagon .
Such concern was aired by the NBC ’s Pentagon ’s correspondent Jim Miklaszeswki on February 27 , 2009 that ‘ military commanders , despite their Status of Forces agreement with the Iraqi government that all U.S. forces would be out by the end of 2011 , are already making plans for a significant number of troops to remain in Iraq beyond that 2011 deadline , assuming that the Status of Forces Agreement would be renegotiated .
And one senior military commander told us that he expects a large number of American troops to be in Iraq for the next 15 to 20 years . ’
In case of such need to keep the American forces in Iraq , the puppet regime in Baghdad will hardly be in a position to resist the American diktat and pressure .
That means the colonial occupation of Iraq according to U.S. designs and interests will continue .
There are a number of important issues that President Obama did not touch in his speech .
What will happen to more than 100,000 mercenaries and private military contractors operating in Iraq ?
Dyncorp , Bechtel , Blackwater have been used by American military and they have been immune to any accountability for killing Iraqis .
The recent change of name from Blackwater to ‘ Xe ’ does not change the mission of the mercenaries and their crimes in Iraq .
Again , the ultimate responsibility for the actions of such people lies with the American government .
The peace movement should demand the Obama administration to redress the issue .
In Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone , the Bush administration built the largest embassy of any nation anywhere on Earth , a sprawling complex of buildings to accommodate up to 5,000 American diplomats and officials .
That shows what long - term objectives the Bush administration had for Iraq and the Middle East .
Besides , it was again the illegal action of the occupying military power in which the people of Iraq had no say .
An embassy is meant for diplomatic relations between two states .
But the gigantic building to accommodate thousands of officials in the capital of an occupied oil - rich country shows the true intentions of the American rulers .
These buildings should be closed down or handed over to the Iraqis .
The United States has 58 permanent military bases in Iraq , as a part of the larger network of American military bases around the world .
President Obama should give a clear indication that when the American troops are withdrawn , the illegal use of Iraqi military bases will also come to an end .
Let us hope that President Obama ’s words match his actions ; actions that will signify a change in the direction of American imperial policy .
It was encouraging to see that when he turned to the Iraqi people and said : ‘ The United States pursues no claim on your territory or your resources .
We respect your sovereignty and the tremendous sacrifices you have made for your country .
We seek a full transition to Iraqi responsibility for the security of your country . ’
The American rulers have inflicted immeasurable death and destruction on the Iraqi people and the infrastructure of their country .
They have caused untold humanitarian disaster and suffering in Iraq .
The people of Iraq have seen only death , destruction and barbarity at the hands of the occupiers since the U.S. invasion of their country .
The Belgian philosopher , Lieven De Cauter , the initiator of the BRussells Tribunal , writes : ‘ During six years of occupation , 1.2 million citizens were killed , 2,000 doctors killed , and 5,500 academics and intellectuals assassinated or imprisoned .
There are 4.7 million refugees : 207 million inside the country and two million have fled to neighbouring countries , among which are 20,000 doctors .
According to the Red Cross , Iraq is a country of widows and orphans : two million widows as a consequence of war , embargo , and war again and occupation , and five million orphans , many of whom are homeless ( estimated at 500,000 ) . ’
For us the ordinary human beings , such a degree of inhumanity shown by the rulers of the United States towards the people of a great country and callous imperviousness to the suffering of so many people is hard to understand .
In addition , Iraq , the cradle of human civilisation eventually fell in the hands of the American occupiers and they vandalized the ancient treasures and artifacts , which were the common heritage of all humanity .
In sum , the peace movement should demand the complete withdrawal of all U.S. troops , the withdrawal of all mercenaries and military contractors hired by the Pentagon .
All American military bases in Iraq should be closed and the full sovereignty of Iraq over its land and air be respected .
All lucrative oil contracts the occupiers made with the puppet regime in Baghdad should be held null and void .
Above all , the United States should be held accountable to pay reparations for the damage it caused and pay compensation to the victims of aggression .
We should demand that the International Criminal Court takes steps to indict the alleged war criminals .
The governments of the United States and Britain have a special responsibility to hand over the principal war criminals to The Hague and to facilitate the task of such trials .

Cap and trade is the tax that dare not speak its name , and Democrats are hoping in particular that no one notices who would pay for their climate ambitions .
With President Obama depending on vast new carbon revenues in his budget and Congress promising a bill by May , perhaps Americans would like to know the deeply unequal ways that climate costs would be distributed across regions and income groups .
Politicians love cap and trade because they can claim to be taxing " polluters , " not workers .

A recent study conducted by NSS Labs revealed that of the six most - used browsers , Internet Explorer 8 ( IE8 ) RC1 is " head and shoulders " above Firefox , Safari and Chrome in its ability to detect and block socially - engineered malware .
Socially - engineered malware is considered to be among the most prevalent computer viruses in existence .
The infection process becomes a very familiar scenario : a user is enticed to visit an external website and agrees to the malware download under false pretences .
NSS reported on the dangers of these attacks many times in the last year , urging users to constantly update their anti-virus / malware programs for ensured safety .
Malware Detection Based On Reputation Services
Most of the latest web browsers approach malware detection based on " reputation services " in the same manner experienced when analyzing phishing sites .
Detection is based on a blacklist of domains and IP addresses known as phishing / malware sites .
When a user attempts to click onto one of these domains , a message appears restricting access to the site .
( Source : yahoo.com )
39 % Gap Between First and Second
The actual results of the NSS study are as follows : IE8 ( RC1 ) was able to detect malware 69 % of the time , followed by Firefox v.3.07 at 30 % , Safari v.3 at 24 % , Chrome v.1.0.154 at 16 % and Opera v.9.84 at 5 % .
Those who continue to use the previous Microsoft browser will be saddened to learn that IE7 was only able to detect malware 4 % of the time .
Study Reveals Questionable Results
Analysts are raising some concern over the validity of NSS Labs , after it was revealed that the study was funded in part by Microsoft .
NSS admitted that Microsoft did fund a significant portion of the study , but stated that their labs remain an independent entity unto themselves and the funding does not make the results any less factual .
( Source : pcmag.com )
Still , many are waiting for confirmation from a non-funded source .
In the meantime , users are still reminded to treat browser - based malware detection as a secondary means of protection .
While this kind of protection is a good start , it is still no substitute for a strong anti-malware program and common sense ( among other measures ) .
Google ' Requests ' That We Not Copy Works That Are Already In The Public Domain
from the yeah - right dept
Computer scientist Steven Bellovin notes a troubling trend : companies that republish public domain works are increasingly trying to use contract law to place restrictions on their use .
For example , Google is apparently in the habit of " requesting " that people only use the out - of - copyright works they 've scanned for " personal , non-commercial purposes . "
Even more troubling , works like this one that were produced by the US federal government — and have therefore never been subject to copyright — come with copyright - like notices stating that any use other than " individual research " requires a license .
Fundamentally , this is problematic because copyright law is supposed to be a bargain between authors and the general public : we give authors a limited , temporary monopoly over their works , in exchange for those works being created .
But in this case , the restrictions are being imposed by parties — Google and Congressional Research Services , Inc. , respectively — who had nothing to do with the creation of the works .
The latter case is particularly outrageous because taxpayers already paid for the works once , through our tax dollars .
With that said , there are a couple of reasons to think that things are n't as bad as Bellovin suggests .
It 's hardly unusual for companies to claim rights they do n't have in creative works — that does n't mean those claims will stand up in court .
The fact that Google " requests " that users limit how works are used does n't mean they can stop people who ignore their requests .
And especially in the case of government works , there 's a strong case to be made that copyright law 's explicit exemption of government works from legal restrictions should trump any rights that private companies might claim to limit the dissemination of such works .
Moreover , a few courts have recognized the concept of copyright misuse , the attempt to extend a copyright holder 's rights beyond those that are specified in the law .
So it 's not at all clear that these purported contractual restrictions would actually be binding .
Companies might say that you need permission to reproduce the works , but they 're unlikely to try to enforce those requirements in court .
Nevertheless , government officials and librarians should do a better job of policing these kinds of spurious claims .
As Bellovin says , government agencies that hire firms to manage collections of public domain works should ensure that the private firms are contractually obligated not to place additional restrictions on downstream uses of those works .

I decided earlier this week I needed to rip a DVD and looked around at the available options on Linux .
I ’m not overly experienced at doing this sort of thing , in the past I ’ve always got the job done with applications like dvd:rip but not had a very satisfying experience .
I ’d heard a while back that the popular program Handrake had now released a Linux version with a GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) and it seemed a good idea to try it out .
I have some Mac using friends who really like it and often tell me how good it is for ripping discs .
There ’s been a command line version of Handbrake on Linux for quite some time I believe but I never used it , I can handle myself pretty well in a terminal but it just did n’t appeal .
Handbrake is licensed under the GPL and as such is completely free and open source software , with all these facts and endorsements ringing in my ears I figured I should take it for a spin , no pun intended .
Installation :
Installing the program was nice and simple for me on Linux Mint 6 .
There are “ .deb ” packages built for Ubuntu on the Handbrake website so it ’s simply a matter of double clicking to install , who says Linux has to be hard eh ?
Admittedly if you ’re on a non Debian - based system it might be not be quite so simple for you .
You can download the source code and build the application yourself which is n’t as daunting as it sounds or it ’s possible some other distributions might have their own binary packages .
It ’s worth having a look around before you start I ’d say .
Once installed the application should just appear on your menu , for me it was in the MintMenu under “ Sound & Video ” so it ’s likely to be in a similar place even if you ’re using a different flavour of Linux .
Ripping It Up :
Upon opening the application for the first time you ’re presented with a pretty nice looking interface , simple enough and not overcrowded but incorporating all the features you could need .
One thing I did find strange is that the program did n’t automatically detect the DVD I ’d loaded in my drive , instead I had to manually select the correct device .
I ’m using a Dell m1330n laptop and I only have one optical drive , the one selected was labeled “ dvd ” so I chose “ dvdrw ” from the dialog and then everything worked .
I do n’t know if this is a quirk of the program or a quirk of my hardware but once I ’d figured this out it was n’t too much hassle .
I have to do this whenever I want to rip a new disc , it does n’t auto - detect which would be a nice feature .
I decided to test it by ripping an episode of Spaced , a British comedy series that I highly recommend if you have n’t seen it .
One thing I like about the Handbrake interface is the list options down the right hand side to quickly and easily target specific devices .
I do n’t have an iPod or iPhone but I do have a PS3 and being able to just select that profile and know the video will work on the device is great .
I wish more applications worked as easily as this .
You can also tweak the video and audio settings if you ‘re more of an expert and you know what you want , so it does n’t limit you really but still has sensible defaults you can call up .
One thing about Handbrake which is n’t great is the length of time it takes to actually rip a disc .
It does produce very high quality rips with minimum fuss but you need to be patient , very patient .
I only ripped a small section of the DVD I was using to test , about 20 mins and it still took almost half and hour to complete .
Once it was done I opened the mp4 file and it looked perfect I have to say , so perhaps good things really do come to those who wait .
I made a slideshow of whole process if you ’d like to check it out
Verdict :
I really like Handbrake as you can probably tell by now , it does it ’s job well without being overly fancy .
It has all the features advanced users could need but still remains accessible for the average Joe .
It ’s not quick as I said , it takes it ’s time in ripping discs but does produce great quality .
My advice would be to start it up when you can afford to leave the machine alone for a couple of hours to work , perhaps at night .
Especially if you ’re doing a 3 hour epic like Lord Of The Rings or something , you ’ll be in for a long wait if you sit there and watch it and you could probably grow a convincing Gandalf beard by the end .
Overall I would recommend Handbrake as the best application of it ’s type I ’ve used on the Linux desktop , best of all it ’s free in both the speech and the beer senses so there ’s nothing to lose .
Try it out and let me know what you think in the comments .
Thanks for reading .
Friday Q&A 2009 - 02-06 : Profiling With Shark
Welcome back to Friday Q&A. ;
This week I 'm taking Jeff Johnson 's idea to discuss optimization and profiling tools .
Tools
So you 've progressed beyond the first rule of optimization ( Do n't Do It ) and have decided that enough time has passed at the second rule ( Do n't do It Yet ) .
Being smart about this whole optimization business , you know that the first thing you need to do before you actually start changing code is to measure it .
Measurement breaks down into two basic categories :
Overall performance .
This is usually defined in terms of operations per second , whatever it is that you 're doing .
If it 's an animation , this will probably be frames per second .
If it 's some kind of lookup system , it might be searches per second .
More exotic cases might look at CPU usage or memory consumption .
No matter what it is , you need to come up with a number so that you can do before - and - after comparisons to see how much any given code change helped ( or hurt ) .
Profiling .
This tells you how much time the computer spent in every piece of your code .
You need this so that you know which parts of the code to attack .
Overall performance measurement is pretty easy and so I 'm not really going to discuss that .
Much more interesting is profiling .
The first question is , what tool should you use ?
You may be tempted to use Instruments .
It is new and shiny and Apple hypes it up a lot .
Do n't .
When it comes to profiling , Instruments , in a word , blows .
It 's difficult to use , bloated , and does n't provide enough information .
As if that were n't bad enough , in threaded applications it frequently provides information which is just plain wrong .
Avoid Instruments for this work .
( Actually it 's pretty good at other kinds of profiling , like memory usage .
But when it comes to reducing CPU usage , Instruments is worse than useless . )
There are other tools on the system , such as Activity Monitor 's sample command , or the ' sample ' command line tool ( which Activity Monitor uses ) but there 's really only one worthy tool for this job : Shark .
Opinions may differ , but mine is solid : Shark is the only tool to even consider using here .
Some of the others are decent ( aside from Instruments ) , but Shark is pure gold .
I have actually had people who have never touched a Mac before tell me that they need to buy one after I give them a 30 - second demo of this program .
It 's that good .
Something to Optimize
Before we can talk about Shark , we need a program to use it on .
I wrote a little program that just searches for substrings in the /usr / share / dict / words word list that ships with the operating system .
Here it is :
#import < Foundation / Foundation.h > @interface Dict : NSObject { NSArray * _words ; } - ( NSArray * ) find :( NSString * ) toFind ; @end @implementation Dict - ( id ) init { if ( ( self = [ super init ] ) )
{ NSString * str = [ NSString stringWithContentsOfFile : @ " /usr/share/dict/words " ] ; _words = [ [ str componentsSeparatedByString : @ "
" ] copy ] ; } return self ; } - ( void ) dealloc { [ _words release ] ; [ super dealloc ] ; } - ( NSArray * ) find :( NSString * ) toFind { NSMutableArray * array = [ NSMutableArray array ] ; for ( NSString * word in _words ) { if ( [ [ word lowercaseString ] rangeOfString :[ to Find lowercaseString ] ]. location != NSNotFound ) [ array addObject : word ] ; } return array ; } @end int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { NSAutoreleasePool * outerPool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; NSTimeInterval start = [ NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate ] ; NSTimeInterval lastPrinted = start ; unsigned counter = 0 ; while ( 1 ) { NSAutoreleasePool * innerPool = [ [ NSAutoreleasePool alloc ] init ] ; Dict * dict = [ [
Dict alloc ] init ] ; [ dict find : @ " bob " ] ; [ dict release ] ; counter ++ ; NSTimeInterval now = [ NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate ] ; if ( now - lastPrinted >= 1.0 ) { NSLog ( @ " %.1f/sec " , counter / ( now - start ) ) ; last Printed = now ; } [ innerPool release ] ; } [ outerPool release ] ; return 0 ; }
I 've also made a whole package available for today 's post , including this source code , the source code for the changes that I 'll be making throughout the article , Shark traces for each one , and precompiled x86 binaries for each one .
You should download it and follow along .
Download it here
There are a lot of pretty obvious speed problems here , but it 's meant to illustrate the usage of Shark , not be a perfect real - world example .
First , let 's establish a baseline by running the program .
You 'll notice that I measure the number of lookups performed per second and print it out periodically .
This is the overall performance number that we 'll be concentrating on .
On my Mac Pro , I see about 1.6 / sec with this code .
Let 's shark it :
This is the opening window , where you control what Shark will do .
For now we 'll set it to Time Profile , Process , and give it our dictfind1 program , which we 've already run in a shell .
The other settings can be left alone .
Then we click the Start button , wait 30 seconds , wait some more for it to process , and we can view the results :
I have it in Tree ( Top - Down ) mode which is generally the best mode to use for profiling .
This shows you the call stacks that were profiled from the top down .
Here you can see that start called main which then called -[ Dict find : ] , -[ Dict init ] , and a bunch of others .
The Self and Total columns are important here .
the Self column shows how much CPU time was spent in that function .
The Total column shows how much time was spent in that function and in all of its descendants .
We can see here that -[ Dict find : ] is responsible for 40.8 % of all CPU time .
However we can see that only 0.8 % of the time is spent in -[ Dict find : ] itself .
The other 40 % of the time is spent in things being called from there .
This tells us that we may be able to optimize that method by changing what it calls , but we wo n't gain much by trying to make the code right in -[ Dict find : ] go faster .
There 's one obvious bit of slowness here , which was probably obvious just from looking at the code and is even more clear once we have the profile to look at : this code reinitializes the dictionary every time through the loop !
If we imagine that our real case is going to be looking up a lot of words for each run , this is foolish .
Let 's create a single instance of Dict before the loop and just reuse it for each pass .
You 'll find this modified code in dictfind2.m in the package .
Compile and run .
Result : 2.7/sec .
Not bad !
That 's about a 70 % speedup over the original code , just from moving two lines of code around .
Of course this is still pretty slow , so let 's see what else we can do .
Profiling this version , we see that about 70 % of the time is spent in -[ Dict find : ] and about 26 % in NSPopAutoreleasePool .
The latter is an indication that we 're creating too many temporary objects .
If we pop open -[ Dict find : ] we can immediately see why : half the time is spent calling -[ NSString lowercaseString ] , and that of course produces a temporary object each time which then needs to be destroyed .
So we can guess that about 75 % of this program 's time is due to the two calls to that method .
Easy fix , though : NSString allows case insensitive searching .
Instead of comparing lowercase strings , we 'll just compare the original strings with the case insensitive option set .
dictfind3 in the package contains this change .
Compile and run .
Result : 17.5/sec .
This is a 6.5 x speedup over dictfind2 , roughly in line with what we would expect .
( Removing code that takes up 75 % of the time should result in a 4 x speedup , and the numbers are imprecise enough that this is well within the fudge factor . )
It 's an 11 x speedup over the original code .
Not too bad at all .
But still , under 20 lookups per second kind of sucks .
Let 's profile this version too .
What we find is that 90 % of the time is spent in -[ NSString rangeOFString : options : ] .
We do n't control that code , and it's hard to imagine that we could write a faster custom version .
Optimizing the rest of the code will win us at best 10 % .
So now we 're stuck .
If we can't speed up -[ NSString rangeOFString : options : ] , maybe we can call it less frequently .
Let 's start to think of an algorithmic improvement .
Every time we do a search , we do a linear search through the entire dictionary .
Can we reduce that ?
It 's tricky , because we 're doing a substring search , so something easy like sticking everything in an NSDictionary wo n't do .
Neither will a classic binary search .
A modified binary search will do it , if we pay a memory price .
Instead of storing each word in the array to search , we 'll store pairs .
The first part of a pair will be a suffix of the word , and the second part will be the entire word .
Then if we binary search on the suffixes , we can rapidly find all words which contain the search term .
The memory cost will be substantial : a 10 - character word will result in 10 entries in the array instead of just 1 , and with all those suffix strings floating around in memory .
But if we really want speed , the tradeoff may be worth it .
dictfind4 contains the binary search version .
Dictionary initialization is now substantially more complex , building up all the substrings .
In the find routine , we take advantage of CoreFoundation toll - free bridging and use the CFArrayBSearchValues function .
Compile and run .
Result : initialization takes forever , over 10 seconds on my computer .
But once that 's done , the reward is enormous , at about 24500 / sec .
This is a 1400 x speedup over the last version , and a 15000x speedup over the original .
Let 's profile this one too just for fun .
We find that 22.5 % of the time is spent just in -[ NSCFArray addObject : ] .
This code spends nearly a quarter of its time just adding the results to the array after it finds them !
There are no doubt further optimizations to be had here , but at this point we hit diminishing returns .
We already got a fifteen - thousand - times speedup over the original slow version , and that 's good enough for me .
Before we quit for the day , let 's flip Shark into " Heavy ( Bottom - Up ) " mode :
This essentially flips everything around .
Instead of showing the top of each stack , and then showing what each entry called underneath , it shows you the bottom first .
It then shows what functions called it , what functions called those functions , and so forth .
This is generally less useful than the top - down mode , but sometimes it 's really handy , because occasionally you have an important bottleneck which is called from many locations scattered around your code .
This is a great illustration of just one of those cases .
We see that objc_msgSend is taking up 25 % of our time now .
Of course we can't very well improve on libobjc , but if we were after even more speed we might start taking measures to make fewer message sends .
Wrapping Up
Hopefully this should get you started on Shark , but I 've barely scratched the surface of what it can do .
If you double - click any entry in the profile list , Shark will show you the source of the function in question .
( The actual source if available , assembly if not . )
In that view it will give you a line - by - line listing of exactly where your time is being spent .
Even crazier , Shark has a big database of common speed problems and sometimes will actually give you advice on what 's slow and how to fix it .
( Look for the little exclamation point , and click on it to get the advice . )
And there 's so much more beyond this .
This is a truly wonderful tool that Apple has produced .
( Those who know me well are gasping in surprise at this remark , but it 's true ! )
That 's in for this week .
Have a great optimization battle story ?
Think my slam of Instruments was totally unfair ?

Taxes have been one of the most hotly debated topics in Washington and cuts for the wealthiest Americans are one of the most controversial subjects surrounding the issue .
But how many rich people are there in the U.S. , how much do they make and where do they live ?
And just what income do you qualify to be rich ?
According the data from the Census Bureau , there are currently 4.5 million households that earn over $ 200,000 per year , the highest wealth division compiled in Census reports , which is approximately 3.8 % of all households in the country .
The average income of those making over $ 250,000 is $ 425,226 and there were 2.37 million households in this range as of 2009 , although this data is not broken down by state .
With Census Bureau data from their National Data Book 2010 Statistical Abstract , we ’ve outlined the states that have the highest proportion of households with annual incomes in excess of $ 200,000 .
Among the states with the lowest proportion of $ 200,000 + households are West Virginia ( 1.4 % ) , South Dakota ( 1.81 % ) and Arkansas ( 1.86 % ) .
So , what are the states with the most high - income households ?

Women ' exhausted ' by fight for equality , claims feminist icon
Women 's campaigner Erin Pizzey
Women have won the war for equality but it has left many of them imprisoned and exhausted , a pioneering feminist has claimed .
Campaigner Erin Pizzey , who founded the world 's first refuge for battered women in 1971 , claims the idea of women happily combining a career and a family has proved to be a myth .
The 70 - year - old said women 's ' freedom of choice ' to have both has left them with less spare time than they had before .
But she added that many now did not understand what they had lost .
Speaking as part of a BBC programme about the role of women in the workplace , she said many are mothers who are having to juggle jobs at the same time .
She said : ' There 's been a subterranean war between men and women which has been won by women and they do n't actually understand what they 've lost . '
The campaigner added : ' I do n't think anybody foresaw that what a freedom of choice would do is imprison many .
' Many women , they do n't have a choice now , they have to work , they have to work hard , and I just see an exhausted generation of women trying to do it all . '
Her comments feature on the first episode of BBC2's The Trouble With Working Women , which is to be screened in June .
The programme looks at why men still dominate the top jobs and on average earn £ 369,000 more than women across their career .
Miss Pizzey 's comments come days after the publication of Labour 's Equality Bill which gives employers legal powers to discriminate in favour of women and ethnic minorities .
Erin Pizzey pictured in 1976 outside the High court with campaigners battling to keep women 's shelters open in Chiswick
Harriet Harman unveiled plans for firms to choose them ahead of equally qualified
white male applicants without risk of being sued .
The Labour deputy leader hopes to boost the proportion of female and ethnic minority staff , as well as pushing more of them into senior roles .
But the Equality Bill , which brings together nine major laws , has prompted grave concern that white men could miss out unfairly on jobs .
Last year an academic claimed that many women wanted to raise families rather than pursue careers .
Dr Catherine Hakim said : ' The myth that all or most women would be just as careerist as men , if only they were given the opportunity has been exploded . '
Pizey recently spoke out about the court case which saw her receive an apology and damages over claims made about her in Andrew Marr 's book .
She took action over claims in the BBC journalist 's book for his TV show A History Of Modern Britain which suggested she was a terrorist sympathiser .
Marr had written that Pizzey had been a ' cadet enthusiast ' in the Angry Brigade , the militant anarchist group the detonated bombs around 1970 's London .
A peace activist and champion of women 's rights , she told how she cried on hearing what had been written about her and was never a member of the group .
She took legal action against publishers Macmillan for defamation .
Macmillan offered her an unreserved apology and agreed to pay substantial damages and costs .
During her career , she has campaigned to liberate women from their abusive husbands .
Pizzey , who has never described herself as a feminist , fell out with many in the women 's movement because she did not share many of their views .
The middle - class Christian said many feminists were obsessed with destroying men and marriage and said for many it was like a ' born again ' religion .
She has previously claimed women need to stop competing with each other with things like dieting and cosmetic surgery .

Thursday lunch time at the City of London headquarters of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , and at the stroke of one o'clock , 200 people arrive on the pavement outside .
Some are wearing red nooses around their necks , others are parading around in top hats and City - boy pinstripes , a few are carrying placards that read , " Storm the banks " .
A pedal - powered sound system is cranked up and The Fall 's anthem to grinding poverty , " F'oldin ' Money " , blares out across the street .
This is a flash - mob demonstration , mobilised through a Facebook event called " Give us our money back " .
It 's a protest against the Government pouring billions of pounds into the banking industry and the £ 16.9 m pension pot awarded to the former RBS chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin .
A man picks up a megaphone .
" Congratulations , people , " he says .
" After the biggest bailout from the poor to the rich that this country has ever seen , this bank now belongs to us .
The time has come to claim what is rightfully ours . "
The protesters applaud wildly .
" Whose money ? " they chant over and over , " Our money . "
Armoured police vehicles are scattered up and down Bishopsgate and the grand glass - fronted entrance to the RBS building is guarded by a phalanx of the Met 's finest .
From within , a few bemused RBS workers look nervously out at the street .
It 's probably not the best day to be slipping out for a boozy banker 's lunch .

Standing cackling on the sidelines is Ian Bone , a self - confessed " lifelong enemy of the state " and member of the Whitechapel Anarchist Group ( WAG ) .
" This is just a taste of things to come , " he says .
" That was the spring offensive .
Next up is the summer of rage . "
Bone is referring to a wave of mass demonstrations planned for the capital which kicked off yesterday with the Put People First march , organised by a coalition of trade unions and environmentalists .
On Wednesday , 1 April – or " Financial Fools Day " – thousands more are due to take to the streets of the City for the biggest show of public anger since the credit crunch began .
And Thursday , dubbed G20 Meltdown , is when protesters will descend on the Excel Centre in London 's Docklands – the day that world leaders arrive in the capital for the G20 summit .
According to media reports , police are gearing up to deal with unprecedented numbers of protesters and terrifying levels of violence .
Fears are also growing for the safety of City financial workers .
The G20 Meltdown campaign posters show a besuited mannequin being hanged .
City staff are being advised to dress down and cancel all non-essential meetings .
" People are in an incendiary mood , " says Bone .
" 1 April will see the biggest ructions on the street since the poll - tax riots and possibly even the Gordon riots of 1780 .
I do n't think politicians realise quite how angry we are .
In the past six months , this country has been turned upside - down .
A deep recession has been created by a few greedy bankers and as a result , thousands have lost their homes and jobs .
A dam of resentment has built up and 1 April is when all these pissed - off people march on the City to take what 's theirs .
Capitalism itself is on the ropes . "
Bone believes the anarchists ' moment has finally come .
With the banking system on its knees and capitalism ' floundering , a window of opportunity for real change has arisen .
" We need to seize the moment , " he says .
" There was a moment in May 1968 and another in the 1980s under Thatcher when the miners were on strike , but we failed to grasp either .
This one is different .
No one 's ever seen what we are seeing now with the economy and it's the economy that drives people to the streets . "
Bone 's own particular brand of anarchism is extreme .
" I 'm full of class hatred , " he tells me cheerfully over a pint in the local Wetherspoons pub after the demonstration .
" I just want to overthrow the ruling classes . "
He was radicalised from an early age : his father was a butler for one Sir Gerald Coke , and the young Bone spent his formative years witnessing him bowing and scraping to his superior .
By the age of 15 , he was a regular on the Aldermaston CND marches and in 1983 he set up the anarchist journal Class War , " Britain 's most unruly tabloid " , which still runs to this day .
Although there are no membership figures – anarchists do n't deal in such administrative formalities – Bone claims the numbers of people joining the movement has risen significantly in the past six months .
But what makes him more convinced that the anarchists ' moment has come is that the types of people joining are entirely different .
" Traditionally , anarchism appealed to young , inner- city types , " he says .
" Now we 've got people coming into the anarchist movement we 've never seen before .
There 's older people , whose pensions or savings have been wiped out , as well as people from the suburbs – the aspirational working - class who voted Tory , bought their own council flats and moved up in the world .
These are people who were sold all that stuff about the free - market dream and now are being repossessed or made redundant .
Capitalism has failed them and they are angry as hell .
In the past we 've needed to create rage .
We do n't need to do that now because the rage is already there . "

Despite his own hardline stance , Bone is astute enough to realise that not all of these " anarchists " want actual revolution .
Some simply want to voice their anger at the greed and recklessness of the City , others want peaceful protest , and some just want a ruck with the police .
But if there is one uniting consensus among them , it 's the belief that there is something fundamentally wrong with a capitalist system that has allowed the rich of the world to carry on getting endlessly richer .
Chris Knight , a professor of anthropology at the University of East London , and one of the co-ordinators of G20 Meltdown , describes himself as moderate .
" I 'm the kind of anarchist that adheres to some form of organisation , " he says .
" I 'm not into throwing bricks through windows ; what I 'm talking about is something closer to revolutionary , or anarcho , communism . "
Since the economic crisis began , Knight has regularly taken to the streets brandishing a placard reading , " Eat the bankers " .
" We have n't got any secrets , " he tells me .
" On 1 April , we fully intend to overthrow the Government .
' Gordon Brown is on his last legs , this is his last throw of the dice .
The revolution starts here . "
Knight adds that 1 April is a date that is highly pertinent to the anarchist calendar : it 's exactly 360 years to the day that the Diggers , the English civil - war revolutionaries and arguably the UK 's first anarchistic group , set up an independent commune and issued a call for equality .
" If we succeed , " Knight continues , " and New Labour falls , we say let 's immediately nationalise all banks and redistribute the wealth .
In other words , we take the power and we do n't let the bankers dictate to us any more .
We stop the money pouring into bankers ' pockets , where it disappears , and start giving it to the people who will spend it – students , single mums , the unemployed .
We need to spend money to stop this country going bankrupt : well , that is a solution .
" It 's seismic , " Knight concludes .
" There has already been a whole balance - of - power shift and the world has been turned upside - down , but it 's all happened peacefully .
There is going to be a velvet revolution .
Not a violent one . "
Commander Bob Broadhurst of the Metropolitan Police does n't seem to think so .
He has £ 7.2 m earmarked for the police operation from Wednesday until the conclusion of G20 and believes there to be " unprecedented " planning between protest groups , which are now using technology such as Twitter to organise themselves .
What further worries him is that certain groups – Reclaim the Streets and the anarchist group the Wombles , for example – that have lain dormant for much of the boom years of the noughties , are showing signs of remobilisation .
Groups such as these are the ones that gave the authorities such an enormous headache throughout the 1990s – from the poll - tax riots in 1990 to the protests over the Criminal Justice Bill in the mid-1990s and finally the violent Reclaim the Streets protests at the end of the decade .
Alexander Callinicos , professor of European Studies at King 's College , London , who is speaking at this week 's demonstration , backs up Broadhurst 's belief that new allegiances between protest groups are being forged .
He went to an anti-capitalist demonstration on Halloween last year at Canary Wharf following the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
" It was an unusual event , " he says , " because for the first time there was an unlikely alliance between anarchists , Marxists and other groups that do n't usually get on terribly well .
Whatever our disagreements , we are all united in the belief that the blind hunt for profit leads to catastrophe .
That is what has brought us all together . "
Like his fellow protesters , Callinicos is feeling buoyant about the situation .
" I have high hopes for this week , " he says .
" The economic crisis has exposed the bankruptcy of capitalism and the dire need for an alternative .
Anyone who feels there is something fundamentally wrong with capitalism is entitled to feel this is their moment . "
But is this all just talk ?
Is the country really ready for revolution ?
Tim Harford , Financial Times journalist and author of The Logic of Life ( just published in paperback ) does n't think so .
" The last time we had a really bad economic depression , we got National Socialism and I 'm sure this is n't the alternative these guys have in mind .
We have to ask the question , is it really all that bad ?
Unemployment is clearly terrible but it 's nothing like America in the Great Depression of the 1930s .
In 1981 , it was also bad , it was a rotten time .
But was that the end of capitalism as we know it ?
People have a tendency to engage in wishful thinking .
Journalists want it to be really appalling because it makes an exciting story ; anarchists want it be the end of capitalism because that 's what they 've spent their lives hoping for ; and economists think that it 's nothing really that remarkable . "
Nor does Harford think it 's time for capitalism to be brought to its knees .
" Clearly the free market has its faults , but no one could argue we have n't all done very well out of it in the West , " he says .
" It 's lifted an awful lot of people out of poverty .
Generally , the places in the world that have not been successful in letting the market take off tend to be the places that are poorer .
Capitalism has had a fairly good track record .
I hope it's not on its last legs because I doubt it could be replaced by anything more effective . "
Meanwhile , back at the flash - mob gathering , Madonna 's " Material Girl " has started up and the obligatory crazy dancing has broken out .
Tamsin Omond , one of the five who were arrested after climbing on to the roof of the House of Commons in a protest against the expansion of Heathrow , and the current poster girl for climate change , is right in the thick of it .
" What shall we chant ? " she asks her friend breathlessly .
" Something about banks , maybe ? "
" Stupid twat , " says Ian Bone .
" Listen to her accent .
She 's just one of those climate - change lot who do a bit of environmental action to get it on their CV before going back to live in their big house with mum and dad .
You watch : she 'll be an overpaid environmental consultant before you know it . "
If this is the unity Commander Broadhurst is so worried about , perhaps he can relax a little .
It 's hard to tell if anything really has changed ; today , it looks like the same old faces doing the same old thing .
Should we really be in fear of revolution ?
We 'll have to wait until Wednesday to find out .

A young schoolboy is shot dead by police in Athens , resulting in four weeks of rioting across Greece .
Anarchists seize control of government buildings .
Similar riots kick off in other parts of Europe
Anarchy in the EU :
How one boy 's death sparked riots across Europe
The demonstrations that took place in cities across Europe last December , as protesters took to the streets in solidarity with Greek rioters , were a stark indication that anarchism is alive and kicking throughout the EU .
In Athens , it was the shooting of 15 - year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos by police that triggered weeks of violent clashes between the authorities and youths frustrated by government corruption , crony capitalism and high unemployment .
Almost immediately , France , Germany , Spain , Italy , Sweden and Denmark saw unrest and , in some cases , similar outbreaks of serious violence , sparking fears that mass insurrection was the shape of things to come .
While many of the protestors were quick to identify themselves with a unified anarchist scene , political commentators agree that in reality , the European picture is ideologically and strategically fragmented , composed of more or less self - contained groups .
In each country , individual factions are engaged in their own specific battles with the political establishment , from economic to environmental issues , linked only by a broad anti-capitalist , anti-imperialist stance .
Although overlaps with the ultra- Left exist , leading to widespread confusion between the two , what ultimately separates anarchist groups is their belief in practical , militant action .
Not surprisingly , the European countries in which the anarchist movement tends to be strongest are those in which a capitalist status quo exists , as is the case in Germany , Switzerland and Scandinavia .
In Greece , Italy and Spain , the situation is aggravated by a deeply felt divide between the Right and Left , and – in the case of the latter two – relatively fresh memories of right - wing dictatorships .
Nevertheless , recent events suggest that anarchist activity is on the rise in nations where it has not previously been a major concern .
In France , for example , where a strong far - Left has traditionally stifled any anarchist movement , the Interior Minister Michèle Alliot - Marie has spoken of a serious threat from " ultra - Leftist " and " anarchist " terrorists .
In November , nine members of a group of young men and women living in a commune in southern France were arrested in connection with sabotaging the power supply to high - speed train lines and " associating with wrong - doers with terrorist aims " .
All but one of the " Tarnac Nine " has now been released , amid accusations of absurd heavy - handiness on the part of the authorities .
