North Korea stunned its opponents with its shock success in 1966
By John Sudworth
BBC News , Seoul , South Korea
For only the second time in footballing history one of the world 's most isolated countries has won itself an invite to the sport 's biggest party .
News that North Korea has qualified for the World Cup finals in South Africa in 2010 was broadcast to an expectant nation at lightning speed .
Well , that is , within a few hours of the final whistle .
North Korea is a country that often takes days to digest and interpret international events before letting its citizens in on the story .
So , on the evening after the night before , North Korean television viewers were able to see a recording of the victorious , if perhaps dull , 0 - 0 away draw to Saudi Arabia .
The result was enough to snatch one of the automatic qualifying places .
Isolated it may be , but on the first and only other occasion that it made the World Cup finals , North Korea showed itself to be no shrinking violet .
Former glory
In fact , that team was one of stars of the 1966 tournament , which was hosted by England .
The Red Mosquitoes , as they were dubbed , romped into the quarter - finals , beating footballing giants Italy 1 - 0 along the way .
There was a feeling that North Korean football was world class and already the pride of the people
Shim Joo-il , North Korean defector now living in South Korea Apparently , in Italian footballing circles the North Korean goal scorer that day , Pak Do-ik , is still known as " the dentist " for the pain he inflicted on the national psyche .
The shamefaced Italian team were pelted with tomatoes upon their arrival back home .
Shim Joo-il is a former North Korean military officer who defected to the South in 1999 .
Mr Shim now works as a Christian pastor .
But back in 1966 he was just your average 16 - year - old North Korean schoolboy .
" Most North Koreans who were interested had to listen to the matches on the radio , " he said .
" But we were n't surprised by the performance .
There was a feeling that North Korean football was world class and already the pride of the people . "
After going three goals ahead in the quarter - final , North Korea were somehow outsmarted by their opponents , Portugal , who knocked them out of the competition , winning 5 - 3 .
To have got that far was widely viewed as a spectacular success , although it was one that Mr Shim never got the chance to see his team repeat .
It was suggested that the North Korean authorities were not as delighted as the fans , and there was dark gossip about what might have happened to the players after they came home .
North Korea is likely to use the World Cup for propaganda " People said that during their time in England they were drinking and womanising , " Mr Shim recalled .
" It was rumoured that some of them were sent to the coal mines as a punishment , and that was why our team never again achieved such greatness . "
In fact , the surviving members of the 1966 squad were tracked down a few years ago by a British documentary team given rare access to North Korea .
They found seven of the men alive and well , including " the dentist " himself , Pak Do-ik .
All of them insisted that the team had received nothing but praise for their exploits , on and off the pitch .
Underdogs again
So what of today 's North Korean side ; is it likely to repeat past glories ?
Bookmakers do n't think so , having set the team 's odds of winning at 750/ 1 .
Football has long been a popular game in North Korea
One of the problems may be the lack of exposure North Korean players have to the international game .
Japanese - born Jong Tae-se , dubbed " Asia 's Wayne Rooney " because of his style of play , is one of the few players from the team who plays for a club side outside of the country , turning out for Japan 's Kawasaki Frontale .
And there will be the added disadvantage of a distinct lack of travelling support .
The average North Korean of course , even if he or she had the money , would find it impossible to leave the country .
Any win , though , is likely to be exploited by Pyongyang for maximum propaganda value , and people at home will be willing their team to do well from afar .
Football is genuinely very popular in North Korea .
People of all levels play and practise in parks and gardens , and the capital city , Pyongyang , boasts five major stadiums .
And fans do n't have to look back as far as 1966 for a glimpse of success .
The North Korean women 's football team has a strong track record and happen to be the current holders of the Asian Cup .
Even if the men do n't do as well in South Africa in 2010 , is there not at least the hope that with South Korea also qualifying , this World Cup might just offer a way to break down barriers and introduce to the world a friendlier , more human side of North Korea ?
Maybe not .
The South and North have already met in the qualifying stages , and earlier this year the North declared that one of the games had turned into " a theatre of plot - breeding and swindling " .
The match was held in the South Korean capital , Seoul , and the North accused their hosts of deliberately giving its players food poisoning , a claim denied as groundless by the South .

After six years together , the relationship between a pair of gay male penguins at San Francisco zoo is apparently over , with Harry leaving Pepper for another penguin - Linda .
The Los Angeles Times reported Friday ( local time ) that the relationship between Harry and Pepper , who lived side - by - side protecting eggs abandoned by other penguins , came to a shocking end when Harry moved into a neighbouring nest with recently - widowed Linda .
The development has sparked a variety of reactions in the blogosphere , where Linda has been called a " home wrecker " who " lives for her own happiness , no matter who gets hurt " .
Harrison Edell , a curator of birds at the zoo , had a more pragmatic explanation , noting that Linda 's recently - deceased partner was a leader of sorts among the small zoo penguin community , commanding not one but two nests .
" For penguins , real estate means a lot , " Mr Edell told the Los Angeles Times , so " as far as penguins go , she was a pretty attractive prospect " .
With Pepper rejoining the ranks of the single , Christian website OneNewsNow.com took the split as a sign that " nature prefers heterosexual relationships " .
Others were more sympathetic to the bereft Pepper .
John , writing on The Frigging Loon blog , said he was " heartbroken " about the split and that he hopes Pepper " finds another male penguin that is 10 times hotter than Harry ! " .

Despite the economic reality of an impending U.S. financial collapse , 76 % of young adults between the ages 18 to 29 believe their personal financial situation will improve over the course of the next year , according to a recent Pew Research study .
Adults under age 30 are more likely than those ages 30 - 64 to say they are very confident about getting through retirement with ease .
This overly optimistic attitude prevails even as four - in - ten between the ages 18 to 29 have cut back spending on alcohol or cigarettes , and a third report having changed to a less expensive cell phone plan or cancelled their service altogether .
In Britain , theunemployment rate among adults ages 18 to 24 is 20 % and climbing .
Additionally , the Pew study says one - in - five young adults in this age group have either moved in with a friend or relative or have had a friend or relative move in with them because of the recession .
If the figures in this study are even close to being correct , Generation Y has a big surprise coming to them .
Many young adults have demonstrated remarkable independence and resourcefulness during this recession .
USA Today sites an increase in sign ups for the entrepreneurial programs offered by youth - oriented groups such asand the " Kids are actively considering starting their own businesses , " says Junior Achievement President Jack Kosakowski .
" It might be out of necessity , since there are n't a lot of jobs out there .
But they 're also seeing parents and other adults that have been loyal to companies for years ... getting laid off , so these kids might be thinking , ' Hey , I might be better off being my own boss . '
" But the long slide down to nowhere is just beginning , and this pierced tongued , tattoo generation will be hit the hardest .
Worth noting is almost all of the " Y" ers I 've worked with are extremely intelligent and have an unusually heightened sense of awareness -- but their keen perceptions are soulless and efficiency driven .
It 's almost as if they have a secretly shared , collective mantra inspired by corporate dogma : the 21st century God .
As Kunstler says , the tattoos are a sign of how deeply insecure we are as a nation , and a form of " non-conformist - just - like - you ' consumerism " .
I look on with much curiosity to see how the most consumer worshipping generation on Earth yet will react to the inability to consume .
Will they rise to the occasion as some of their brethren have , or turn to stone -- shiny lifeless pebbles only to be used as fodder for the next world dictator .
We 'll find out when Apple sales go south .
In the early 1980s , legendary Billy Mitchell set a Donkey Kong record that stood for almost 25 years .
This documentary follows the assault on the record by Steve Wiebe , an earnest teacher from Washington who took up the game while unemployed .
The top scores are monitored by a cadre of players and fans associated with Walter Day , an Iowan who runs Funspot , an annual tournament .
Wiebe breaks Mitchell 's record in public at Funspot , and Mitchell promptly mails a controversial video tape of himself setting a new record .
So Wiebe travels to Florida hoping Mitchell will face him for the 2007 Guinness World Records .
Will the mind - game - playing Mitchell engage ; who will end up holding the record ?

A POLICEMAN who helped evacuate hundreds of people from Marysville minutes before fire engulfed the town has allegedly been called before a disciplinary committee for submitting his own statement to the Bushfires Royal Commission .
Counsel for the commission Melinda Richards said Senior Constable Ken Dwight had advised lawyers that he had been called to a disciplinary interview for an alleged breach relating to the fact that his submission was made on a Victoria Police letterhead .
When she asked Deputy Commissioner Kieran Walshe whether he knew about the incident , Mr Walshe said he did not .
When she asked Mr Walshe if it worried him a member who had raised matters that concerned him might be subject to an internal disciplinary process , counsel for the State Government Garry Livermore interjected , saying there was no evidence to support such a claim .
No he does not , he never molested any children but Muhammad did he raped a 9 year old girl , Jesus never promoted child abuse and said who ever caused a child to sin is better off with a rope tied to a iron and wrapped around his neck and be tossed into the sea , Jesus was a child too and he was just like all of us * BUT NEVER SINNED * when he was a child he probably played , snored , or possibly picked his nose , Which is what I do sometimes .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - YouTube frames of ‘ Neda ’ , a young Iranian woman whose face is engulfed in blood , are a horrific image of what some are calling the Tehran spring .
They also show the genie unleashed by citizen journalists .
Identified on the photo - sharing website flickr as Neda Agha Soltan , the young woman shown on cameraphone footage falling , apparently shot , on the edges of a protest at Iran ’s disputed elections has drawn a passionate response worldwide .
Dubbed a “ murdered angel ” on the popular Sina.com Chinese website , her name in Persian yields 15,300 results on Persian language sites according to Google .
In Russia , Moskovsky Komsomolets , a Russian newspaper with a circulation of 2.1 million , carried an article about her on Tuesday on page four .
“ She is called Neda Agha - Soltan and she studied at the philosophy department of Tehran University , ” it says .
“ Over the last weekend , she has become an icon of the opposition movement -- and her photo is on all the placards of Mousavi supporters , many of whom vow revenge . ”
The pictures came from an internet source known to Reuters television .
Since Reuters and other foreign media are subject to Iranian restrictions on their ability to report , film or take pictures in Tehran , they increasingly depend on people like the one on whose cameraphone Neda ’s death was recorded .
Iran has more internet connections than any country in the Middle East .
According to PRI ’s “ The World ” technology podcast it arrested its first blogger in 2003 .
So for some commentators , it is a fitting place for citizen journalism through sites like Twitter , Facebook and YouTube to come of age .
Others see a complex revolution under way .
PROXY CHASE
In the early days after the election , the micro-blogging site Twitter was a prominent venue for the cat - and - mouse game of finding internet proxies for use by people whose access from Iran was blocked .
People posting the web addresses to help Iranians evade government filtering reached a peak when celebrities including the British comedian Stephen Fry joined in , only to be reminded that the Iranian authorities had access to Twitter too .
A frame grab from YouTube shows a woman identified as Neda Agha - Soltan lying on the ground after getting shot in the chest in Tehran June 20 , 2009 .

“ The moment you tweet something some people say ‘ you idiot , you naive fool ... they can close you down , ’ ” he said .
But it was thanks to these proxies that people have managed to release pictures to the outside world .
A journalistic problem with images of demonstrations and violence is that besides what can be seen or technologically verified , the context of events or the identities of those involved often cannot be independently proven .
Some sources check what is offered , starting with knowing their contributors , contacting them by email where possible and using whatever metadata the images carry to verify when , and increasingly where , they were taken .
“ We have to hold ourselves to the same journalistic standards as the mainstream press , ” said Jonathan Tepper , Chief operating officer of photo Web site Demotix , which has placed several photos from people on the ground in Iran with mainstream media in recent days .
“ Things that are true tend to be self - reinforcing , ” he told Reuters , referring to the multiplicity of shots that come in from a given event .
The site licenses still images to earn photographers an average of 150 pounds ( $ 245 ) per image .
PEOPLE POWER
Other examples of how important “ people power ” has become in covering the events via the internet include the role played by the U.S. State department in “ highlighting ” to Twitter its significant role , so the group delayed scheduled maintenance .
And in response to popular demand , Google Earth updated its satellite image of Tehran , in principle to allow people to see better what is happening .
But those with longer experience of social networking sites see a more complex dynamic .
Jeff Jarvis , author and professor of interactive journalism at City University of New York ’s new Graduate School of Journalism , said in his blog the events show how Twitter , by making its code freely available to people for manipulation into useful tools , was becoming indispensable .
“ Twitter is different because it ’s live and social -- the retweet is the shot heard ‘ round the world ’ and because that API ( application programing interface ) lets it survive any dictator ’s game of whack - a- mole , ” he wrote .
“ But it ’s by no means the final word in digital revolutions .
I know we will soon see witnesses and participants to events such as these broadcasting them live from their mobile phones .
We will see people organizing with Google Maps .
We ca n’t imagine what will come next . ”
And cyber security buffs point out that the increasing sophistication of internet technologies has opened up ways in which sites like Twitter can turn people who may think they are merely watching events into participants .
Around June 16 , according to Web sites quoted by computerworld.com , some saw evidence that links highlighted on Twitter were directing people to sabotage other Web sites by demanding high volumes of information at once .
“ With the increase of violence in Iran due to the recently held election , it was just a matter of time when we will see some hacktivism , ” wrote Bojan Zdrnja at the SANS Internet Storm Center , describing what are known as DDoS or distributed denial of service attacks .
“ So far I ’ve seen two groups launching DDoS attacks against Iranian web sites -- in both cases we are talking about technically very , very simple attacks . ”
Phonosemantics is a portmanteau word which suggests the meaning that comes from sounds .
The idea that individual vocal sounds have meaning is not a new idea .
You can find precedents in the Upaniṣads and in Plato .
However it is not a popular idea amongst linguists who deny the possibility of such a relationship .
Try this .
Get a dictionary of English and chose a consonant - but be aware that this experiment works on sounds so the hard / c / and /k/ are the same sound .
To eliminate the confusion I will refer to a phoneme .
Phonemes are indicated by being placed between slashes .
So c can be / c / or / k/ ; and j or g can be either / j/ or /g / ; but k is always /k/.
Take each word which does not have a prefix or suffix , and put it into as many categories of meaning as you need to cover the basic senses .
Words typically have more than one meaning .
Work through all the words that start with that phoneme .
At the end of the process most of the words will have fitted into a small number of reasonably well defined categories .
Those that do not fit a category are typically concrete nouns - they are names for specific things .
In /d/ daffodil is just a daffodil for instance , and has no other referent .
This should take 60 - 90 miuntes .
Repeat for another sound and compare .
I can summarise the results you will find because I have done this experiment as suggested by Margo Magnus the person who first performed it as part of her doctoral research at Trondhiem University , Norway .
Firstly a very high percentage of words beginning with any phoneme , approaching 100 % , which are not concrete nouns will fit into one of about a 10 - 20 broad categories of meaning .
We call this effect clustering .
Secondly comparing two different initial phonemes you will find only limited cross over of categories , and words beginning with one phoneme will not fit well into the categories associated with another phoneme .
Thirdly more subtle patterns emerge when comparing similar phonemes such as / p / an /b/ which are respectively the unvoiced and voiced bilabial stops .
Taking a catergory - such as impacts - words beginning with different phonemes seem to emphasise different aspects of the referant .
Impacts with /b/ are broad and blunt , stay on the surface ; where /p/ words indicate precision , pin-points , and the impact with puncture the surface .
This effect of the phoneme on the symbolism underlying a word we call iconism .
If you work through the whole dictionary you will find the that , at least for the consonants , that this pattern holds true for all the phonemes in English .
Vowels appear to behave in a different manner .
Why should a pattern like this emerge .
I know of three explanations .
1. Bounded Chance
2. verbal roots
3. Sound symbolism
Bounded Chance
Chance is a slight misnomer .
Contemporary linguists hold that the relationship between sounds and what they signify is arbitrary .
If this were so it would predict a random distribution of meanings and sounds .
As the simple experiment above shows there is not a random distribution .
Linguists solve this problem by invoking social convention .
Words that mean the same are given similar sounds because this has become conventional .
The relationship is still fundamentally arbitrary because the sound itself carries no universal meaning , but it does have a relative value in each language .
However this is a weak answer to the pervasive phenomenon of sound symbolism .
One way to disprove this hypothesis would be to demonstrate that clustering goes across languages .
So far as I know a conclusive demonstration of this is wanting , but there are some results which are suggestive .
For instance people have a better than random chance of guessing the meaning of a unfamiliar word in a language they do not speak .
Also some phonemes , such as the compound / str / do appear to cluster in a similar way across languages from different language families - the clustering in one language matches the clustering in another unrelated language for / str / .
Verbals Roots .
As far as I know the scholarly literature has not considered the idea that notional verbal roots underpin clustering .
It occured to me when studying Pāli and becoming familiar with Sanskrit words that verbal roots give rise to a range of words all starting ( on the whole ) with the same phoneme .
These variations fill up dictionaries .
However verbal roots are notional , which is to say that they were arrived at by considering similarities between words and working back to theoretical root entities - verbal roots do not exist in the wild .
It may be that verbal roots in fact offer a confirmation of a relationship which clustering is a manifestation of .
Sound Symbolism
The theory says that there is relationship between phonemes and meaning .
That relationship is non-arbitrary , but also non-linear .
We say that there is a degree of " motivation " behind the choice of phonemes in making a new word .
A strong form of this theory would say that speakers have little freedom in choosing ; while a weak version would say that speakers have much choice .
But any theory of sound symbolism suggests that says that the sounds that make up words , the sounds themselves , carry information .
One very simple experiment , now known from it 's result as " the bouba / kiki effect " shows that sounds can and do act as metaphors for forms in normal people .
The Bouba / Kiki effect
If you look at the image on the right you will see two letters from the " Martian " alphabet .
One of the letters is called " bouba " , and one " kiki " .
Which one is which ?
Irrespective of the language they speak around 95 % - 98 % of people will say that kiki is on the left ( the spikey shape ) , and bouba is on the right ( the rounded shape ) .
This suggests that some sounds do indeed have an inherent symbolic " meaning " .
That meaning is metaphoric and fuzzy rather than literal and linear .
The effect was first noted in 1929 , but more recent studies have confirmed it .
Interestingly children of 2.5 years , too young to read , also make this distinction .
Conventional linguistic theories cannot account for this result .
If the relationship between sound and meaning is arbitrary then there is only a 50 % chance of any two disparate people choosing the same label for each shape .
However experimental results show that across language groups it is extremely unlikely that individuals will make a different choice .
Mechanisms
The mechanism of sound symbolism is as yet unknown .
However one suggestion is that verbal gesture - the use of the lips and tongue - is an aspect of it .
Margo Magnus for instance suggests that a large portion of words beginning with /b/ come under the headings " barriers , bulges , and bursting " because of the action of lips when creating the /b/ sound : viz they come together to form a barrier to the flow of air , resulting in a build up of pressure ( and a bulge ) , and finally a burst of air and sound .
Plato suggested that /r/ connoted movement and activity .
Another promising area is research into synaesthesia .
Someone with synaesthesia interprets sensory experience in one mode via the language of another : they see music sounds as colours for instance , or experience words as taste sensations .
Vilayanur S. Ramachandran has shown that not only are synaesthetes not faking it , but that there is a possible neurologicla explanation .
His work is promising because it demonstrates how sounds might function as metaphorical images for us .
Ramachandran thinks that cross activation between different areas of the brain explain not only synaesthesia , but the whole development of metaphorical thought , and language itself .
In particular areas of the brain which process aural information are next door to those which process visual information .
Cross linking between them gives rise , accoridng to Ramachandran , sight - sound synaesthesia .
Some cross linking is normal and it is this that allows us to perceive for instance sounds as dull or bright ; or colours as loud or muted .
Problems with the Phonosemantic Hypothesis
The many languages / many words problem
The key objection from the mainstream is this : that different languages use different words for the same thing , therefore the relationship must be arbitrary .
However this is a weak argument that involves a number of assumptions which are not legitimate .
Listing the assumptions is useful .
The first assmuption is that a single word refers to a single ' thing ' , and that there is a one to one correspondance between referants between languages .
So for instance a " dog " is a single thing , and the word for that thing in French , say , chien , is a word for that same thing .
This is an extremely naive assumption as anyone who has ever tried to translate from one language to another will know .
Many words do not translate easily , and even when they do they may have both subtle and gross differences .
Language is more frequently marked by ambiguity or multiplicity of reference ( polysemy ) , than by singularity .
We might also ask whether a dog really is a simple phenomena ?
Well , obviously it is not .
A dog has a general body plan and physical characteristics , and a set of behaviours which mark it out as a dog .
The single word dog can take in chihuahua and great - dane ; poodle and bloodhound .
We know it is a dog because we are able to interact with it through our senses in a way which conforms to our previous experience of other dogs .
Some dogs are closer to our mental picture of a dog , and some are much further away .
Given that the dog is complex , and our relationship with it , would it then surprise us to find that there are many English words for a dog ?
Not really .
So why would it surprise us to find that other languages , which often involve quite different patterns of thinking , use different words .
If Swedes say " hund " , might they not relating to the dog in a similar way to us when we choose to call a dog a hound ?
Experience is not simple and linear .
Experience is complex and non-linear .
It is not just processing facts and churning out actions .
Linguistics has a behaviouralist model of the relationship of people to their world as an unstated assumption .
That assumption demonstrably is flawed and misleading .
The foundations of a new theory of the relationship may well be found in the work of George Lakoff and others working in the area of " linguistic categorization " .
Lakoff acknowledges the complexity of experience , the possibility of polysemy , and the importance of relationship in definition and the making of meaning .
Lakoff emphasises the role of metaphor and metonym ( where a part stands in for the whole ) in creating meaning .
Comparing languages with radically different sound pallets
There is an unsolved problem with the phonosemantic hypothesis which is what happens when you compare two languages with very different sound pallets : Māori has 10 consonants , while Sanskrit has 34 .
Māori has at least one sound , / f/ , that Sanskrit lacks .
So far as I know there has been no research on this aspect of sound symbolism .
The vowels
The vowels do not have the same kind of symbolic associations .
The initial phoneme /o/ shows the clustering , but the various sounds associated with the English vowel ' a ' do not seem to .
Research on the symbolism of vowels in words has shown a fairly consistent effect in regard to size - stressed high vowels ( e , i ) sound smaller , that rounded back vowels ( o , u ) .
Think minimum , medium , maximum ( i, e , a ) .
Also in sequences back vowels are later than front vowels : sang , sung .
However no one has researched this in the comprehensive way that Magnus has done for the consonant sounds .
Applications to Mantra
A thorough application of the principles of phonosemantics to mantra has yet to be performed .
But we can at least look at some general applications .
One of the features of aural experience is that we often take in and process sounds unconsciously .
It is well known , for instance , that music evokes emotions without us making a conscious effort to " understand " the music .
There is a good evolutionary bilogical explanation .
Reacting to sounds has a positive survival value : we hear in 3 dimensions , and can typically pin-point the direction of a sound to about 1° of arc .
This we hear some threat approaching and are launhced into action often before we can think .
Our aural systems is fine tuned for this survival : we have emotional responses to sounds .
More than this however we are a social species and many of our interactions are conducted in the medium of vocal sounds .
Anecdotally we say that only a very small percentage of the information in a conversation is down to the words we use .
The bulk of what we are communicating is non-verbal .
Included in this are factors such as intonation , and phrasing : features of language known collectively as prosody .
Prosody gives us clues as to the attitudes and emotions of another person .
It is prosody that allows us to completely change the meaning of a phrase through inflection ( technically known as conversation implicature ) .
I could say " I like your new hair cut " and convey many different messages by varying prosodic and gestural elements , even making it mean the complete opposite .
As a social species this kind of non-verbal information is vital to the healthy functioning of our group , and therefore once again we are highly attuned to it .
We can tell simply from tone of voice for instance , if someone is angry with us , or genuinely pleased to see us .
So on this level also we are atuned to sounds .
If we accept that vocal sounds are also gestures ( in the broadest sense ) , or at least can symbolise a gesture , then we accept that a verbal sound may communicate information from other modes .
This in a way is obvious , but I am drawing attention to it in the light of sound symbolism .
If sounds are no arbitrary , then our choice of sounds conveys information .
What I mean is that we convey information with a word , but that the choice of that word in particular , with those sounds , is a layer of non-verbal information .
Sound symbolism posits a symbolic link between sounds and meaning .
The link is metaphoric or poetic even .
Upon hearing a vocal sound we do not immediately leap to a concept .
We may associate it with an image , or series of images ; or we may simply respond emotionally .
Linguistics on the whole tries to set aside this aspect of language , and to focus on trying to refine the meaning of words , or the structure of grammar and syntax .
Anything which has no precise meaning , or which does not convey a concept is often dismissed out of hand .
Linguists working within this paradigm come to conclusions which are a variation on " mantras are meaningless " .
The exemplar of this is Fritz Staal who uses the tools of Straucturalism and Semantics to try to understand ritual and mantra .
Ritual according to Staal is a set of rules with no meaning , and mantra is not a form of language but a relic of a time before language , a persistance of pre-human animal sounds into the human arena .
Neither of these theories are very attractive , nor do they offer much in the way of insight into the effects of mantra , or why they are such potent symbols .
Staal is a more sophisticated version of the Victorian scholars of Buddhism who frequently concluded that if they did not understand something , then it was incomprehensible to all .
However linguists working within the paradigm of Pragmatics often find more meaning in mantras .
They see for instance poetic devices such as repetition , alliteration , and rhyming in some mantras .
Despite the lack of proper words , a mantra can be using the effects of language to create an image .
Phonosemantics goes even further .
It says that vocal sounds , even single syllables , have meaning .
That meaning is imprecise and metaphoric .
If we accept the phonosemantic hypothesis then we need not conclude that the sounds of mantras have no meaning .
Mantras can be meaningful in the sense that phonemes communicate in images and feelings .
Compare this idea with research that shows that the inarticulate noises we make during conversations - hmm , uh , uhuh , mmm , etc - are packed with meaning .
( see for instance : http://www.nigelward.com/egrunts/
My understanding of mantra in Tantric Buddhism is that its purpose is to give us an experience .
That experience should help us to transform ourselves in line with the Buddhist teachings .
We are highly attuned to Sounds , and vocal sounds in particular , and they are able to produce a physical / emotional response in us without involving conscious cognition .
Sounds can indeed evoke an involuntarily response in us , that is , they can give us an experience .
What is communicated is non-verbal and non-linear - it is metaphorical and symbolic .
What 's more by choosing specific syllables , that have built up and possibily even intrinsic associations , we may be able to direct that experience .
Anecdotally practitioners do often report that different mantras have a different " feel " to them .
A lot of what I am saying here is speculative , and based on an admittedly limited understanding of linguistics , but I think it is plausible .
In this essay I have not appealed to any mystical entity or process .
This is not metaphysics , although a metaphysical explanantion may be more satisfying to some people .
Personally I want to understand the process to better apply it .
If I know how the average person might respond to a given combination of sounds , for instance , then it will be possible to create new mantras designed to evoke a particular kind of experience .
If however mantras are a kind of devine revelation that we must n't tamper with or investigate then we are stuck .
Perhaps Sanskrit mantras do not work so well for Westerners ?
What if one or other of the sounds in English which are not in Sanskrit ( / f/ for instance ) might work better for me ?
What if , having grown up with no retroflex consonants , they merely confuse my aural processing facility ?
A lot of work remains to be done , and there are few people to do it .

Mérida , June 28th 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – Military personnel kidnapped the ambassadors of Venezuela , Cuba , and Nicaragua in Honduras , along with the Honduran Foreign Relations Minister Patricia Rodas , according to Venezuela ’s ambassador to the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , Roy Chaderton .
Chaderton made the announcement just before noon today during an emergency meeting of the OAS in Washington that was convened to respond to the military coup d’etat underway in the Honduras .
“ Excuse the interruption , it is an urgent matter .
I have just received information in this moment that the ambassadors of Nicaragua , Cuba , Venezuela , and Foreign Relations Minister Patricia Rodas have been kidnapped by a group ofhooded military agents , ” said Chaderton .
Rodas confirmed the kidnapping in a hurried phone call to the Caracas - based television channel Telesur as the kidnapping was underway , according to Telesur .
Early this morning , approximately 200 soldiers kidnapped Honduran President Manuel Zelaya from his home and took over the state television station .
A conflict between Zelaya and top military officials erupted this week after the military officials impeded the distribution of electoral materials for a national poll scheduled for today on whether to have a national referendumto re-write the national constitution .
The president of the Honduran Congress , Roberto Micheletti , has been sworn in as de facto president .
U.S. President Barack Obama expressed his “ concern ” and called for all parties to “ respect democratic norms ” and peacefully resolve the conflict .
Zelaya has communicated with Telesur from San Jose , Costa Rica , where the military forcibly transported him .
Troy Schafer found out the hard way that insurance and liability issues trump Good Samaritan deeds at Randalls grocery store in Round Rock , Texas .
The now former produce manager thought he was doing the right thing when he chased a purse snatcher fleeing the store and helped recover Ann Welch ’s stolen goods , only to find out a few days later store management had fired him .
The reason ?
He broke company policy .
According to Randalls spokeswoman Connie Yates , all employees are told not to pursue suspects , for fear of them getting hurt ( worker ’s comp ) or hurting someone else ( civil liability ) .
“ The policy exists for the safety of our employees , customers and others who may be seriously injured in a chase , ” Yates said in a statement .
Schafer said he could n’t help himself when the incident occurred .
“ In a split - second decision , when someone is screaming for help , what do you do ? ” he asked .
“ I did what I thought was right .
I still feel like I did the right thing .
I could n’t look at myself in the mirror the next day if I did n't help that lady . ”
Welch was so appreciative of Schafer helping get her purse back that she offered him a reward .
But Schafer declined .
Welch also vowed to boycott Randalls unless they give Schaefer his job back .

Intel has announced a new brand structure that , over time , promises to do away with a complex structure of too many product names with " a simplified family of Core processors spanning multiple levels " .
That 's the theory , but we 're already a little confused by Intel 's plans going forward .
Judging by a post by Intel communications manager Bill Calder on the Intel Technology Blog , it seems as though the semiconductor giant is taking a leaf out of NVIDIA 's book by attempting to unify its core product line with a common nomenclature , i.e .
Core i# .
However , looking forward , Bill 's information does n't quite paint a crystal clear picture of what will happen in years to come .
We know that the much - loved Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad brands will one day go the way of the Dodo , but the new brands coming in - Core i3 and Core i5 - are n't exactly made clear .
What are they ?
Well , we know now that the Core i5 moniker will be used by upcoming Lynnfield parts , but the rest remains largely a mystery .
With Intel leaving the door agape for conjecture , here 's what we think might be the future line up of Intel 's flagship brand .
Please keep in mind that this is merely hearsay , and we 're simply doing our best to put two and two together .
Core i3 Core i5 Core i7 Core i9 Codename Wolfdale Yorkfield Penryn Arrandale Lynnfield Clarkdale Lynnfield Clarksfield Bloomfield Gulftown Process 45nm 45 nm 45 nm 32nm 45 nm 32nm 45 nm 45 nm 45 nm 32nm Platform Desktop Desktop Mobile Mobile Desktop Desktop Desktop Mobile Desktop Desktop Architecture Core 2 Core 2 Penryn Westmere Nehalem Westmere Nehalem Nehalem Nehalem Westmere Socket ( LGA ) 775 775 775 mPGA-989 1156 1156 1156 mPGA-989 1366 1366 Intel chipset support P35 , P43 , P45 , G35 , G43 , G45 , Q35 , Q43 , Q45 , X38 , X48 P35 , P43 , P45 , G35 , G43 , G45 , Q35 , Q43 , Q45 , X38 , X48 GL40 , GS45 , GM45 , PM45 Unknown P55 , P57 , H55 , H57 , Q57 P57 , H57 , Q57 ( will require FDI for IGP ) P55 , P57 , H55 , H57 , Q57 Unknown X58 X58 Cores / Threads 2 / 2 4 / 4 2 / 2 2 / 4 4 / 4 2 / 4 4 / 8 4 / 8 4 / 8 6 / 12 Hyper Threading No No No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes QPI / DMI DMI DMI DMI DMI DMI DMI DMI DMI QPI QPI Memory Dual - channel Dual - channel Dual - channel Dual - channel Dual - channel Dual - channel Dual - channel Dual - channel Tri-channel Tri-channel Turbo boost No No No Unknown Yes Unknown Yes Unknown Yes Yes L3 cache No No No 4MB 8MB 4MB 8MB 6MB / 8MB 8MB 12MB 45nm IGP No No No Yes No Yes No No No No Availability Now as Core 2 Duo Now as Core 2 Quad Now as Core 2 Mobile Q4 2009 Q3 2009 Q4 2009 Q1 2010 Q3 2009 Now as Core i7 Q1 2010
Now for some observations .
The above table , built from a combination of mostly fact and a little speculation , focuses solely on Intel 's Core range .
Readers should be aware that Intel 's Atom , Celeron and Pentium brands will live on unchanged .
Why not bring them under the Core umbrella ?
Well , Intel wants to keep its
Core brand limited to performance parts - and , let 's face it , a Core i1 just does n't sound quite right .
So , given Intel 's comments , we can speculate and assume that the still - going - strong Core 2 line will live on under the Core i3 brand , where it'll later be joined by the 32nm mobile Arrandale range .
It 's important to note , also , that Intel states that the Core i3 , Core i5 and Core i7 names are not brands but modifiers that signal different features and benefits .
Hence Lynnfield , a mainstream Nehalem part , will appear as both Core i5 and Core i7 when it reaches market .
Trying to make sense of it , we 're assuming that the Core i5 Lynnfield will be without Hyper Threading , whereas the Core i7 alternative will feature eight threads - making it a slower clocked Bloomfield , albeit without QPI and tri-channel memory .
Still with us ?
Good , because there 's also the matter of Gulftown - a six - core derivative of Bloomfield that we reckon could emerge as Core i9 when it reaches the market sometime next year .
Should that be the case , we 'll see Intel 's range span the following multiple levels - Core i3 for mainstream , Core i5 for performance , Core i7 for high performance , and Core i9 for extreme .
It 's all starting to get a little clearer , but model names remain a mystery .
Once Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad are phased out , will Intel continue to make clear the number of cores featured in a single processor ?
If so , will we see a Core i3 Duo and a Core i3 Quad ?
Maybe , maybe not .
On top of that , how will it identify parts with an IGP ?
Will the Clarkdale - based Core i5 arrive with a name along the lines of Core i5 G820 ?
With the G pointing out integrated graphics ?
Who knows .
All that remains unclear , but Intel reckons the simplification process will come good , someday .
What do you think , dear readers ?
Are we painting a logical picture , or would you like to see Intel 's Core line up branded differently ?

APPRECIATING MONEY : Tawa Intermediate School pupil Jonty Boyd has been taught how to put together a budget and is excited about learning even more at school when the course becomes part of the curriculum .
Pupils could mortgage their school lockers , run sweet shops , and learn about personal banking and the sharemarket under an addition to the national curriculum .
The Education Ministry is introducing a financial literacy scheme into schools after a successful pilot programme .
Pupils will be taught how to manage their finances , about hire purchase contracts , interest rates , the ramifications of bad credit ratings , and the importance of financial planning and saving .
Financial literacy will be taught through existing subjects such as maths , social sciences and technology to pupils in years 1 to 10 .
The Retirement Commission began a pilot project at 10 schools last year including Wellington 's Tawa Intermediate and Scots College to help young people develop money sense and counter New Zealand 's poor savings record .
In one of the new teaching resources , pupils are encouraged to consider financial decisions and the consequences of owning a pet .
They will also learn how to set up businesses such as making pickles , screen - printing T - shirts and raising calves .
Scots College teacher Paul Norman , who headed the pilot at his school , said the results were unbelievable .
" It was an incredibly beneficial unit .
The whole idea was for the boys to become familiar with financial terms and an understanding of what money is and the need to look after it .
It was brilliant . "
Mr Norman developed his own currency using a points system , which pupils could earn by completing tasks , such as schoolwork .
He then introduced a banking and tax system .
" The more they earned the more they were taxed .
They were n't very happy with that , but I said , ` Welcome to the real world . " '
Pupils had weekly expenses in the form of fines if schoolwork was handed in late or if their school uniform was untidy .
They also had to take out a mortgage on their school locker and decide if they wanted a fixed term or floating rate mortgage .
" The parental feedback was incredible .
The boys were asking questions about the length of their parents ' mortgage and how interest rates work . "
Tawa Intermediate principal Carolyn Stuart said many pupils now understood how hard it was for their parents to juggle their finances .
" I had some students who said they will never bug their parents for money because they now realise how difficult things can be . "
The scheme will be introduced in August and will eventually include courses counting toward NCEA .
HANGING ON TO HIS MONEY
Jonty Boyd used to spend his money as soon as it was in his hand .
" I was pretty bad and would usually spend it at the movies or something like that . "
But after taking part in a financial literacy course at Tawa Intermediate School , the 12 - year - old has had a change of heart .
" Now I want to save for something big , I 'm not sure what , but I still want to save my money .
" I 'm still pretty average with saving because I do n't get pocket money , but when my parents do give me money I really appreciate it .
" I 'm less likely to go out and spend it straight away . "
He has also been taught how to put together a budget and is excited about learning even more at school when the course becomes part of the curriculum .
" I am pleased I got the chance to take part . "
On the '00s ( the " Naughts " ) ...
Employment Dec 1999 : 130.53 million
Employment Jun 2009 : 131.69 million
A gain of just 1.16 million .
What are the odds that the economy loses another 1.16 million jobs over the next 6 months ?
Pretty high .
That would mean no net jobs added to the economy for the naughts : Naught for the Naughts !
And for the stock market ?

There ’s a new phenomena of people declaring themselves social media experts .
We ’ve actually heard from firms who pushed someone to become their resident social media expert because the person was on Facebook .
There is no endorsement or accreditation to set apart legitimate industry leaders from bandwagon opportunists .
Social media is a hot topic .
We get it .
And we do n’t want to see people getting scammed by self - touting experts ready to make a quick buck .
There are very few people who could , or should in all honesty , be called social media experts .
We ’re sharing this list with our networks , including those not yet involved in the social media world to give them a helpful guide .
1 . They call themselves an evangelist , guru or expert , and no one else does .
2 . They use “ expert ” or “ evangelist ” or “ guru ” or our personal favorite , “ influencer ” as any of their user names .
3 . They “ discovered ” social media in the last six to 16 months , and there ’s nothing online from them in the social media space prior to that .
( Remember – Google is your friend . )
4 . All of a firm or agency ’s “ social media strategists ” come from traditional PR or Marketing agencies .
5 . Everything they learned about social media they learned by reading blog posts ( i.e. no application ) .
You can learn a ton about sex from reading Kinsey ’s manuals , but I ’d still rather be with someone who has some practical experience .
6 . They have n’t done anything of significance using social media ( i.e. demonstrating they know how to apply the tools ) .
Again , see point on Kinsey .
7 . They keep shouting about “ widgets . ”
( Or worse , they ’re still talking about push marketing . )
8 . Their resume does n’t include anything that has to do with social media ( i.e. no results using social media ) .
And no , having a Twitter account does n’t cut it .
9 . Their sound bites eerily resemble what you just heard from Chris Brogan and Brian Solis .
And quite frankly , following them and a few others ( including Sarah ) can usually answer 95 % of your social media questions to begin with .
10 .
Their firm has added social media as an additional service ( as opposed to integrating it into a comprehensive PR approach ) .
If they say “ And we ’ll do Facebook and Twitter ! ” beware .
11 . Any use of the term “ MySpace ” unless you ’re only targeting 14 - year - old males , or independent bands .
12 . Their networks do n’t reflect that they are connected .
( You should probably research them before hiring them .
If their blog has n’t been updated since 2004 yet they tweet every time they take a slurp of Yogurt , something ’s up . )
13 .
When you Google them , it ’s difficult to find them .
If they do n’t show up on the first page of Google , how are they going to get you up there ?
14 .
They never talk to you about free ways to monitor your online presence ( like Google alerts and Twitter search ) .
Perhaps they ’re afraid you can do it yourself ?
15 .
They do n’t maintain an active blog ( at least two posts every month ) .
16 .
Any case studies they present only involve very big companies with very big budgets
17 .
Their lead social media strategist is “ this kid we picked up after his internship ended . ”
18 .
When they talk strategy , there is no approach that encompasses a discussion about : communications , marketing , advertising , business development , internal communications and / or customer service .
19 .
They see “ Social Media ” as a replacement for customer service , when in fact , only good customer service propels positive social media .
20 .
They want to charge you to get you signed up on social media sites ( yuck ) .
21 . There ’s a pay structure that includes a pay - per - post model .
Run very far away , very fast .
22 . The strategy they provide you primarily includes a Twitter profile and a Facebook fan page .
23 . Measurement to them means building up lots of followers and fans .
24 .
After you work with them you ’re just as confused as when you started .
25 .
They ’ve never used Help a Reporter Out ( added by Sarah , not Peter ) .
To Sarah ’s point , they ’ve also not suggested any of the wonderful free services out there before they recommend paying .
This is our list .
We ’re not saying you have to agree or disagree , just that people acknowledge everyone who calls themselves an expert , is n’t .
The list does n’t end here , either .
Share your own “ red flags ” to identifying social media “ expert ” posers .

Shortly after taking office in December 2006 , Mexican President Felipe Calderon mobilized the military to fight a war against drug cartels widely believed to have infiltrated the country ’s police forces .
Since then , 45,000 troops have been deployed to at least seven states , placing some of the most violent areas , such as Ciudad Juarez , Chihuahua , under a virtual state of siege .
More than 11,000 people have been killed and many others wounded in the drug war , and now human rights groups say a relatively small but still disturbing number of those casualties may have been inflicted by soldiers whose crimes have gone unpunished .
Because the U.S. government is helping to fund the drug war , that ’s putting the Obama administration in a quandary .
To be sure , most of the bloodshed has been committed by drug mafias fighting each other for control of the lucrative cocaine , marijuana and methamphetamine trade to the United States , as well as battling the military .
Their brutality extends to signature beheadings , and their armory includes grenades and antitank rockets .
Through threats and payoffs , the multibillion - dollar cartels have successfully infiltrated local and state governments , along with the police , to such a degree that they threaten the stability of Mexico .
Given the danger they represent , we do n’t doubt that the army ’s help was needed .
And yet , the cartels cannot serve as an excuse for the country ’s security forces to commit abuses with impunity .
A modern and moral state demands the rule of law .
And as the Bush administration ’s war policies in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrated , human rights abuses can weaken a country ’s legal system and the legitimacy of its government .
The army is one of the few respected state institutions in Mexico , but the growing list of allegations against it undermines its credibility -- and potentially its success .
As in any war , the government cannot win this one without the support of the population , and the people wo n’t support an army they fear .
Mexico ’s military has not launched coups , and it has n’t been a force for repression as other Latin American armies have been historically .
But it does have a checkered human rights record , dating back to its “ dirty war ” against leftists in the late 1960s and continuing through its battle with the Zapatista guerrillas in the 1990s .
Unfortunately , the unwritten agreement to keep the military out of politics and politicians away from what were broadly defined as “ military issues ” also has meant that the army seldom is held accountable for disappearances , extrajudicial killings or the use of torture .
Advertisement
Against that background , Calderon was taking a gamble when he sent combat forces to fight the drug war , which involves police and intelligence work among civilians -- a role the Mexican military is n’t fully trained to play .
Now , U.S. and Mexican human rights activists say they have documented the murder , rape and torture by soldiers of scores of Mexicans believed to be innocent civilians , and the country ’s National Human Rights Commission received 559 complaints against members of the army in the first six months of this year .
Although Mexican law calls for the military to prosecute its own criminal abuses , advocacy groups note that there has not been a successful military prosecution of a human rights case in the last decade .
The U.S. government has allocated $ 1.4 billion to the counter - narcotics effort in Mexico over the last three years under the so - called Merida Initiative .
By law , 15 % of the funding must be withheld until the U.S. State Department reports that Mexico is meeting certain human rights conditions , including the prosecution of human rights abuses “ in accordance with Mexican and international law . ”
With tens of millions of dollars at stake , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is due to issue her judgment on this condition by the end of September .
The U.S. - based nongovernmental organization Human Rights
Watch has urged her to withhold the money unless abuse cases involving the military are turned over to civilian courts .
Although it gives us some pause , we agree .
U.S. - Mexican relations have improved enormously since the 1980s and ‘ 90s , when the U.S. Congress had to certify Mexican cooperation in fighting drug trafficking annually or the country would face U.S. trade and economic sanctions .
That fostered resentment and foot - dragging among Mexicans , who rightly thought it was hypocritical for the U.S. to pass judgment while it was failing to stem the demand for Mexican drugs north of the border .
Today , the two sides are working closely in the drug fight , as seen most clearly in the extradition of 222 suspected traffickers from Mexico to the United States in the last 2 1/2 years .
We do n’t want to return to the old adversarial relationship between neighbors .
Mexico ’s legislature has become more powerful in recent years , and Calderon has begun to reform a judicial system that has been weak and often corrupt .
We ’d like to see that continue , matched by a more holistic approach to the drug war that includes real training , professionalization and pay for the country ’s police forces .
Ideally , we ’d like to see Mexican institutions act on their own to address the abuse cases and hold the Mexican military accountable , without U.S. pressure .
No country should have an army that is above the law , a condition that ’s poisonous to democracy .
But until Mexico acts , the United States should make the case for justice by trimming a symbolic 15 % from its aid package .
The production met with about thirty different writers , and they all passed , as most of them felt that Iron Man was a relatively obscure character in the Marvel universe .
They were also a bit nervous about working for an untried studio better known for producing comic books .
Even the re-writes led to many refusals .

When Tony reveals the power generation of the first arc reactor he uses in his chest , he gives it in gigajoules per second ( more typically called gigawatts ) .
Since the reactor is generating this much power , the amount of power available to the suit in the ending battle should not be dropping steadily , but should be constant until the reactor stops generating power .
However , given the high amount of advanced technology all constantly being run at the same time while the suit is operational , it 's entirely plausible that the suit is using more energy per second than the reactor is generating ( i.e. JARVIS ' comment that the Mark I chestpiece was not designed for * sustained * flight ) , resulting in a steady loss of total power available and causing him to switch to the backup power source while the reactor catches back up .

Moon to Google .
Standby for liftoff of Google Earth 3D moon mapping .
Well , maybe .
The gang at Google is preparing to embark on some new type of mission , and speculation is running rampant that it 's going to be a groundbreaking three - dimensional moon - mapping utility .
The G - team is keeping quiet for now , but it's not hard to track the signals and see why the moon 's on everyone 's mind .
The Google Moon Map Buzz
You can largely thank Buzz for all the Google moon map buzz .
Google 's press department sent out invitations to reporters this week describing a media event at which famed astronaut Buzz Aldrin will be speaking .
The event is described as " a very special announcement about the newest addition to Google Earth " -- oh , and it 's scheduled for July 20 .
In case your space geek alarm is n't going off yet , July 20 marks the 40 - year anniversary of NASA 's first landing on the moon .
It was that day in 1969 when Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong took that monumental " one small step " -- you know , the one that was a giant leap for mankind and all .
So fast - forward back to 2009 .
Google has Armstrong 's fellow Apollo 11 crew member Buzz Aldrin on - board , along with Andrew Chaikin , a space writer who 's written extensively about Apollo and the moon .
Factor in NASA 's recent progress collecting lunar maps and images with its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter -- and , oh yeah , that little research partnership NASA has with Google -- and you can see why some sort of advanced Google Earth moon mapping appears to be a logical destination .
Either that , or Google 's just acquired the moon and is renaming it gMoon Beta .
The advertising possibilities , after all , would be out of this world .

FINAL UPDATE : Coleman concedes !
Pawlenty says he 'll sign !
[ 1st UPDATE below : statement from Sen. Harry Reid ]
Minn. rules for Franken in Senate fight
By BRIAN BAKST
The Associated Press
Tuesday , June 30 , 2009 ; 2:18 PM
ST . PAUL , Minn . --
The Minnesota Supreme Court has ordered that Democrat Al Franken be certified as the winner of the state 's long - running Senate race .
The high court rejected a legal challenge from Republican Norm Coleman , whose options for regaining the Senate seat are dwindling .
Justices said Franken is entitled to the election certificate he needs to assume office .
With Franken and the usual backing of two independents , Democrats will have a big enough majority to overcome Republican filibuster .
Coleman has n't ruled out seeking federal court intervention .
Ken
UPDATE : SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY
REID HAS ISSUED THIS STATEMENT --
I congratulate Senator - elect Al Franken , the next Senator from the state of Minnesota .
The people of Minnesota will now finally get the brilliant and hardworking new senator they elected in November and the full representation they deserve .
After all the votes have been counted and recounted , the Minnesota Supreme Court has made the final determination that Minnesotans have chosen Al Franken to help their state and our country get back on track .
The Senate looks forward to welcoming Senator - elect Franken as soon as possible .
He will play a crucial role as we work to strengthen our economy , ensure all Americans can access and afford quality health care , make our country more energy independent , confirm the President ’s outstanding nominee to the Supreme Court , and tackle the many other challenges we face .
I once again encourage Governor Pawlenty to respect the votes of his constituents and the decisions of his state ’s highest court .
He should put politics aside , follow his state ’s laws and finally sign the certificate that will bring this episode to an end .
#
By the way , the ruling unanimously rejected outright all of Coleman 's claims , and that 's with the two justices who had participated in the recount commission not participating .
--
Unfortunately , the ruling does n't seem to include the death penalty for Norm Coleman -- and Sen.
John Cornyn and the rest of his election - stealing supporters -- for kidnapping the U.S. electoral system .
Now the ball is in Governor Pawlenty 's court , and he has indicated that he might actually be prepared to do his job certifying the election .
“ Cocksure : The Psychology of Overconfidence ” is the title of Malcolm Gladwell ’s recent piece in the New Yorker , where he investigates the mental - space of decision - making .
Gladwell analyzes financial collapse and war , arguing that beyond the conventional explanations of those predicaments ( structural mishap and cognitive deficit ) , there is a psychological dimension at play .
In high - stakes situations , we suffer from a more deeply rooted conundrum : a crisis of overconfidence .

Gladwell ’s tales of a brazen Bear Sterns ’ CEO and a feckless British officer deftly illustrate how confidence misapplied can lead to dire situations .
However , it is not overconfidence alone that creates a global financial collapse or failed military operation .
Gladwell contends that leaders of all stripes and industries , in war and peace , recessions and booms , base their future behavior on what created past successes .
Instead of understanding current situations as ones requiring different and new thinking , leaders often fail to adapt .
In many ways design is the ultimate practice of adaptation .
Designers modify their environments by creating objects and systems to promote better behaviors and experiences .
But are there times when we resist adaptation ?
In design , as in business , do n’t clients or partners deliberately select us because of our track records of past successes ?
Because our portfolios give an indicator of future success , are we really encouraged to drift away from what we know ?
I would answer yes , and yes .
Designers are confident in greeting new situations with agility .
We meet challenges with freshness , optimism , and creativity .
I believe that .
I say it every day .
I am a professional designer .
But then the winners of the IDSA International Design Excellence Awards ( known as the IDEA awards ) were announced .
I was one of what award - sponsor BusinessWeek dubbed the “ 20 world ’s top designers , ” who had the privilege of judging the 1,600 + entries .
It was an extremely rewarding experience , and I was engaged and delighted by the caliber of conversations in the judging , and of course in the excellent entries .
In fact , it was such a positive experience that I started to poke around in the archives of IDEA winners to get a richer sense of the history of which now I was a part .
I started in 2000 .
And I found something surprising :

2000 Phantom Desktop and 2009 Karbon
These two winners shared a surprisingly similar look and feel .
I wanted to find out if this was an anomaly , so I pulled some more winners .
2000 View - Master Virtual Viewer and 2009 Argus Bean Children ’s Digital Camera
2000 LabSpec Pro® Spectrophotometer and 2009 HP FIREBIRD
2000 Stanley IntelliSensor Digi Scan and 2009 All Area male body shaver concept
2000 Herman Miller Caper Seating and 2009 Steelcase Cobi Chair
advertisement
2000 NEC Z1 Personal Computer and 2009 Venue 40
2000 Portable Cooler and 09 Ridgid® SMARTCART ™
Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner
Perhaps the similarity of these highlighted designs suggests a continuum of aesthetics in our field , or a consistent ethos in the creative community .
But maybe it ’s something different–perhaps it also indicates our lack of adaptation .
Consider how the world has radically , unalterably , unyieldingly transformed in the last decade .
In the year 2000 , we did n’t have Google , 9/11 , the iPod ( or the iPhone ! ) , the war on terror .
Wal - Mart was a chain store , not the global monarch of retail .
At that time , our most serious financial concerns involved the failure of Pets.com .
Enron and AIG were icons of performance .
Fast - forward to 2009 : with all of the change in this decade alone , should n’t design look different ?
If designers are truly cultural shape - makers , why are we awarding the same thing we awarded almost ten years ago ?
Gladwell might suggest that we are suffering from an “ illusion of control ” where be believe so stridently in our past decisions , that “ we overestimate the accuracy of our judgments . ”
It ’s natural that based on our experiences , we select what we believe to be good .
But maybe in this new world order , it ’s not good enough .

Design is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in business .
Designers regularly work with corporate leaders , leading foundations , and governments around the world to solve the most complex problems of our time .
We ask industry for higher - order challenges , we are requesting that design students graduate with more nuanced strategic and holistic skills , but still measure our successes with a beauty shot and a 200 word description .
We remove context to look at the artifact , instead of understanding the system at work .
We evolve competitions by cleaving on new categories of relevance ( I ’ve recently been an eco - design judge , a do - gooder judge , a social justice judge ) , instead of reconceiving the entire platform .
Design is at an inflection point .
We are playing a more significant role in industry and policy .
Now our challenge is how to describe our value .
We need to adapt to our current role in the world , as problem - solvers not stylists , as collaborators not lone inventors .
We need to represent and celebrate what design actually does , not the way it used to look .
Saul Bass said , “ Design is thinking made visual . ”
What does design thinking look like ?
More importantly , what does it look like now ?

Hxcpp 1.0 , neash 1.0 , NME 1.0
The release this week of haXe version 2.0.4 officially includes c++ as a build target , for Windows , Mac , Linux and iPhone .
You can download and install from haxe.org .
In addition to the standard includes , you will need the “ hxcpp ” library , which can be insatlled with the included haxelib management tool .
Coincident with the hxcpp release , I have updated the neash and NME libraries to versions 1.0 .
You can also download these via the haxelib tool too .
There are several incrental improvements , and the iPhone target has been added !
Getting started with the iPhone
Getting started with the iPhone is quite tricky at the moment , mainly because of the pain of setting up an Xcode project .
Also , getting the simplest program onto the device is hard due to the code signing requirements .
So if you can already get one of the existing application templates to work , you are half way there .
Note that this solution uses the “ SDL ” library , and must statically link against this .
SDL is covered by the LGPL license , and this has implications should you choose to release your software .
I am hoping to remove the LGPL restiction at a later date .
The binaries used here are have been compiled for the “ 2.2.1 ” iPhone SDK .
So choose this version when compiling for simulator or device .
Download and install components
Get haxe & neko : Visit haxe.org
Visit haxe.org
Get hxcpp : haxelib install hxcpp
haxelib install hxcpp
Get nme : haxelib install nme
haxelib install nme Get neash : haxelib install neash
haxelib install neash
Get the sdl- static libs for iphone : I have created a project with binary builds of these .
You can get the latest builds directly from subversion svn code at :
http://code.google.com/p/sdl-static/source/checkout.
Or get the snapshot bundle from this site and install somewhere handy :
sdl-static-iphone-1.0.zip
Get Xcode with iphone sdk support – visit apple.com
Get a Developer key ( you can try simulator without it ) .
You will need to pay to sign up as a developer on the apple site .
Fire up Xcode and do File > New Project .
Choose iPhone OS > Application .
Here choose a “ Windows - Based Application ”
but infact we will use the delegate setup in the SDL code , so we will have
to delete the one created by the wizard .
Select a name & directory for the project .
I ’m calling it “ Haxe Test ” .
Now as it stands , you should be able to build for the Simulator and
get a lovely white screen and a program called “ Haxe Test ” in the simulator
start screen .
Next thing is to delete ( to trash ) the “ … AppDelegate.h ” “ … AppDelegate.m ” ,
the “ Nib Files ” group , Resources / MainWindow.xib and “ main.m ” .
Finally , select the “ Haxe Test ” executable ( in the Targets section ) and from the “ Get Info ” –
“ Properties ” tab , clear the reference to “ MainWindow ” .
We will add replacements for these soon .
Add “ main.cpp ” from the NME project .
Select the top - level project folder and then use Action > Add > Existing Files .
It is probably in / usr / lib / haxe / lib / nme/1,0/ndll / iPhone / or
similar depending on which version of NME you have installed .
It can be
very painful to get xcode to load from this location , unless you hit
Command - Shift - G at the “ Add ” dialog and type ( at least some ) of this filename in .
Choose to “ Copy to destinations folder ” so
that you can mess with it if you wish .
Note : you need to have a cpp mainline
in order to automatically link in the correct runtime libraries .
Add the libNME.iphoneos.a and libNME.iphonesim.a files from the haxelib NME project .
You can add them both and the linker
will select the correct on depending on your build .
They are in the same place
as main.cpp , you you should be able to use “ iPhone ” from the pull - down box
in the add dialog .
Probably best not to copy these files – in case you want
to change them at some stage .
Add the whole sdl - static / lib / iPhone directory .
Again probably best not to copy .
I used the “ Recursively create groups ” option .
These will be where you stored them
in step 1 .
Add the whole hxcpp / bin / iPhone directory like above .
Again , this will
be in a path like / usr / lib / haxe / lib / hxcpp/1,0,2/bin/ iPhone /.
Add the hxcpp include directory to the include path .
Use the “ Info ” button
to get the project properties , and on the build tab , under “ Search Paths ”
add something like / usr / lib / haxe / lib / hxcpp/1,0,2/ include / to “ Header Search Path ” Now we are ready for the haxe code .
If you have and existing project ,
then you can adapt the following instructions .
Create a new file from Xcode ( Other / Empty File ]
Here I have called it “ HaxeTest.hx ” , and unticked the “ Targets ” option .
I ’m prety sure there is a way to get “ Haxe File ” to appear as on option here – but I do n’t know the details .
In the haxe file , enter something like ( Note the window size ) : import flash .display .
Sprite ; import flash .display .
Shape ; class HaxeTest extends Sprite { public function new ( ) { super ( ) ; flash.Lib.current.addChild( this ) ; var circle : Shape = new Shape ( ) ; circle.graphics.beginFill ( 0xff9933 , 1 ) ; circle.graphics.drawCircle(
0 , 0 , 40 ) ; circle.x = 150 ; circle.y = 200 ; add Child ( circle ) ; } static public function main ( ) { neash .
Lib.mOpenGL = true ; neash .
Lib.Init( " HaxeTest " ,320,480 ) ; neash .Lib.SetBackgroundColour(0x447733 ) ; new HaxeTest ( ) ; neash .
Lib.ShowFPS ( ) ; neash .
Lib.Run ( ) ; } }
This is the “ main ” file for haxe , and the hxcpp compile will create a library matching
this class name .
Set up a build script to build changes you make to your haxe files into a library .
Xcode has a few issues with a straight custom build script order due to incorrect
dependency checking .
This can be worked around by first adding a custom target .
Highlight the “ Targets ” in the Groups & Files and use the “ Action > Add > New Target .. ”
Choose “ Other > Shell Script Target ” and call it something like “ Compile Haxe ” .
Close the pop-up and go back to the explorer .
There should be a “ Run Script ”
entry under the “ Compile Haxe ” target if you expand it out .
Get info on “ Run Scipt ” and enter the following script if [ " $ CURRENT_ARCH " = " i386 " ] then haxe - main HaxeTest - cpp cpp - lib neash - lib nme -- remap neko : cpp -- remap flash : neash - D iphonesim else haxe - main HaxeTest - cpp cpp - lib neash - lib nme -- remap neko : cpp -- remap flash : neash - D iphoneos fi
You can untick the “ Show Environment ” if you do not need to debug this .
One last step – drag the “ Compile Haxe ” target into the “ Haxe Test ” target .
It should now also show up as first item “ under ” the “ Haxe Test ” target .
The build order should now be correct .
( See image at end of post ) Now you are ready to do the build .
The first time you build , the build
results will show “ Running custom shell script … ” for quite a while .
Haxe compiles to cpp very quickly , but it take a while for the cpp files
to compile to a library .
You can see the progress if you expand out the
middle tab bit .
At this stage , you should get a bunch or errors when linking , but also haxe
should have created a library for you .
Add this library to the project –
it should be in the local cpp/HaxeTest.iphonesim.a.
Compiling now gets a bunch of unresolved functions from frameworks .
Add the following frameworks to the project ( Add > Existing Frameworks ) : QuartzCore
OpenGLES
AudioToolbox
These can be found in / Developer / Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS2.2.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/.
Run !
So you should be good to go .
Open up the debug console so you can see
any traces / printfs .
Change the target to “ Device – IPhone OS ” from the pull - down and hit “ Build and Go ” .
Again , this takes quite a while the first time .
Now add the new cpp/HaxeTest.iphoneos.a library to the project .
Now you need to sort out your code signing .
If you have not done so already ,
setup you apple developer account & certificates on the apple web site .
Go to the info of the “ Haxe Test ” executable and the “ properties ” tab .
Change the “ Identifier ” to match one of your cerificates .
Make sure to
match your company URL .
You may want to use “ * ” when creating your
profile for easy changing .
Under the “ Build ” tab , under the “ Code Signing ” bit
in the “ Any iPhone Device ” pull down your profile .
If you do n’t have one then
you will need to create one on the apple website .
Connect up your iPhone ( iPod touch ) and build !
W00t !
I have had all sorts of errors when trying to upload to the device .
So far , they have been solved by getting out of the car , walking around it and getting back in .
ie , Disconnect and power down ipod .
Fully exit Xcode and the start it all up and try again .
Also , uninstalling the app from the “ Windows > Orgainiser ” directory can help .
But now the easy bit .
Change to HaxeTest.hx file , and hit Build & Go . It is that simple .
Errors should show up nicely in xcode .
You can add data files ( eg , pngs , xml etc ) to the project and they will be copied to device so you can open them with a relative path .
In the properties of the “ Info.plist ” you can set a Icon File – do n’t forget to add the icon to the project too .
Not covered here ( because I have not fully sorted it out myself ) :
Syntax highlighting in XCode
Debug build ( hxcpp can do then – it ’s a matter of setting up Xcode )
Code completion in Xcode
Automating this procedure !

Add framework path , SDL version , MainWindow clearing .

The following is a letter I recently wrote to the editor of my local newspaper , the Dodge County News .
I am not sure if it will be published in the edition that should be coming off the presses right now , but I do expect it should be included in next weeks edition .
I have included in my salutation that I am a fiscal conservative Atheist and included my website , hoping to get some feedback from the local folks but I am actually quite nervous about it .
See , I am out about my lack of belief … I do n’t do anything to hide it and if someone asks me anything about religion I am more than glad to let it be known that I am indeed an Atheist .
I have not , however , made an uninvited public statement as of yet which is why I know that members of my family and the family of my wife may be surprised to know of this and it may be a shock to them .
Therefore , before I post this letter , let me just explain a few things :
Disclaimer
I did not choose to be an Atheist , I simply chose to think critically about my religious beliefs and it led me to this place , I am not making an effort not to believe , I simply find it impossible to continue belief in any god especially the god of Christianity .
This is not the fault of anyone , it has nothing to do with a less than perfect ( though it had it ’s high points , do n’t get me wrong ) family life or any sort of trauma over the problems that my family has had .
I do not hate the religious , I respect those that wish to continue believing .
I have no intention of fighting the religious establishment in this town publicly .
I just want to see common sense used when political rallies are held and false pretenses are used to attract participants .
I still believe in the freedom to believe in whatever god or gods you please so long as your belief does not drive you to harm other people , I would fight to keep that freedom for everyone if there was ever an attempt to take it away .
My morals have not changed , there are no black robed satanic rituals occurring at my home nor any wild orgies .
I still love my wife and am wholly dedicated to my marriage .
None of my opinions , views , beliefs , or lack of beliefs are necessarily shared by my wife .
She believes whatever she wants to believe and I have not made any effort to stop her from believing in god .
Please do n’t apply any words that you read here to my wife because they simply are not her statements .
If you want to know about her beliefs or disbelief you will have to ask her though she does n’t seem too very inclined to discuss those things with a whole lot of people .
If you came here after reading my letter please feel free to comment in the comments section , I will not censor any views so long as there are no threats made against myself or my family .
Sometimes people do irrational things in the name of god and I know that %99.9999 of you would never do anything to harm another person , but for that individual that cannot tolerate questioning his / her beliefs people like me on occasion fear the repercussions of not participating in the status quo .
I love my fellow man , I care about this country , and I worry about it ’s future – this is why I wrote this and why I continue my blog in the way that I do .

My Gripe with the T.E.A. Party of Dodge County Georgia
Editor ,
This Independence Day there was a gathering of concerned citizens at the ChasMar parking lot under the banner of a T.E.A. ( Taxed Enough Already ) Party .
Who ’s stated goal and purpose was to speak out against bad fiscal policies and overspending in our local , state , and federal governments ; all of which are things that I think need to be protested and fought against as strongly as possible .
I went to the T.E.A .
Party expecting to protest these things and hear people talk about how spending is simply out of control in Washington and elsewhere .
What I got was something entirely different .
I know that I live in a very religious minded community , so I would never expect even the most secular of functions to go on without some sort of prayer or homage to god .
What I do expect is for a group of adults to keep their focus on the task at hand : taxes and wasteful spending .
What I got was anything but that .
I was fine with a prayer but I saw no real reason for a Christian Flag to be present , we were supposed to be protesting issues of government – not issues of faith .
However , the flag was a mild disappointment compared to the speakers , two of four saying nothing or next to nothing about government policy and focusing almost entirely on getting America “ Back to God ” .
The worst of these had to be the preacher from Solid Rock Church of God ( I ca n’t imagine why clergy were asked to speak about taxes anyway …. they make a living off of a tax exempt business ) who thought that this was his opportunity to rail against abortion and the Ten Commandments not being displayed absolutely everywhere , among other things that are generally fed to masses in order to get them riled up however far from the truth these things may be .
The only substance of this speech was religious in nature or something along the lines of calling “ liberals ” a bunch of “ communists ”
( It sounded as if he had never read anything by Marx or Engels – I digress ) .
I did n’t go to hear that , nor was it advertised as a religious rally - so why was I subjected to it ?
I do n’t care if you and everybody else want to believe in god or Jesus , I would gladly lay down my life to make sure that your right to religious freedom is preserved in this country , but turning what is supposed to be a political rally into a parking lot revival is dishonest and rude to those that do not believe as you do and it completely avoids real solutions to real problems .
Prayer and repentance are not going to change this nation , only action can do that while prayer is only an excuse to avoid getting your hands dirty .
Alienating unbelievers that want to see conservative fiscal policies in this nation is a really bad idea so I recommend that from now on the TEA Party organizers stick to politics when it comes to the rally and put their religion anywhere else .
Another thing that was forgotten by every speaker and most attendees at the rally is the fact that the Bush administration has n’t had a balanced budget in 8 years and that trillions of dollars have been thrown at Iraq and Afghanistan with no end in sight – what have these wars accomplished that sovereign people could not on their own ?
For some reason it was forgotten that bad fiscal policy did n’t start with President Obama , it began long ago and only got worse with Bush in office .
If I remember correctly though , there were no TEA Parties in Dodge County for those 8 years , or even toward the end of his term when the TARP was signed .
I reckon everyone was too busy praying for the President to notice all of his screw ups .
Even during the primaries , when it actually mattered a little more – no TEA Parties .
No one really seemed to give a rip until Obama got elected and simply continued the same bad policies of the old administration , too late now .
I was so shocked by the religious nature of the Dodge County rally that I had to go to the official website to see if this was what normally occurred at these events ; I found out that most of the events actually focus on taxes …
So I have to find fault with someone and I do :
The organizers and speakers .
The organizers failed to find relevant individuals to speak on this subject opting for clergymen that could n’t control their zeal and the speakers decided to use their time as opportunities to throw bible verses around proclaiming this nation a Christian one ( A very very wrong statement ) .
Let me remind you folks , America is NOT a Theocracy nor was it ever .
In closing let me just ask this of the organizers of the T.E.A
Party for next time :
1 : Focus on fiscal policy
2 : Find qualified speakers
3 : Include information on the cost of the war & foreign policy , protest that too
4 : Remember that this is n’t something that began with Obama and avoid ad hominem attacks on his administration
5 : Do n’t preach at me

Police numbers have hit a record high in England and Wales , with 143,770 officers in post in March this year , according to official figures out today .
The Home Office said this was an increase of 1,911 officers over the previous 12 months and included 1,200 constables .
The increase includes 648 police community support officers , who have a patrolling role , to bring their total to 16,331 .
The number of such officers has grown rapidly from only 1,176 when the role were introduced in 2003 .
The new figures for the 43 police forces in England and Wales indicate that budget cuts and efficiency savings being faced by chief constables have not yet led to a reduction in police numbers .
However there was not a uniform rise across the country .
While 27 forces increased their numbers , including an extra 1,100 recruited by the Metropolitan police in London , 16 forces reported a fall in numbers .
The largest falls were recorded in North and South Yorkshire and Humberside .
Women now represent 27 % of rank and file police officers but only hold 13 % of senior posts .
There are now 6,290 black and minority ethnic police officers , an increase of 497 in the last year .
However this represents only 4.4 % of the total and fails to meet the 7 % race equality target set for the police .

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
He was black and white , the perfect gift for the 6 - year - old daughter of Donna and Ronald Gleason .
His name was Tommy .
The death and mutilation of Tommy the cat has been linked to a serial pet killer , say police in Miami , Florida .
The black and white tuxedo cat was one of a dozen pets that have been killed and mutilated recently by someone in the Miami area , police said .
On Thursday , the list of confirmed cat deaths and mutiliations grew to 19 pets , police said .
They are looking into another 14 feline fatalities .
The Gleasons do not want their daughter 's name to be published .
Donna Gleason asked the child to leave the room before telling CNN the gruesome details of what happened to their cat .
" Part of his skin was missing underneath ... and part of his legs , " Gleason said .
" He was partially skinned . "
Miami-Dade County police say Tommy 's demise is part of a string of sadistic feline fatalities that have occurred recently in the Cutler Bay and Palmetto Bay areas of southern Miami - Dade County , south of Miami .
Miami-Dade Police spokesman Bobby Williams said two of the cat carcasses were " posed . "
He said that anyone capable of such cruelty toward and torture of an animal " is disturbed at some sort of level . "
The crimes began May 13 .
A reward of up to $ 10,000 has been offered for any information leading to an arrest .
Do n't Miss WPLG : 5 more cats found mutilated
Police have been inundated with dozens of phone calls from people who have discovered dead cats throughout the community .
Investigators have determined that most of the cases are not related to the string of cat killings .
The number grew from 12 to 15 to 19 in just the past two days .
Ronald Gleason found Tommy lying in their yard May 25 .
At first , he thought his family 's pet had been killed by a dog , but a closer look revealed the cruelty behind his death .
Tommy was a gift for the Gleasons ' little girl .
She desperately wanted a cat , Donna Gleason said .
She searched for a cat that could get along with their dog , but none of the shelter cats they brought home was compatible .
" We prayed that we would find a nice cat that liked our dog , and a few days later , he just showed up at our front door , " Donna Gleason said .
Tommy was adopting them .
The Gleasons put signs up in the neighborhood , and when no one claimed him , they kept Tommy .
" It 's disturbing to know that this happened right in front of your house , while you 're sleeping inside , " Donna Gleason said .
" I 'm not terrified , but I 'm not sleeping as well as I used to . "
Others in south Miami - Dade County are telling similar stories .
A woman whose Siamese mix cat , Caesar , was killed and mutilated did n't want her name published .
" This person killed my cat .
He does n't need to know anything else about me , " she said .
" I do n't know if it 's a gang initiation thing or a satanic ritual thing , but to do what he 's doing , he has to be extremely sick . "
The month - long cat - killing spree has police concerned .
" We 're telling people to be aware where their cats are at .
Keep your pets inside , " said Williams , the police spokesman .
" If anyone looks or acts suspicious , call police , " he added .
" Have us come out there and check them out .
This could be the missing link we 're looking for . "
For the Gleasons and 11 other cat owners , it 's too late .
All they can do is break the news gently to a little girl who always wanted a kitty .
" She loved him and played with him every morning .
...
She just misses him , " Donna Gleason said .
" We told her that Tommy was killed by an animal , " she said .
Then she added , " Well , an animal did kill him . "

The top 10 first round steals of the last 10 years
Everyone loves to focus on the lottery , but there are good players to be had in the late first round as well .
A while back , I put together a list of the top second round picks of the modern era , so now I ’m going to focus on those players that were drafted between pick # 21 and pick # 30 in the first round .
( Note : If a player was drafted in the second round , even if they were taken with the # 29 or # 30 pick overall , they are ineligible to make the list .
Sorry , Gilbert . )
Since there are more star - quality players available in the 20’s , I ’m limiting this list to the last ten drafts ( i.e. 1999 through 2008 ) .
It is sometimes tough to rank older players with newer players , but even if a younger player holds more trade value right now , I am going to take into account each player ’s entire career .
For the young guys , I have to project a little bit , so keep that in mind as you read and react .
I feel great about the top eight guys , but there are a few players that missed the list that are pretty interchangeable with # 9 and # 10 .
On with the list …
10 . Aaron Brooks , Rockets
26th pick in 2007
I had to decide between Brooks and Nate Robinson here and went with Brooks given his fine performance in the playoffs this season ( 16.8 ppg , 3.4 apg , 42 % from 3PT ) and how Robinson ’s numbers are a little inflated playing for Mike D’Antoni .
Brooks is not a natural point guard , but his sharpshooting is a good fit given Houston ’s inside - out attack .
He ’s small , but he ’s quick and is able to score at the rim when given some daylight .
The Rockets feel good enough about Brooks to trade Rafer Alston away midseason , so you have to like his upside .
9. Kendrick Perkins , Celtics
27th pick in 2003 ( drafted by the Grizzlies )
In the world of “ big ” guys , I also considered Boris Diaw here , but it ’s tough to pass on a 6 ’ 10 ” 24 - year - old who averaged 8.5 points , 8.1 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game on a team loaded with vets .
Without Kevin Garnett in the playoffs , the C’s needed Perkins to step up his game and he responded with 11.9 points , 11.6 boards and 2.6 blocks per contest .
He also did a pretty good job on Dwight Howard , who had his worst numbers of the playoffs against the Celtics .
8. David Lee , Knicks
30th pick in 2005
Isiah Thomas could n’t make a good trade to save his life , but he could spot talent in the draft .
Lee has turned out to be a steal with the last pick in the 2005 draft .
He ’s an athletic lefty whose best traits are his hustle and smarts .
In just his fourth season , Lee averaged 16.0 points and 11.7 rebounds per game , which made him one of the most consistent double - double guys in the league .
His stock is so high right now that the Knicks might be able to use him as trade bait in order to land Chris Bosh or Amare Stoudemire .
Maybe they ’d be better off sticking with Lee …
7. Gerald Wallace , Bobcats
25th pick in 2001 ( drafted by the Kings )
Even though he plays in Charlotte , Wallace has a reputation for being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league .
Throw in the fact that he ’s a capable scorer ( 15.9 ppg last season ) and you have one of the best all - around small forwards in the league .
His jumper is improving ( if slowly ) , but he ’s at his best when he ’s using his superior athleticism to attack the rim .
If he had landed in a bigger market or for a better team , he would n’t be playing so far under the radar .
6. Andrei Kirilenko , Jazz
24th pick in 1999
AK - 47 was named to just one All - Star game , but has made three All - Defensive teams .
Let ’s not forget that Kirilenko was Utah ’s leading scorer in the 2002 - 03 season , the year before the arrival of Carlos Boozer .
Then came Deron Williams , and Kirilenko has settled into a more complementary role as a key defender , shotblocker and rebounder .
He has had an up - and - down few years in Utah , but the fact remains that he was one of the top picks of the late first round .
5. Tayshaun Prince , Pistons
23rd pick in 2002
At Kentucky , Prince was known more for his offense than he was for his defense .
The reverse has been true since he entered the league in 2002 .
He was named to the All - Defensive 2nd Team four straight times , while averaging better than 13.2 points per game for the last five seasons .
His jumper is ugly , but it goes in , as evidenced by his 40 % accuracy from long range last season .
Simply stated , he is one of the most productive “ glue guys ” in the league and he was instrumental in the Pistons ’ solid run over the last seven years .
4. Kevin Martin , Kings
26th pick in 2004
Here ’s a guy that has made himself into one of the best scorers in the league .
He has always possessed great quickness , but has gone from shooting 20 % behind the arc in his rookie season to just over 41 % last season .
He can score in a multitude of ways and was second in the league in free throws attempted with 10.3 per game ( behind Dwight Howard and ahead of Dwyane Wade ) .
Moreover , he ’s just 26 , so he has room to grow .
3. Josh Howard , Mavericks
29th pick in 2003
Sure , he ’s kind of a knucklehead , but there ’s no doubt that Howard has game .
He slipped in the draft because of an apparent lack of upside .
When he came out of college , he was n’t a superb athlete and was n’t great at any one thing , but he was a very good all - around player , which is why he won the ACC Player of the Year in his senior season at Wake Forest .
In the NBA , he has steadily improved his offensive repertoire and has a reputation for being one of the better defensive small forwards in the league .
He was named to the All - Star game in 2007 and is often used as evidence that it ’s not always smart to pass on a proven college upperclassman for perceived upside .
2. Rajon Rondo , Celtics
21st pick in 2006 ( drafted by the Suns )
Rondo slipped in the ’06 draft due to concerns about his non-existent jumper .
As a second - year player , he successfully molded his game to fit with veterans Paul Pierce , Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to help lead the Celtics to a title in 2008 .
He was named to the All - Defensive team in 2009 , and when Garnett went out with a knee injury late in the year , Rondo turned it on come playoff time .
In the first round against the Bulls , he averaged a stellar 19.4 points , 11.6 assists and 9.3 rebounds , including two triple - doubles .
Due to his work ethic , energy and the tutelage of Doc Rivers , he ’s quickly becoming one of the best young point guards in the game .
But can he keep this career trajectory once the Big Three start departing and defenses can afford to pay more attention to him ?
1. Tony Parker , Spurs
28th pick in 2001
Parker is just 27 and already has had an illustrious career .
He has been named to three All - Star games , and was the Finals MVP in 2007 when it became apparent that the Cavs did n’t have a guy that could stay in front of him .
In fact , there are very few players in the league who can effectively defend Parker , who is one of the very best at getting to the rim in transition and off the pick and roll .
He has helped the Spurs win three titles , and it has been interesting to see his transformation from a 19 year - old rookie to wily veteran over the past eight seasons .
It will be even more interesting to see how he adjusts to being “ The Guy ” as Tim Duncan gets older and less productive .
Parker went late in the first round because he was a foreigner ( remember , international scouting was not as sharp in 2001 ) and because he was / is short and slight .
But he really benefited from the rules changes that reduced hand checking on the perimeter and has flourished since he joined the league .
Honorable Mention : Nate Robinson , Boris Diaw , Delonte West , Rudy Fernandez , Morris Peterson , Samuel Dalembert , Leandro Barbosa , Courtney Lee , Jarrett Jack , Kenny Thomas , John Salmons , Jordan Farmar , George Hill , Linas Kleiza and Beno Udrih .
What can we draw from this list ?
1 . There are four small forwards —
Howard , Kirilenko , Wallace and Prince — that are all known more for their defense than their offense , and Howard and Prince both scored in the high teens in college .
2 . There are three point guards on the list .
Two were deemed too small ( Parker and Brooks ) and the other could n’t shoot ( Rondo ) .
3 . There is a power forward ( Lee ) and an off guard ( Martin ) who are known for their tremendous work ethics .
Lee is a big - time hustler on the court and Martin is a gym rat who has transformed himself into one of the best scorers in the league .
4 . There ’s a 6 ’ 10 ” center ( Perkins ) who came to the NBA straight out of high school .
It ’s especially tough to find a good big late in the first round , as anyone with size and talent is usually long gone by now .
Check out this list of 6 ’ 10 ” or taller players that were drafted in the late first round over the last 10 years : Pavel Podkolzine , Iakovos Tsakalidis , Kosta Koufos , Dalibor Bagaric , Primoz Brezec , Johan Petro , Mamadou NDiaye , Tiago Splitter , David Harrison , Samuel Dalembert , Jeff Foster , Nenad Krstic , Ryan Anderson , Josh Boone , Brian Cook , Serge Ibaka , Ian Mahinmi , Donte Greene , Leon Smith and Joel Freeland .
While there are a few contributors on that list , the vast majority ride the bench or are n’t even in the league .
The lesson ?
Go small .
Look for a player with an impressive work ethic .
Try to find someone that has the physical tools to play good defense or a point guard that is too quick to be covered .
These are the types of players that seemed flawed , but have the potential to develop into first round steals .

We do n't have much to go on yet , but Swedish television is reportedly claiming that Koenigsegg , makers of ultra high - performance exotic supercars , and a group of Norwegian investors have signed a letter of intent with Saab to take over the brand from General Motors .
Final negotiations will reportedly take place in the coming months .
Along with Saturn and Hummer , Saab was put up for sale by GM before the automaker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
Many companies and investor groups from all over the world , including China , were reportedly interested in the Swedish brand , and despite how crazy it sounds , Koenigsegg was thrown into the list of finalists late last month .
What we thought was crazy has reportedly come to pass .
Do you think Koenigsegg and Saab , two automotive brands that share a home country and sell completely different kinds of cars , will work well together ?

The 2008 hurricane season was one of the most active on record .
In this image , taken on Aug. 28 , 2008 , three storms can be seen in various stages : Fay , Gustav and Hannah .
( ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) )
Changes in the nature of global weather phenomenon El Niño may be causing an increase in the total number of hurricanes as well as their likelihood of hitting land , new research suggests .
El Niño forms in the Pacific , but it affects circulation patterns across the globe — from drought in Australia , to the Indian monsoon and the number and severity of hurricanes in the Atlantic .
Conventional El Niño events involve warming in the eastern Pacific .
But a new wrinkle might be emerging as a phenomenon dubbed El Niño Modoki ( from the Japanese meaning " similar , but different " ) shows warming in the Central Pacific — similar to that which is seen during La Nina years .
" Normally , El Niño results in diminished hurricanes in the Atlantic , " said Peter Webster , a professor at Georgia Tech 's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , who led a research team studying the issue .
" But this new type is resulting in a greater number of hurricanes with greater frequency and more potential to make landfall . "
Warming in the central Pacific Ocean is associated with a greater - than - average frequency and increasing landfall potential along the Gulf of Mexico coast and Central America , the report said .
The study 's findings are published in the July 3 issue of Science .
The value of hurricane - related damages averages $ 800 million during El Niño years , and as much as $ 1.6 billion during La Nina years , the report said .
Forecasters predicted lower than average hurricane activity in 2004 , which was expected to be an El Niño year .
But the season ended up being unusually high — a total of 15 tropical cyclones developed in the North Atlantic , of which 12 were named storms .
Cylcones caused a total of $ 40 billion in damages and led to the loss of 3,000 lives that year .
Changes in the characteristics of El Niño could have huge ramifications for the insurance industry , as well as making storm - ravaged areas better able to avert catastrophe .
" This new type of El Niño is more predictable , " said Webster .
" We 're not sure why , but this could mean that we get greater warning of hurricanes , probably by a number of months . "
As to why the form of El Niño is changing to El Niño Modoki , that 's not entirely clear yet either , Webster said .
" This could be part of a natural oscillation of El Niño , " he said .
" Or it could be El Niño 's response to a warming atmosphere .
There are hints that the trade winds of the Pacific have become weaker with time and this may lead to the warming occurring further to the west .
We need more data before we know for sure . "
The research team is currently looking at changes in La Nina , which is showing signs of changing its structure as well .

Ireland 's vote is vital for the future of the EU treaty EU leaders have agreed a deal they hope will secure the Lisbon Treaty a " Yes " vote in a second Irish referendum .
Ireland won legally - binding assurances that Lisbon would not affect Irish policies on military neutrality , taxes and abortion , diplomats said .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said leaders had agreed to Irish demands that the guarantees would be given the status of a treaty " protocol " .
But he stressed it would not affect the other 26 member countries .
The leaders have also agreed in principle to a new framework of rules to oversee the EU 's financial sector .
On Thursday they backed Jose Manuel Barroso for a new term as president of the European Commission .
Smoothing concerns Speaking at the end of the summit , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the agreed protocol was " specific to Ireland " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The protocol status is no different from any other clarifications in other states , " he said .
He said the new protocol would " only be subject to ratification at the time of the next accession treaty " .
He did not give further details , but it is thought it will likely be attached to Croatia 's EU accession treaty .
The Lisbon treaty has been ratified in most EU countries and the second Irish referendum - expected to be in October - was the biggest remaining hurdle .
Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen had said fears that the EU might be able to override Irish policies were among the factors that prompted voters to reject the Lisbon Treaty in a referendum last year .
This decision will not necessitate any re-ratification of the treaty
Draft EU summit conclusion
Mardell 's blog : Pandora 's box Irish treaty guarantees in brief Q&A : The Lisbon Treaty EU sets basis for finance reform Supporters of the treaty - a complex set of institutional changes aimed at making the enlarged EU more efficient - were keen to avoid any new round of referendums on it , after years of negotiations .
Sweden , the incoming holder of the EU presidency , was anxious to move forward over Lisbon , especially as Britain 's Conservative Party has pledged to hold a referendum on the treaty if elected to government .
Opponents of the treaty see it as part of a federalist agenda aimed at weakening national sovereignty .
Financial concessions
The EU leaders also backed a framework for enhanced oversight of the financial sector , after the UK won key concessions to the plans .
The UK had opposed proposals to give a new oversight body the ability to order national governments to use taxpayer money to bail out failing banks .
" Stronger cross - border supervision is in our interests , " Gordon Brown said .
" UK taxpayers will be protected .
The City of London will stand to benefit from this " .

The draft summit conclusions say the European Council - the assembly of EU leaders - " stresses that decisions taken by the European Supervisory Authorities should not impinge in any way on the fiscal responsibilities of member states " .
The leaders want the European Commission to deliver detailed proposals for the new supervisory bodies by early autumn , so that the new framework will be in place next year .
In another concession to the UK , a new European Systemic Risk Board will not automatically be chaired by the head of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) .
The ECB will still elect the chair , but the new body will not be controlled by the 16 - nation eurozone .
The board 's job will be to spot any threats to financial stability across the EU .
On Thursday , the leaders unanimously nominated the conservative Jose Manuel Barroso for a second term as EU Commission president .
He had no rival - and even had backing from some centre - left leaders .
His nomination now needs the approval of the European Parliament next month .

Undocumented income makes it hard to get a loan Mortgages
Jennifer France ( left ) and her partner Pouneh Toutounchian work in a home office at their home in San Carlos , Calif. , on Thursday , July 2 , 2009 .
The couple has been unable to refinance their home with a 30 - year loan despite drawing good incomes from their self - employed businesses .

With more than $ 300,000 in combined annual income , tens of thousands of dollars in the bank and credit scores that top 800 , Jennifer France and her partner would seem like ideal candidates for a mortgage refinance .
But when they applied to swap an interest - only loan on their nearly $ 1 million San Carlos home for a 30 - year fixed that locked in today 's low rates , they were summarily denied .
The reason : effectively , because both operate their own businesses .
" I was really surprised , I had been preparing to refinance for years , " said France , a landscaper and gardener .
" It 's hard for the self - employed ; that puts us in a bind . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
While the amount they make is easily enough to qualify for the new loan , tax deductions for self - employed workers dropped their official income below the threshold that banks wanted to see .
A few years ago , theirs would have been the ideal scenario for a stated - income or no-documentation loan , which allowed individuals with ample but unconventional sources of income to secure home loans .
But after untold numbers of borrowers lied about their financial wherewithal to buy homes they could n't afford , often with a wink and nod from mortgage brokers , nearly all lenders stopped offering what became known derisively as " liar loans . "
Now even the well - qualified borrowers for whom the products were first intended can't get them .
Stricter rules
Most real estate professionals acknowledge that lending rules need to be stricter than during the go - go days of the housing boom , when nearly anyone could qualify for a $ 500,000 mortgage .
But many worry that the industry has overcorrected for the subprime lending fiasco by discarding nearly everything but traditional loans , trapping people in costly products and preventing transactions when the market needs them most .
" They 've made it across the board , for everyone , no matter how much you have in assets and what you 've done , " said Fif Ghobadian , a broker with Guarantee Mortgage in San Francisco , who worked with France and her partner , freelance Web designer Pouneh Toutounchian , on their attempted refinancing .
The refinancing would have saved them nearly $ 2,000 in monthly payments and allowed them to begin paying the principal on the mortgage .
They were ultimately able to modify their loan through one of the federal stimulus programs , but it lowered their payment by only about $ 1,500 and the loan remains an interest - only mortgage .
Ghobadian said she could point to at least 20 similar cases in recent months .
One client retired from a bank with nearly $ 1 million in assets but was turned down for a refinancing by that same bank because the individual 's income , while substantial , consisted mostly of 401 ( k ) disbursements and rental income .
Missing the point ?
Eliminating certain loans is a simplistic solution to the credit market turmoil that misses the bigger point , said Richard Redmond , a broker with All California Mortgage in Larkspur .
Given the evolving shape of the workforce , there needs to be a wide array of flexible tools to meet the needs of responsible consumers , he said .
The real problem was n't any particular type of loan but a lack of accountability that allowed lenders to push risky mortgages off their books by packaging them and selling them to third parties .
" There was no responsibility up the chain , " he said .
" The guy who made the loan could n't care less if the loan went bad , because nothing happened to him .
If loans go bad , a price should be paid by everyone . "
The Obama administration 's proposed overhaul of the financial regulatory system , outlined last month , includes a plan to force lenders to retain a portion of the loans they originate .
The California Mortgage Bankers Association , a Sacramento trade group representing real estate lenders , has n't taken a position on that part of the proposal , spokesman Dustin Hobbs said .
He did say that banning products is n't the right approach and stressed that the industry 's decision to stop underwriting certain loans is n't permanent .
" It 's a reaction to the current environment , " he said .
" There 's such a lack of appetite for risk right now in general that any product viewed as having any sort of risk at all has a tough hill to climb . "
Chris George , president of CMG Mortgage in San Ramon , predicts that no -doc loans and other nontraditional mortgages will begin to re-emerge over the next six months , as creditors gain confidence .
" As with injuries , as with your credit , as with the economy , time heals all wounds , " he said .

In an odd ruling , a Michigan state agency that deals with professional licensing has closed an investigation into RIAA 's unlicensed pirate investigators MediaSentry , saying that without evidence of payment from the RIAA , there is no case .
The investigation was prompted by Randy Kruger , father of one of the RIAA 's targets .
MediaSentry , a long time partner of the RIAA in their numerous court cases against alleged pirates where it was responsible for collecting evidence , has been criticized by various parties .
The company ’s evidence gathering techniques have been described by experts “ as factually erroneous ” , “ unprofessional ” and “ borderline incompetent ” .
In addition , MediaSentry is lacking the proper license required in some states to actually perform the evidence gathering .
Michigan is such a state , which spurred a father of an alleged file - sharer to dispute the legitimacy of RIAA ’s ( former ) partner so the evidence provided by them can be discounted .
If found acting as a Private Investigator within the state , the company committed a criminal act .
That would have a significant negative impact on any evidence they provided to a court case , indeed it might disqualify it entirely .
Without the evidence of the alleged infringement provided by MediaSentry , there is no case to answer .
Enter the Michigan Department of Energy , Labor and Economic Growth ’s ( DELEG ) Bureau of Commercial Services ( BCS ) .
They regulate and maintain the lists of professional licenses in the state .
Their investigation has turned up no license , but more critically , no evidence of payment from the RIAA either .
Without that , there ’s no business being performed , which means there ’s no need for a license .
As such , the BCS has closed ( thanks to Ray Beckerman ) their investigation .
However , while the case is closed for now , the letter does say it can be reopened if new evidence on payments is produced .
Since the case came out of a current lawsuit ( SONY Music Entertainment v. Kruger ) it should n’t be hard to get evidence of the business relationship admitted into evidence .
Once that ’s done , MediaSentry might be in some hot water .
As the BCS later states , “ The Court may impose a civil fine of up to $ 25,000 for a violation of the Act .
The Court may also find a person practicing without a license guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment . ”
MediaSentry ’s pirate snooping amateurs might be working for free – but that ’s unlikely – as we all know the RIAA ’s position on getting anything for free …
The daughter of two held followers and a former detainee tell of continuing abuse 10 years after China launched its crackdown
The men from China 's national security brigades came for Natalie Qiao 's parents at 10 pm on 8 June .
Five young men in plain clothes bundled the elderly couple into an unmarked car .
The crime of Qiao Yongfang and his wife , Yan Dongfei , both aged 60 and residents of Huhot City , in Inner Mongolia , was to be practitioners of the banned Falun Gong religion , which has tens of millions of followers in China .
Ten years after the prohibition on Falun Gong was ordered by China 's former leader Jiang Zemin , commencing a brutal crackdown on its adherents , believers such as Qiao 's parents are still being pursued , despite international protests .
The only change is that the persecution is now more secretive .
Amid new protests in Britain , including a march today from the Chinese embassy to Chinatown to mark the anniversary of the Falun Gong crackdown , Natalie Qiao and a former detainee have described the continuing abuse , providing a detailed insight into how those deemed enemies of the Chinese state are dealt with .
Anyone practising religious observance outside officially sanctioned channels , including members of unofficial Catholic churches or Protestant house churches , risk detention .
Other groups at risk include Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region , especially those branded as religious extremists by the authorities .
Falun Gong has been treated most harshly .
Supporters outside China claim 2,000 have died in custody since 1999 , and the UN alleges that the group 's members feature disproportionately among those who have suffered torture and abuse .
It is this that Qiao – who will hand in a petition to Downing Street on Monday – fears most .
" They took my parents after dark .
They do n't want people to know .
The persecution is almost underground , " said the 35 - year old purchaser , who lives in Watford .
" I got a call from one of the members of my family in China .
They had tried to call my parents ' phone and a strange man had answered and demanded to know who was calling .
They do that to find other members of Falun Gong .
" My uncle then went to my parents ' house .
The building attendant did n't want to talk but finally he said what happened .
But even then the local police would not admit they had been arrested .
They said they did n't know .
In the end we heard it through a friend in the police who told us they had been taken to detention centre number one .
" We are not allowed to talk to them .
When we rang the National Security Brigades they said my parents were not co-operating .
They have not written a letter denouncing Falun Gong or given names of other practitioners .
My extended family at first refused to believe what was going on .
They said the persecution of the Falun Gong was over .
But it 's happening every day . "
Natalie is terrified about what is happening to her parents , amid well - attested reports of the serious maltreatment of Falun Gong detainees who refuse to renounce their beliefs , as well as darker , unproven allegations that some who have died in custody have had their organs harvested .
Annie Yang , an antiques dealer who fled to London after being released from a re-education through labour camp , knows at first hand what Qiao 's parents are going through .
" I was arrested in March 2005 , " she said .
" I was living in Beijing and was a practitioner of Falun Gong .
They came for me in the evening .
I 'm a single mother and I was with my 16 - year old son .
Only one of the men was wearing a uniform .
None of them showed ID .
" I told them I was a mother .
But they took me and left my son on his own .
They took me to a detention centre where they kept me for 40 days without access to a lawyer .
At the end they said I had been sentenced to two years in a labour camp for being a member of Falun Gong . "
According to Yang , it was commonplace until 2004 to use physical violence to make members recant and give up more names .
She was subjected to a more insidious abuse .
" The camp made gloves .
But I was not allowed to work or have enough food or water until I renounced my beliefs .
I was made to sit on a stool for 21 to 22 hours a day .
I had to keep my back straight and my knees and feet pressed together with my hands flat on my thighs .
I was told I was not allowed to close my eyes .
If I did , they would swear at me .
" If I wanted a drink I had to say : ' Please class leader ...' and before I put down my cup : ' Please class leader ...'.
The only food I was allowed was half a 30g Chinese bun .
It was hard and sour .
No vegetables .
I became so thin .
It was so hot too .
In the 40s .
And they would not give me enough water .
" After three months I could not take it .
I was nearly mad .
I renounced .
They force you to .
They say if you do n't we will extend your sentence .
Against my conscience I gave them names too . "
The persecution of Falun Gong is all the more peculiar for the innocuousness of the religion .
Without any real formal leadership structure and no role of membership as such , adherents of the religion , founded by Li Hongzhi in 1992 , follow so - called traditional qigong practices for both spiritual and physical development as detailed in Falun Gong 's literature .
Without formal rituals of worship , its central tenets are truthfulness , forbearance and compassion .
Falun Gong , which emerged in large part out of ideas prevalent in some aspects of alternative Chinese medicine , came to be regarded as a threat to the Chinese state after 10,000 of its practitioners staged a silent protest at the Communist party 's headquarters in April 1999 to complain about attacks on its members , a move that led to its banning two months later .
Accused of being an unregistered religion , spreading superstition and defrauding people , official organisations – crucially – attempted to suggest it was a politically motivated organisation , suggesting the real motive for the crackdown : the perceived threat it posed to the Communist party by its massive appeal .
Amnesty International 's UK director , Kate Allen , who has been following Qiao 's case , said : " This is a heartbreaking story – Natalie 's parents were due to visit the UK to see their grandchildren at the end of the month .
Now instead of preparing for a family visit , Natalie is worrying about their safety in a Chinese detention centre .
" Nobody should be locked up for their peaceful religious beliefs .
Yan Dongfei and Qiao Yongfang should be released immediately and unconditionally , unless the Chinese authorities are going to charge them with an internationally recognised crime and give them a fair trial . "
It ’s no surprise that the PlayStation 2 is selling like hotcakes with its recent price drop .
But the PS2 is not only winning in terms of sales , but also gaming usage time according to the latest Nielsen data .
As seen in the chart above , the PlayStation 2 received the most playtime in comparison to the other consoles , leaving the 360 in a close second .
While the PlayStation 3 is lacking severly in play time , a look at the PC chart may show a good outlook for the PS3 ’s future .
Reigning at the top of the PC chart is World of Warcraft and Second Life , both of which are MMOs .
Since the PS3 is getting quite a number of MMOs , with one being completely free , the playtime for the PS3 might be rising dramatically in the near future .

A motivating and well thought out approach , using Python and other free resources .
NOTE : This review relates to the first edition of this book ( ISBN : 978-1933988498 from 2009 ) .
Computer programming is a skill that all children should have the opportunity to learn .
Indeed a couple of decades back I assumed that by now it would be on an equivalent footing with reading and writing on the school curriculum .
Sadly my prediction has n't materialised so I 'm very pleased to discover this new book written by a father and son team to help make up for a very real deficiency in the educational system .
Learning to program is a mind expanding experience so while the book has been written to appeal to a young audience it has a lot to offer all beginners .
It adopts a logical approach and presents clear explanations backed up by well chosen examples .
So that you can proceed without having to buy any software , the book uses Python as its teaching language and provides it , together with the examples used throughout the book , on its own website in versions for Windows , Mac and Linux .
You are encouraged to type in at least some of the examples but having them supplied is obviously a bonus .
You might have reservations about using Python as a teaching language - but it's not a bad choice when you consider its characteristics .
It 's an interpreted language which means feedback is fast and problems can be corrected interactively - always good when you are learning .
It is object oriented so its a modern language but you can write code without using objects so these more difficult ideas can be slotted in after the basics like flow of control and methods have been mastered .
It 's also named in honour of Monty Python and who can resist the temptation to remember , and reproduce the old jokes - any excuse is a good one !
The book employs a child - friendly style and is suitable for any beginner aged from 9 to 99 .
The language is straightforward and there are plenty of graphics that aid communication .
Certain characters appear at intervals .
The most important one is Carter - the book 's junior co-author .
He appears with questions and comments that draw attention to key points and as you get deeper into programming it 's Carter who notices when things do n't work as they should .
There 's also a bespectacled girl who appears with hints in " Thinking like a programmer " boxouts in early chapters and a youth carrying a surf board whose messages under a " Do n't Worry , Be Happy " banner offer reassurance .
I particularly liked the oriental - looking granny who provides information about how things were different " in the good old days " of early personal computers .
Word boxes for important jargon and technical boxouts that explain what 's going on at the hardware level also contribute to a varied and highly informative presentation .
Self test questions ( with answers ) appear at the end of every chapter together with practical problems for the reader to solve - again the solutions are at the end of the book .
The book provides a well - structured course in programming .
In the very first chapter , having taken you through installing Python and the IDLE editor , you get off to a flying start by running two programs .
Chapter 2 is where we get down to basics starting with variables , numbers and strings ; quickly proceeds to arithmetic operations ; looks at types of data and then considers input .
In Chapter 6 on GUIs the number guessing game from Chapter 1 is revisited and is transformed into something more sophisticated .
I have some reservations about the degree of complexity encountered in the next chapter on tests for conditions and was relieved to discover that only the for loop is introduced at this stage in the following one .
The idea of commenting code is introduced next and then Chapter 10 is devoted to a skiing game that uses the techniques introduced so far .
I would have preferred to have the program listing interspersed with explanatory text - instead there are terse explanations annotating the listing - but , despite the encouragement to type the game in as useful exercise , I imagine many readers will use the supplied program as a shortcut that gives them more time for playing it !
The game also serves as an introduction to Pygame , a Python module that crops up frequently throughout the rest of the book .
The level ramps up quickly in the following chapters which having introduced nested and variable loops , lists and functions proceed to objects in a chapter that covers attributes , methods and classes along with polymorphism and inheritance .
Modules and namespaces come next and are followed by the potentially troublesome but obviously appealing topic of graphics .
This opens up lots of potential for games programming and is followed by a chapter on sprites and collision detection , complete with code for controlling bouncing balls .
This leads logically on to considering events in a chapter that culminates with programming PyPong , a version of the classic bat and ball game .
Sound effects and music are added to the game in the next chapter which covers sound .
Chapter 20 shows how to create GUIs using PythonCard and introduces the components - buttons , text and so on - that make up a GUI .
It presents a program for converting temperatures in Celsius to Fahrenheit as a example .
Print formatting and strings is covered next and then comes file input and output , with a game of hangman as its example .
This is followed by randomness with dice and card games and computer simulations with a lunar lander and a virtual pet to program .
This brings us to the end of the book .
I was amused to read in its " What 's Next " chapter the recommendation of locating 1980 's titles of books of games programs written in BASIC and a reminder that QBASIC still exists .
Perhaps it 's time to dust the cobwebs off the many such volumes currently neglected on shelves or relegated to attics .
This book is a very good introduction to programming and can be recommended to anyone , young or old , who wants to start learning this vital and highly enjoyable skill .

Also , the U.S. is believed to be able to produce twice as much wind energy than previously laid out in a 2008 study .
( 16 times more than current consumption ) .
Rural areas of Russia and Canada are said to be the best areas for power generation , which is based around the distribution of 2.5 - to 3.0 - megawatt turbines in relatively temperate and open landscapes .
The three were part of a gang who tortured Mr Baker at his home
Three men who were part of a gang which tortured a 75 - year - old man to death in a burglary at his Wiltshire home have been jailed .
Reginald Baker was stabbed and battered in an attack in September 2008 .
Daniel Coker , 23 , and Trevor Gray , 19 , from Salisbury , admitted manslaughter and were jailed for six years and five years and nine months respectively .
At Bristol Crown Court John Wilkinson , of Ferndown , Dorset , was jailed for three years for conspiracy to burgle .
He had been cleared of a burglary charge relating to an earlier raid on Mr Baker 's Landford home .
After the murder they drove off without any thought or care as to what had happened to Mr Baker
Det Ch Insp Sean Memory
Two other men , John James , 19 , and Joby Barney , 25 , were found guilty at Winchester Crown Court in May of murdering Mr Baker .
Barney , of Alderholt , must serve a minimum of 30 years in prison and James , of Salisbury , at least 28 years .
At the end of their trial Barney and James were told by Mr Justice Royce their " prolonged , savage and callous attack almost defied belief in any civilised society " and that they did not posses " one ounce of human decency " .
' Brutal murder '
The attack was captured on a hidden camera installed after Mr Baker had previously been attacked .
" This is a case where five men conspired together to commit burglary and the subsequent brutal murder of a vulnerable and terminally ill man in his home , said Det Ch Insp Sean Memory of Wiltshire Police .
" The three men sentenced all played a significant part in these offences .
" They were aware that some violence was to be used against Mr Baker .
After the murder they drove off without any thought or care as to what had happened to Mr Baker .
" In fact during that evening were socialising as a team , " added Det Ch Insp Memory .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) --
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck Friday morning in the Gulf of California , off the western coast of Mexico , the U.S. Geological Survey reported .
The quake 's epicenter was near the southern tip of Baja California , about 42 miles ( 68 kilometers ) southwest of the city of Ahome in Sinaloa state and about 661 miles ( 1,064 kilometers ) southeast of Tijuana .
Tijuana is across the border from San Diego , California .
The temblor occurred at 5 a.m. local time ( 7 a.m. ET ) .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries .
All About Mexico • Baja California
The population regulation one .
“ The chief goal of all other species is to turn food into offspring .
More food means more offspring .
It is this biological logic that underlies the perennial fears of human overpopulation .
Most creatures live in environments that correspond to open access commons .
Recent fertility trends strongly suggest that the simple biological model of human breeding is wrong , or at least , is wrong when the institutions that support economic freedom and the rule of law , e.g. , markets , price stability , honest bureaucracies , security of private property , and the fair enforcement of contracts , are well - developed .
Economic freedom and the rule of law are the equivalent of enclosing the open access breeding commons , causing parents to bear more and more of the costs of rearing children .
In other words , economic freedom actually generates an invisible hand of population control . ”
So I started golfing this summer .
If you can call it that .
I 'm still in the " pathetically hitting buckets while eight - year - olds laugh at me "  stage , not even close to the " let 's play the back nine and have a few drinks "  stage .
Yeah , I 'm nowhere near actually playing a game , let alone playing any of these .
But maybe they are something to aspire to , at least some of them .
Here are 10 of the most unique golf courses in the world .
1. Prison View Golf Course , Angola , Louisiana .
Have you ever wanted to play a round in the shadow of one of the most formidable prisons in the United States ?
You can !
The nine - hole course was built and is maintained by prisoners , who are n't allowed to play on it .
It was designed by the prison dentist and appears to be much like any other golf course " ¦ except for some of the rules .
Anyone wanting to play must apply 48 hours in advance so they can be screened , and play may be suspended at any time " due to institutional need or at the Warden 's discretion . " 
2. Kabul Golf Club , Kabul , Afghanistan .
The greens are brown ( even nearly black ) , but that does n't stop people from playing .
Originally opened in 1967 , the Kabul Golf Club has had a spotty history ever since .
It closed in 1978 because it was considered a symbol of Western capitalism , but reopened in 2004 .
Since it was used as a military training site during those non-golfing decades , it had to be swept for landmines before anyone could play on it again .
I 'd still be a little wary about playing on it , personally !
3. Mosul , Iraq .
It may not be there anymore , but in 2004 , some homesick soldiers made a makeshift hole using an antenna and an oil rag as a flag .
It was so popular that five more holes were added and the impromptu Mosul golf course was born .
4. McMurdo Station , Antarctica .
You might remember from my post a few weeks ago that McMurdo boasts Antarctica 's only ATM .
Well , it also boasts the only golf course on the continent .
OK , OK , it 's a disc golf course , but I thought it was worth a mention .
It warns that the " varied "  terrain includes snow , ice , drifts and high winds .
You think ?
5 . The Coeur d'Alene Resort Golf Course , Coeur d'Alene , Idaho .
It 's not so much the location that makes this interesting , it 's the 14th hole .
It floats , it moves , and you can only get to it by taking " The Putter Boat Shuttle . " 
6. Camp Bonifas , South Korea .
There 's a reason Sports Illustrated called this the most dangerous hole in golf " “ the rough is full of land mines , and unlike the course in Kabul , these have definitely not been removed .
One of the SI reporter 's shots actually set one off .
But there 's only one hole , so your flirtation with danger will be brief .
7. Furnace Creek , Death Valley , California .
It 's the lowest golf course in the world at 218 feet below sea level , and you 're definitely going to want to bring something to keep yourself cool : summer temperatures can exceed 130 degrees Fahrenheit .
They used to close the place during the summer , turning it over to a cattle rancher and letting his sheep keep their fairways tended .
But now it 's available year - round in case you really feel like breaking a good sweat .
Oh , and you have to watch out for the coyotes that are prone to wandering onto the course .
There 's also the Devil 's Golf Course in Death Valley , but you wo n't be able to play it " “ it 's just a large salt pan that made weird salt crystal formations .
It was nicknamed in a 1934 guide book that claimed " Only the Devil could play golf "  on its surface .
8. Uummannaq , Greenland .
It 's home to the World Ice Golf Championship and offers stunning views of icebergs and formations ; it also offers frostbite and hypothermia if you 're not careful .
It 's a lot like normal golf , except the greens are called whites and the golf balls are red " “ obviously , you 're going to lose track of a typical white orb .
The course changes every year based on the position of the fjords and icebergs .
Interestingly , Rudyard Kipling used to play snow golf during the Vermont winters in the later 1800's to keep himself amused while writing The Jungle Book .
9. Golf Merapi , Mount Merapi , Indonesia .
On the day in 1994 when the construction started on this course , Mount Merapi volcano erupted .
It 's a mere five miles away , so this could have been a cause for concern .
It was a minor affair , though , and locals saw it as a blessing from the Gods .
The Sultan calls it his home course , and it is said that it never rains when he plays .
Another eruption did occur in 2006 , big enough to send golfers scurrying for home .
" That is the risk of putting a club here , "  the owner casually said .
10 . La Paz Golf Club , La Paz , Bolivia .
If you 're going to golf the lowest course the world , you might as well golf the highest course as well .
La Paz Golf Club is 10,650 feet above sea level and takes golfers some time to get used to .
But once they do , they 're singing the praises of the course : most golfers report that balls seem to go straighter and fly higher than they do anywhere else .
True , or psychological ?
Either way , the view is amazing .
Some of the terrain is referred to as moonscape because of the appearance of the eroded sandstone that surrounds it .
Other scenery includes snow - capped mountains in the distances and , sometimes , condors circling overhead .
What about you ?
Have you ever golfed a course with particularly cool scenery or an interesting hole ?
Share in the comments !
And if you 're a pathetic golfer like I am , share that too " ¦ make me feel better .

Even More Change We Can Believe
In :
The directed energy pain weapons will now be mounted on helicopters and generate multiple beams .
Via : New Scientist :
THE Pentagon ’s enthusiasm for non-lethal crowd - control weapons appears to have stepped up a gear with its decision to develop a microwave pain - infliction system that can be fired from an aircraft .
The device is an extension of its controversial Active Denial System , which uses microwaves to heat the surface of the skin , creating a painful sensation without burning that strongly motivates the target to flee .
The ADS was unveiled in 2001 , but it has not been deployed owing to legal issues and safety fears .
Nevertheless , the Pentagon ’s Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate ( JNLWD ) in Quantico , Virginia , has now called for it to be upgraded .
The US air force , whose radar technology the ADS is based on , is increasing its annual funding of the system from $ 2 million to $ 10 million .
The transmitting antenna on the current system is 2 metres across , produces a single beam of similar width and is steered mechanically , making it cumbersome .
At the heart of the new weapon will be a compact airborne antenna , which will be steered electronically and be capable of generating multiple beams , each of which can be aimed while on the move .

Today is Listverse ’s second birthday !
In that time we have had over 70 million visits !
Because it is our birthday , I have decided to do a list of our most popular lists since we opened our cyber - doors two years ago .
I am hoping that it will introduce at least a few of you to some lists you may have overlooked .
The statistics I used to determine the order is total unique views – that excludes repeat visits from people who may be wanting to check up on the comments .
Be sure to mention your own favorite lists in the comments .
Happy birthday Listverse !
10 Top 10 Human Sideshow Freaks 232,798 views
This was the list where we first met Juan Baptista dos Santos – the man with three legs and two penises .
He was eventually to appear again on the bizarre relationships list because of his brief sexual encounter with Blanche Dumas , the woman with two vaginas and three legs ( that would have been a good one for the amazing coincidences list as well ! )

9 Top 10 Bizarre Mental Disorders 245,123 views
This list was published at quite an opportune time as many of the disorders that appeared on it later featured in other lists as related facts , so everyone that read this one was prepared for the others .
The list was published just 3 months after the site launched so its high number of comments was pretty amazing .
Comments above 200 happen quite regularly now but it was extremely rare back then .
The contributor ( JT ) has contributed many other popular lists since then .

8 Top 20 Best Gangster Movies 249,128 views
This list would rank high in the most popular , most commented on , and most controversial !
This list started out as a top 15 and excluded a large number of very popular films .
For this reason the comments ( for the first time on the site ) took on a very nasty tone and I had to pull it .
I spent a few hours adding new films and re-rating some of the originals and finally came up with the top 20 as it stands now .
As you can see by comment 1 : “ Mr Frater this list is so much better . ” the updated list had a much better reception .

7 Top 10 Amazing Facts About Dreams 259,766 views
Not only is this one of our most popular lists , it is one of our most stolen .
It seems that the majority of the 59,500 Google results for “ 10 amazing facts about dreams ” are related to our original list – either as a complete rip or a derivative .
The 450 comments on the list certainly speaks to its popularity with the most recent comment being posted a mere few days ago ( nearly 2 years after first posting ) .

6 Top 10 Most Evil Women 260,251 views
Having done a second list of evil women , I would be quite keen to combine the two and re-order them , giving us an “ all time most evil women ” list .
Unfortunately when I wrote the original there were a number of wicked women I was unfamiliar with and the commenters certainly had no problem pointing that out .
The list caused some controversy because of my inclusion of Queen Mary and Queen Isabella , but that was balanced by the inclusion of Elizabeth I on the second list .
All in all , the list proved very popular despite its less - than - ideal ordering .

5 Top 10 Unsolved Mysteries 287,330 views
Sticking the Shroud of Turin onto any list is a recipe for controversy on this site ( and most of the Internet for that matter ) .
This list was definitely no disappointment .
I certainly was surprised by the popularity of this list and that inspired me to write another 5 mysteries lists ( and there are more to come I assure you ) .
The Shroud seemed to be the most talked about item on the list and this lead to what was one of our earliest religion versus non-religion debates .

4 Top 15 Amazing Coincidences 301,438 views
This was one of the most enjoyable lists to put together – which may account for its popularity .
It featured some spooky and some happy coincidences .
It eventually led to a second list of the same and there will hopefully be more in the future .
Item number 9 ( the Mystery Monk ) was definitely my favorite addition .
If only we all had someone like that watching out for us !

3 Top 15 Manipulated Photographs 345,094 views
It was probably the political nature of some of the items on this list which led to its popularity – that and a front page on Reddit and Fark .
This was a fascinating list and there will hopefully be more of the same in the future .
I think item 5 ( the Lincoln photo ) is the most interesting as it is such a famous portrait – who would have thought that it was a photographic fake ?

2 Top 10 Incredible Recordings 323,182 views
This was our first popular list ( and the first one to reach the front page of Digg – causing untold headaches managing traffic but leading to our fast rise in popularity ) .
For the last two years this list has topped the “ top 10 ” on the site so I was pretty shocked to see that it had been ousted from its place by the new number 1 .
This list was particularly close to my heart as all of the recordings were things that had fascinated me long before compiling it .
Moreschi ( the last Castrato ) is especially interesting to me due to my interests in history , religion , and music ; Moreschi combines all three !

1 10 Fascinating Last Pictures Taken 447,773 views
So after nearly two years a list finally toppled the reign of the incredible recordings .
Considering how recently this list was posted ( just 7 months ago ) it is an amazing feat .
It was sent in by Blogball who has submitted many excellent lists in recent times .
I am sure I am not alone in saying that I look forward to more in the future .

+ Top 10 Common Methods of Suicide 463,999 views
Unfortunately this list caused such a furore that I had to remove it .
The list explained the ten most commonly used methods of suicide as well as the likely consequences when things go wrong .
In the footer of the list I included telephone numbers for suicide lines in the countries that send us the most traffic .
At first the list was well received ( albeit controversial ) but eventually we reached the number one spot on Google for “ suicide ” and we started getting a lot of very angry comments from people who were disgusted with the list .
We also received a lot of comments from people who said that the list was going to help them commit suicide ( I think that these were almost all from people trying to guilt us into removing the lists ) .
Despite all of this I left the list on the site – but I closed the comments .
A few months later one of my advertisers completely withdrew from the site and another threatened to if the list was not removed .
We may all like to think that there is no censorship on the Internet – but in a way this was a form of censorship through blackmail .
Without the advertisers the site would have to close .
My hands were tied , so the list was removed ; that is the reason you have to view the list on my person site .
Interestingly , if the list was still available , it would be in the number one position on this list with 463,999 unique views .

Summary Two Years And Still Going
In summary to this list I would like to thank you all for sticking around and commenting on the lists .
It has been quite hard to get lists out regularly and I am proud to say that we have not missed a single day in the last year – despite moving half way across the world .
Thanks to the admins who have been a great help .
There are many more lists to come in the future and I look forward to the next year in the hopes that we can grow even bigger .
In the wake of one " kiss - in " protest carried out last Sunday and ahead of another one planned for this Sunday , the LDS Church issued a statement Friday defending its Main Street Plaza property rights and its actions involving a pair of men cited there last week for their public displays of affection .
Echoing previous comments made by a church spokeswoman following the July 9 incident , Friday 's statement said the pair were asked " to stop engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate for any couple of the plaza , " which was " more involved than a simple kiss on the cheek . "
" They engaged in passionate kissing , groping , profane and lewd language and had obviously been using alcohol , " the statement continued .
" They were politely told that the plaza was not the place for such behavior and asked to stop .
When they became belligerent , the two individuals were asked to leave church property . "
The two — Derek Jones and Matthew Aune — were detained by church security , cited by Salt Lake police for trespassing , an infraction of city ordinances , and later released .
The police report stated that Aune said the two had been drinking earlier at the Gallivan Center .
After leaving and passing through the plaza , they sat down and he kissed Jones .
Aune told police that when the two were confronted by church security and asked to leave , he refused , and he was slammed to the ground as security detained the pair with handcuffs .
The reporting officer wrote that he did not see any signs of injury on either of the two men and that the security personnel denied slamming down either of the two when detaining them .
The report also acknowledged the smell of alcohol on the breath of one of the men and accompanying slurred speech .
Jones did not return repeated calls from the Deseret News seeking his response to the church 's statement .
Calling the church - owned pedestrian mall an extension of the Salt Lake Temple grounds and its headquarters , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints said in the Friday statement that it wants the area to be a place of beauty and serenity for everyone .
" There is nothing satisfying in learning that there have been problems for anyone on church property .
We hope the plaza will continue to be an asset to the community and enjoyed by the many that cross it each day . "
Meanwhile , Salt Lake City prosecutor Sim Gill said his office plans to examine the case thoroughly to ensure that the charges are valid and his office has all the evidence it needs to proceed with a prosecution .
" It appears there are some missing pieces that still need to be gathered , " Gill said .
" We want to make sure there was sufficient evidence in the police report and make sure the charges are appropriate . "
Gill said the case against the pair is set for a routine arraignment hearing July 23 before Salt Lake City Municipal Court Judge John Baxter .
Gill said infractions of city ordinances do not carry jail time as potential sentences , but fines up to $ 500 can be imposed .
After the July 9 incident and Jones ' own blog - posts were reported by the media , about 60 people gathered last Sunday morning to stage a " kiss - in " on the sidewalk just off the LDS Church 's property to protest the actions taken by the church security personnel .
As the gathering was beginning to disperse , about 35 protesters crossed onto church property , prompting church representatives to call police officers .
Police gave directives to protesters to move off the private property — demonstrators complied , and no citations were issued .
A similar " kiss - in " is planned for Sunday .

Republican Sen. John Ensign took three trips paid for by an arm of the religious group The Family , which operates the C Street house that has been at the center of recent sex scandals involving the Nevadan and other elected officials .
The trips Ensign took in 2003 and 2004 to Tokyo and the Middle East were apparently allowed under congressional ethics laws that have since been rewritten to restrict privately funded travel .
But the trips have come to light as questions have arisen about the secretive group and its work with elected officials .
Ensign and Republican South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford have admitted to extramarital affairs .
Both have ties to C Street .
Former Republican Rep. Chip Pickering has been accused of an affair while he lived there .
Author Jeff Sharlet , whose book “ The Family ” includes insight from his month spent living with the organization , wrote that “ The Family acts today like the most powerful lobby in America that is n’t registered as a lobby — and is thus immune from the scrutiny attending the other powerful organizations . ”
Sharlet wrote this week on Salon.com that the group sends its members around the world to spread what he calls Biblical capitalism — a brand of fiscal conservatism rooted in the philosophy of the group ’s founder , who believed the Great Depression was God ’s punishment for the socialist leanings of Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
In the group ’s earlier days , it was supportive of the anti-communist campaign of Indonesian dictator Suharto , and “ sent delegations of congressmen and oil executives to pray to Jesus with the Muslim leader , ” Sharlet said .
In Africa , the group sent a senator and defense contractor as emissaries to Somali Siad Barre , who agreed to pray to the “ American Christ in return for American military aid , which he then used to wreak biblical terror on his nation , ” the author said .
Information about Ensign ’s trips is limited .
Ensign ’s office declined to offer further details .
Travel records show that Ensign traveled twice in 2003 and once in 2004 on trips funded by the International Foundation , which is identified on tax records as part of the Fellowship Foundation , the official name of the group behind The Family .
The group provided more than $ 15,000 for the three trips , according to congressional travel records .
The senator went twice to Tokyo , from Aug. 26 to 31 , 2003 , and from Aug. 21 to 25 , 2004 .
The purpose was described as “ participation in policy dialogue and programs with Japanese government officials , ” according to records compiled by Legistorm.com .
A newspaper article at the time referred to the 2004 trip as a conference on international disputes at a Mount Fuji retreat , and noted it was the second consecutive year Ensign had attended the foundation - sponsored trip .
When asked about the foundation upon his return in 2004 , Ensign told the Las Vegas Review - Journal , “ I know very little about it . ”
Another foundation - sponsored trip , Dec. 8 - 13 , 2003 , was to Tel Aviv , Israel , and Amman , Jordan , for “ participation in fact finding trip . ”
Records show the group also paid for two Republican lawmakers from the House to travel to the same Middle Eastern areas around the time of Ensign ’s trip .
In all , the Fellowship Foundation has spent $ 95,185 paying for 20 lawmaker trips since 2000 .
Seventeen of those trips were taken by Republicans ( including the three by Ensign ) and three by Democrats .
In its nonprofit tax filing , the foundation describes its primary purpose as : “ To develop and maintain an informal association of people banded together , to go out as ‘ ambassadors of reconciliation , ’ modeling the principles of Jesus , based on loving God and loving others .
To work with the leaders of many nations . ”
Professor Clyde Wilcox , who teaches government at Georgetown University , said nothing is inherently wrong with religious groups sending lawmakers abroad .
Evangelical groups , for example , took lawmakers to Africa to show them the reality of the AIDS epidemic on that continent .
“ The notion you would promote religion among the leaders of a society is not outlandish , ” Wilcox said .
The Constitution separates church from state , it does n’t bar religious participation .
“ At some level the sort of merging of capitalism and Christian conservatism and fundamentalism — we ’ve had that for a long time , ” said Wilcox , who has written about religion and politics .
“ It ’s reasonable to think groups like this have a right to exist and they can do what they want in terms of sending people around . ”
Congressional ethics laws were tightened when Democrats took control of Congress in 2007 , and the new law restricts privately funded travel paid for by lobbyists .
Nonprofit organizations can still sponsor trips .
But if the foundation is engaging in freelance diplomacy that is lending government support to overseas leaders or granting government contracts outside of official channels , there could be concerns .
Craig Holman of the watchdog group Public Citizen notes that a loophole in the new ethics law allows nonprofit organizations to continue funding lawmaker trips .
The powerful American - Israel lobby group , AIPAC , for example , continues to send elected officials to Israel , he said .
The couple , who have been married for 44 years and have no children , did not take holidays and chose to spend his last days at home in Yetminster , Dorset , together surrounded by friends .
Reporter : How are you feeling now ?
Deng Yujiao : ( nods her head )
Okay .
Reporter :
Are you satisfied with the trial result ?
Deng Yujiao : Hmmm , I am satisfied .
Reporter : Did you expect the result today ?
Deng Yujiao : ( brief pause ) Somewhat unexpected .
Reporter :
What was your expected result ?
Grandfather :
She is a young child who knows nothing about the law .
She was not thinking about any result .
Reporter :
Are you still taking medicine everyday ?
Deng Yujiao : Yes .
Aunt :
She is taking anti-depression and sleeping medicine .
Reporter :
Do you feel more relaxed now ?
Deng Yujiao : Yes .
Reporter : What do plan to do next ?
Deng Yujiao : I want to get a job and live well .
Reporter :
What did the family expect the trial result to be ?
Grandfather :
Our family is happy with the result , but it was somewhat unexpected for us .
Mother :
The verdict was fair .
Aunt : Quite unexpected , quite happy .
We thank the government , we thank society .
Reporter : Before the trail , what verdict did you expect ?
What was your worst scenario ?
Mother :
The family members were thinking about a probationary sentence .
Aunt : I get on the Internet frequently and I know that the majority of netizens support us .
But Internet opinion does not represent the law , and our initial expectations could not be so optimistic .
Grandfather : First , we must thank that good kind people , including the netizens and the media , for caring , helping and supporting Deng Yujiao .
We also thank our lawyers Wang Xiaopeng and Liu Gang for their hard work to defend the legal rights of Deng Yujiao .
Reporter :
Do you feel that the Internet and public opinion had some impact on the case ?
Grandfather :
After the incident took place , the public security bureau gathered the evidence .
That is to say , they had evidence of the crime committed by my granddaughter , but they also had information that could reduce the penalty .
When the procuratorate filed to prosecute , they also based their decision on the basis of facts and law .
They upheld the dignity of the law and showed humanity .
I believe that the verdict today showed unbiasedness , objectivity and fairness .
They upheld the dignity of the law but also dealt leniently with my granddaughter based upon the objective circumstances and gave her a chance .
We are very satisfied .
I must emphasize that my granddaughter was defending her own rights and avoiding unlawful harm .
In so doing , she stabbed one person to death and caused injury to another person .
This has caused irreparable harm and loss to these persons and their family members .
Our entire family has profound regret and sorrow .
Reporter :
The verdict today accepts that the psychiatric assessment that Deng Yujiao has " mental impairment " and thus " has only partial criminal responsibility . "
What do you think about that assessment ?
Grandfather :
We feel that this assessment is appropriate .
Previously , my granddaughter had a history of not being able to sleep for two or three years , and this caused her to become mentally unstable .
She argued with her mother frequently and she was taking medication for a long time .
The evaluation was done by authoritative departments in Hubei province and Wuhan city .
We believe the result is fair and objective .
Reporter :
The case has one aspect that puzzles the world .
It was said taht Deng Yujiao was sexually assaulted in the bathing area .
We want to know what the true facts are .
Grandfather : I can say definitively that there was no sexual assault .
In the bathing area , they grabbed my granddaughter and she fought back .
That happened .
But there was not concrete action .
I was also perplexed by this issue .
I have seen several bulletins .
The description of the details in the first , second and third bulletins were dissimilar .
I went to see my granddaughter in the detention center .
I said , " You must tell me the truth .
What exactly happened at the time ? "
My granddaughter surely told me the truth .
She said that the man grabbed her in the bathing area and she had fought back .
But there was no sexual assault as reported outside .
I ask you to remember that there were seven or eight persons present at the scene .
How can that sort of thing happen with so many persons present ?
I asked her whether she had been " pressed down " or " shoved down . "
She said that it was more like " shoved down " onto the sofa .
When I saw my granddaughter , I told her that it was not enough to turn yourself in .
You have not surrendered yourself unless you also tell the truth .
Therefore , you must not lie .
You must tell the truth .
Later I found out that the first bulletin came from the public security bureau , the second bulletin was the report from the public security bureau and the third bulletin was prepared by the government .
The wording of the government is obviously different from that of the public security bureau , but this may be how the outside speculation came about .
Aunt :
Our understanding was that there was the intention to commit sexual assault , but it did not actually happen .
Reporter :
Is that why the former lawyers were dismissed ?
Grandfather :
The family was not satisfied with some aspects about the originally hired lawyers .
After they met with my granddaughter , some of their actions were incomprehensible to us .
Their unauthorized disclosure of case details was against the regulations .
We even suspected that they were hyping up the case , so we dismissed them .
Reporter :
What kind of impact has the case had on Deng Yujiao and her family ?
Grandfather :
There has definitely been a lot of negative impact .
Today , the family feels better now .
I only want to take a good rest now .
After the incident occurred , my granddaughter was treated well .
She was never handcuffed .
She was sent from Yesanguan to Enshi Hospital to the Badong detention center without being handcuffed .
She was treated well .
At the detention center , the guards gave her honey water because she was ill .
They kept her spirits up .
The county party committee even sent the People 's Congress vice director and the Political Consultative Conference vice director to watch over her .
When she was bailed out to stay at home , the County Women 's Association chairwoman and several workers kept her company around the clock .
The fastest growing segment of telecommunications these days is the mobile internet .
How people access the Web using their cell phones , PDAs and other mobile devices is increasingly an important issue , and the companies who control such access have tremendous power with far - reaching consequences .
As the New York Times wrote yesterday , the FCC is now turning its attention to ensuring that there is adequate market competition in the mobile telecom space .
This development is sorely needed and long - overdue .
The central issue is exclusivity contracts .
Basically , exclusivity means that , unless you are willing to be a hacker , you can use the iPhone only on AT&T ’s network , the BlackBerry Storm on Verizon ’s and the Palm Pre on Sprint’s .
It also allows the cell phone companies to lock us in to new multi- year service contracts every time we need to buy a new phone .
This stinks , and we all know it .
What 's even worse is that in many areas of the country , the Big Four - AT&T , Verizon , Sprint , and T - Mobile ( who collectively hold a virtual monopoly with 90 % market share ) - are n't even interested in providing any service at all .
As a result , people in these areas have only one wireless provider , and the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) has already found numerous cases of " scant competition , high prices and onerous contracts " .
As wireless providers increasingly earn their revenues from data plans ( a.k.a. - internet access ) , the goal of fostering competition warrants a new sense of urgency .
If only one company can control internet access for entire regions of people , and can implement their own private rules for what people can and can't do on the Web , then the potential for abuse of power is frightening .
For example , consider how some web applications ( that are perfectly legal ) have already been banned on these companies networks , such as the decision to block the Skype application on the iPhone from working on AT&T ’s 3G network .
If this is a precedent , then it 's only a matter of time before these companies start banning access to and censoring whichever websites they choose .
This is clearly not the internet experience most of us want , however , without strong competition , we may ultimately be stuck with it .
The Times is absolutely right in praising the FCC for turning its attention to the wireless telecom market .
As these telecoms become the future gatekeepers of the mobile internet , we all share an interest in making sure that we , as consumers , have choices .
We have previously published two lists of bizarre mental disorders : Top 10 Bizarre Mental Disorders , and Another 10 Bizarre Mental Disorders .
This list brings our total list of diseases of the mind to 30 .
While it is possibly true to say that everyone has a small amount of mental disorder , the items on this list are extreme and often obvious to others .
We should all be thankful for our private quirks when reading this list .
10 Synaesthesia
Unlike the majority of items on this list , synaesthesia is not entirely negative .
Synaesthesia is a neurologically phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic , involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway , in other words , numbers can be perceived as having color , or words ( such as the days of the week ) can be perceived as having personalities .
Many people with synesthesia use their experiences to aid in their creative process , and many non-synesthetes have attempted to create works of art that may capture what it is like to experience synesthesia .
Here is a description of the disorder by one synaesthete : “ I realized that to make an R all I had to do was first write a P and draw a line down from its loop .
And I was so surprised that I could turn a yellow letter into an orange letter just by adding a line . ”
The image above shows how a synaesthete might perceive numbers and letters ( which would appear all black to normal people ) .
In a more bizarre twist , sufferers might mix sound and taste so that different noises might have a taste .
It may be wise for synaesthetes to avoid the brown sound .
9 Oniomania
Oniomania is a compulsive desire to shop , more commonly referred to as compulsive shopping , compulsive buying , shopping addiction or shopaholism .
Victims often experience moods of satisfaction when they are in the process of purchasing , which seems to give their life meaning while letting them forget about their sorrows .
Once leaving the environment where the purchasing occurred , the feeling of a personal reward has already gone .
To compensate , the addicted person goes shopping again .
Eventually a feeling of suppression will overcome the person .
For example , cases have shown that the bought goods will be hidden or destroyed , because the person concerned feels ashamed of their addiction and tries to conceal it .
8 Trichotillomania
Trichotillomania or “ trich ” as it is commonly known , is an impulse control disorder or form of self - injury characterized by the repeated urge to pull out scalp hair , eyelashes , facial hair , nose hair , pubic hair , eyebrows or other body hair , sometimes resulting in noticeable bald patches .
It may seem , at times , to resemble a habit , an addiction , a tic disorder or an obsessive - compulsive disorder .
Trichotillomania often begins during the individual ’s teenage years .
Depression or stress can trigger the trich .
Some people with TTM wear hats , wigs , wear false eyelashes , eyebrow pencil , or style their hair in an effort to avoid such attention .
7 Piblokto
Piblokto , Pibloktoq or Arctic hysteria is a condition exclusively appearing in Eskimo societies living within the Arctic Circle .
Appearing most prevalently in winter , it is considered to be a form of a culture - bound syndrome which is a disorder ( usually both mental and physical ) which occurs in a specific culture or community .
Symptoms can include intense hysteria ( screaming , uncontrolled wild behavior ) , depression , coprophagia ( poo eating ) , insensitivity to extreme cold ( such as running around in the snow naked ) , echolalia ( senseless repetition of overheard words ) and more .
This condition is most often seen in Eskimo women .
This syndrome is possibly linked to vitamin A toxicity because the native Eskimo diet provides rich sources of vitamin A. Similar symptoms have been seen in Westerners with vitamin A toxicity .
6 Dissociative Identity Disorder
Dissociative identity disorder is the disease formerly known as multiple personality Syndrome .
It is a condition in which a single person displays multiple distinct identities or personalities ( known as alter egos or alters ) , each with its own pattern of perceiving and interacting with the environment .
The diagnosis requires that at least two personalities routinely take control of the individual ’s behavior with an associated memory loss that goes beyond normal forgetfulness .
There is a great deal of controversy surrounding the topic , with some therapists considering it to not exist at all , despite the fact that 40,000 cases were diagnosed from 1985 to 1995 .
The most famous example of a sufferer is Sybil – after whom the well - known 1970s film was named ( see video clip above ) .
5 Nymphomania
It is amazing that this , our favorite disorder , was absent from our previous two lists !
Nymphomania is an uncontrollable urge in women to have sex .
Sex addicts are unable to control their sexual impulses , which can involve the entire spectrum of sexual fantasy or behavior .
Eventually , the need for sexual activity increases , and the person ’s behavior is motivated solely by the persistent desire to experience the sex act and the history usually reveals a long - standing pattern of such behavior , which the person repeatedly has tried to stop , but without success .
Eventually , the sexual activity interferes with the person ’s social , vocational , or marital life , which begins to deteriorate .
When a man has an uncontrollable urge to have sex , it is called adolescence .
Just kidding , that is called satyriasis .
4 Depersonalization
Depersonalization is a strange disorder in which the sufferer feels that they are living in a dream world ; it is the feeling of watching oneself act , while having no control over a situation .
It can be considered desirable , such as in the use of recreational drugs , but it usually refers to the severe form found in anxiety and , in the most intense cases , panic attacks .
Often a person who has experienced depersonalization claims that life “ feels like a movie ” or things seem unreal or hazy .
Also a recognition of self breaks down ( hence the name ) .
Depersonalization can result in very high anxiety levels , which further increases these perceptions – a snowball effect .
One way to describe the physical manifestation of the feeling is to compare it to a film technique called the vertigo shot or dolly zoom .
In this technique , the subject of the picture stays fixed within the shot while the surrounding background is pulled away , providing a sense of vertigo or detachment .

3 Jumping Frenchmen of Maine
This one should probably win the award for not just being a bizarre disorder , but for having a bizarre name !
Jumping Frenchmen of Maine is a rare disorder first described in 1878 .
An individual with this disorder has a genetic mutation that prevents “ exciting ” signals in the nervous system from being regulated , which causes a number of bizarre irregularities in their startle response .
Most notably , an event which might startle a normal person will result in an extended , grossly exaggerated response from a “ jumper , ” including crying out , flailing limbs , twitching , and sometimes convulsions .
Because a jumper is almost immediately susceptible to another jump soon after an episode ends , there have been reports that sufferers are sometimes teased mercilessly by people who find the reaction amusing , and trigger it repeatedly .
Another curious abnormality caused by this disorder is a sufferer ’s automatic reflex to obey any order that is delivered suddenly .
For example , if one uses a sharp , quick voice to order a jumper to throw the object in their hands , they will throw it without hesitation ; if they are similarly told to strike a person , they will strike that person , even if it is a loved one .

2 Coprolalia
[ WARNING : Video clip above is not safe for work viewing . ]
Coprolalia is involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks ( this should not be confused with Tourette Syndrome which is usually signified by physical and vocal tics – not just coprolalia ) .
Involuntary outbursts , such as racial or ethnic slurs in the company of those most offended by such remarks , can be particularly embarrassing to the sufferer of coprolalia ; the phrases do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of the person .
Surprisingly , this disorder is often treated with botox near the vocal chords which helps to reduce the volume ( but not the quantity ) of outbursts .
Related disorders are copropraxia , performing obscene or forbidden gestures , and coprographia , making obscene writings or drawings .
And now , item fucking one :
1 Wendigo Psychosis
Wendigo Psychosis is a mental disorder in which a person intensely craves human flesh and thinks they are turning into a cannibal ( despite an abundance of healthy food available ) .
The most common response amongst the aboriginal communities in which wendigo psychosis was most prevalent , was curing attempts by traditional native healers or Western doctors .
In the unusual cases when these attempts failed , and the Wendigo sufferer began either to threaten those around them or to act violently or anti-socially , they were then generally executed .
While some have denied the existence of this disorder , there are a number of credible eyewitness accounts , both by aboriginal communities and by Westerners , that prove that Wendigo psychosis is a factual historical phenomenon .

The state of the art in optimizing compilers today is such that for optimizing code , you need ( 1 ) a strong optimizing compiler and ( 2 ) a strong optimizing human .
My rule of thumb is that ( 1 ) alone will yield 2 x to 10 x slower code .
This is also what a person selling a ( great ) compiler " giving 80 % of the optimal performance with no manual intervention " once told off - record to a roomful of programmers who pressed him into a corner , elevating my rule of thumb to a nobler plane of anecdotal evidence .
Now , I claim that this situation will persist , and in this post I 'll try to close the fairly large gap between this claim and the mere acknowledgment of what the state of the art is today .
The gap is particularly large for the believer in the possibility of strong AI – and while my position is a bit different , I do believe in fairly strong AI ( can I say that ?
people keep telling that I can't say " nearly context - free " .
oh well . )
I realize that many people experienced in optimization feel that , on the contrary , there 's in fact no gap large enough to justify an attempt as boringly rigorous ( for a pop tech blog ) at proving what they think is obvious as will shortly follow .
But I think that many language geek discussions could benefit from a stronger bound on the power of a Sufficiently Smart Compiler than can be derived from ( necessarily vague ) doubts on the power of AI , and in this post I 'll try to supply such a bound .
I actually think a lot of ( mainly domain - specific ) things could be achieved by AI - ish work on compilation – closer to " identify bubble - sort and convert to quick - sort " than to traditional " analyze when variables are alive and assign them to registers " – and this is why it 's useful to have a feeling when not to go there .
So , consider chess , where the state of the art is apparently quite similar to that in optimization : a strong human player using a strong computer program will take out both a human and a computer playing alone .
However , it is conceivable that a program can be developed that does n't need the help of a human , being able of completely simulating human thought processes or instead alternative processes which are consistently superior .
Why can't it be the same with optimizing compilers ?
( Chess and optimization are similar in another respect – few care about them ; I readily acknowledge the insignificance of a 10 x speed - up in a continuously expanding set of circumstances , I just happen to work in an area where it does count as a checkmate . )
I 'll try to show that optimization is a fundamentally different game from chess , quite aside from the formal differences such as decidability .
I 'll use optimizing for VLIW SIMD processors to show where compilers outperform humans and vice versa .
I 'll be quoting a book by the inventor of VLIW called " Embedded Computing : A VLIW Approach " to support my position on the relative strength of humans and compilers in these cases .
I 'll then try to show that my examples are significant outside the peculiarities of current hardware , and attempt to state the general reason why humans are indispensable in optimization .
VLIW SIMD
First , we 'll do the acronym expansion ; skip it if you 've been through it .
VLIW stands for " Very Long Instruction Word " .
What it really means is that your target processor can be told to execute several instructions in parallel .
For example : R0 =Add R1,R2 and R3=Mul R0,R1 and R1= Shift R5 , R6 .
For this to work , the processor ought to be able to add , multiply and shift in parallel , that is , its execution hardware must be packed into several units , each getting distinct inputs .
The units can be completely symmetric ( all supporting the same operations ) ; more often , different units support different instruction sets ( so , for example , only one unit in a processor can multiply , but two of them can add , etc . )
A stinky thing to note about VLIW instructions is the register semantics .
In the example instruction above , R0 is mentioned both as an input and as an output .
When it 's mentioned as an input of Mul its old value is meant , and not the value computed by Add .
This is somewhat natural since the whole point is to run Add and Mul in parallel so you do n't want Mul to wait for Add ; but it 's confusing nonetheless .
We 'll come back to this shortly .
SIMD stands for " Single Instruction , Multiple Data " and is known much more widely than VLIW , being available at desktop and server processor architectures like x86 and PowerPC ( VLIW reigns the quieter embedded DSP domain , the most commercially significant design probably being TI 's C6000 family . )
SIMD means that you have commands like R0 =Add8 R1 , R2 , which does 8 additions given 2 inputs .
The registers are thus treated as vectors of numbers – for example , uint8 [ 16 ] , or uint16 [ 8 ] , or uint32 [ 4 ] , assuming 16 b registers .
This establishes a preference for lower - precision numbers since you can pack more of them into a register and thus process more of them at a time : with uint16 , you use Add8 , but with uint8 , you get to use the 2x faster Add16 .
We 'll come back to this , too .
Optimizing for VLIW targets
The basic thing at which VLIW shines is the efficient implementation of " flat " loops ( where most programs spend most time ) ; by " flat " , I mean that there are no nested if / elses or loops .
The technique for implementing loops on VLIW machines is called modulo scheduling .
The same technique is used on superscalar machines like modern x86 implementations ( the difference from VLIWs being the instruction encoding semantics ) .
Since I could n't find a good introductory page to link to , we 'll run through a basic example of modulo scheduling right here .
The idea is pretty simple , although when I first saw hardware designers doing it manually in a casual manner , I was deeply shocked ( they do it for designing new hardware rather than programming existing hardware but it's the same principle ) .
Suppose you want to compute a [ i ] =b[ i ] * c+d on a VLIW processor with 4 units , 2 of them capable of load / store operations , 1 with an adder and 1 with a multiplier .
All units have single - cycle latency ( that is , their output is available to the next instruction ; real VLIW units can have larger latencies , so that several instructions will execute before the result reaches the output register . )
Let 's assume that Load and Store increment the pointer , and ignore the need to test for the exit condition through the loop .
Then a trivial assembly implementation of a [ i ] =b[ i ] * c+d looks like this :
LOOP :
R0 =Load b++
R1=Mul R0 , c
R2=Add R1 , d
Store a++,R2
This takes 4 cycles per iteration , and utilizes none of the processor 's parallelism as each instruction only uses 1 of the 4 execution units .
Presumably we could do better ; in fact the upper bound on our performance is 1 cycle per iteration , since no unit has to be used more than once to implement a [ i ] =b[ i ] * c+d ( if we had two multiplications , for example , then with only 1 multiplying unit the upper bound would be 2 cycles / iteration . )
What we 'll do now is blithely schedule all of the work to a single instruction , reaching the throughput suggested by our upper bound :
LOOP :
R0=LOAD b++ and R1=MUL R0 , c and R2=ADD R1 , d and STORE a++,R2
Let 's look at what this code is doing at iteration N :
b[ N ] is loaded
] is loaded b[ N - 1 ] ( loaded at the previous iteration into R0 ) is multiplied by c
] ( loaded at the previous iteration into R0 ) is multiplied by c b [ N - 2 ] *c ( computed at the previous iteration from the old value of R0 and saved to R1 ) is added to d
] *c ( computed at the previous iteration from the old value of R0 and saved to R1 ) is added to d b [ N - 3 ] * c+d is saved to a [N ]
This shows why our naive implementation does n't work ( it would be quite surprising if it did ) – at iteration 0 , b [ N - 1 ] to b [ N - 3 ] are undefined , so it makes no sense to do things depending on these values .
However , starting at N=3 , our ( single - instruction ) loop body seems to be doing its job just fine ( except for storing the result to the wrong place – b ran away during the first 3 iterations ) .
We 'll take care of the first iterations by adding a loop header – instructions which implement the first 3 iterations , only doing the stuff that makes sense in those iterations :
R0 =Load b++
R0 =Load b++ and R1=Mul R0 , c
R0 =Load b++ and R1=Mul R0 , c and R2=Add R1 , d
LOOP :
R0 =Load b++ and R1=Mul R0 , c and R2=Add R1 , d and Store a++,R2
For similar reasons , we need a loop trailer – unless we do n't mind loading 3 elements past the end of a[ ] , but I reckon you get the idea .
So we 'll skip the trailer part , and move to the more interesting case – what happens when the loop body wo n't fit into a single instruction .
To show that , I can add more work to be done in the loop so it wo n't fit into the units , or I can use a weaker imaginary target machine to do the same work which will no longer fit into the ( fewer ) units .
The former requires more imaginary assembly code , so I chose the latter .
Let 's imagine a target machine with just 2 units , 1 with Load / Store and one with Add / Mul .
Then our upper bound on performance is 2 cycles per iteration .
The loop body will look like this :
LOOP :
R0 =Load b++ and R2=Add R1 , d
R1=Mul R0 , c and Store a++,R2
Compared to the single - instruction case , which was still readable ( " Load and Mul and Add and Store " ) , this piece looks garbled .
However , we can still trace its execution and find that it works correctly at iteration N ( assuming we added proper header code ) :
At instruction 1 of iteration N , b[ N ] is loaded
of iteration N , b [ ] is loaded At instruction 2 of iteration N , b[ N ] ( loaded to R0 by instr 1 of iter N ) is multiplied by c
of iteration N , b[ ] ( loaded to R0 by instr 1 of iter N ) is multiplied by c At instruction 1 of iteration N , b [ N - 1 ] *c ( computed in R1 by instr 2 of iter N - 1 ) is added to d
of iteration N , b[ ] *c ( computed in R1 by instr 2 of iter N - 1 ) is added to d At instruction 2 of iteration N , b [ N - 1 ] * c+d ( computed in R2 by instr 1 of iter N ) is stored to a [N ]
In common VLIW terminology , the number of instructions in the loop body , known to the rest of humanity as " throughput " , is called " initiation interval " .
" Modulo scheduling " is presumably so named because the instructions implementing a loop body are scheduled " modulo initiation interval " .
In our second example , the operations in the sequence Load , Mul , Add , Store go to instructions 0,1,0,1 = 0%2,1%2,2%2,3%2 .
In our first example , everything goes to i%1=0 – which is why I needed an example with at least 2 instructions in a loop , " modulo 1 " being a poor way to illustrate " modulo " .
In practice , " modulo scheduling " grows more hairy than simply computing the initiation interval , creating a linear schedule for your program and then " wrapping it around " the initiation interval using % .
For example , if for whatever reason we could n't issue Mul and Store at the same cycle , we could still implement the loop at the 2 cycles / iteration throughput , but we'd have to move the Mul forward in our schedule , and adjust the rest accordingly .
I 've done this kind of thing manually for some time , and let me assure you that fun it was not .
An initiation interval of 3 with 10 - 15 temporary variables was on the border of my mental capacity .
Compilers , on the other hand , are good at this , because you can treat your input program as a uniform graph of operations and their dependencies , and a legal schedule preserving its semantics is relatively easy to define .
You have a few annoyances like pointer aliasing which precludes reordering , but it 's a reasonably small and closed set of annoyances .
Quoting " Embedded Computing : A VLIW Approach " ( 3.2.1 , p. 92 ) : " All of these problems have been solved , although some have more satisfyingly closed - form solution than others . "
Which is why some people with years of experience on VLIW targets know almost nothing about modulo scheduling – a compiler does a fine job without their help .
The book goes on to say that " Using a VLIW approach without a good compiler is not recommended " – in other words , a human without a compiler will not perform very well .
Based on my experience of hand - coding assembly for a VLIW , I second that .
I did reach about 95 % of the performance of a compiler that was developed later , but the time it took meant that many optimizations just would n't fit into a practical release schedule .
Optimizing for SIMD targets
I will try to show that humans optimize well for SIMD targets and compilers do n't .
I 'll quote " Embedded Computing : A VLIW Approach " more extensively in this section .
A book on VLIW may not sound like the best source for insight on SIMD , however , I somewhat naturally have n't heard of a book on SIMD stressing how compilers are n't good at optimizing for it .
But then I have n't heard of a book stressing the opposite , either , and success papers I saw claimed at automatic vectorization was modest .
Furthermore , the particular VLIW book I quote is in fact focusing on embedded DSP where SIMD is ubiquitous , and its central theme is the importance of designing processors in ways making them good targets for optimizing compilers .
It sounds like a good place to look for tips on designing compilers to work well with SIMD and vice versa ; and if they say they have no such tips , it 's telling .
And in fact the bottom line of the discussion on SIMD ( which they call " micro - SIMD " ) is fairly grim :
" The ability of compilers to automatically extract micro-SIMD without hints ( and in particular , without pointer alignment information ) is still unproven , and manual code restructuring is still necessary to exploit micro- SIMD parallelism " ( 4.1.4 , p. 143 ) .
This statement from 2005 is consistent with what ( AFAIK ) compilers can do today .
No SIMD - targeted programming environment I know relieves you of the need to use intrinsics in your C code as in " a = Add8 ( b , c ) " , where Add8 is a built - in function - looking operator translated to a SIMD instruction .
What I find fascinating though is the way they singled out pointer alignment as a particularly interesting factor necessitating " hints " .
Sure , most newbies to SIMD are appalled when they find out about the need to align pointers to 16 bytes if you want to use instructions accessing 16 bytes at a time .
But how much of a show - stopper can that be if we are to look at the costs and benefits more closely ?
Aligning pointers is easy , producing run time errors when they are n't is easier , telling a compiler that they are can't be hard ( say , gcc has a __vector type modifier telling that ) , and alternatively generating two pieces of code – optimized for the aligned case and non-optimized for the misaligned case – is n't hard , either ( the book itself mentions still other option – generating non-optimized loop header and trailer for the misaligned sections of an array ) .
There ought to be more significant reasons for people to be uglifying their code with non-portable intrinsics , and in fact there are .
The book even discusses them in the pages preceeding the conclusion – but why does n't it mention the more serious reasons in the conclusion ?
To me this is revealing of the difference between a programmer 's perspective and a compiler writer 's perspective , which is related to the difference between optimization and chess : in chess , there are rules .
For an optimizing programmer , SIMD instructions are a resource from which most benefit must be squeezed at any reasonable cost , including tweaking the behavior of the program .
For an optimizing compiler , SIMD instructions are something that can be used to implement a piece of source code , in fact the preferable way to implement it – as long as its semantics are preserved .
This means that a compiler obeys rules a programmer does n't , making winning impossible .
A typical reaction of a compiler writer is to think of this as not his problem – his problem ending where program transformations preserving the semantics are exhausted .
I think this is what explains the focus on things like pointer alignment ( which a compiler can in fact solve with a few hints and without affecting the results of the program ) at the expense of the substantive issues ( which it can 't ) .
In the context of SIMD optimizations , the most significant example of rules obeyed by just one of the contestants has to do with precision , which the book mentions right after alignment in its detailed discussion of the problems with SIMD .
" Even when we manipulate byte - sized quantities ( as in the case of most pixel - based images , for example ) , the precision requirements of the majority of manipulation algorithms require keeping a few extra bits around ( 9 , 12 , and 16 are common choices ) for the intermediate stages of an algorithm .
… this forces us up to the next practical size of sub -word … reducing the potential parallelism by a factor of two up front . "
They go on to say that a 32 b register will end up keeping just 2 16 b numbers , giving a 2 x speed - up – modest considering all the cases when you wo n't get even that due to other obstacles .
This argument shows the problems precision creates for the hardware implementation of SIMD .
However , the precision of intermediate results is n't as hard a problem as this presentation makes it sound , because intermediate results are typically kept in registers , not in memory .
So to keep the extra bits in intermediate results , you can either use large registers for SIMD operations and not " general - purpose " 32 b ones , or you can keep intermediate results in pairs of registers – as long as you have enough processing units to generate and further process these intermediate results .
Both things are done by actual SIMD hardware .
However , the significant problems created by precision lie at the software side : the compiler does n't know how many bits it will need for intermediate results , nor when precision can be traded for performance .
In C , the type of the intermediate results in the expression ( a [ i ] * 3 + b [ i ] * c [ i ] ) >>d is int ( roughly , 32b ) , even if a , b and c are arrays of 8b numbers , and the parenthesized expression can in fact exceed 16 b .
The programmer may know that b[ i ] * c [ i ] never exceeds , say , 20000 so the whole thing will fit in 16 b .
That C has no way of specifying precise ranges of values a variable can hold ( as opposed to Lisp , of all rivals to the title of the most aggressively optimizing environment ) does n't by itself make an argument since a way could be added , just like gcc added __vector , not to mention the option of using a different language .
Specifying the ranges of b[ i ] and c[ i ] would n't always suffice and we would have to further uglify the code to specify the range of the product ( in case both b[ i ] and c[ i ] can be large by themselves but never together ) , but it could be done .
The real problem with having to specify such information to the compiler is n't the lack of a standard way of spelling it , but that a programmer does n't know when to do it .
If it 's me who is responsible for the low - level aspects of optimization , I 'll notice the trouble with an intermediate result requiring too many bits to represent .
I will then choose whether to handle it by investigating the ranges of b[ i ] and c[i ] and restricting them if needed , by moving the shift by d into the expression as in ( a [ i ] * 3 >>d ) + ( b[ i ] * c [ i ] >>d ) so intermediate results never exceed 16 b , or in some other way .
But if it 's the compiler who 's responsible , chances are that I wo n't know that this problem exists at all .
There 's a trade - off between performance gains , precision losses and the effort needed to obtain more knowledge about the problem .
A person can make these trade - offs because the person knows " what the program really does " , and the semantics of the source code are just a rendering of that informal spec from one possible perspective .
It 's even worse than that – a person actually does n't know what the program really does until an attempt to optimize it , so even strong AI capable of understanding an informal spec in English would n't be a substitute for a person .
A person can say , " Oh , we run out of bits here .
OK , so let 's drop the precision of the coefficients . "
Theoretically , and importantly for my claim , strong AI can also say that – but only if it operates as a person and not as a machine .
I do n't claim that we 'll never reach a point where we have a machine powerful enough to join our team as a programmer , just that ( 1 ) we probably would n't want to and ( 2 ) if we would , it would n't be called a compiler , it would be called a software developer .
That is , you would n't press a button and expect to get object code from your source code , you 'd expect a conversation : " Hey , why do you need so many bits here – it's just a smoothing filter , do you really think anyone will notice the difference ?
Do you realize that this generates 4 x slower code ? "
And then someone , perhaps another machine , would answer that yes , perhaps we should drop some of the bits , but let 's not overdo it because there are artifacts , and I know you could n't care less because your job ends here but those artifacts are amplified when we compute the gradient , etc .
This is how persons optimize , and while a machine could in theory act as a person , it would thereby no longer be a compiler .
BTW , we have a compiler at work that actually does converse with you – it says that it will only optimize a piece of code if you specify that the minimal number of iterations executed is such and such ; I think it was me who proposed to handle that case using conversation .
So this discussion is n't pure rhetoric .
I really wish compilers had a - warn - about - missed - optimization - opportunities switch that would give advice of this kind ; it would help in a bunch of interesting cases .
I just think that in some cases , precision being one of them , the amount and complexity of interactions needed to make headway like that exceeds the threshold separating aggressive optimization from aggressive lunacy .
To be sure , there are optimization problems that could be addressed by strong AI .
In the case of SIMD , the book mentions one such area – they call it " Pack , Unpack , and Mix " .
" Some programs require rearranging the sub - words within a container to deal with the different sub - word layouts .
From time to time , the ordering of the sub - words within a word ( for example , coming from loading a word from memory ) does not line up with the parallelism in the code …
The only solution is to rearrange the sub-words within the containers through a set of permutation or copying operations ( for example , the MIX operation in the HP PA - RISC MAX - 2 extension ) . "
An example of this reordering problem is warping : computing a [ i ] =b[ i*step+ shift ] .
This is impossible to do in SIMD without a permutation instruction of the kind they mention ( PowerPC's AltiVec has vec_perm , and AFAIK x86's SSE has nothing so you can't warp very efficiently ) .
However , even if an instruction is available , compilers are AFAIK unable to exploit it .
I see no reason why sufficiently strong AI could n't manage to do such things with few hints in some interesting cases .
I would n't bet my money on it – I side with Mitch Kapor on the Turing Test bet , but it is conceivable like the invincible chess playing program , and unlike transformations requiring " small " changes of the semantics .
Significance
There are areas of optimization that are very significant commercially but hardly interesting in a theoretical discussion ( and this here 's a distinctively theoretical discussion as is any discussion where the possibility of strong AI is supposed to be taken into account ) .
For example , register allocation for the x86 is exceedingly gnarly and perhaps an interesting argument could be made to defend the need for human intervention in this process in extreme cases ( I would n't know since I never seriously optimized for the x86 ) .
However , a general claim that register allocation makes compiler optimization hard would n't follow from such an argument : on a machine with plentiful and reasonably uniform registers , it 's hard to imagine what a human can do that a compiler can't do better , and almost everybody would agree that the single reason for not making hardware that way is a commercial one – to make an x86 - compatible processor .
Now , I believe that both SIMD and VLIW instruction encodings do n't have this accidental nature , and more likely are part of the Right Way of designing high - performance processors ( assuming that it makes no sense to move cost from software to hardware and call that a " performance gain " , that is , assuming that performance is measured per square millimeter of silicon ) .
One argument of rigor worthy of a pop tech blog is that most high - end processors have converged to SIMD VLIW : they have instructions processing short vectors and they can issue multiple instructions in parallel ; some do the latter in the " superscalar " way of having the hardware analyze dependencies between instructions at run time and others do it in the " actual VLIW " way of having the lack of dependencies proven and marked by the compiler , but you end up doing modulo scheduling anyway .
However , this can of course indicate uninformed consumer preference rather than actual utility ( I type this on a noisy Core 2 Duo box running Firefox on top of XP , a job better handled by a cheaper , silent single - core – and I 'm definitely a consumer who should have known better ) .
So my main reasons for believing VLIW and SIMD are " right " are abstract considerations on building von Neumann machines :
You typically have lots of distinct execution hardware : a multiplier has little in common with a load / store unit .
Up to a point , it will therefore make sense to support parallel execution of instructions on the different execution hardware .
The cost of supporting it will be more I/O ports connecting the execution units with the register file – quite serious because of the multiplexers selecting the registers to read / write .
However , the cost of not supporting it will be more execution hardware left unused for more time .
So the optimum is unlikely to be " no parallel execution " , it 's likely " judicious parallel execution " .
It is cheaper to have few wide registers and wide buses between the register file and the execution units than it is to have many narrow registers and buses .
That 's because the cost of the register file is proportional to the product of #registers and #buses to the execution units .
It is thus significantly cheaper to have 1 unit with 4 8bx8 b multipliers and 2 32 b buses for the inputs then it is to have 4 units with 1 8bx8 b multiplier in each and 8 8 b buses for the inputs .
It 's also cheaper to keep 4 bytes in 1 32b register than in 4 8b registers .
Likewise , it is cheaper to have 4 multipliers in 1 processor than to have 4 full - blown processor cores , because each core would have , say , its own fetch and decode logic and instruction cache – which are in fact pure overhead .
So if you have a von Neumann machine with registers and buses and instruction cache , it makes sense ( up to a point ) to add SIMD to make the best of that investment , and this is why commercial VLIWs have SIMD , although the VLIW theory recommends more units instead .
Since I believe that both VLIW and SIMD are essential for maximizing hardware performance , I also tend to think that optimizations needed to utilize these features are " mainstream " enough to support a broad claim about optimization in general .
And the main point of my claim is that compilers can't win in the optimization game , because part of that game is the ability to change the rules once you start losing .
Humans faced with a program they fail to optimize change the program , sometimes a little , sometimes a lot – I heard of 5×5 filters made 4×4 to run on a DSP .
But even if we exclude the truly shameless cheating of the latter kind , the gentler cheating going into every serious optimization effort still requires to negotiate and to take responsibility in a way that a person – human or artificial – can , but a tool like a compiler can not .
Modulo scheduling is an example of the kinds of optimizations which in fact are best left to a compiler – the ones where rules are fixed : once the code is spelled , few can be added by further annotations by the author and hence the game can be won without much negotiations with the author ; although sometimes a little interrogation can't hurt .
David Chisnall looks at the OpenPandora project , which is producing a powerful handheld computer running an open source software stack , and considers what the impact of this project is likely to be .

A little while ago I came across an interesting project called OpenPandora .
The aim of the project was to produce a powerful handheld console system running open source software .
On paper , the specs for the design are very impressive .
The system boasts a Texas Instruments OMAP3530 chip , which is an ARM Cortex A8 corepretty much the fastest ARM chip you can currently buy coupled with a digital signal processor ( DSP ) and graphics processing unit ( GPU ) on chip .
The DSP is fast enough for a large number of media functions , and the GPU supports OpenGL ES 2.0 .
Although this general - purpose system is reasonably powerful , it 's marketed as the Pandora console , a handheld gaming machine for homebrew game development .
Although relatively slow by desktop ( and laptop ) standards , it 's significantly more powerful than most other portable consoles , and the open nature of the system and its selection of input systems promise to give small developers an opportunity to create interesting games .
The system was originally due to be released in 2008 , but various delays have moved the release date further and further back .
The Pandora console is now scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2009 .
I talked with Pandora 's Craig Rothwell about some of the decisions and problems behind the console , and I 'll share his insights and comments in the rest of this article .
The ARM Core
I 've been saying for a while that my next computer will probably have an ARM chip .
One of the first computers I ever used was a BBC Model B , produced by Acorn around the 6502 CPU .
When designing its next computer , Acorn wanted a faster CPU .
Seeing the RISC prototypes coming out of universities in the U.S. , Acorn decided to come up with its own RISC design , and the Acorn RISC Machine ( ARM ) was born .
At around this same time , Apple was looking for a CPU for the device that would eventually become the Newton , and approached Acorn about the ARM .
The result was a separate company spun out to provide CPUs for both product families .
( In an interesting twist of fate , Apple now has a team working on producing ARM - compatible designs , which it acquired when purchasing P.A. Semi . )
The ARM architecture never did very well on the desktop .
Acorn 's Archimedes and Risc PC designs were solid , but did n't sell well outside educational circles .
When Acorn eventually went bust , ARM Limited continued , selling processors for low - power portable devices .
A remarkably similar situation occurred with another British computer company from the 1980s : Psion , which made the first palmtop computer I ever owned , spun out a company to develop its operating system , called EPOC .
The OS was rebranded Symbian and now owns around 70 % of the global mobile phone market .
ARM does n't make CPUs , but rather produces intellectual property ( IP ) cores designs for chips that are licensed to third parties .
Other companies such as TI , Qualcomm , NVIDIA , and Freescale integrate the IP cores with other components and fabricate them .
The latest design is the Cortex - A9 MPCore , but few products have reached the market yet based on these chips .
The slightly older Cortex A8 is a lot more common , and this is at the heart of the OMAP3530 found in the Pandora .
There are a few Cortex A8 chips around , the OMAP 3 series being one of the most common .
A recent entry into the market , the Freescale i.MX515 , is due to appear in Netbooks over the next few months .
The A8 runs at clock speeds from 600 MHz up to over 1 GHz .
The version in the Pandora is one of the slower models .
Does the slow speed matter ?
That depends .
At 600 MHz , the chip is only slow in comparison to recent desktop and laptop CPUs .
Until around 2002 , I was using a desktop computer that approximated this speed , and I still use many of the programs I ran then .
I also do some things no one was doing back then ; watching H.264 video is an obvious example .
As CPU speeds have increased , so have the demands of contemporary encoding schemes .
The secret weapon the OMAP 3 offers to address this need is the Texas Instruments TMS320 series DSP , which is capable of decoding 720 p H.264 on its own , as well as supporting a number of other codecs .
When decoding something like MP3 audio , it can use as little as 15 mW .
These days , the most processor - intensive things I do are related to video and 3D , and neither of these will run on the ARM core in the OMAP .
Video ( and audio ) decoding can be offloaded to the DSP , and 3D runs on the OpenGL ES 2.0 - compatible GPU .
Reflections on the police raids on Rampart Social Centre and the Convergence Space during the G20 Summit .
On the Thursday following the G20 protests , two squatted social centres in East London were raided by riot police , apparently looking for instigators of the attacks on the Royal Bank of Scotland .
RampART Social Centre , which has existed for more than four years , and a newly opened Convergence Centre in Earl Street were both being used to house and feed protesters throughout the period of the G20 summit .
In both cases , the police acted illegally but , other than a brief report in the Independent which referred to unwarranted violence , the raids remained largely unreported .
In both buildings , people were subjected to physical violence and verbal abuse and those that were arrested were later ' de - arrested ' for lack of any supporting evidence .
Our only ' crime ' , it seems , is that we are political activists and squatters and thus deemed to be suitable targets .
If only we had kept our heads down and stayed away from these kinds of activities , the logic goes , we would not deserve what we had coming .
It is right and proper that the events leading up to the death of Ian Tomlinson should be the subject of a criminal investigation but the danger , as we see it , is that it will be seen as an isolated incident and will be dealt with simply by disciplining individual officers , only serving to further obscure the role of the police in perpetuating a climate of fear .
Under the terms of the global surveillance state , citizenship has become an exercise in evading a charge of deviance .
In fact , the proliferation of forms of deviance is the flip side of the supposed ' lifestyle choices ' available under the terms of consumer citizenship .
You can ' choose ' to spend your money on home improvements , high fashion and high - tech gadgets and are applauded for making the ' right ' choices .
But if you choose to occupy an unused building for the purposes of providing space for political discussion , self - education and creative activities without the intrusion of CCTV cameras , access restrictions , and particularly if you refuse to levy a charge which situates these activities in terms of market forces , then you effectively become outlaw ..
And , if you choose to express your outrage at a system that produces inequalities and then condemns those that become unemployed and homeless , you become a target for repression .
The differences between Tomlinson and the people who went to the Bank of England to demonstrate against the iniquitous excesses of neoliberal capitalism are marginal , despite attempts to distinguish between ' innocent ' bystanders and ' guilty ' protesters .
Tomlinson was on his way home from work .
The demonstrators were exercising their lawful right to protest .
Both were exercising their right to the city as citizens of a supposed democracy
When RampART social centre was raided on the Thursday , members of the volunteer collective were sitting down to a cup of coffee and biscuits .
Other members were elsewhere in the building speaking to some guests who had come to stay for the duration of the protests .
We were aware of the massing of officers outside the building but were used to the presence of a Forward Intelligence Team , the police paparazzi , who had been frequent visitors to Rampart Street in the weeks leading up to the G20 , photographing and scrutinising anyone entering the building .
And so , for us , it was business as usual .
At the Convergence Centre , the police seemed to be employing a new tactic whereby people being searched before entering the building had their mobile phones confiscated and were threatened with arrest unless they could ' prove ownership ' .
Essentially , this amounted to an attempt to illegally secure personal details .
The raid itself was surreal .
Or rather , it was hyperreal , in the sense that , as some of us commented later , it was like being on the wrong side of a ' first person shooter ' video game .
Some of us thought the men and women in balaclavas , padded uniforms , helmets and carrying riot shields were pointing toy guns at us .
In fact , as we discovered later , they were tasers , which are designed to stun but are occasionally known to kill .
It 's tempting to say that the violence that we experienced was out of all proportion to the level of resistance which was , in fact , zero .
But to even speak of proportionality is a mistake , because it implies that there is something in our actions that warrants a violent response .
One member of the collective was punched in the face , another was pushed downstairs , saw another person 's head smashed against the wall and was met with looks of disbelief when he pleaded with officers to protect his glasses .
One of the residents of the building was punched and kicked , narrowly avoided taser fire and was arrested in his pyjamas .
We would stress again that this happened to people who , like Ian Tomlinson , were simply exercising their most basic civil rights : to congregate peacefully with friends and to walk the streets unmolested .
Some might think that we are opportunistically linking what happened to us with Tomlinson , and would want to make a clear distinction .
After all , he was a regular bloke in the wrong place at the wrong time , and we were deliberately taking part in political activism .
But to continue in this vein is lose all semblance of what it means to live with even a modicum of freedom and self - respect .
The press reported that four ( and , in some reports , six ) arrests had been made during the raids on RampART and the Convergence Space .
Two known to us personally were held in police cells for up to ten hours , had their clothes confiscated and were sent home in Guantanamo Bay style boiler suits .
News of arrests functions to assuage anxiety and to justify the cost of police operations that amount to little more than exercises in public relations .
The public can rest assured that the dangerous anarchists have been infiltrated and detained and that ' scroungers ' and ' cheats ' have been brought to book .
Comparisons have inevitably been made between Tomlinson 's death and the death of Blair Peach during an Anti-Nazi League demonstration in April , 1979 , widely speculated to be as a result of assault by the police .
Although Peach 's brother reached an out - of - court settlement with the Metropolitan Police in 1989 , no officer was ever charged in connection with the death .
Thirty years later , the same police force has been granted unprecedented powers in the name of ' security ' and justified on the basis that London is under threat from elements in the population that threaten ' our ' way of life .
The result is the proliferation of deviant identities which function as a focus for collective anxiety and paranoia ( ' terrorists ' , ' anarchists ' , ' squatters ' , ' foreign workers ' etc. ) .
Since the incidents on the 1st and 2nd of April , voices have been raised in condemnation of police actions , particularly the tactic of “ kettling ” which herds protesters like cattle and allows the police to punish those who attempt to escape .
Back at RampART on the Wednesday evening we saw the resulting head injuries and beaten bodies
If we are to avoid more deaths and injury , then we need to think seriously , not only about the powers granted to a police force that seems dangerously out of control but about the ideology that sanctions violence in the name of respectability .
We need to think about what it means to be a citizen in 21st century global culture and about the treatment of those that effectively have their human rights revoked because they refuse , or are unable to conform to the dictates of consumer citizenship .
We need , in short , to be aware that , as the global downturn deprives people of their homes and livelihoods , any one of us could end up on the wrong side of the divide that separates ' us ' from ' them ' .
Any one of us could become a scapegoat for the unfocused anger which results when people relinquish responsibility for their own lives and then find themselves deprived of their freedom and dignity .
Places like RampART exist because some of us believe that we can reclaim our freedoms but only if we work together in a spirit of mutual respect and toleration .
Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly has long been an outspoken conservative who maintains anti-gay and transphobic viewpoints .
In his latest segment he invites Megyn Kelly to discuss and ridicule Silverton , Oregon mayor Stu Rasmussen who identifies as a heterosexual transgender male for violating the city dress code in front of a presentation in front of children .
The mayor fits the bill of someone who is genderqueer , preferring male pronouns , and female attire .
The segment below shows the discussion between O'Reilly and Kelly .
O'Reilly says " it 's so bizarre " in referring to the story and calls Oregon a " secular progressive heaven with left - wing loons like Stu . "
O'Reilly chuckles at the story , and acts surprised that " Stu has a girlfriend "
He ends with the question " do children need to be protected from the likes of Stu ? "
O'Reilly acted immature and transphobic throughout the program .
We do applaud Megan Kelly for not stooping down to his level and saying that " transgender people are part of society , and they are not bad people , and that people need to learn about them . "
Email Bill O'Reilly and tell him to be ashamed for mocking Mayor Rasmussen .
Email Megyn Kelly to thank her for standing up for transgender people .
Authorities were trying to deterimine Monday whether a man killed in a shootout with police is a suspected serial killer blamed for five deaths in a South Carolina town about 30 miles away .
Police investigating the shootings over the past week in and around the town of Gaffney , S.C. , traveled northeast to Gastonia , N.C. , where police said they stopped a man attempting to burglarize a home .
Officials , who did n't identify the man , said he shot at officers before they returned fire .

An eight - year - old boy who lost his dad to cancer traveled to Disney World to get his mind off the tragedy , but his family says he suffered yet another blow after his Disney toys were taken by TSA workers in Ft. Lauderdale .
The family of Jeremiah Ramirez brought the youngster from North Carolina to Disney to raise his spirits , a dream vacation after such a terrible loss .
" It was devastating , " said Jeremiah 's cousin , Joe Chao , who lives in South Florida .
" I just wanted to bring some sunshine into my cousin 's life . "
While at Disney , little Jeremiah picked up a Pirates of the Caribbean toy gun and sword , and was hoping to bring them back to North Carolina .
But his mom says that when she and Jeremiah tried to go through security at Ft. Lauderdale - Hollywood Airport earlier this week , the toys were taken away .
" It 's very upsetting because at one point I had told one of the employees , ' You know this is not a real weapon , ' and he said ' Yes , I understand that , it does n't matter , ' " said mom Maria Edge .
Edge said she became even angrier when she claims that not long after the TSA officers had confiscated the items , she saw the officers playing with the toy sword and gun .
All weapons , even toys , are prohibited from any aircraft , according to the TSA .
They said all their rules are spelled out on their website , though Jeremiah 's family is n't buying it .
" TSA has a responsibility to keep us safe and I fully understand that , and I know Maria fully understands that as well , " said cousin Michelle Chao .
" But there 's a point at which it becomes an abuse , when you take toys , clearly a toy from a child , that 's an abuse of power . "
The story does have a happy ending .

Government virus expert paid £ 116 k by swine flu vaccine manufacturers
Conflict : Sir Roy Anderson faced demands to resign
A scientist who advises the Government on swine flu is a paid director of a drugs firm making hundreds of millions of pounds from the pandemic .
Professor Sir Roy Anderson sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies ( Sage ) , a 20 - strong task force drawing up the action plan for the virus .
Yet he also holds a £ 116,000 - a- year post on the board of GlaxoSmithKline , the company selling swine flu vaccines and anti-virals to the NHS .
Sir Roy faced demands to step down yesterday amid claims that the jobs were incompatible .
' This is a clear conflict of interest and should be of great concern to taxpayers and government officials alike , ' said Matthew Elliott of the TaxPayers ' Alliance .
' You cannot have the man in charge of medical emergencies having any financial interest in the management of those emergencies .
We need someone totally unbiased to tackle this crisis . '
The Department of Health and GSK denied there was a conflict and said Sir Roy did not attend Sage meetings where vaccines and drugs were discussed .
Sir Roy was appointed to Sage to ' provide cross- government scientific advice regarding the outbreak of swine flu ' .
He was one of the first UK experts to call the outbreak a pandemic .
During an interview for Radio Four 's Today programme on May 1 , he praised the anti-flu drugs and called for their distribution .
Listeners were not told he was paid by GSK .
The West London - based drugs giant has had to defend itself from allegations of profiteering from swine flu after posting profits of £ 2.1 billion in the last three months .
Sales of the company 's Relenza inhaler , an alternative to Tamiflu used by pregnant women among others , are expected to top £ 600 million .
This figure could be boosted by up to £ 2 billion once deliveries of the firm 's swine - flu vaccine begin in September .
Sir Roy , 61 , who was unavailable for comment yesterday , earned £ 116,000 at GSK last year , at least a quarter of which he received in shares .
GSK 's share price has risen 10 per cent since May from about 1,060 p to more than 1,160p .
A spokesman for GSK insisted there was no conflict of interest .
' Professor Anderson stepped down from the government 's flu advisory group on appointment to GSK .
' In May , he was asked to rejoin as a temporary member as the scale of the influenza pandemic became evident .
He is a world authority on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and his positions as an adviser to the government and as a member of GSK 's board are entirely appropriate .
' These interests have been declared at all times and he has not attended any meetings related to purchase of drugs or vaccine for either the government or GSK . '
A spokesman for Imperial College said Sir Roy 's temporarily appointment to Sage was made ' with the full knowledge of the government departments involved in handling the pandemic ' .
He added : ' He is not a member of the drug or vaccine sub committees of the flu advisory group . '
During the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak , Sir Roy 's advice to Tony Blair led to the culling of more than 6 million animals .
The previous year at Oxford University , Sir Roy was at the centre of controversy after claiming a female colleague had slept with her boss before getting a job .
He was forced to apologise and pay compensation .
A university inquiry in the wake of the scandal found that he was in breach of rules by failing to disclose his business interests as director and shareholder of International Biomedical and Health Sciences Consortium - an Oxford - based biomedical consultancy , which had awarded grants to his research centre .
Sir Roy was forced to resign , although his career soon recovered .
He moved to Imperial College within months , was made the Ministry of Defence 's chief scientist and , last year , took over as Rector of Imperial College , London where he earns up to £ 400,000 a year .
Fears for life - support mum
Swine flu victim : Sharon Pentleton is fighting for her life
A pregnant mother with swine flu battling for life in a Swedish hospital could be there for months , staff said yesterday .
Sharon Pentleton , 26 , has a rare complication of the disease and she and the baby are being kept alive on a life support system in the capital Stockholm .
But because she is six months pregnant , it could take weeks or even months before she is able to come off the machine , said a spokesman at Karolinska University Hospital .
Miss Pentleton , who has a two - year - old daughter , was airlifted to Sweden by private jet on Thursday because the NHS ran out of beds to treat her .
She has adult respiratory distress syndrome and needs to be on a ECMO machine which oxygenates her blood outside her body .
The NHS has only five ECMO beds , and Sweden has only four - two of which are now taken up with swine - flu victims .
The hospital spokesman said Miss Pentleton , from Saltcoats , Ayrshire , remained critical but stable .
Her partner Brian Muirhead , 30 , has flown to the Swedish capital along with her father James .
Outside the hospital last night , Mr Muirhead said : ' She is getting excellent care here but it is a very difficult time . '
Yesterday it emerged that the NHS is prepared to fly more swine - flu victims by private jet to hospitals across Europe if its intensive - care services become overwhelmed .
The Health Department confirmed it has signed agreements with other countries to provide critical care in the event of excessive demand .

Pc Davies has handled many police dogs , including one named Prince Nottinghamshire Police have spoken of their dog section 's devastation , after two German shepherds died after being left in a hot car .
Here , a serving police dog handler from another police force speaks of the strong bond officers develop with their canine charges .
" When you see a police dog taking down a criminal suspect , or sniffing out narcotics , all they really want is their ball . "
Pc David Davies , 50 , has been a police dog handler for 17 years , having owned six general purpose dogs - all German shepherds - and two narcotics dogs .
He enthuses about his job , and says dog handling is so popular that those who perform the role " usually do n't get promoted , because they do n't want to do anything else " .
That was certainly PC Davies 's experience and he has written a book about his work - Thanks Inky : Tales Of A Police Dog Handler .
He explains that most of those who take on the role are responsible for the training of their dogs .
" You 're assessed annually , and there are Home Office courses to go on that assess a dog 's obedience , agility and ability to track objects using scent .
" But much of the training is done by its handler , who teaches the animal to look for something that will result in a reward .
I love my dogs , and that 's the correct term .
They 're part of the family .
They 're your friend
David Davies
" Usually it 's a ball .
You must keep rewarding a dog , which is how you teach it to do what you want it to do .
" So after it 's correctly performed any sort of task out on the street , you must give it a ball as its prize , or whatever it perceives as its reward .
You have to make sure that what it 's doing is fun . "
Many forces breed their own animals , but some organisations sell dogs , fully or partly trained , to police forces .
Rigorous training Training can start when the dog is about eight weeks old , and should ideally begin when the animal is under two years old , says Pc Davies , as " the younger dog is easier to train " .
Typically the youngest age at which a dog should take to the streets is 18 months , and its working life usually ends when it is around seven - and - a - half years old , particularly if it is a German shepherd .
The animal and their trainer are also assessed to be fit for duty by an independent assessor , as part of the Home Office course that they must regularly undertake .
The initial training for a general purpose dog - usually a German shepherd - takes 13 weeks .
A narcotics dog trained to search property takes four to six weeks , and one looking for drugs on people , such as in nightclubs for example , takes six to eight weeks .
Dogs can even be trained to sniff out currency , as is the case with Hamish , one of Mr Davies 's dogs , who is a Patterdale cross with Bedlington terrier .
Mr Davies says the relationship between handler and their dog is a close one .
Threatened with machete " I love my dogs , and that 's the correct term .
They 're part of the family .
They 're your friend .
" They 're your equal partner , I do n't consider that they work for you .
There are plenty of things a dog can do that I can't - I can't detect minute sound in an empty warehouse where someone is hiding , and I can't sniff out narcotics .
" I was out at an incident once where someone threatened to kill me and my dog with a machete .
My first thought was how to protect my dog .
" I 've always kept my dogs after they retired , and most handlers do . "
Mr Davies says that the vans which transport police dogs have a form of battery - powered cooling system in the animal 's section .
" If you 're going to leave the animals for a long time then it's a worry about what can happen if something goes wrong .
" Once I did return to my van to find the cooling system had failed , although the dogs were fine on that occasion .
But if that were to happen on a hot day , then it could be disastrous . "

Admit it : you 've felt it , too .
Let 's say you 've climbed to the observation deck of a tall building , or tiptoed to the edge of a high cliff .
Or perhaps you 're on a ski lift , dangling far above the ground .
And that 's when it arises - the mysterious urge that Edgar Allan Poe , who wrote about it best , calls " a cloud of unnameable feeling " .
What if you jumped ?
You do n't want to die , of course ; you 're feeling generally good about life .
Yet the urge is real : as Poe writes in his story The Imp Of The Perverse , it " chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror " .
Acting on it would be catastrophic .
But somehow it's that very fact that makes it so seductive , and so strong .
The imp is at his worst in situations involving the risk of death - is any driver immune to the idea of swerving into oncoming traffic ? - but hardly confines himself to them .
" Anytime I am around a large body of water such as a river , lake or ocean , I feel tempted to throw my BlackBerry in the water , " admits one contributor to purgetheurge.com , a squirm - inducing site dedicated to the phenomenon .
In hushed theatres , I have to fight the desire to yell out loud ; the sheer ease with which I could ruin things for hundreds of others makes me giddy .
A recent paper in the journal Science suggests these fantasies are near - universal , but usually resisted - though we 're more likely to act on them when highly stressed .
As Poe observes , procrastination sometimes works this way , too : " The most important crisis of our life calls , trumpet - tongued , for immediate energy and action ... and yet we put it off until tomorrow ; and why ?
There is no answer , except that we feel perverse . "
This ubiquitous idiosyncrasy in our wiring seems to have little connection with suicidal thinking : the whole force of the urge comes from how much we do n't want the results it would bring .
So might it serve a purpose - could it be , in computing parlance , a feature , not a bug ?
Toddlers develop into autonomous , well - functioning selves by testing boundaries .
Might this be the adult version ?
Perhaps it 's useful to come face to face with what we could do if we chose , then choose not to .
( Additionally , as the philosopher David Copp points out , " The more powerful we imagine the urge to be , the stronger the reason it gives me to back away from the edge [ of the building ] . "
Ironically , the urge may be protective . )
This is the one sense in which Poe 's description of the attractions of perversity is n't true to life : his characters , plagued by the desire to commit awful acts , actually commit them .
The narrator in The Imp Of The Perverse explains how he carried out what ought to have been the perfect murder .
For years afterwards , nobody suspects him , and he secretly revels in his achievement .
But then , one day , a thought occurs : " I am safe - yes - if I be not fool enough to make open confession ! "
Immediately , a chill creeps over him , and the urge to confess starts gnawing at his soul .
He is n't suffering a crisis of conscience : the only thing driving him to reveal the truth is how disastrous it would be to do so .
He does so , and is sentenced to hang .
He is telling his story , he reveals , from a prison cell .
The imp wins out .

A man who came to the aid of his neighbour a week after she became trapped in her toilet says he wishes he could have helped sooner .
The 67 - year - old Ipswich woman was wedged so badly - with her feet on either side of the toilet bowl and the door opening inwards - that she was unable to free herself and spent the week calling for help .
It was n't until Michael Hibberd was hanging out his washing at his home on Sunday morning that he heard her cries .
" It seems a bit 21st century , how un- neighbourly we are , and I do feel bad in a way that I did n't hear her cry for help sooner , but I 'm glad that I was in the right place at the right time and did hear her when I did , " he told The Queensland Times .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
One in nine Americans are using federal food stamps to help buy groceries as the country ’s deep recession forced another 591,000 people onto the federal anti-hunger program at latest count .
Enrollment jumped 2 percent to 33.2 million people in March , the fourth consecutive month that rolls hit a record , said the Agriculture Department .
The average monthly benefit was $ 113.87 per person .
“ It ’s tough out there for struggling families and will be for many months to come , ” Jim Weill , president of the Food Research and Action Center , said .
“ It ’s very likely that the numbers will continue to grow in the coming months as a turnaround in unemployment and wage declines typically lags behind the recovery of the broader economy , ” he said .
In 20 states , as many as one in eight are on the food stamp program , according to the Food Research Center .
The U.S. economy has contracted sharply since last fall , with nearly 6 million jobs disappearing since the beginning of 2008 .
Further job losses are expected as the recession grinds on .
Congress allocated some $ 54 billion for food stamps this fiscal year , up sharply from $ 39 billion last year .
In the new fiscal year beginning Oct 1 , costs are estimated at $ 60 billion .
U.S. enrollment in recent months :
March - 33.157 million
February - 32.556 million
January - 32.205 million
December 2008 - 31.784 million
November 2008 - 31.097 million
October 2008 - 31.050 million
Sept 2008 - 31.587 million

" You have the power to hold your leaders accountable . "
- President Obama , Ghana , July 14 , 2009
While Congress says it is gearing up to investigate what is old news , that CIA and Special Ops forces are killing Al Qaeda leaders , a decision of far different gravity is being contemplated by Attorney General Eric Holder .
The new insistence of Congress on its oversight role , conspicuously absent throughout 8 years of Bush , is suddenly rearing its head in the form of questioning a policy which has been in place with no controversy for years .
The U.S. has been hunting and killing Al Qaeda leaders outside of official war zones since 2004 , when the New York Times reported that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had signed an order authorizing Special Forces to kill Al Qaeda where they found them .
As recently as September 2008 CBS reported that Special Forces struck Qaeda leadership in Pakistan .
The decision faced by Holder , whether or not to appoint a Special Prosecutor on torture , is of a different gravity altogether .
A weight of evidence keeps building which indicates torture was employed on innocent men , that it did n't work , and that it did n't prevent any attacks .
And it gets worse .
Bush 's own FBI Director Robert Mueller recently confirmed to the New York Times what he told Vanity Fair a year ago , that " to [ his ] knowledge " torture did n't prevent a single attack .
Former Legendary CIA Director William Colby has said that torture is " ineffective . "
Harper 's Magazine 's Scott Horton now suggests there are two Eric Holders at war with each other :
Holder the good soldier who knows well the preference of his boss for prosecutions to not take place , and Holder the servant of the law who is aware that what he does now may determine what is likely to happen again .
It is becoming clear that such an investigation , if it happens , will not stop with a few low - ranking scapegoats .
Horton notes :
" President Obama 's assurance to CIA officials who relied on the opinions of government lawyers in implementing these programs , an assurance that Holder himself repeated , would have to be worked in .
That suggests that the focus would likely be on the lawyers and policymakers who authorized use of the new techniques . "
And CIA whistleblower Ray McGovern writes this week :
" the buck stops - actually , in this case , it began - with President Bush .
Senate Armed Services Committee leaders Carl Levin and John McCain on Dec. 11 , 2008 , released the executive summary of a report , approved by the full committee without dissent , concluding that Bush 's Feb. 7 , 2002 , memorandum " opened the door to considering aggressive techniques . " "
What changed with Holder ?
Horton writes in " The Torture Prosecution Turnaround ? " :
" Holder began his review mindful of the clear preference of President Obama 's two key political advisers -- David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel - - that there be no investigation .
Axelrod and Emanuel are described as uninterested in either the legal or policy merits of the issue of a criminal investigation .
Their concerns turn entirely on their political analysis ... Holder initially appeared prepared to satisfy their wishes . "
This attitude seemed to change after Obama 's speech at the CIA , when Emanual and Axelrod moved out front to say there would be no prosecutions .
According to Horton :
" In the days after Obama 's speech at the CIA , both Axelrod and Emanuel insisted that the White House had made the decision that there would be no prosecutions .
According to reliable sources , that incensed Holder , who felt that the remarks had compromised the integrity both of the White House and Justice Department by suggesting that political advisers made the call on who would or would not be criminally investigated . "
To make things worse for the Bush administration , evidence is emerging that they can no longer even rely on exhibit A and B of the Torture Works theory , Al Zabudaya and Kalid Shiek Mohammed , the latter of whom is still confessing to everything short of being the real Boston Strangler .
I guess if I 'd been waterboarded 82 times I 'd be babbling too .
The FBI Special Agent who interrogated Abu Zubayda , recently breaking a 7 - year silence after reading the " torture memos , " wrote in the New York Times :
" One of the most striking parts of the memos is the false premises on which they are based .
The first , dated August 2002 , grants authorization to use harsh interrogation techniques on a high - ranking terrorist , Abu Zubaydah , on the grounds that previous methods had n't been working .
The next three memos cite the successes of those methods as a justification for their continued use .
It is inaccurate , however , to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative .
Along with another F.B.I. agent , and with several C.I.A. officers present , I questioned him from March to June 2002 , before the harsh techniques were introduced later in August .
Under traditional interrogation methods , he provided us with important actionable intelligence ... This experience fit what I had found throughout my counterterrorism career : traditional interrogation techniques are successful in identifying operatives , uncovering plots and saving lives . "
Then there is the political risk to the Obama administration that Axelrod and Emanual have miscalculated , and that , in fact , the rest of the president 's agenda is hamstrung while a growing number of Americans call for existing laws to be enforced .
What is haunting Americans could be , in Washington jargon , " sucking oxygen " out of the debate , and " moving forward " is a pipe dream until pending business is dealt with .
Spontaneous and planned rallies calling for a Special Prosecutor are growing , not diminishing .
In addition , the worse revelations may be yet to come in the horrifying saga of what happened when , as Major General Anthony Taguba says :
" [ a ] permissive environment [ was ] created by implicit and explicit authorizations by senior US officials to " take the gloves off " ... "
President Jimmy Carter wrote that the Red Cross , Amnesty International and the Pentagon " have gathered substantial testimony of torture of children , confirmed by soldiers who witnessed or participated in the abuse . "
In " Our Endangered Values " Carter said that the Red Cross found after visiting six U.S. prisons " 107 detainees under eighteen , some as young as eight years old . "
And reporter Hersh , ( who broke the Abu Ghraib torture scandal , ) reported 800 - 900 Pakistani boys aged 13 to 15 in custody .
Journalist Seymour Hersh's ( who broke the Abu Ghraib scandal ) bombshell before the ACLU some years ago has been in a temporary slumber , as there is question as to whether the videotapes in possession of the Pentagon were among those claimed to be destroyed .
Destroyed or not , there is still the conscience of soldiers and agents who bore witness to contend with , as the reign of political terror against whistleblowers which characterized the Bush administration subsides .
Hersh said :
" Some of the worst things that happened you do n't know about , okay ?
Videos , um , there are women there .
Some of you may have read that they were passing letters out , communications out to their men .
This is at Abu Ghraib ...
The women were passing messages out saying ' Please come and kill me , because of what 's happened ' and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys , children in cases that have been recorded .
The boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling .
And the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has .
They are in total terror .
It 's going to come out . "
" The American public needs to understand , we 're talking about rape and murder here .
We 're not just talking about giving people a humiliating experience .
We 're talking about rape and murder and some very serious charges . "
History is just beginning to sort out the Bush era , with stubborn facts showing a resilience that Fox News talking points cannot , and more emerging .
Today , even among Republicans , it is difficult to find those who will embrace Richard Nixon , though for a while he was every bit the perceived victim of " left - wing hate " that Bush and Cheney are now .
Incredibly , to compare Nixon to Bush - Cheney is to do a deeply flawed man a disservice .
Nixon inherited Vietnam .
He did not orchestrate from whole cloth a campaign to link Saddam with 9/11 , and strenuously push to war despite the objections of his countrymen and the world .
Nixon spied on political enemies .
He did not use a tragedy to illegally spy on millions , the true numbers of which we still do not know because congress has never investigated .
It 's almost possible to feel sorry for the shifty , friendless Nixon .
It is less possible to feel so for the smirking Bush , who thought nothing of telling soldier 's families that war critics were saying that their loved ones " had died in vain . "
A compilation in November2008 of other evidence of alleged incidents involving children at the time recounts :

What is it about Internet connections these days ?
StarCraft 2 wo n't be supporting LAN play , although Blizzard promises us that when we see the new version of Battle .
net we wo n't be bothered .
Battlefield Heroes had a rocky start when it came to keeping servers up , but some people argue that since it 's still in beta , we need to cut it some slack .
Battlefield 1943 continues to have problems , and that game costs $ 15 ... harder to rationalize the connection errors .
So what hope does Command and Conquer 4 have ?
The game will require you to be online at all times , but if your Internet connection dies , or EA 's servers go down , you wo n't be able to play .
Not online , not single - player , not at all .
So we have to ask , is this enough to keep your from buying the game ?
A comment in a story yesterday said this may be time for another poll , and I can't agree more .
Most people were incredibly turned off by the Internet connection requirement of Command and Conquer 4 , although there were a few people who stepped up to the plate with some rather reasoned defenses for EA 's behavior .
So let 's see what the community thinks : does the requirement of an Internet connection that 's always on to play a game mean that the title goes into the " do not buy " bin ?
Let 's see what you say .
Would an always - on Internet connection requirement cause you to pass on a game ? ( polls )
One of the strangest claims of today ’s environmentalists is that “ green ” technology is actually highly productive and efficient , so that by switching to environmentally friendly production methods , firms can increase their profits , and by adopting energy efficient practices at home , consumers can save money .
Obama ’s plan to outlaw incandescent light bulbs , for example , is being pitched in terms of efficiency and thrift :
“ I know light bulbs may not seem sexy , but this simple action holds enormous promise because 7 percent of all the energy consumed in America is used to light our homes and businesses , ” the president said , standing alongside Energy Secretary Steven Chu at the White House .
Obama said the new efficiency standards he was announcing for lamps would result in substantial savings between 2012 and 2042 , saving consumers up to $ 4 billion annually , conserving enough energy to power every U.S. home for 10 months , reducing emissions equal to the amount produced by 166 million cars a year , and eliminating the need for as many as 14 coal - fired power plants .
In other words , consumers can save up to $ 4 billion annually by switching to the kinds of bulbs the President likes ( presumably the ugly knotty ones that produce that creepy shade of bluish - white ) , but consumers are too foolish to do this on their own .
Likewise , firms can reap substantial rewards by producing and marketing these über - bulbs , but are too shortsighted to make the necessary investments without a government mandate .
As a marketing strategy , I understand perfectly the government ’s and the Green ’s approach here .
If market participants had a good idea of the true costs and benefits of such policies , they would reject them out of hand .
Better to persuade consumers that expensive environmental mandates are really money - saving devices .
But , of course , this is logically inconsistent , absent some kind of subtle and complex “ market failure ” argument .
Nothing stops firms from adopting efficient technologies and consumers from switching to lower - cost products .
Indeed , that is exactly what they do on the free market .
If you have to force them to switch , it ’s hard to make the case that the switch is really in their best interest , absent crass paternalism .
Oh , I forgot , this really is all about crass paternalism .

Holes that are 5 mm usually allow the most variation in customizations , but any size will do as long as the drilled holes and bulb sizes match .

Advertisement A man suspected of raping a woman 12 years ago cannot face prosecution , as the police have lost the case file .
Wendell Baker 's DNA matches that of the man who broke into Hazel Backwell 's home in Stratford east London , beat and raped her and left her in a cupboard .
Mr Baker was charged with rape , but a judge ruled his DNA had been unlawfully retained .
This decision was then overturned by the Law Lords in 2000 .
The story has come to light following a BBC investigation into the case .
If the police have no case file then we cannot apply for a retrial
CPS spokesman A retrial cannot take place unless the original case file can be found .
Mrs Backwell , who has since died , was 66 at the time of the attack .
She was asleep in her home when the intruder broke in , struck her over the head , tied her hands behind her back and sexually assaulted her .
She spent 15 hours in a cupboard below the stairs before she was found by a friend who raised the alarm .
A change in the double jeopardy law in 2005 would allow a retrial to take place if there was " new and compelling evidence " .
But a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said after " extensive " searches police could not find the file , which contains the victim 's statement and details of supporting evidence .
Hazel Backwell was found by a friend in an understairs cupboard Searches and inquiries have been carried out in the police archives , at the Forensic Science Service , the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , the Old Bailey , the Royal Courts of Justice and the House of Lords .
The original trial judge and barristers have also also been contacted , it is understood .
The police spokeswoman added that losing the case files was " deeply regrettable " .
" It is not a case we can progress any further , " she said .
A CPS spokesman confirmed a search had been carried out for the file but said it was the police 's responsibility to look after such documents .
" If the police have no case file then we cannot apply for a retrial , " he added .
Earlier this year , the law lords lifted a ban on naming Mr Baker in a case which was brought by the BBC .
Sam Collyns , a producer at Mentorn Media which undertook the investigation for the BBC , said : " We 're bewildered and bemused that police have lost files that contain evidence critical to the case .
" The police should look harder - the public interest in bringing this man to justice is overwhelming . "
He added : " It seems embarrassing to say the least that the police have misplaced the paperwork . "
The story is due to be featured on BBC1 investigative show Double Jeopardy at 2235 BST on Thursday .

By George Friedman U.S. Vice President Joe Biden 's visit to Georgia and Ukraine partly answered questions over how U.S. - Russian talks went during U.S. President Barack Obama 's visit to Russia in early July .
That Biden 's visit took place at all reaffirms the U.S. commitment to the principle that Russia does not have the right to a sphere of influence in these countries or anywhere in the former Soviet Union .
The Americans ' willingness to confront the Russians on an issue of fundamental national interest to Russia therefore requires some explanation , as on the surface it seems a high - risk maneuver .
Biden provided insights into the analytic framework of the Obama administration on Russia in a July 26 interview with The Wall Street Journal .
In it , Biden said the United States " vastly " underestimates its hand .
He added that " Russia has to make some very difficult , calculated decisions .
They have a shrinking population base , they have a withering economy , they have a banking sector and structure that is not likely to be able to withstand the next 15 years , they 're in a situation where the world is changing before them and they 're clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable . "
U.S. Policy Continuity
The Russians have accused the United States of supporting pro-American forces in Ukraine , Georgia and other countries of the former Soviet Union under the cover of supporting democracy .
They see the U.S. goal as surrounding the Soviet Union with pro-American states to put the future of the Russian Federation at risk .
The summer 2008 Russian military action in Georgia was intended to deliver a message to the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union that Russia was not prepared to tolerate such developments but was prepared to reverse them by force of arms if need be .
Following his July summit , Obama sent Biden to the two most sensitive countries in the former Soviet Union — Ukraine and Georgia — to let the Russians know that the United States was not backing off its strategy in spite of Russian military superiority in the immediate region .
In the long run , the United States is much more powerful than the Russians , and Biden was correct when he explicitly noted Russia 's failing demographics as a principal factor in Moscow 's long - term decline .
But to paraphrase a noted economist , we do n't live in the long run .
Right now , the Russian correlation of forces along Russia 's frontiers clearly favors the Russians , and the major U.S. deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan would prevent the Americans from intervening should the Russians choose to challenge pro-American governments in the former Soviet Union directly .
Even so , Biden 's visit and interview show the Obama administration is maintaining the U.S. stance on Russia that has been in place since the Reagan years .
Reagan saw the economy as Russia 's basic weakness .
He felt that the greater the pressure on the Russian economy , the more forthcoming the Russians would be on geopolitical matters .
The more concessions they made on geopolitical matters , the weaker their hold on Eastern Europe .
And if Reagan 's demand that Russia “ Tear down this wall , Mr. Gorbachev ” was met , the Soviets would collapse .
Ever since the Reagan administration , the idee fixe of not only the United States , but also NATO , China and Japan has been that the weakness of the Russian economy made it impossible for the Russians to play a significant regional role , let alone a global one .
Therefore , regardless of Russian wishes , the West was free to forge whatever relations it wanted among Russian allies like Serbia and within the former Soviet Union .
And certainly during the 1990s , Russia was paralyzed .
Biden , however , is saying that whatever the current temporary regional advantage the Russians might have , in the end , their economy is crippled and Russia is not a country to be taken seriously .
He went on publicly to point out that this should not be pointed out publicly , as there is no value in embarrassing Russia .
The Russians certainly now understand what it means to hit the reset button Obama had referred to :
The reset is back to the 1980s and 1990s .
Reset to the 1980s and 90s
To calculate the Russian response , it is important to consider how someone like Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin views the events of the 1980s and 1990s .
After all , Putin was a KGB officer under Yuri Andropov , the former head of the KGB and later Chairman of the Communist Party for a short time — and the architect of glasnost and perestroika .
It was the KGB that realized first that the Soviet Union was failing , which made sense because only the KGB had a comprehensive sense of the state of the Soviet Union .
Andropov 's strategy was to shift from technology transfer through espionage — apparently Putin 's mission as a junior intelligence officer in Dresden in the former East Germany — to a more formal process of technology transfer .
To induce the West to transfer technology and to invest in the Soviet Union , Moscow had to make substantial concessions in the area in which the West cared the most : geopolitics .
To get what it needed , the Soviets had to dial back on the Cold War .
Glasnost , or openness , had as its price reducing the threat to the West .
But the greater part of the puzzle was perestroika , or the restructuring of the Soviet economy .
This was where the greatest risk came , since the entire social and political structure of the Soviet Union was built around a command economy .
But that economy was no longer functioning , and without perestroika , all of the investment and technology transfer would be meaningless .
The Soviet Union could not metabolize it .
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was a communist , as we seem to forget , and a follower of Andropov .
He was not a liberalizer because he saw liberalization as a virtue ; rather , he saw it as a means to an end .
And that end was saving the Communist Party , and with it the Soviet state .
Gorbachev also understood that the twin challenge of concessions to the West geopolitically and a top - down revolution in Russia economically — simultaneously — risked massive destabilization .
This is what Reagan was counting on , and what Gorbachev was trying to prevent .
Gorbachev lost Andropov 's gamble .
The Soviet Union collapsed , and with it the Communist Party .
What followed was a decade of economic horror , at least as most Russians viewed it .
From the West 's point of view , collapse looked like liberalization .
From the Russian point of view , Russia went from a superpower that was poor to an even poorer geopolitical cripple .
For the Russians , the experiment was a double failure .
Not only did the Russian Empire retreat to the borders of the 18th century , but the economy became even more dysfunctional , except for a handful of oligarchs and some of their Western associates who stole whatever was n't nailed down .
The Russians , and particularly Putin , took away a different lesson than the West did .
The West assumed that economic dysfunction caused the Soviet Union to fail .
Putin and his colleagues took away the idea that it was the attempt to repair economic dysfunction through wholesale reforms that caused Russia to fail .
From Putin 's point of view , economic well - being and national power do not necessarily work in tandem where Russia is concerned .
Russian Power , With or Without Prosperity Russia has been an economic wreck for most of its history , both under the czars and under the Soviets .
The geography of Russia has a range of weaknesses , as we have explored .
Russia 's geography , daunting infrastructural challenges and demographic structure all conspire against it .
But the strategic power of Russia was never synchronized to its economic well - being .
Certainly , following World War II the Russian economy was shattered and never quite came back together .
Yet Russian global power was still enormous .
A look at the crushing poverty — but undeniable power — of Russia during broad swaths of time from 1600 until Andropov arrived on the scene certainly gives credence to Putin 's view .
The problems of the 1980s had as much to do with the weakening and corruption of the Communist Party under former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev as it had to do with intrinsic economic weakness .
To put it differently , the Soviet Union was an economic wreck under Joseph Stalin as well .
The Germans made a massive mistake in confusing Soviet economic weakness with military weakness .
During the Cold War , the United States did not make that mistake .
It understood that Soviet economic weakness did not track with Russian strategic power .
Moscow might not be able to house its people , but its military power was not to be dismissed .
What made an economic cripple into a military giant was political power .
Both the czar and the Communist Party maintained a ruthless degree of control over society .
That meant Moscow could divert resources from consumption to the military and suppress resistance .
In a state run by terror , dissatisfaction with the state of the economy does not translate into either policy shifts or military weakness — and certainly not in the short term .
Huge percentages of gross domestic product can be devoted to military purposes , even if used inefficiently there .
Repression and terror smooth over public opinion .
The czar used repression widely , and it was not until the army itself rebelled in World War I that the regime collapsed .
Under Stalin , even at the worst moments of World War II , the army did not rebel .
In both regimes , economic dysfunction was accepted as the inevitable price of strategic power .
And dissent — even the hint of dissent — was dealt with by the only truly efficient state enterprise : the security apparatus , whether called the Okhraina , Cheka , NKVD , MGB or KGB .
From the point of view of Putin , who has called the Soviet collapse the greatest tragedy of our time , the problem was not economic dysfunction .
Rather , it was the attempt to completely overhaul the Soviet Union 's foreign and domestic policies simultaneously that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union .
And that collapse did not lead to an economic renaissance .
Biden might not have meant to gloat , but he drove home the point that Putin believes .
For Putin , the West , and particularly the United States , engineered the fall of the Soviet Union by policies crafted by the Reagan administration — and that same policy remains in place under the Obama administration .
It is not clear that Putin and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev disagree with Biden 's analysis — the Russian economy truly is " withering " — except in one sense .
Given the policies Putin has pursued , the Russian prime minister must believe he has a way to cope with that .
In the short run , Putin might well have such a coping mechanism , and this is the temporary window of opportunity Biden alluded to .
But in the long run , the solution is not improving the economy — that would be difficult , if not outright impossible , for a country as large and lightly populated as Russia .
Rather , the solution is accepting that Russia 's economic weakness is endemic and creating a regime that allows Russia to be a great power in spite of that .
Such a regime is the one that can create military power in the face of broad poverty , something we will call the " Chekist state . "
This state uses its security apparatus , now known as the FSB , to control the public through repression , freeing the state to allocate resources to the military as needed .
In other words , this is Putin coming full circle to his KGB roots , but without the teachings of an Andropov or Gorbachev to confuse the issue .
This is not an ideological stance ; it applies to the Romanovs and to the Bolsheviks .
It is an operational principle embedded in Russian geopolitics and history .
Counting on Russian strategic power to track Russian economic power is risky .
Certainly , it did in the 1980s and 1990s , but Putin has worked to decouple the two .
On the surface , it might seem a futile gesture , but in Russian history , this decoupling is the norm .
Obama seems to understand this to the extent that he has tried to play off Medvedev ( who appears less traditional ) from Putin ( who appears to be the more traditional ) , but we do not think this is a viable strategy — this is not a matter of Russian political personalities but of Russian geopolitical necessity .
Biden seems to be saying that the Reagan strategy can play itself out permanently .
Our view is that it plays itself out only so long as the Russian regime does n't reassert itself with the full power of the security apparatus and does n't decouple economic and military growth .
Biden 's strategy works so long as this does n't happen .
But in Russian history , this decoupling is the norm and the past 20 years is the exception .
A strategy that assumes the Russians will once again decouple economic and military power requires a different response than ongoing , subcritical pressure .
It requires that the window of opportunity the United States has handed Russia by its wars in the Islamic world be closed , and that the pressure on Russia be dramatically increased before the Russians move toward full repression and rapid rearmament .
Ironically , in the very long run of the next couple of generations , it probably does n't matter whether the West heads off Russia at the pass because of another factor Biden mentioned : Russia 's shrinking demographics .
Russian demography has been steadily worsening since World War I , particularly because birth rates have fallen .
This slow - motion degradation turned into collapse during the 1990s .
Russia 's birth rates are now well below starkly higher death rates ; Russia already has more citizens in their 50s than in their teens .
Russia can be a major power without a solid economy , but no one can be a major power without people .
But even with demographics as poor as Russia 's , demographics do not change a country overnight .
This is Russia 's moment , and the generation or so it will take demography to grind Russia down can be made very painful for the Americans .
Biden has stated the American strategy : squeeze the Russians and let nature take its course .
We suspect the Russians will squeeze back hard before they move off the stage of history .

Apple Quick To Yank Off to More iPhone Porn
You have to give a hand to Apple ( NSDQ : AAPL ) — as fast as new controversies over pornographic material on its iPhone are cropping up , the company has been just as quick to jerk the offending developers ’ off its iTunes App Store .
Following last week ’s tug over the “ Hottest Girls ” app , the latest issue concerns an iPhone app called “ BeautyMeter ” by German developer Braun Software .
BeautyMeter , a Hot or Not - type service launched for the iPhone on Jan. 17 , has apparently been used to post nude images for quite some time , despite lacking a nudity warning in its App Rating .
That alone might have shined a spotlight on Cupertino , Calif . - based Apple ’s inconsistency regarding pornography in the App Store , but the real trouble arose Wednesday when an iPhone app review site discovered nude photos on BeautyMeter of a purported 15 - year - old girl .
Raciness is one thing , potential child pornography is even better — and Apple pulled the BeautyMeter application from the iTunes App Store early Thursday morning .
Krabbs , the Web site that first discovered the offending Beauty Meter picture , reports that despite the removal of the app , “ previous downloads are still fully functional ( wink wink ) — including access to the infamous 15 - year - old nude image . ”
Apple has certainly been coming on to new things recently , and purging the App Store of all traces of Beauty Meter may take some time , but the company did demonstrate Thursday that it can tackle a problem with speed when it ’s of a mind .
Thirty percent favor new law , but not necessarily this year ; a quarter oppose new law at any time
PRINCETON , NJ -- Seven in 10 Americans favor the passage of new healthcare reform legislation , but less than half ( 41 % ) say a new law needs to be passed this year .
Results from a Gallup Poll conducted Thursday night , one day after President Obama 's press conference at which he emphasized the importance of moving quickly on healthcare reform legislation , show that 41 % of Americans would advise their representative in Congress to pass a new healthcare reform law by the end of this year ; another 30 % would say Congress should pass a new law , but not necessarily this year ; and the remainder -- 24 % -- do n't think Congress should pass a new healthcare reform law at all .
The urgency of the effort to pass new healthcare reform legislation has become a significant focus of President Obama 's full - court press on the issue .
Obama has argued that without a short - term deadline for passing such a law , momentum would be lost and inertia would rule -- lowering the probability that such legislation would ever be passed .
The data show that about 4 out of 10 Americans generally agree with Obama -- that a new healthcare law needs to be passed this year .
But that leaves the majority of Americans who do not agree , either because they believe a delay is acceptable , or because they do n't believe such a law is needed at all .
There are strong partisan differences in response to this question .
Sixty - three percent of Democrats are behind the effort to pass a new healthcare law this year , with most of the rest choosing the alternative of passing a new law , but not necessarily this year .
Almost half of Republicans , on the other hand , favor not passing a new healthcare reform law at all ; the slight majority of the rest favor passing a new law , but not necessarily this year , leaving 22 % of Republicans favoring a new law to be passed this year .
The crucial bloc of independents -- at this point the largest of the three partisan groups -- are much more mixed in their views , as would be expected .
A little more than a third say pass a new law this year ; a third say pass a new law , but not necessarily this year ; and about a fourth say do n't pass a new law at all .
Implications
The good news for the Obama administration : 7 in 10 Americans would advise their representative in Congress to pass a new healthcare reform law -- one of President Obama 's major domestic priorities .
The not - so - good news for Obama is that less than half ( 41 % ) favor passing such a law this year , with 30 % favoring a new law but saying it is not necessary to move that quickly .
About a quarter of Americans , the majority of whom are Republicans , would advise their representative in Congress not to pass a new healthcare reform law at all .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,030 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted July 23 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±x percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Polls conducted entirely in one day , such as this one , are subject to additional error or bias not found in polls conducted over several days .

PEP 372 : Ordered Dictionaries ¶
Regular Python dictionaries iterate over key / value pairs in arbitrary order .
Over the years , a number of authors have written alternative implementations that remember the order that the keys were originally inserted .
Based on the experiences from those implementations , a new collections .
OrderedDict class has been introduced .
The OrderedDict API is substantially the same as regular dictionaries but will iterate over keys and values in a guaranteed order depending on when a key was first inserted .
If a new entry overwrites an existing entry , the original insertion position is left unchanged .
Deleting an entry and reinserting it will move it to the end .
The standard library now supports use of ordered dictionaries in several modules .
The configparser module uses them by default .
This lets configuration files be read , modified , and then written back in their original order .
The _asdict ( ) method for collections.namedtuple ( ) now returns an ordered dictionary with the values appearing in the same order as the underlying tuple indicies .
The json module is being built - out with an object_pairs_hook to allow OrderedDicts to be built by the decoder .
Support was also added for third - party tools like PyYAML .
See also PEP 372 - Ordered Dictionaries PEP written by Armin Ronacher and Raymond Hettinger .
Implementation written by Raymond Hettinger .
Since an ordered dictionary remembers its insertion order , it can be used in conjuction with sorting to make a sorted dictionary :
>>> # regular unsorted dictionary >>> d = { ' banana ' : 3 , ' apple ' : 4 , ' pear ' : 1 , ' orange ' : 2 } >>>
# dictionary sorted by key >>>
OrderedDict ( sorted ( d . items ( ) , key = lambda t : t [ 0 ] ) ) OrderedDict ( [ ( ' apple ' , 4 ) , ( ' banana ' , 3 ) , ( ' orange ' , 2 ) , ( ' pear ' , 1 ) ] ) >>>
# dictionary sorted by value >>>
OrderedDict ( sorted ( d . items ( ) , key = lambda t : t [ 1 ] ) ) OrderedDict ( [ ( ' pear ' , 1 ) , ( ' orange ' , 2 ) , ( ' banana ' , 3 ) , ( ' apple ' , 4 ) ] ) >>>
# dictionary sorted by length of the key string >>>
OrderedDict ( sorted ( d . items ( ) , key = lambda t : len ( t [ 0 ] ) ) ) OrderedDict ( [ ( ' pear ' , 1 ) , ( ' apple ' , 4 ) , ( ' orange ' , 2 ) , ( ' banana ' , 3 ) ] )
The new sorted dictionaries maintain their sort order when entries are deleted .
But when new keys are added , the keys are appended to the end and the sort is not maintained .

Ralph Peters is an angry man , apparently plagued with what might be called a Napoleonic complex , no offense to the old Corsican .
Like most neoconservatives , he has been strutting and fretting upon the stage of mainstream media for some time .
But in a strange discontinuity with Shakespeare ’s poetry , we find that the tales told by this idiot do , in fact , signify something .
Ralph is a retired Army intelligence officer , and the author of a long series of books and articles .
His novels are formulaic adventures , his non-fiction at times interesting and thought - provoking .
Peters has assessed the state of the American empire accurately in some ways , although he seems to be childishly in love with it , on the side of the great US - centric , Amero - dominant world planners , Friedmanite flat - earthers , neoconservative American globalists and adherents of Thomas P.M. Barnett ’s phantasmagoric Pentagon " new map . "
To hear how these folks perceive goodness and structure in the world , listen to Barnett last year celebrating Clinton ’s Balkan adventurism as wonderful and successful because it created new US dependent states who " are now contributing more NATO troops to Afghanistan than the rest of NATO combined . "
Barnett calls this " exporting security . "
Ralph and his fellow believers should not be too upset .
While reality has bitten and bitten hard , the neoconservative - imperial - dominance fantasy has found both empowerment and audience in the bureaucratic and political constructs that feed parasitically on the wealth of nations and peoples , particularly those in democratic socialist empires like ours .
What infuriates Ralph Peters is that something has gone out of state control .
On a human scale , that " something " is 23 - year - old Army Private Bowe Bergdahl .
Bergdahl walked away and got captured by the Taliban , and was later filmed drinking tea and looking rested , in what the Pentagon immediately termed a " propaganda " video .
They should know .
Regarding the strange case of Private Bergdahl , Peters expresses venom usually reserved for only the extremely sputtering and stupid on FoxNews .
Even the FOX newsreader , who had just expressed sincere pride that FOX News Corp refused to harm American Foreign Policy by airing the Taliban video of Bergdahl ( available everywhere on the internet , of course ! ) was taken aback by Peter ’s bloodlust .
Not for the Taliban — no , Peters and the rest of the American war machinery in the Middle East want the Taliban .
They need the Taliban and they need it big , bad , and brutal .
This is " The Enemy " and it helps keep the homefront from falling off the war wagon , something the American public is increasingly doing in an age where a hundred seeds of newthink on the righteousness of the federal warfare / welfare state have found fertile ground .
Peters ’ bloodlust is based on his inside track idea that Private Bergdahl , in an act of unspeakable and awesome defiance , deserted the Afghanistan campaign .
That perhaps Bergdahl had become sympathetic to the Afghans we have been destroying .
Perhaps he got fed up with what he was being told to do .
Perhaps he discovered he was n’t cut out to be a merc , or maybe he was captured ( as Taliban media suggested , the drunken private stumbled out of his garrison ) because military order had broken down .
Whatever it was , for Peters to become enraged over soldier " disloyalty " indicates extreme fear .
Is Bergdahl representative of other Army trends in Afghanistan like torture prisons and mass murder of civilians that we ought to know about ?
On a systems level , Peter ’s anger may reflect his concern — along the lines of the early Pentagon screaming about Taliban propaganda — that in fact , the Taliban are coming off looking like everything we want to be in Afghanistan .
Competent , high tech , well meaning , honoring their basic religious values , and taking care of the weak and unfortunate , even if one of them is a temporary enemy .
Oh sh%$@
I can see why Peters and the team might be worried .
Lastly , on a strategic level , Peter ’s anger may not be real at all .
His FoxNews interview suggesting that the cost - saving features of Private Bergdahl ’s death while in Taliban custody could have been designed , just as DIA leakage to old hand Ralphie of the whole " Bergdahl the Defeatist Defector " storyline , to prepare the media for sympathetic reporting of just one more American death to come , in another ill - fated drone strike or special forces raid with good intentions that left no witnesses .
Peters suggested further that such a raid should occur inside Pakistan , to serve both as warning to American troops who might be considering Bowe’ing out , and to Iranians , Afghans , Iraqis and Pakistanis , among others that no Middle Eastern country has territorial sovereignty where the Americans are concerned .
In this case , as Peters predicted , we would indeed be saved the cost and embarrassment of a trial for Bergdahl , and any sustained national discussion of either the soldier ’s motivations and actions , any or all of which discredit the American operation in Afghanistan .
Maybe I ’m reading too much into Peters ’ shocking display of peevishness and cruelty .
Maybe he is just in a bad mood because as Chris Hedges wrote this week , Americans are increasingly aware that we are engaged in a war without purpose .
Americans not associated with or beholden to big military , politicized gas , the global heroin trade and neoconservative visions of a subordinated and obedient Middle East are coming to the Hedges conclusion that we do n’t really need Afghanistan at all .
Bowe Bergdahl stated that he ’s scared that he wo n’t be able to come home .
If Ralph Peters and other cruel and pampered neoconservative visionaries get their way , Bowe and many more Americans will die in Afghanistan this month , and for years to come .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Fight police misconduct with a cell phone , the NAACP says .
The century - old civil rights organization has launched an online reporting system that lets users upload cell phone images of alleged police abuses .
The Rapid Report System also lets users send text messages and e-mails about alleged misconduct .
" We know that most of police officers around the nation are excellent public servants .
But the few who violate people 's rights are often not held accountable , " said Benjamin Jealous , president and CEO of the NAACP .
" Research has shown that there are many barriers to reporting incidents of police misconduct , including intimidation at police departments and a lack of trust in the integrity of the system , among other reasons .
This breakdown leads to an absence of public safety and a deterioration of the quality of life in many communities of color . "
The NAACP unveiled the online system Monday at its national convention in New York City .
Users can post images from their cell phones or online .
Cell phone footage has repeatedly helped spotlight alleged police misconduct in recent years .
The fatal shooting of an unarmed man in Oakland , California , on New Year 's Day made headlines and spread across the Internet partly because of cell phone video .
The killing sparked large protests in Oakland and led to a murder charge against the transit officer .

Here 's the thing :
The world already knows what was done in the name of the United States Of America .
I imagine that the logic is that releasing more photos will not only cause more anger , it will serve as a recruiting tool for radical groups already bent on attacking the USA .
Want to blunt that tool ?
Show the world that those who tortured will be treated like the criminals that they are .
Frankly , it should n't matter anyway what anyone else thinks , torture is a crime .
Our jails are full of people who committed far less serious offenses .
Our behavior does n't need to be based on its potential P.R. impact , if we follow and enforce the law and our conscience as a nation , our standing in the world will be improved .
Heads of the Pikuach Nefesh rabbinical committee have begun collecting the signatures of rabbis in Israel on a letter to United States President Barack Obama .
The letter demands that Obama cease talking about ending Jewish construction in Jerusalem and stop pressuring Israel in that direction .
In a reference to the upcoming “ nine days ” which culminate in Tisha B’Av , the rabbis tell Obama that “ during these days , in which the Jewish people mourns the destruction of Jerusalem and marks the disgraceful memory of its destroyers , we are certain that you , Mr. Barack Obama , do not want to enter that disreputable list of those who raise their hand to strike Jerusalem and those who live in it . ”
We are certain that you , Mr. Barack Obama , do not want to enter that disreputable list of those who raise their hand to strike Jerusalem and those who live in it .
The rabbis note that during his visit to the Middle East , Obama showed “ impressive erudition ” in the Koran .
“ As one who is familiar with the Koran , you surely know that the city of Jerusalem is not even mentioned in it once , ” they said .
Jews pray towards one place
“ The Arab and Muslim world never recognized Jerusalem as belonging to it , ” the letter went on .
“ On the other hand , all of the world ’s nations knew for thousands of years that the Jews pray towards one place only – the holy city of Jerusalem . ”
The rabbis added that even putting aside the city ’s enormous sanctity and importance for the Jewish people , there is no realpolitik logic behind any concession to the PA .
“ Since Israel began negotiations , withdrawals and concessions to the Palestinians , the entire world is witness to the justice of the Jewish Law ( Halacha ) which determines that any such concession will entail another round of bloodshed and deepen mistrust and dangers , ” they agreed .
The rabbinical letter ends with a clear request : “ If you , Mr. Obama .
Wish to leave any chance at all for peace and quiet in the Middle East , take your hands off the Holy City of Jerusalem right now ! ”
Two hundred and fifty rabbis have signed the appeal , and efforts are being made to collect the signatures of almost every single rabbi in Israel before the letter is sent to Washington .
MPs have taken up the case of two young newlyweds who are being forced apart as an unintended consequence of a new immigration law aimed at protecting Asian women from forced marriages .
Adam Wallis and Canadian Rochelle Roberts , who married in the UK a week after her visa ran out , face an enforced year and a half of separation until she is 21 …
Keith Vaz , the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee , said last night the case could prompt a change in the law , adding : “ This is clearly a case which needs to be looked at by a minister .
What needs to happen is the government needs to say , ministers in the Home Office need to say , that this is not what we intended with this act … ”
This is as stupid as the Zero Tolerance regulations much beloved of school administrators in the United States .
Removing the requirement to think – removes responsibility for stupid decisions .
Supposedly .
The couple met in Canada more than two years ago and remained in close contact before she decided to visit him at his home in Aberystwyth , Wales , last March .
They decided to marry and applied for permission from the Home Office a month before her visa ran out .
Arrangements for the wedding were delayed after the authorities lost the couple ’s passport photos .
Permission was finally granted a week before the visa ran out , but the couple were unable to arrange the wedding at such short notice .
By the time they married a few weeks later , and sent forms applying for Roberts to remain in the country , she had technically overstayed her visa …
Absolutely intolerable , of course , to the tiny minds and bureaucrats of the world .
The 18 - month separation set to be imposed was described as an “ inconvenience ” in a letter from the UK Border Agency to the couple ’s local MP , Mark Williams .
Though the brittle mindset of some nanny - state bureaucrats is a frequent concern of this blog – and many others – short - sighted decisions , thoughtless acts of inhumanity , criminal unwillingness to examine and make decisions based upon reality are as disgusting as any other aspect of a dissolute British government .
They surpass the American model .
Which is really saying something .
THE NEW blasphemy law will send Ireland back to the middle ages , and is wretched , backward and uncivilised , Prof Richard Dawkins has said .
The scientist and critic of religion has lent his support to a campaign to repeal the law , introduced by Atheist Ireland , a group set up last December , arising from an online discussion forum .
The law , which makes the publication or utterance of blasphemous matter a crime punishable by a € 25,000 fine , passed through the Oireachtas last week .
In a message read out at Atheist Ireland ’s first agm on Saturday , Prof Dawkins said : “ One of the world ’s most beautiful and best - loved countries , Ireland has recently become one of the most respected as well : dynamic , go - ahead , modern , civilised – a green and pleasant silicon valley .
This preposterous blasphemy law puts all that respect at risk . ”
He said it would be too kind to call the law a ridiculous anachronism .
“ It is a wretched , backward , uncivilised regression to the middle ages .
Who was the bright spark who thought to besmirch the revered name of Ireland by proposing anything so stupid ? ”
Messages of support for the campaign were also received from the creators of Father Ted Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews , and the European Humanist Federation .
The federation , which represents 42 organisations in 19 countries , said it was “ appalled ” at the new law and it was “ a seriously retrograde step ” .
At the agm , Atheist Ireland members voted to test the new law by publishing a blasphemous statement , deliberately designed to cause offence .
The statement will be finalised in the coming days .
Atheist Ireland ’s chairman Michael Nugent said the group wanted to highlight the ridiculousness of the law .
Labour Senator and barrister Ivana Bacik told the meeting that an amendment provides for a review of the law within five years .
“ There ’s a great potential to have this very much altered if not removed altogether , ” she said .
The new law invited people to make complaints to gardaí and would result in “ a huge amount ” of wasted Garda time , she said .
“ So for lots of reasons I think it ’s going to be highly problematic . . . and it ’s bad lawmaking if nothing else . ”
Ms Bacik said the establishment of Atheist Ireland was “ long overdue ” .
More than 150 people attended the meeting in Dublin and the group ran out of membership application forms .
“ I think it ’s also good to see an organisation that has the word atheist in the title because for a long time many of us were in the closet , ” she said .
“ It ’s not fashionable or popular to declare oneself to be an atheist .
There are many people in Ireland who would like to describe themselves as atheists and I ’m one of them .
I think I may be the only self - confessed or card - carrying atheist in the Oireachtas . ”
She said there should be space for atheists , agnostics and believers in organised religions .
“ And that ’s the nature , to me , of a pluralist and tolerant and democratic republic , a country in which there is space for all of us , and in which no body ’s belief elevates them to any particular position . ”
The meeting agreed to campaign for the removal of all references to gods from the Constitution and for a secular education system .
Ms Bacik said the education system , particularly at primary level , was “ built on sectarian lines .
It is a fundamentally sectarian system in which in our equal status legislation , schools are entitled to give priority to children of a particular religion ” .
The group also publicised a website www.countmeout.ie which provides information on how to formally leave the Catholic Church .
Atheist Ireland believes that many lapsed Catholics , agnostics and atheists are counted in the church ’s membership and claims that these figures are used by the church to justify its continued involvement in education .
Atheist Ireland will also encourage people to read the Bible .
Mr Nugent said an objective reading of the Bible was one of the strongest arguments for rejecting the idea of gods as intervening creators or moral guides .
Dick Spicer of the Humanist Association of Ireland welcomed the formation of the new group and said it illustrated the changes that had taken place in Irish society .
“ It ’s a sign of how far we ’ve come in Ireland , so take hope for the future .
This society does move and it does move forward , more so , I think , than we appreciate . ”
As far as tech concepts are concerned we see most designers lure in as many specs as possible , just to make the gadget geeky enough for the ...
Thursday , 9 July 2009 — Minister of Information
I have always been passionate about politics — perhaps too passionate .
I certainly was as a young Republican , and I am certainly now as a older liberal .
This passion is often mistaken for arrogance , which is in a small way a fair charge — because I am often bewildered ( in every sense of that word ) at the beliefs of American conservatives ( and even some moderates and liberals ) , especially during the last eight years .
That being said , these days , my passion flares its ugly head whenever someone mentions George Bush , or Dick Cheney , or Donald Rumsfeld .
As soon as those names hit me , my blood boils .
Why ?
I am frustrated , as many are , that both Bush and Cheney were allowed to slink off stage on January 20th without facing criminal trials for their actions since entering office .
Both of these men are war criminals ; they both , through their personal actions and their policies , destroyed this nation and allowed the terrorists to “ win . ”
And yet neither has been hauled to the dock to face charges .
This fact enrages me .
How did the terrorists win ?
The point of terrorism is to radical alter the political and social fabric of a nation .
Who could argue that our political and social life was not radically altered by the September 11th attacks ?
Bush played right into bin Laden ’s hands .
He overreached by invading Iraq — a bizarre response to the attacks , when all of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and the UN inspectors insisted there were no WMDs in Iraq — , he damaged relations with our allies , bankrupted the nation by pouring trillions of dollars into the Iraqi morass , and caused the deaths of more than 4,000 Americans ( more than Al Qaeda ) and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
Republican fiscal policy as a whole since 1981 has been to undo the New Deal safeguards put in place during the Great Depression , which contributed to our economic collapse .
The damage done to our nation by George Bush , Cheney , and the rest of their administration is exactly what bin Laden wanted .
A great nation brought low not by terrorism , but rather by the incompetence , the arrogance , and the criminality of our own leaders .
Bush , Cheney and their supporters claim , of course , that they took necessary action to protect the nation .
But if we give up our civil liberties and support a criminal administration to achieve some illusion of security — as total security is impossible — what then are we fighting for ?
Have we not already surrendered in the face of terrorism , by abandoning our historic values ?
To quote President Dwight D. Eisenhower — an imperfect man but a far greater man than either Bush or Cheney — , who said , responding to the hysteria over the launching of the Sputnik Soviet satellite in 1957 :
“ [ W ]e must remember that we are defending a way of life , not merely property , wealth , and even our homes …
Should we have to resort to anything resembling a garrison state , then all that we are striving to defend … could disappear . ”
Bush ’s swaggering machismo is — and always was — pathetic .
Cheney ’s behind - the - scenes maneuvering undermined an already fragile American democracy .
The combination of a smarter president and a less devious vice president could have led is in a far better direction .
I am sick to my stomach that these men are not tried for their crimes .
Both committed impeachable offenses during their tenure , and so both could have been removed if the Democrats in Congress were not so cowardly .
I shall never understand why impeachment was not pursued .
Congress could have removed Cheney and then Bush .
For not pressing harder for impeachment or resignation then , and for not calling now for criminal trials , WE ARE ALL GUILTY .
I urge you to pass this post along .
I also urge you to write to President Obama and demand that the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against all those at the top of the Bush Administration .
The snail mail address is : White House , 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW , Washington , D.C. 20500 .
The contact form is : http://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/.
Here is my proposed email , in case you do n’t have time to write one yourself :
Dear Mr. President , Please order Attorney General Holder to pursue criminal charges against George W. Bush , Richard B. Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and others of the former Bush Administration .
I believe that each of these men must be made to face responsibility for their actions since September 11 , 2001 .
The world will never forgive us for allowing such criminal behavior to go unpunished , and failure to act will only contribute to the decline of our democracy and constitutional order .
No one , not even an American president , is above the law .
Yours most sincerely ,
( name )
If we are to recover from the damage of the last eight years ; if we are to return to our historic values ; if we are to close this horrid chapter of our history , these men must face trial .
If they do not , future leaders will feel free to go even further .
That is the undeniable lesson of history .
Let ’s be sure we avoid such pitfalls .

No question , the 2009 Nissan 370Z is an amazing car .
But , personally , I feel that the aesthetics make the car look a bit soft since it has to appeal to both sport cars junkies and people who like to think it ’s “ cute . ”
The 2009 NISMO 370Z takes that fluff , beats out the stuffing , gives it some jail house tats and puts a chip on its shoulder ( figuratively speaking of course ) .
The car that I had hoped the new Z would closer approach is now going to be available thanks to the gear - heads over at NISMO , Nissan ’s in - house tuning operation .
The new , second generation NISMO 370Z gets an upgraded 350 horsepower 3.7 - liter V6 engine with 276 lb- ft of torque at 5,200 rpm .
That ’s a 18 hp increase over the base model .
A new exhaust system and revised ECU help the car achieve the additional horsepower .
This engine is matched with a close - ratio 6 - speed manual transmission featuring Nissan ’s SynchroRev Match that handles the synchronization of engine revs during shifting .
This very nice feature that essentially blips the throttle can be deactivated if you want less intervention .
The NISMO 370Z gets some rigidity in the form of a strut tower brace and performance dampers .
The springs and stabilizer bars both front and rear have been made stiffer to provide better control and handling .
Some serious RAYS aluminum - alloy rims are provided ( 19×9.5 - inch front and 19 × 10.5 - inch rear ) wrapped in Yokohama ADVAN Sport tires measuring 245/40ZR19 up front and 285/35 / ZR19 in rear .
NISMO sport brakes provide serious stopping power via 14.0 inch vented rotors with 4 - piston calipers in front and 13.8 inch vented rotors with 2 - piston calipers in the rear .
Aerodynamic tweaks are aplenty with an extended front nose design featuring a canard at each corner for greater downforce in addition to a fully integrated chin spoiler .
It also benefits from side sills , a revised rear bumper and massive rear spoiler along with flared fenders .
Inside , NISMO branding is spread throughout with the most apparent logos found on the seats and center console .
Pricing is not yet available for the 2009 Nissan NISMO 370 Z but should be before it is sold ( otherwise , how could we buy it ? )

A call for schwag
Two things happened this morning which started me thinking .
First , I read Zed Shaw 's rant about how he thinks he deserves more recognition and money from his Open Source work ; and second , I looked at my pile of t- shirts , and realized that while I have 4 Google t- shirts ( one from August 2006 , when I interviewed there ; and three from Google Summer of Code ) , I do n't have a single t- shirt from any company which is using code I 've written .
Now , this is not to say that I have n't received any rewards for my work on FreeBSD .
In the summer of 2006 I spent four months working full - time on FreeBSD in exchange for almost $ 15 k in donations ; I 've received a USB - attached hard drive ; the FreeBSD Foundation paid for my flight to BSDCan '06 ; and last summer a FreeBSD user sent me a book off my Amazon wishlist .
But aside from the book , those were all about enabling me to continue working on FreeBSD , not about acknowledging work I had already done .
Perhaps the most significant benefit I 've received from people recognizing my work on FreeBSD is the indirect benefit via my tarsnap online backup service : I 've seen lots of people saying " I love Portsnap / FreeBSD Update / your work as FreeBSD Security Officer / etc , and based on that I 'm sure your backup service is worth trying out " .
Maybe it 's unreasonable to expect any more recognition than this .
After all , the FreeBSD project is big -- a few hundred committers , not to mention the thousands of people who contribute patches which other people end up committing -- and most companies wo n't have the budget to send t- shirts to hundreds of people just to say " thank you " .
On the other hand , my bsdiff binary patch tool has been used by Apple 's Software Update tool , Firefox 's software updates , and the Amazon Kindle ; I 'm sure they all have promotional schwag available , but in two of the three cases ( I 'm not going to say which ) I did n't even get so much as an email to tell me that they were going to be using my work .
One of the strongest motivations for people to get involved in Open Source software is the allure of being recognized for their work .
It 's nice to be recognized by other developers , and this happens quite often ; it 's also nice to be recognized by people using one 's work , and this also happens fairly regularly .
But being recognized by companies ?
Aside from Poul - Henning Kamp , whose " beerware " license has resulted in companies sending him beer , I 'm not aware of FreeBSD developers receiving any form of recognition from FreeBSD - using companies .
( Again , I 'm distinguishing between sending someone a gift to thank them for their work and making a contribution towards keeping the project running -- many companies have donated hardware and bandwidth to the FreeBSD project . )
So I am hereby issuing a call for schwag :
If your company uses Open Source software , and your company has promotional t- shirts , bags , hats , USB disks , et cetera , please pick one of the developers who worked on the code you 're using and send him / her an email :
To : Open Source Developer
From : Big company
Subject :
Thanks for your work on XYZ
Dear Mr. Developer ,
Thank you very much for your work on XYZ -- it 's [ insert comment here about why you like and are using XYZ ] .
Would you like a BigCo t- shirt ?
Let me know your address and what size you 'd like and we 'll send you one .
Sincerely ,
Guy who works at BigCo
Obviously , money is even better than schwag , and many developers ( myself included ) are available for consulting work ; most companies , however , ca n't afford to throw money around .
But a t- shirt is a much easier thing to give someone than a consulting contract ; and when it comes to telling someone that you recognize and appreciate the work that they 've done -- well , as they say , it 's really the thought that counts .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
I got an email today from Paizo about the impending release of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that talks about how one can make sure one gets a copy of the game when it comes out .
I ’ve already signed up for a Pathfinder RPG Ongoing Subscription , which ensures that I get all the core game products as they are published , so the SigO and I will get one core gamebook this August already .
We want two of them , though , so we ’re planning to buy a book elsewhere as well .
We took the advice in Paizo ’s email ; I called a local store called Gryphon ’s Games and Comics to ask whether the people who manage the store were ordering any Pathfinder RPG core books for this August .
As the Paizo email says , telling a local retailer before 13 July that you want the book gives them time to order it so they ’ll have it right away when the new book is released .
I get the distinct impression that Paizo ’s basically saying “ Tell your local retailers what you want in time for them to order from us so we know how many to print . ”
When I called Gryphon , the answers I got gave me the impression the people who run the store were n’t planning on ordering any copies for the store .
I was told they ’d order one to hold for me , and they would give me a call when it came in so I could go pick it up , though .
I sent an email to the mailing list I maintain for my local gaming group telling them all about this , forwarding the content of the Paizo email as well , so they can call Gryphon to reserve copies as well if they want to .
Maybe , if enough people call the store to request copies , they ’ll decide they should order a few copies to put on the shelves too .
How many is enough in a case like this — three ?
Four ?
Maybe the smart thing for them to do would be to order 1.5 times as many as people request .
That ’d be my guess .
I hope they get enough interest to decide to just start stocking Paizo / PRPG stuff in general .
Wizards of the Coast could use the competition , especially considering that many people regard D&D 4E with profound disappointment .
Anyway . . . the following is the content of the email I got from Paizo :
With the August 13 release date for the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook approaching , I ’m reaching out to ask for your help .
While there ’s a little over a month until the book is released , we ’re just a few short weeks away from shipping the books to our distributors .
Why is this important to you ?
With today ’s difficult economy , retailers and distributors have generally cut back on the amount of inventory that they are carrying .
So if you plan to buy your copy of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook from any place other than from Paizo , we ask that you inform your preferred retailer of your intention to buy from them before Monday , July 13 , and encourage them to place an order with their distributor by that date .
This will help ensure that their distributor will place an order with us , and that you ’ll have a book waiting for you on August 13 .
Nobody wants to see the distribution channel understocked on the Core Rulebook on the release date ; restocks can take as long as two weeks to make their way through the distribution channel–and even longer internationally –so a retailer who sells out might not get more copies until September !
So if you ’re planning on buying from your favorite local game store , please talk to the owner before July 13 and let him know you intend to buy your copy of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook from him .
If you ’re ordering online from a place other than paizo.com , please place your preorder by July 13 so they know how many copies to order .
If we all work together , we can get the right number of books out there so that you can get a copy of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook from the retailer of your choice .
Those of you who are planning to subscribe to the Pathfinder RPG line or preorder the book directly from paizo.com have a bit longer : you should place your order or start your subscription with us before August 3 to ensure that your book will arrive as close to the release date as possible .
( We ’re also planning to bring plenty of copies to Gen Con in Indianapolis . )
So please take the time to let the retail venue of your choice know about your desire to purchase the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook from them as soon as you can .
We also wanted to let you know that the PDF of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook will be available at paizo.com on August 13 .
We ’ve priced it at just $ 9.99 , which we hope allows those who want the book in both print and electronic form to feel that you can still support your favorite retailer and purchase the PDF without breaking your budget .
( Of course , those who subscribe to the Pathfinder RPG line will get the PDF for free with your Core Rulebook . )
Finally , we ’d like to let you know that Paizo is celebrating our 7th anniversary today , and we appreciate all the help that more than 52,000 of you provided by playtesting the Pathfinder RPG , and that even more of you have provided by supporting Paizo as a company with your purchases and friendship on our messageboards over the last seven years .
Thanks !
I really like this game , this company , and the relationship the company maintains with its customer base .
The production quality of Paizo books is amazing — even the “ cheap ” stuff is slick and fancy and feels high - quality in my hands , a welcome change from smearing - ink problems of some WotC publications and other cheap production quality from many other game publishers ( do n’t even get me started on the crappy bindings on Steve Jackson Games books ) .
The prices are n’t exactly bargain - basement , but so far , the books are worth every penny — and then some .
I want to support the company and the product lines I like ; hopefully you ’ll do the same .
If you want to see the kind of stuff you can expect from the upcoming Pathfinder RPG , you can still download the free Beta test PDF of PRPG from the Paizo Website .

Harrop : Legalizing pot would save billions of dollars Legalizing marijuana would save billions of dollars
The popular TV series Weeds is about a widowed suburban mother who deals pot to preserve her family 's cushy California dream .
Not a few Californians would like to see the theme writ large for their state .
California has legalized medical marijuana , its cannabis crop is valued at $ 17 billion a year , and people there smoke pot openly .
But the state can't collect a penny of revenues from the enormous enterprise .
As California faced budget Armageddon , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called for “ a debate ” on the potential of tapping marijuana as a source of tax revenues .
That 's all he can do , because federal law still criminalizes marijuana use .
Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has already calculated the sort of revenues California and other states could see were marijuana taxed like cigarettes and alcohol .
California 's taxes would easily top $ 100 million a year .
But that 's the least of it .
Miron puts California 's costs of enforcing the marijuana ban — policing , the courts , jail time — at $ 981 million a year .
Nationally , legalizing marijuana would save $ 7.7 billion a year on drug - war spending , according to Miron .
And it could raise $ 6.2 billion annually in tax revenues .
A vain hope rose that President Obama 's naming of Gil Kerlikowske as drug czar would lead to a more rational policy on drugs .
As Seattle 's police chief , Kerlikowske oversaw the city 's annual Hempfest ( a giant and mellow smoke - in ) without bothering the celebrants .
But Kerlikowske announced this month that “ marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit . ”
And to end any idea that the hip , liberal Obama administration would ease up on pot , he added , “ Legalization is not in the president 's vocabulary , and it 's not in mine . ”
Obama readily admits having used marijuana in his youth ( in addition to cocaine ) .
And every year , many thousands of Americans are arrested and their lives ruined for doing what he did .
Does Obama get to be president only because he was n't caught ?
Miron is a libertarian who sees all drug prohibition as interfering with people 's private lives .
But he well understands the politics that stop politicians from taking the no-brainer position on marijuana .
“ Democrats know that the potheads are going to vote for them anyway , ” he told me , “ and the people on the other side who care about this stuff know that this is really a big deal . ”
If marijuana were legalized , and the sky did n't fall in , many drug laws would crack .
In previous economic downturns , state and local governments had turned to casinos and other gambling for revenues .
These tough times may push legislators to ease their umbrage over additional “ sinful ” activities .
If they want to tax marijuana , they 'll have to legalize it .
But even the lesser step of decriminalization — whereby people may possess marijuana but not sell it — would save the billions spent going after users .
Selling the public on expanded gambling and legalized marijuana require different arguments .
Casino gambling was already permitted in Las Vegas and Atlantic City , so Americans were used to the idea when other states started allowing it .
And of course , there 's a long history of wagering at racetracks or church bingo games .
Marijuana was never part of the official culture .
Marijuana does have an advantage over gambling as a revenue source :
It does n't compete with other taxed businesses .
Casinos take entertainment dollars away from restaurants and movie theaters .
Legal marijuana would take business away from foreign drug gangs .
A bill to “ tax and regulate ” marijuana like alcohol now before the California legislature has strong support .
But it 's not going anywhere as long as “ legalization ” is not in Obama 's vocabulary .
The word “ hypocrisy ” has apparently made the cut .

Our hero and narrator , Ijon Tichy , should be a familiar name to Lem fans or anyone familiar with Lem 's Space Diaries in either English or Polish .
Tichy acts as a mechanism of sanity in many of Lem 's novels just trying to figure out what the devil is up with a messed up planet he lands on or a particular device / person .
By this manner , Lem allows himself much discovery on the reader 's behalf and by these means can relay the current state of events to the reader without jarringly interrupting the natural flow of things too much .
Through this novel 's course of Tichy 's discoveries , I was suspended from being disturbed by spoon - fed explanations most of the time , but the word play that occurred in this particular story got to be a bit much and tedious for a sub - 150 - page paperback hence a missing point in its score .
Tichy is now a member of the Futurological Association and is invited to attend the Eighth Futurological Congress in Nounas , Costa Rica .
From the get go , Lem is full of satire with the immediate lampooning of such self - appointed associations ( and maybe even academia ) by pointing out that there are two kinds of individuals in these associations : the ones that attend every single meeting / conference and those that do n't leave their offices , period .
One of the themes throughout the book is a borderline anti-American sentiment about the development of munitions and bombs .
I 'm familiar with Lem 's ability to criticize both sides of the Cold War in a single paragraph although The Futurological Congress seems to focus more heavily on American military and pharmaceutical faults .
Lem must have been well aware of kidnappings in Latin America when he wrote this book because that 's one aspect he got right about the future of that area .
Due to heavy activist presence in Costa Rica trying to capture and ransom Americans , a military attache is accompanying the U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica to speak at the congress but in the middle of his speech an unfortunate delegate from India reaches into his breast pocket to grab a handkerchief to wipe his nose .
This delegate standing next to Tichy is immediately dispensed with by the bodyguards of the ambassador and , thanks to ' humanitarian ballistics , '
Tichy only gets a spattering of blood on him instead of the bullet passing through the target and injuring more people .
Some background on Lem may help you understand this satire .
He was born a Catholic Pole with Jewish ancestry and seemed to run the gauntlet of oppression .
He survived World War II with fake papers as a mechanic / welder and due to his " bourgeois origin " could not study at the Polytechnic during Soviet occupation of Eastern Poland after the end of the war .
He became an Atheist stating , " for moral reasons ... the world appears to me to be put together in such a painful way that I prefer to believe that it was not created ... intentionally . "
Knowing this , his satire and bitter critique of all things may not surprise you .
On his way to the conference -- aside from meeting an orgy of liberated publishers -- he encounters an ' anti- papist ' who is a Catholic on his way to kill the Pope with a gun of a massive caliber .
The anti-papist 's surprising motive is none other than The Holy Bible where Abraham is ordered to kill his son Isaac by God .
Except that the anti-papist would be killing a father , the most holiest father .
And this would be a great personal sacrifice and the " utmost of martyrdom " as the anti-papist " would suffer terrible torment and his soul eternal damnation . "
Again , Lem predicts today 's world , we have no limit of people eager to misinterpret scriptures of any religion .
Back to the conference -- since there 's 168 attendees from 64 different countries , each person gets four minutes to present their paper .
And everyone is only really interested in their own work and telling everyone else about it in a bit of a narcissistic way .
This leads the first member to spend his four minutes thusly : " Stan Hazelton from the U.S. Delegation immediately threw the hall into a frenzy by emphatically repeating : 4 , 6 , 11 , and therefore 22 ; 5 , 9 hence 22 ; 3 , 7 , 2 , 11 , from which it followed that 22 and only 22 !!
Someone jumped up , saying yes but 5 , and what about 6 , 18 , or 4 for that matter ; Hazelton countered this objection with the crushing retort that , either way , 22 .
I turned to the number key in his paper and discovered that 22 meant the end of the world . "
The Futurologists in this novel are probably best described as each one being a less optimistic Ray Kurzweil in that they all seem to be spouting their own version of obstacles humanity is soon to face and consequently their ideas to remedy it .
For instance the second delegate from Japan unveils a 10,000:1 model of a housing complex some 800 stories tall with self sustaining everything and mobile in the ocean !
It 's the future !
In fact , everything is recycled !
Even the food is recycled waste and excrement from the people .
The sausage left out in the hall is actually reconstituted human waste ( at which point everyone in the audience stops eating and shuffles the food underneath their seats ) .
This sets the tone for a few of the minor themes of the novel and gives you an idea of how Lem takes subtle jabs at everyone .
For example another United States delegate takes the floor to talk about population problems that are rapidly developing .
He outlines seven solutions : " mass media and mass arrests , compulsory celibacy , full - sale deeroticization , onanization , sodomization , and for repeated offenders -- castration . "
The book makes other references to population control and one character notes that continuing trends of population would eventually result in human beings exploding outward at the speed of light .
Nature is addressed in an equally hilarious means as later in the book all animals have been extinct and replaced with what appear to be better controlled robots .
While in his room , Tichy makes the mistake of drinking the water and discovers that the water is spiked with a powerful hallucinogenic drug .
He assumes it 's the work of the revolutionaries and decides not to tell anyone but as the violence outside escalates and he mentions it to a fellow futurologist , he discovers that it is the rise of chryptochemocracy !
With the hotel 's staff , he quickly equips a gas mask as it becomes clear that chemical warfare is afoot ... of a psychedelic nature .
Planes are called in equipped with LTN bombs .
LTN stands for " Love Thy Neighbor " which is pretty indicative of today 's munitions and their goals with surgical strikes .
Hilariously enough , the very hotel in which the congress is convening is immediately bombed by mistake .
After pages of chemical warfare that affect the crowd 's temperament and counter chemicals that affect the crowd 's temperament , Tichy and a friend find oxygen tanks and masks and descend to the sewers where the hotel staff is relaxing comfortably with their own oxygen tanks and masks .
Unfortunately , Tichy and his companion do not have enough oxygen to last the night and therefore must take shifts suffering hallucinations .
What follows from this point is a series of hallucinations that Tichy has ending in him coming to in the sewer .
Tichy has several of these bizarre hallucinations ending in him being shot by revolutionaries in the sewer .
He comes to certain that he is still hallucinating and refuses to believe anyone he is not .
As a result , they freeze him until they can find a cure for his mental illness and he is unthawed many years later in a reality where ' psychemicals ' keep everyone happy .
This overmedicated society disgusts and frightens Tichy at times .
It has gotten so bad that a company now exists where you can order a psychem that allows you the satisfaction of doing evil upon another person .
Murder 's no longer a problem , you just get reanimated .
The worst possible offense is using psychems on an individual without their consent .
Tichy attempts to adapt and I could n't help but be reminded of Fry in Futurama with similar humor employed nearly thirty years before it .
As Tichy reconnects with his futurologist friend ( people stopped dying as technology caught up a la Kurzweil ) , he discovers something unsettling about the drugs everyone is taking .
He discovers that there 's mascons that act as blockers to your senses and replace it with a superficial reality .
And we start to understand why everything is so mysteriously idyllic while at the same times animals have been extinct for many years and the planet is at an overburdening 26 billion people .
Tichy 's friend hands him two vials that will unblock the layers of mascons .
You see , the ' architects ' of this current psychem reality have patched and repatched side effects of psychems and mascons with more psychems and mascons in the air and water supply !
I 'll leave The Matrix - like vials and harsh transition from utopia to dystopia for people interested in reading the book .
This book was a joy to read and although the very end is a bit dissatisfying to me , the satire and pessimism inherent to Lem 's writings have influenced me and continue to influence me heavily .
I like to think that Lem borrowed from sci-fi writers like Philip K. Dick and that other science fiction authors like Douglas Adams have borrowed from Lem despite the language barrier and difference in culture .
While Lem may not be the icon that Lovecraft , Clarke and Asimov have become , I certainly hope that people recognize his large corpus of works for more than just Solaris as I 've enjoyed many novels by him .
Lem offers a rare dark comedy in science fiction with The Futurological Congress .
You can pick up the English version of The Futurological Congress at Amazon .
And catch the Ari Folman movie where the present day will be live action while the unfathomable future will be animated to adapt to the stark impossibilities the book portrays .

Some of the new exciting features of HTML5 are the audio and video tag .
This could potentially , in the long term , replace flash on the video level .
I wanted to use the audio tag in one of my experiemental project , there is little information about how to manipulate the audio tag , and tought it would be great to have a starter guide .
One thing clear is this is still an early implementation , which also means it is a bit buggy .
I had a strange bug where if I had a song playing and had javascript throw errors at the same time ( not related together ) , I could not terminate the song .
Closing the tab would not stop it , I had to restart Firefox .
Which lead me to think that the process is still not completely linked only to the tab ( in Firefox at least ) .
I used jquery in my demo because the application I developing is wrapped around it , but this is not necessary .
View demo
( Only consisting of 5 buttons )
What I learned
The API is somewhat easy to work with , as it should be , play ( ) , pause ( ) , want to stop the volume ?
audioElement.volume=0 .
Want to start playing at 55 seconds ?
audioElement.currentTime = 55 . Pretty cool stuff .
The default html audio player controls are added automatically with a simple : controls = ” true ” , it has good and bad sides .
You do n’t have to worry about it , but at the same time , for now , you cannot modify the player style .
Also when you right click you have a nice contextual menu where you can save the file in ff3.5 .
A normal audio tag
Your browser does not support the audio tag .
Add and play a sound via JavaScript
var audioElement = document.createElement(' audio ' ) ; audioElement.setAttribute( 'src' , ' loading.ogg ' ) ; audioElement.play ( ) ;
Get the song filepath and duration
audioElement.src ; audioElement.duration ;
Load a sound
var audioElement = document.createElement(' audio ' ) ; audioElement.setAttribute('src ' , ' Mogwai2009-04-29_acidjack_t16.ogg ' ) ; audioElement.load( ) audioElement.addEventListener( " load " , function ( ) { audioElement.play ( ) ; $ ( " .duration span " ).html(audioElement.duration ) ; $ ( " .filename span " ).html(audioElement.src ) ; } , true ) ;
Stop a song
audioElement.pause ( ) ;
Change volume
audioElement.volume=0 ;
Play at exactly 35 seconds in the song
audioElement.currentTime=35 ; audioElement.play ( ) ;
The bad parts
No stop ( ) , only pause ( ) , I really do not know what stopped them to put stop ( ) in the API .
No way to get the songs name .
The only accessible format are ogg and wav , no mp3 love .
It also means that you will have to convert all your sounds in ogg .
As I said this is a bit buggy but understandable , the specs are not even finished .
Microsoft will probably implement the audio and video tag in 2022 .
The good parts
The API is easy to use , you can have a song playing in no time .
You do not need to parse the audio object in the HTML body , you can have it played directly in your script .
In the end , I ’m really happy on how this turned out .

Illustration by David Simonds
IN DECEMBER 1997 large numbers of cattle , goats and sheep began dying in the Garissa district of north - eastern Kenya .
A month later people started dying , too .
It was , at the time , the biggest recorded outbreak of Rift Valley fever in east Africa .
Some 100,000 stock animals succumbed and about 90,000 people were infected — hundreds fatally — in five countries .
In December 2007 the same thing happened .
Or , rather , it started to happen but was stopped in its tracks .
The difference was that the second time around there was warning .
In September researchers at the Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt , Maryland , part of America 's space agency , NASA , told the authorities in Kenya that they had a problem .
They told them again in October .
And again in November .
By the time the epidemic emerged , the Kenyan health ministry had dispatched teams to the area to distribute mosquito nets and urge village leaders and religious authorities to stop people slaughtering and eating animals .
Though the outbreak still killed 300 people in Kenya , Somalia and Tanzania , it could have been a lot worse .
According to Kenneth Linthicum of America 's Department of Agriculture , the number of deaths would probably have been more than twice as high without the warning .
The warning itself was possible because of a model of how disease spreads that Dr Linthicum helped design .
And the data that were plugged into that model came from satellites .
What the researchers at Goddard had noticed at the time of the first outbreak was that in the months preceding it , surface temperatures in the equatorial part of the Indian Ocean had risen by half a degree .
These higher temperatures brought heavy and sustained rains , cloud cover and warmer air to much of the Horn of Africa .
Mosquitoes multiplied wildly — and lived long enough for the virus that causes the fever to develop to the point where it is easily transmissible .
In September 2007 the researchers saw the same thing happening in the ocean , and suspected the same consequences would follow .
Vein hopes
Attempts to foresee epidemics such as these have traditionally relied on fieldwork on the ground .
This is often slow and expensive .
Crunching data from satellites is much less costly .
Satellites transmit copious information on temperatures , precipitation , vegetation cover and even the health , moisture content and chlorophyll - production of plants .
As David Rogers , an expert in ecology and disease at Oxford University , observes , this is an enormously useful combination of variables .
His research has linked levels of photosynthesis , detected from satellites , to the size of a vein in the wings of west African tsetse flies .
This vein - measurement indicates the health and size of fly populations — and suggests the likelihood of epidemics of sleeping sickness , a tsetse - borne parasitic disease that kills tens of thousands of Africans a year .
That means satellite data can be used to predict epidemics without having to collect any flies on the ground .
Jacques - André Ndione , a researcher at the Centre de Suivi Ecologique , a government public - health agency in Dakar , Senegal , is also impressed by the power of satellite monitoring .
He cites one study which showed that in west Africa malaria tends to spread faster in suburban neighbourhoods than in cities and slums .
The reason , revealed by satellite , is that the suburbs have more backyard ponds and puddles .
Indeed , satellites can not only count such small bodies of water , they can measure their longevity , salinity and mud content — and thus how mosquito - friendly they are .
And it is not only Africa that is benefiting .
Satellite research indicates a “ significant risk ” that dengue fever , malaria and Rift Valley fever will enter Europe , according to Renaud Lancelot , the head of the EDEN project , a group of laboratories and public - health agencies in 24 European and African countries .
Indeed , chikungunya , a mosquito - borne virus endemic to tropical Africa and Asia , has already arrived in Albania and Italy .
A harbinger of things to come , perhaps ?
11 . Have you ever played whack - a- mole , except the moles were shrieking baboons and the hammer was a giant rubber dildo ?
Yes
No
No , but that sounds like the greatest sport in the history of athleticism final question !

A dispute has erupted between Burger King and one of its franchisees over global warming .
The franchisee , Mirabile Investment Corporation had placed the placed the political statement global warming is baloney on a dozen of their signs across Tennessee .
Corporate BK ordered the statement taken down , and the franchisee has refused .
According to The Guardian , Mirabile Investment Corporation ( MIC ) owns more than 40 Burger Kings across Tennessee , Mississippi , and Arkansas .
The controversy erupted when a Memphis newspaper reporter discovered the signs then contacted corporate Burger King for comment .
BK headquarters originally knew nothing about the signs , but upon verifying their existence , ordered them removed .
However the marketing president of MIC , John McNeils , refused to take the signs down , “ I would think [ Burger King ] would run from any form of controversy kinda like cockroaches when the lights get turned on .
I ’m not aware of any direction that they gave the franchisee and I do n’t think they have the authority to do it . ”
Advertisements
McNeils said that he had the right to display the signs , “ The [ restaurant ] management team can put the message up there if they want to .
It is private property and here in the US we do have some rights .
Notwithstanding a franchise agreement , I could load a Brinks vehicle with [ rights ]
I ’ve got so many of them .
By the time the Burger King lawyers work out how to make that stick we ’d be in the year 2020 .
Burger King can bluster all they want about what they can tell the franchisee to do , but we have free - speech rights in this country so I do n’t think there ’s any concerns . ”
Meanwhile corporate Burger King is trying to distance itself from a potential PR disaster .
BK ’s director of corporate communications said ,
The statement that was posted on several restaurants ’ reader boards in the Memphis area , and the view expressed by the franchisee on this issue does not reflect Burger King Corp ’s opinion … BKC has guidelines for signage used by franchisees [ which ] were not followed .
We have asked the franchisee to remove the signage and have been told that the franchisee will comply . ”
It is a pretty safe bet that there is a clause in the franchise agreement that prohibits these kinds of political statements .
If there was n’t a standard clause , then these types of statements would pop up all of the time .
I am going to take a wild guess here that MIC is keeping the signs up , while telling corporate that they will take them down .
It is likely that MIC signed away their free speech right when they signed the franchise agreement .
It wo n’t take until 2020 to figure this one .
If it ends up in court , a judge will be able to rule based on the agreement .
If the signs are n’t removed , corporate could strip the franchisee of the franchise , which is what would probably land this dispute in court .
It is not good business for any industry that is dependent on the personal tastes of customers to engage in partisan politics .
The last thing Burger King wants is to be known as the home of the global warming deniers .
If there is any ambiguity in the franchise agreement , it could set up an interesting legal challenge .
If franchisees would be allowed to display political statements , I wonder how many would .
Personally , the last thing I would want is to be subjected to a political statement while grabbing a meal .
I have enough politics in my life , and I would like to think that I can go somewhere and eat in peace .

Researchers have reconstructed atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over the past 2.1 million years in the sharpest detail yet , shedding new light on its role in the earth 's cycles of cooling and warming .
The study , in the June 19 issue of the journal Science , is the latest to rule out a drop in CO 2 as the cause for earth 's ice ages growing longer and more intense some 850,000 years ago .
But it also confirms many researchers ' suspicion that higher carbon dioxide levels coincided with warmer intervals during the study period .
The authors show that peak CO 2 levels over the last 2.1 million years averaged only 280 parts per million ; but today , CO 2 is at 385 parts per million , or 38 % higher .
This finding means that researchers will need to look back further in time for an analog to modern day climate change .
In the study , Bärbel Hönisch , a geochemist at Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , and her colleagues reconstructed CO 2 levels by analyzing the shells of single - celled plankton buried under the Atlantic Ocean , off the coast of Africa .
By dating the shells and measuring their ratio of boron isotopes , they were able to estimate how much CO 2 was in the air when the plankton were alive .
This method allowed them to see further back than the precision records preserved in cores of polar ice , which go back only 800,000 years .
The planet has undergone cyclic ice ages for millions of years , but about 850,000 years ago , the cycles of ice grew longer and more intense — a shift that some scientists have attributed to falling CO 2 levels .
But the study found that CO 2 was flat during this transition and unlikely to have triggered the change .
" Previous studies indicated that CO 2 did not change much over the past 20 million years , but the resolution was n't high enough to be definitive , " said Hönisch .
" This study tells us that CO2 was not the main trigger , though our data continues to suggest that greenhouse gases and global climate are intimately linked . "
The timing of the ice ages is believed to be controlled mainly by the earth 's orbit and tilt , which determines how much sunlight falls on each hemisphere .
Two million years ago , the earth underwent an ice age every 41,000 years .
But some time around 850,000 years ago , the cycle grew to 100,000 years , and ice sheets reached greater extents than they had in several million years — a change too great to be explained by orbital variation alone .
A global drawdown in CO 2 is just one theory proposed for the transition .
A second theory suggests that advancing glaciers in North America stripped away soil in Canada , causing thicker , longer lasting ice to build up on the remaining bedrock .
A third theory challenges how the cycles are counted , and questions whether a transition happened at all .
The low carbon dioxide levels outlined by the study through the last 2.1 million years make modern day levels , caused by industrialization , seem even more anomalous , says Richard Alley , a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University , who was not involved in the research .
" We know from looking at much older climate records that large and rapid increase in CO 2 in the past , ( about 55 million years ago ) caused large extinction in bottom - dwelling ocean creatures , and dissolved a lot of shells as the ocean became acidic , " he said .
" We 're heading in that direction now . "
The idea to approximate past carbon dioxide levels using boron , an element released by erupting volcanoes and used in household soap , was pioneered over the last decade by the paper 's coauthor Gary Hemming , a researcher at Lamont - Doherty and Queens College .
The study 's other authors are Jerry McManus , also at Lamont ; David Archer at the University of Chicago ; and Mark Siddall , at the University of Bristol , UK .

Cooper kicked a low ball into the net .
The Americans held on to earn their third straight trip to the finals , and sixth overall .
Health minister says chemical used in textile dyeing factories discovered in drug
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
At least 25 children in Bangladesh have died after taking a paracetamol syrup believed to be tainted with a toxic chemical , according to authorities .
The syrup became toxic after manufacturers replaced one of its ingredients with a cheaper alternative , the Bangladesh health ministry said .
Experts found traces of a toxic chemical in a paracetamol syrup produced by a local drug firm that is suspected to have killed at least 25 children in the past few weeks .
The health minister , AFM Ruhul Haque , said experts had conducted two tests on the syrup and had found diethyl glycol , a chemical normally used in textile and leather dyeing factories , on each occasion .
" The drug - maker added the toxic industrial chemical because it is 10 times cheaper than propylene glycol , which is used as a solvent in paracetamol syrup , " he said .
The children who died were aged between one and five , and lived in Brahmanbaria , an eastern district where authorities have already ordered the pharmaceutical company to shut down operations .
Company officials were not immediately available for comment .
Two men were condemned to death and a company boss sentenced to life imprisonment six months ago for their roles in the production and sale of poisoned milk that killed at least six children and made almost 300,000 sick in China .
More than 50,000 children were sent to hospital with kidney problems after drinking Sanlu baby formula contaminated with melamine , a chemical normally used to make fertiliser and plastics .

Admin actions ¶
The basic workflow of Django ’s admin is , in a nutshell , “ select an object , then change it . ”
This works well for a majority of use cases .
However , if you need to make the same change to many objects at once , this workflow can be quite tedious .
In these cases , Django ’s admin lets you write and register “ actions ” – functions that get called with a list of objects selected on the change list page .
If you look at any change list in the admin , you ’ll see this feature in action ; Django ships with a “ delete selected objects ” action available to all models .
For example , here ’s the user module from Django ’s built - in django.contrib.auth app :
Warning
The “ delete selected objects ” action uses QuerySet.delete ( ) for efficiency reasons , which has an important caveat : your model ’s delete ( ) method will not be called .
If you wish to override this behavior , you can override ModelAdmin.delete_queryset ( ) or write a custom action which does deletion in your preferred manner – for example , by calling Model.delete ( ) for each of the selected items .
For more background on bulk deletion , see the documentation on object deletion .
Read on to find out how to add your own actions to this list .
Writing actions ¶
The easiest way to explain actions is by example , so let ’s dive in .
A common use case for admin actions is the bulk updating of a model .
Imagine a news application with an Article model : from django.db import models STATUS_CHOICES = [ ( ' d ' , ' Draft ' ) , ( ' p ' , ' Published ' ) , ( 'w ' , ' Withdrawn ' ) , ] class Article ( models .
Model ) : title = models .
CharField ( max_length = 100 ) body = models .
Text Field ( ) status = models .
CharField ( max_length = 1 , choices = STATUS_CHOICES ) def __str__ ( self ) : return self .
title A common task we might perform with a model like this is to update an article ’s status from “ draft ” to “ published ” .
We could easily do this in the admin one article at a time , but if we wanted to bulk - publish a group of articles , it ’d be tedious .
So , let ’s write an action that lets us change an article ’s status to “ published . ”
Writing action functions ¶
First , we ’ll need to write a function that gets called when the action is triggered from the admin .
Action functions are regular functions that take three arguments :
The current ModelAdmin
An HttpRequest representing the current request ,
representing the current request , A QuerySet containing the set of objects selected by the user .
Our publish - these - articles function wo n’t need the ModelAdmin or the request object , but we will use the queryset : def make_published ( modeladmin , request , queryset ) : queryset .
update ( status = ' p ' )
Note
For the best performance , we ’re using the queryset ’s update method .
Other types of actions might need to deal with each object individually ; in these cases we ’d iterate over the queryset : for obj in queryset : do_something_with ( obj )
That ’s actually all there is to writing an action !
However , we ’ll take one more optional - but - useful step and give the action a “ nice ” title in the admin .
By default , this action would appear in the action list as “ Make published ” – the function name , with underscores replaced by spaces .
That ’s fine , but we can provide a better , more human - friendly name by giving the make_published function a short_description attribute : def make_published ( modeladmin , request , queryset ) : queryset .
update ( status = ' p ' ) make_published .
short_description =
" Mark selected stories as published " Note
This might look familiar ; the admin ’s list_display option uses the same technique to provide human - readable descriptions for callback functions registered there , too .
Adding actions to the ModelAdmin ¶
Next , we ’ll need to inform our ModelAdmin of the action .
This works just like any other configuration option .
So , the complete admin.py with the action and its registration would look like : from django .
contrib import admin from myapp.models import Article def make_published ( modeladmin , request , queryset ) : queryset .
update ( status = ' p ' ) make_published .
short_description = " Mark selected stories as published " class ArticleAdmin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : list_display = [ ' title ' , ' status ' ] ordering = [ ' title ' ] actions = [ make_published ] admin .
site .
register ( Article , ArticleAdmin )
That code will give us an admin change list that looks something like this :
That ’s really all there is to it !
If you ’re itching to write your own actions , you now know enough to get started .
The rest of this document covers more advanced techniques .
Handling errors in actions ¶
If there are foreseeable error conditions that may occur while running your action , you should gracefully inform the user of the problem .
This means handling exceptions and using django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.message_user ( ) to display a user friendly description of the problem in the response .
Even the most securely coded piece of software can be susceptible to malicious hacking and significant exploits the moment it 's linked with less - secure applications or platforms .
These multiproduct , multirole exploits ( also known as " chained exploits " ) are among the most difficult security issues to prevent .
In fact , though issues may be known , they can be just as challenging to avert .
Two recent security events -- one involving net / tun and a Linux compiler and the second involving Gmail , Hotmail , and Twitter -- illustrate the challenges that chained exploits create .
As I wrote last week in regard to the forthcoming Google Chrome OS , most -- if not all -- software must interact with other products and features if it 's going to deliver the functionality that users demand .
The trade - off can be weakened security .

The Linux kernel vulnerability emerged in the open source net / tun program .
In this case , the bug was not written in to the net / tun program .
Rather , when the program 's source code is run through a Linux compiler for optimization , the complier introduces a kernel exploit .
In particular , the compiler finds what it thinks is an unnecessary NULL value and removes an important IF - THEN statement .
The subsequent exploits work even against improved security versions of Linux , such as SeLinux ( see a video of a representative exploit ) .
The second example of a chained exploit is even more intriguing .
In this case , a malicious hacker broke in to one or more Twitter employees ' e-mail accounts , then publicly posted both personal and company confidential information .
The hacker accomplished this feat after discovering that a Twitter employee used Gmail and that a request for a new password for the account would be sent to the employee 's Hotmail account .
However , the employee had not used the Hotmail account in a very long time , so their Hotmail address was available for anyone to adopt .
The hacker registered for the Hotmail address and had Gmail send a password reset for the Twitter employee 's Gmail account to what was now the hacker 's Hotmail account .
With the new password , the hacker gained access to the Twitter employee 's Gmail account .
Using information found in the employee 's e-mail , the hacker was able to acquire personal information about the employee and data to exploit Twitter 's own network .
TechCrunch has an excellent step - by - step account of the hack .
These actions took a lot of ( successful ) guessing and the reliance on default human behavior .
All in all , this is one of the most interesting hacks I 've read about in a long time .
It makes the Sarah Palin e-mail account hack seem like child 's play ( which it was ) .
These two scenarios reveal the difficulty of planning for and combating chained exploits .
In the case of net / tun , the developers of the program might need to rewrite the code such that the compiler does n't remove the important IF - THEN statement .
For sure , the developers of the compiler need to rewrite their code , lest it create security bugs in a future application .
The second exploit type generated a lot of discussion among my friends and co-workers .
Specifically , we focused on how to prevent an old , now long - ignored e-mail account from being exploited by hackers .
Simply preventing e-mail name reuse is n't an efficient application of available resources .
One bright friend thought of using an automated mechanism to help the first e-mail host ( Gmail ) to communicate with the second ( Hotmail , in the example ) to determine how long it has been since the second account was used .
If the time period exceeded the first host 's expected terms of service , the host would not send a password reset notification to the older e-mail address .
The brainstorm of solutions went on and on , and each seemingly perfect answer was found to be riddled with exploit vectors .
It ultimately came down to the ongoing problem of transitive trust .
One weak link in the chain means the whole chain is broken .
Further complicating the problem is that any possible solution would likely solve only one interaction between two hosts .
Sure , one vendor fixes the problem , but what about the other ?
Or all the popular e-mail hosts , for that matter ?
To solve the larger issue , all e-mail and password - resetting hosts would have to agree on a course of actions -- and that is unlikely to happen .
Further , once that problem is fixed , hackers will just jump to the next weak link .
Longtime readers know that the only solution I like is where the entire Internet is fixed .
Outside of that , we 're just playing whack - a- mole with point solutions that are never going to work .
Because that type of Internet protection does n't exist , users must be ultimately responsible for closing any potential holes opened by old e-mail accounts .
For one , do n't reuse passwords between e-mail accounts and Web sites .
Second , when you 're finished with an e-mail account , delete all the messages ( sent and received ) , though be sure to archive and copy what you need to keep .
If you 're an administrator , maybe it 's time to share with end - users the risks of not properly cleaning up old e-mail accounts .
These examples of computer security interconnectedness show the difficulty of the task before us .
It 's not impossible , but there are no easy solutions .
You have to be responsible and responsive , even when it is n't your company or vendor 's sole fault .

ISRAEL is a country with plenty of sunshine , lots of sand and quite a few clever physicists and chemists .
Put these together — having first extracted the oxygen from the sand , to leave pure silicon — and you have the ingredients for an innovative solar - power industry .
Shining sunlight onto silicon is the most direct way of turning it into electricity ( the light knocks electrons free from the silicon atoms ) , but it is also the most expensive .
The scientists are what you need to make the process cheaper .
And that is what two small companies based in Jerusalem are trying , in different ways , to do .
The physicists and chemists at GreenSun Energy , led by Renata Reisfeld , think the way is to use less silicon .
Traditional solar cells are made of thin sheets of the element covered by glass plates .
In GreenSun 's cells , though , only the outer edges of the glass plates are covered by silicon , in the form of thin strips .
The trick is to get the light falling on the glass to diffuse sideways to the edges , so that the silicon can turn it into electricity .
Dr Reisfeld 's team do this by coating the glass with a combination of dyes and sprinkling it with nanoparticles of a metal whose nature they are not yet willing to disclose .
Depth of field
The dyes are there to absorb the incident sunlight ( a mixture is used in order to capture all parts of the spectrum ) .
The role of the metal , though , is more subtle .
The dyes in question are fluorescent — having absorbed the light , they re-radiate it .
Normally , that would mean it was lost .
But interaction with the nanoparticles turns it into a form of electromagnetic radiation called surface plasmons .
These , as their name suggests , propagate over the surface of the glass until they are intercepted by the silicon at its edges .
Not only does all this make GreenSun 's cells cheaper than conventional ones , because they use so much less silicon ; it also makes them better .
In a conventional solar cell much of the energy is lost .
The energy of light varies across the spectrum ( blue light is more energetic than red ) but only a certain amount of energy is needed to knock an electron free .
If the incident light is more energetic than necessary , the surplus disappears as heat .
Unlike the sun , which scatters its energy across the board , the dye / nanoparticle mix delivers plasmons of the right energy to knock electrons free without waste .
According to Amnon Leikovich , the firm 's boss , the upshot is a device that could already , if put into production , deliver electricity at only twice the cost of the stuff that comes out of a conventional power station .
That may not sound great , but the power from traditional cells is about five times as costly as grid electricity , so GreenSun 's system sounds like a winner for places that are not yet connected .
Moreover , Mr Leikovich hopes that costs can be brought down , and efficiency improved , to achieve the alternative - energy nirvana of “ grid parity ” .
He is not the only one , though .
Around the corner , Jonathan Goldstein of 3GSolar hopes to get rid of silicon altogether .
3 G's “ dye - sensitised ” solar cells use titanium dioxide ( more familiar as a pigment used in white paints ) and complicated dye molecules that contain a metal called ruthenium .
When one of the dye molecules is hit by light of sufficient energy , an electron is knocked out of it and absorbed by the titanium dioxide , before being passed out of the cell to do useful work .
This is a well - known process ( it was invented 20 years ago by Michael Grätzel , a physicist at the Federal Polytechnic School in Lausanne , Switzerland ) and several firms are trying to commercialise it .
Dr Goldstein , however , thinks 3G has an edge over its rivals because of the way it draws off the power — though he is reluctant to go into details .
One thing that is clear , though , is that dye - sensitised cells will be cheap to make .
Both silicon cells and a third technology , so - called thin - film cells ( which use novel materials such as cadmium telluride deposited onto sheets of glass or steel ) , have to be made in a vacuum .
That is expensive .
Dye - sensitised cells can be made by a process similar to screen printing , which is cheap .
Dye - sensitised cells are not as efficient as silicon ones , but their cheapness may outweigh that in many applications .
As Barry Breen , 3 G 's boss , points out , more than a billion and a half people have no access to grid electricity .
With people like Dr Reisfeld and Dr Goldstein around , soon that may not matter .

Advertisements proselytizing toothpaste and jeans do not make us question our beliefs .
But a series of posters on city buses promoting atheism is intended to do just that .
An Atheist Bus Campaign has arrived in New York .
The ads , which say “ You do n’t have to believe in God to be a moral and ethical person , ” underscored by the URL for the New York City Atheists Inc .
Web site , will appear on about 20 city buses .
Ken Bronstein , the president of New York City Atheists , a New York affiliate of American Atheists , planned the commercials .
He said the posters will only run on Manhattan bus lines , and some members of his organization had already noticed them .
The ads will remain on buses for about a month and will be officially introduced at a news conference on Saturday at Columbus Circle in front of the Time Warner Center at 1 p.m .
“ This was a test campaign , ” Mr. Bronstein said , adding that he hoped to expand the commercials to the other boroughs in two to three months .
The New York commercials were inspired by the first Atheist Bus Campaign in London last January .
They were put on 800 buses in response to a campaign by a Christian group whose relatively innocuous messages contained a URL for a Web site that warned that nonbelievers would “ spend all eternity in torment . ”
The New York messages are not in response to any such statements , but merely intended to build on what creators believe was the success of the London campaign .
Mr. Bronstein said it was something of a challenge to draft a message that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York deemed acceptable .
“ I had to be very careful in what they would accept , ” Mr. Bronstein said .
It took time “ to find a statement that we thought was positive , it was n’t bashing religion and it was n’t huge . ”
Joseph Zwilling , the director of communications for the Archdiocese of New York , said the ads were not offensive in the Catholic Church ’s view , given their wording .
“ It ’s a free country , and they ’re allowed to say whatever they want on the side of buses , ” Mr. Zwilling said .
“ They ’re not attacking or disparaging the Church as far as I can see . ”
Mr. Zwilling said the archdiocese occasionally runs ads in the transit system , usually on the subway .
He said the ads “ were designed more to invite Catholics back to the practice of their faith . ”
The advertisements cost more than $ 10,000 and were paid for by an anonymous donor .
Jane Everhart , the director of communications for New York City Atheists , said that one goal of the campaign was to increase membership .
Mr. Bronstein said he was more focused on establishing “ atheist pride ” and promoting acceptance of atheism .
“ I ’ve had people call me in tears , and tell me they thought they ’d never see a sign promoting atheism in New York , ” he said .
Mr. Bronstein said he thought American society was opening up to atheism because of a series of events he referred to as an “ atheism awakening , ” like the publication of best - sellers on atheism by writers like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens .
But the moment he was certain atheism was acceptable was when he heard President Obama ’s inaugural address , which included a reference to “ nonbelievers ” among an enumeration of various religions .
Ms. Everhart thought it was about time .
“ People who are religious have been advertising for generations , ” she said .
“ But atheists never have .
We have not come out , and this is part of our coming out . ”
TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - A man who tore the wig off a telegenic Taiwan legislator last year was sentenced to five months in jail for depriving the MP of his freedom to look good , a court spokesman said Tuesday .
The Taipei District Court sentenced Huang Yung - tien , 50 , to jail for snatching the toupee off the head of ruling Nationalist Party lawmaker Chiu Yi. Chiu has become a household name for his media - friendly offensives against the political opposition .
“ The judge thought Chiu Yi had the freedom to wear what he wanted , and Chiu felt the wig made him look prettier , ” court spokesman Huang Chin-ming said .
“ The judge thinks that to remove it intentionally was to take away that right . ”
Chiu lost his wig , revealing a mostly bald head , when he went to file a complaint against former president Chen Shui-bian in December .
Huang , the leader of pro-Chen group , called the sentence excessive , local media said .
“ I was n’t careful , ” he was quoted saying .
“ Carelessness is so severe ? ”

If you walk along St Martin 's Le Grand in the City of London you will come to Postman 's Park , which seems out of place in this busy commercial area .
Inside the park was once the old Roman burial ground of St Botolph 's churchyard .
If the gate is open you may go in , where you will find some gravestones stacked by the side .
They were moved during the rebuilding of the area after heavy bombing during the Second World War .
George Watts was one of Victorian society 's most popular and successful artists .
His fame increased in 1864 when he married the popular actress Ellen Terry - though this marriage lasted less than a year .
His work , in general , had a high tone of morality , from his works in the Tate and Victoria and Albert Museum , and his ' Physical Energy ' sculpture in Kensington Gardens .
In 1900 he was prompted to take over a wall in Postman 's Park near to St Paul's , and then had it filled with delicate tiles honouring ' heroic deeds of self - sacrifice . '
He died in 1904 with thirteen tiles going up in his lifetime .
His widow kept adding to them until they ceased with no .
54 .
There is also a wooden statue of Watts .
If you click on the seat below you will see enlarged photos of all the seats , and will be able to read most of them .

Stacked up graves in Postman 's park Another hidden corner of London is the street by the name of Cloth Fair , which runs by the side of West Smithfield .
It has these two buildings that have survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 .
The houses at numbers 41 and 42 were built between 1597 and 1614 , and were preserved from the Great Fire because they were enclosed by the wall of the priory of St Bartholomew .
St Bartholomew 's gatehouse that leads to the oldest parish church in London - St Bartholomew - the - Great - was built in the sixteenth century and is where Queen Mary ate chicken and drank red wine while watching Protestant martyrs burn at the stake .
The actual spot where they suffered ( found in 1849 ) was in the roadway , a little left of the front of the gateway , It was only when a first World War German Zeppelin bomb fell nearby in 1916 that the tiles to this arch fell off to reveal this Elizabethan half - timber - fronted house built in 1597 .

The Brixton Windmill was built in 1817 and leased to Mr John Ashby .
John , his sons and grandson were millers producing stone - ground wholemeal flour .
The Ashby family operated the mill , which became known as  Ashby 's Mill for the whole of its working life .
By 1862 the surrounding area had become too built up for the windmill to operate efficiently , so the building was used for storage .
In 1962 , the windmill was acquired by the London County Council .
The mill is now owned by Lambeth Borough Council and forms the centrepiece of Windmill Gardens .
With nearby Brixton Prison and the very busy Brixton shopping centre , this windmill remains a hidden gem of South London .
Side by side they stand and more than a century apart are these two milestones .
One was erected in the reign of the Prince Regent , later George IV , and placed in Regent 's Park - before the architect , Nash , laid it out as a Royal Palace for the Regent , who decided to open it out as a Royal Park .
The other was erected in the reign of Queen Victoria .
Regent 's Park ( including Primrose Hill ) covers 487 acres .
Ask any visitor to London what is the biggest clock in London and you will most likely get the answer Big Ben .
Big Ben - the official name being St Stephen 's Tower - is the most famous of the London clocks .
However , the biggest clock face belongs to Shell Mex house in The Strand , once the London head office of the Shell petroleum company , opened in 1933 , with a tower rising to over 200 ft and containing the largest clock in London .
They stand on opposite corners of the west window of St Andrew 's Church , St Andrew 's Hill .
These figures are to be found in various parts of London , on the walls of school buildings .
This would mean that this church once had a school for girls and boys .
The boy holds a Bible in his right hand and a cap in his left .
The girl has a Bible in her right hand and what appears to be a shopping bag in the other .
She stands looking at the new Sainsbury 's head office at Holborn Circus , which has an express shop inside .
She has a look of surprise in her eyes as though she has forgotten to buy something that she needed .
William III was in a financial crisis in 1696 due to the wars with Ireland and on the continent .
One new idea that was brought in to help pay for the debt was the unpopular window tax .
The tax was payable on houses of more than six windows , so the clever tax - dodgers simply got hold of a builder to brick up the other windows .
Houses with nine windows would pay 2 /- ( 10 p ) and for ten to nineteen windows the cost was 4 /- ( 20 p ) .
In 1851 the window tax was scrapped and a new tax called house duty , a forerunner of the community charge , became payable .
The old tramway that passed under the centre of the road in the Kingsway was built in 1906 .
It was a two - way tunnel that took trams down to the Victoria Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge , where they could go either left to Blackfriars or right to Westminster .
The last tram entered the tunnel on 5th of April 1952 .
Part of the tunnel was opened to cars in 1964 from Waterloo Bridge , becoming known as the Strand Underpass , though it ends quite short of the old entrance .
It has had various uses such as films and storage and still has the tracks left from those bygone days .
Magpie Alley that cuts between Bouverie Street and Whitefriars Street has a hidden treasure , for beneath the railings of a new office development , down in the basement is this 700 - year - old crypt displayed in a glass case .
This is the only remains of the Whitefriars Monastery that has lain hidden for hundreds of years beneath a house , where the vault was used as a coal cellar .
This medieval crypt offered sanctuary in the Middle Ages for thieves , murderers , and prostitutes as the lawmen of those times were afraid to enter this monastic crypt .
The Oxo Tower is now a top class London restaurant with superb views across the River Thames of the city of London .
Built on an earlier twentieth - century electric power station and rebuilt in 1920 with its art nouveau design by the Oxo meat and gravy consortium owned by the Liebig meat company .
Unable at the time to have outside advertising on such a high tower , the company used the clever window design in the Oxo letters , which was allowed , whereby the red background light illuminates the Oxo sign at night to the London skyline as our picture insert shows .
The Jewel Tower was built in 1365 - 6 to house jewels and treasures of gold and silver belonging to King Edward III and is the only surviving building of the ancient private palace of Westminster .
It is surrounded by an attractive moat that is fed by the Tyburn during heavy rainfall .
It was the southernmost end of the palace , hence its L - shape .
Other than a treasury , it has also been the storeroom for House of Lords documents and was used by the Weights and Measures department .
It is now open to the public as a museum .
Outside the Athenaeum Club in Waterloo
Place is this strange pair of kerbstones that have stood here for over 170 years with people passing by without a thought .
They were placed in this position to allow the Duke of Wellington to both mount and dismount his horse while visiting the Athenaeum club .
The Dublin - born Iron Duke defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in June 1815 .
One of the most beautiful gas lampposts to remain in use in London is this one in Carting Lane off Savoy Hill .
It is one of the last surviving gas lamps to be using gas from effluent in the subterranean sewers .
On the corner of Queen Victoria Street and Huggin Hill is a small open space that is popular with city office workers on a warm sunny day .
Here they can relax with their sandwiches and chill out during their lunch break .
The reason for this quiet garden retreat ?
A large Roman bathhouse once stood here , fed by a natural spring .
Much of this bathing complex still remains hidden in the basement of the buildings opposite .
In the meantime , we can still glimpse part of the Roman wall at the bottom of the gardens .
This fine shop doorway complete with area railings has all the elegant beauty of eighteenth - century architecture including a window box displaying summer flowers .
As interesting as this corner shop may be , I am drawn to the old sign above the Barbon Close W.C.1 plate which informs us that G Bailey and Sons , Horse and Motor Contractor , were once operating in the rear mews .
The wonderful thing about London is that this old sign remains because nobody has considered removing it even though the days of horse - drawn vehicles are long gone .
This wonderful piece of Southbank history had remained hidden until a warehouse building was destroyed in a World War Two raid , revealing itself while the warehouse bricks were being removed .
The rose window was part of the lavish fourteenth - century Great Hall that served the Bishops of Winchester as the central feature of their London Palace .
Southwark in those days was full of brothels known as stews .
There were the famous theatres , the Rose and the Globe , and bull - baiting just a stone 's throw away .
The bishops decided to build a prison that became known as The Clink just to the west of the palace .
The last bishop to reside here was Lancelot Andrewes , who died in 1626 .
In 1642 Cromwell used it to house Royalist prisoners and eventually sold it off to a Camberwell property speculator who broke up the palace leaving it a ruin by 1662 .
If the wall had not been used to support the inner sanctums of a warehouse wall this unique Elizabethan gem would not have survived .
Jacob the Circle Dray Horse .
The famous Courage dray horses were stabled on this site from the early nineteenth century .
They delivered beer around London from the brewery on Horselydown Lane by Tower Bridge .
In the sixteenth century , the area became known as Horselydown , which derives from ' horse - lie - down ' , a description of working horses resting before crossing London Bridge into the City of London .
In 1811 Daniel Alexander built a warehouse to store tobacco , wines and spirits .
The warehouse still survives although it had a facelift in the mid-eighties when some £ 30 million were spent to convert the building into a modern shopping mall .
It proved to be a disaster and the area now remains one of the quietest spots in this vicinity .
At the rear of the warehouse are a couple of replica ships .
The one in our picture is the Three Sisters , the original of which was built a couple of miles away at Blackwall Yard in 1788 .
It sailed to the East and West Indies with British home - made goods and returned with tobacco and rum .
Relics of the old warehouse wall with a few barrels of rum balancing on top .
The view of the mysterious bath through the window .
At the top of Strand Lane is a house with an old window that reveals what is purported to be a Roman bath .
It was certainly here in the seventeenth century , that much we do know , though the preceding years remain a bit of a mystery .
It is surrounded by some typical Roman tiles so it could well come from those distant times .
However , this theory has been dismissed several times by archaeologists .
The view through the cloudy window and a well worn frame of the mysterious bath .
We do know that the bath was once replenished from a small stream said to be Holy Water that came from St Clement 's well that passes underneath St Clement Danes church in The Strand .
What we also know is that the bath was found on the site of Arundel House later to become Norfolk House , home to the Dukes of Norfolk .
During the reign of Charles II , Norfolk House was demolished , at which time the underground bath was first exposed .
It is thought to have been a covered over water - storage reservoir from its older Arundel House times .
The stream that once flowed down Strand Lane was much wider than the lane of today , and the water would run along its path into the Thames .
The Ferryman 's Seat Bear Gardens , Bankside .
The Ferrymans seat along at Bankside near to where Shakespeares Globe now stands , has seen rather a lot of comings and goings .
Long ago , when there was only London Bridge to cross the river , there were many ferrymen waiting to take people from one side to the other .
It would have been among the many stews , the old name for brothels , that were lined along this side of the river on the South Bank , as well as actors and troubadours that performed at the Rose and the Globe theatres , with the large crowds that also came from the nearby bear - baiting ring .
Now it is set into the side of a modern building in exactly the same spot where the ferrymen rested all those years ago .
The curious stone circle of Mohegan Chief , Mahomet Weyononon remembered at last .
In 1736 Mahomet Weyonomon , a Mohegan Sachem ( chief ) , died in Aldermanbury in the City of London .
He was 36 years old .
Foreigners could not be buried in the City , so he was carried across the river and buried near St Saviours church , now Southwark Cathedral .
Mahomet had sailed to London to petition King George II for the return of stolen lands taken by early English settlers .
His tribe had helped the first English settlers in New England to survive the bitter cold and repel Indian attacks .
Despite support from Queen Annes Commissioners in 1705 , the lands were not returned .
While waiting for an audience with King George II , Captain John Mason and Mahomet contracted smallpox and died .
Two hundred and seventy years later a stone was brought from Mohegan lands and carved with forms that reflect ancient tribal customs .
The stone was unveiled on 22 November 2006 by the Queen , accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh , with tribal chairman Bruce  Two Dogs Bozsum , who presented the queen with a red stone peace pipe , and with the U.S. Ambassador - symbolically granting the audience Mahomet never received .
" Mahomet has his stone now  and his place in history ,  said Bozsum .
The original street bollards were adapted from the French cannons captured at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .
They were placed on street corners to stop the iron wagon wheels of carts mounting the kerbs and doing damage .
They proved so popular that they adorned many of the London streets and , once the real cannons were all used up , copies were made and are still to be seen on the streets of London today .
They continue to be made today in the same familiar shape , although todays replacements are now of the plastic variety .
The one pictured above , however , is an original French cannon which stands on the Southbank near to Shakespeares Globe .
This metal lighthouse tower is more than fifty miles from the nearest coast and opposite Kings Cross Station .
It has puzzled the passing populations for many years , with nobody knowing why it was erected in the first place .
Some will tell of the helter - skelter fairground ride that is said to have been here in early Victorian times .
Others claim that the shop below was once an oyster restaurant and that the lighthouse was added for effect .
I have even heard it said that an old seafaring sailor , pensioned out of the navy , had this eccentric loft conversion built to remind him of his beloved voyages .
Now a listed building and in a state of disrepair , with the entire building recently undergoing renovation With the Channel Tunnel mainline rail station across the road , and with its direct line to Paris , you would think it could be returned to an oyster bar once again .
North Kensington can boast the only remaining 19th - century tile kiln in London .
Originally known as the Piggeries and Potteries where high - quality clay was dug from about 1818 , and then fired in this very kiln that still stands in Walmer Road .
Once known as Cut - throat Lane , Pottery Lane nowadays has properties selling from anything upwards of £ 500,000 .
When Samuel Lake , whose rough trade of scavenging and chimney - sweeping compelled him in the early years of the nineteenth century to remove himself from premises in Tottenham Court Road , and set up a business in a more solitary spot here at Nottingdale , where gravel and sand were discovered under the grass , and soon his brickworks was making bricks for the wealthy owners of houses being built in North Kensington .
The pig- keepers of Tyburnia , present - day Marble Arch and Bayswater Road , soon made use of this district .
Meanwhile , some sixteen acres of adjoining land to the west were being dug for the brick earth by Stephen Bird , one of the principal brick makers in London , who was also a builder active in Kensington .
With the arrival of the potters , several of the principal ingredients were soon put together .
Many of the workforce employed were Irish labourers who could also turn their hands to bricklaying and building work , and so from this little acorn , North Kensington grew .
On the corner of a building almost opposite the Old Curiosity Shop is another amazing curiosity that goes unnoticed by most city dwellers .
It is an old metal sign claiming that orders are taken for the dispatch of newspapers , books and magazines to all parts of the world .
For this building was from 1929 to 1976 the headquarters of Messrs W. H. Smith & Son and the shrapnel - damaged sign that is still attached to the wall is now all that remains to remind us of the business that stood here on the night of the German air raid on 10 October 1940 .
The swastika fixed to the wall of the Indian High Commission , India House , in Aldwych .
The motif was cast long before the Nazi Party took over German politics during the 1930s , leading to Hitlers rise to power with the Third Reich .
The swastika was used as a religious symbol thousands of years ago and still commands reverence in several regions of Asia .
It has been found drawn on caves dating from the Neolithic times , where it was said to be a symbol of good luck .
It is only good luck which kept this sign on this building throughout the war years and beyond when it was once deemed a fascist icon and protesters called for its removal .
It now blends in well with the rest of the motifs along this wall that go largely unnoticed .
Not long after the Great Fire of London in 1666 , it was deemed important to differentiate between houses covered by insurance and those that were not , in order for firemen to battle the fire of insured properties first .
In 1697 it is recorded that the Hand - In - Hand Society ordered their treasurer to " pay for two hundredweight of lead eighteen shillings and for ye making of markes for ye Society " .
Men who went around with ladders to fix them on buildings often charged the clients a fee for their prompt services , otherwise , if a fire ensued , and there was no metal mark found , then insurance would not be paid , and properties were not insured until the metal mark was affixed to the outside wall .
In the days when addresses were given as vague directions like " on the south side of the road at Moulsey aforesaid between the Church and the Sign of the Swan " , although the house in question was quite a distance from the church , so some form of identification was truly needed to establish the correct insured property .
The fixing of plates on insured property gradually died out during the nineteenth century , although one or two companies still continued to do so almost to the turn of the century .
Albert Bridge , nicknamed " The Trembling Lady " because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it , has signs on both sides of the river entrances which warned troops to break step whilst crossing the bridge .
Built as a toll bridge , it was commercially unsuccessful .
Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were removed .
The tollbooths still remain in place and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London .
Despite the many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation , the Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence , other than for brief spells during repairs .
It is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced .
Like so many of Londons ancient monuments that get overlooked without any signage to reveal as to its former use , is this ancient ruin of the Manor House of King Edward III ( 1527-79 ) .
Situated just off Bermondsey Wall East , and opposite the famous Angel public house , this once moated manor house was built in 1353 .
Standing alongside the banks of the river Thames , with the excavated foundations clearly visible ; only now being constantly overlooked by a row of townhouses .
The 1706 Sundial that tells the wrong time .
On the south wall of St Katherine Cree in Leadenhall Street , is a curious triangular arrangement of brass rods which on close inspection proves to be a sundial , with the motto ' Non- Sine Lumine ' .
This was put up in 1706 , but over the years this narrow thoroughfare has been overshadowed by some high buildings opposite .
It is therefore only at certain times of day that the dial is able to function correctly .
Site of the Royal Cockpit
Built during the 18th century , the Royal Cockpit stood alongside Birdcage Walk .
Cock - fighting was first established in Tudor times and was a popular way to make money , as betting was heavy and the sport well regulated .
The cocks would have to be of the same height and weight , and with their wings and tail trimmed .
Public opinion turned against the sport during the 19th century with an Act of Parliament banning cruelty to animals in 1849 , thus making cock - fighting illegal .
The Royal Cockpit itself , however , was demolished in 1816 , although not completely , and these narrow stone steps at Queen Annes gate which once led into it still remain .
Coal Hole
Once a regular feature in every street , cast iron coal hole hatches , set into the pavement , were used for unloading coal from the cart directly to the coal cellar , thus avoiding the dusty coal sacks being carried through the house .
The design of the coal hatch would vary from house to house and street to street .
Their style would generally reflect the household income .
The hatches are locked from the inside to prevent them being lifted from the street .
They were in use from the early 1800s to the mid-1900s , when the burning of coal was made illegal by the Clean Air Act .
The coal hole hatch in our picture , by the way , is from an expensive street in Pimlico .

If you walk along St Martin 's Le Grand in the City of London you will come to Postman 's Park , which seems out of place in this busy commercial area .
Inside the park was once the old Roman burial ground of St Botolph 's churchyard .
If the gate is open you may go in , where you will find some gravestones stacked by the side .
They were moved during the rebuilding of the area after heavy bombing during the Second World War .
George Watts was one of Victorian society 's most popular and successful artists .
His fame increased in 1864 when he married the popular actress Ellen Terry - though this marriage lasted less than a year .
His work , in general , had a high tone of morality , from his works in the Tate and Victoria and Albert Museum , and his ' Physical Energy ' sculpture in Kensington Gardens .
In 1900 he was prompted to take over a wall in Postman 's Park near to St Paul's , and then had it filled with delicate tiles honouring ' heroic deeds of self - sacrifice . '
He died in 1904 with thirteen tiles going up in his lifetime .
His widow kept adding to them until they ceased with no .
54 .
There is also a wooden statue of Watts .
If you click on the seat below you will see enlarged photos of all the seats , and will be able to read most of them .
Another hidden corner of London is the street by the name of Cloth Fair , which runs by the side of West Smithfield .
It has these two buildings that have survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 .
The houses at numbers 41 and 42 were built between 1597 and 1614 , and were preserved from the Great Fire because they were enclosed by the wall of the priory of St Bartholomew .
St Bartholomew 's gatehouse that leads to the oldest parish church in London - St Bartholomew - the - Great - was built in the sixteenth century and is where Queen Mary ate chicken and drank red wine while watching Protestant martyrs burn at the stake .
The actual spot where they suffered ( found in 1849 ) was in the roadway , a little left of the front of the gateway , It was only when a first World War German Zeppelin bomb fell nearby in 1916 that the tiles to this arch fell off to reveal this Elizabethan half - timber - fronted house built in 1597 .
The Brixton Windmill was built in 1817 and leased to Mr John Ashby .
John , his sons and grandson were millers producing stone - ground wholemeal flour .
The Ashby family operated the mill , which became known as  Ashby 's Mill for the whole of its working life .
By 1862 the surrounding area had become too built up for the windmill to operate efficiently , so the building was used for storage .
In 1962 , the windmill was acquired by the London County Council .
The mill is now owned by Lambeth Borough Council and forms the centrepiece of Windmill Gardens .
With nearby Brixton Prison and the very busy Brixton shopping centre , this windmill remains a hidden gem of South London .
Side by side they stand and more than a century apart are these two milestones .
One was erected in the reign of the Prince Regent , later George IV , and placed in Regent 's Park - before the architect , Nash , laid it out as a Royal Palace for the Regent , who decided to open it out as a Royal Park .
The other was erected in the reign of Queen Victoria .
Regent 's Park ( including Primrose Hill ) covers 487 acres .
Ask any visitor to London what is the biggest clock in London and you will most likely get the answer Big Ben .
Big Ben - the official name being St Stephen 's Tower - is the most famous of the London clocks .
However , the biggest clock face belongs to Shell Mex house in The Strand , once the London head office of the Shell petroleum company , opened in 1933 , with a tower rising to over 200 ft and containing the largest clock in London .
They stand on opposite corners of the west window of St Andrew 's Church , St Andrew 's Hill .
These figures are to be found in various parts of London , on the walls of school buildings .
This would mean that this church once had a school for girls and boys .
The boy holds a Bible in his right hand and a cap in his left .
The girl has a Bible in her right hand and what appears to be a shopping bag in the other .
She stands looking at the new Sainsbury 's head office at Holborn Circus , which has an express shop inside .
She has a look of surprise in her eyes as though she has forgotten to buy something that she needed .
William III was in a financial crisis in 1696 due to the wars with Ireland and on the continent .
One new idea that was brought in to help pay for the debt was the unpopular window tax .
The tax was payable on houses of more than six windows , so the clever tax - dodgers simply got hold of a builder to brick up the other windows .
Houses with nine windows would pay 2 /- ( 10 p ) and for ten to nineteen windows the cost was 4 /- ( 20 p ) .
In 1851 the window tax was scrapped and a new tax called house duty , a forerunner of the community charge , became payable .
The old tramway that passed under the centre of the road in the Kingsway was built in 1906 .
It was a two - way tunnel that took trams down to the Victoria Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge , where they could go either left to Blackfriars or right to Westminster .
The last tram entered the tunnel on 5th of April 1952 .
Part of the tunnel was opened to cars in 1964 from Waterloo Bridge , becoming known as the Strand Underpass , though it ends quite short of the old entrance .
It has had various uses such as films and storage and still has the tracks left from those bygone days .
Magpie Alley that cuts between Bouverie Street and Whitefriars Street has a hidden treasure , for beneath the railings of a new office development , down in the basement is this 700 - year - old crypt displayed in a glass case .
This is the only remains of the Whitefriars Monastery that has lain hidden for hundreds of years beneath a house , where the vault was used as a coal cellar .
This medieval crypt offered sanctuary in the Middle Ages for thieves , murderers , and prostitutes as the lawmen of those times were afraid to enter this monastic crypt .
The Oxo Tower is now a top class London restaurant with superb views across the River Thames of the city of London .
Built on an earlier twentieth - century electric power station and rebuilt in 1920 with its art nouveau design by the Oxo meat and gravy consortium owned by the Liebig meat company .
Unable at the time to have outside advertising on such a high tower , the company used the clever window design in the Oxo letters , which was allowed , whereby the red background light illuminates the Oxo sign at night to the London skyline as our picture insert shows .
The Jewel Tower was built in 1365 - 6 to house jewels and treasures of gold and silver belonging to King Edward III and is the only surviving building of the ancient private palace of Westminster .
It is surrounded by an attractive moat that is fed by the Tyburn during heavy rainfall .
It was the southernmost end of the palace , hence its L - shape .
Other than a treasury , it has also been the storeroom for House of Lords documents and was used by the Weights and Measures department .
It is now open to the public as a museum .
Outside the Athenaeum Club in Waterloo Place is this strange pair of kerbstones that have stood here for over 170 years with people passing by without a thought .
They were placed in this position to allow the Duke of Wellington to both mount and dismount his horse while visiting the Athenaeum club .
The Dublin - born Iron Duke defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in June 1815 .
One of the most beautiful gas lampposts to remain in use in London is this one in Carting Lane off Savoy Hill .
It is one of the last surviving gas lamps to be using gas from effluent in the subterranean sewers .
On the corner of Queen Victoria Street and Huggin Hill is a small open space that is popular with city office workers on a warm sunny day .
Here they can relax with their sandwiches and chill out during their lunch break .
The reason for this quiet garden retreat ?
A large Roman bathhouse once stood here , fed by a natural spring .
Much of this bathing complex still remains hidden in the basement of the buildings opposite .
In the meantime , we can still glimpse part of the Roman wall at the bottom of the gardens .
This fine shop doorway complete with area railings has all the elegant beauty of eighteenth - century architecture including a window box displaying summer flowers .
As interesting as this corner shop may be , I am drawn to the old sign above the Barbon Close W.C.1 plate which informs us that G Bailey and Sons , Horse and Motor Contractor , were once operating in the rear mews .
The wonderful thing about London is that this old sign remains because nobody has considered removing it even though the days of horse - drawn vehicles are long gone .
This wonderful piece of Southbank history had remained hidden until a warehouse building was destroyed in a World War Two raid , revealing itself while the warehouse bricks were being removed .
The rose window was part of the lavish fourteenth - century Great Hall that served the Bishops of Winchester as the central feature of their London Palace .
Southwark in those days was full of brothels known as stews .
There were the famous theatres , the Rose and the Globe , and bull - baiting just a stone 's throw away .
The bishops decided to build a prison that became known as The Clink just to the west of the palace .
The last bishop to reside here was Lancelot Andrewes , who died in 1626 .
In 1642 Cromwell used it to house Royalist prisoners and eventually sold it off to a Camberwell property speculator who broke up the palace leaving it a ruin by 1662 .
If the wall had not been used to support the inner sanctums of a warehouse wall this unique Elizabethan gem would not have survived .
The famous Courage dray horses were stabled on this site from the early nineteenth century .
They delivered beer around London from the brewery on Horselydown Lane by Tower Bridge .
In the sixteenth century , the area became known as Horselydown , which derives from ' horse - lie - down ' , a description of working horses resting before crossing London Bridge into the City of London .
In 1811 Daniel Alexander built a warehouse to store tobacco , wines and spirits .
The warehouse still survives although it had a facelift in the mid-eighties when some £ 30 million were spent to convert the building into a modern shopping mall .
It proved to be a disaster and the area now remains one of the quietest spots in this vicinity .
At the rear of the warehouse are a couple of replica ships .
The one in our picture is the Three Sisters , the original of which was built a couple of miles away at Blackwall Yard in 1788 .
It sailed to the East and West Indies with British home - made goods and returned with tobacco and rum .
At the top of Strand Lane is a house with an old window that reveals what is purported to be a Roman bath .
It was certainly here in the seventeenth century , that much we do know , though the preceding years remain a bit of a mystery .
It is surrounded by some typical Roman tiles so it could well come from those distant times .
However , this theory has been dismissed several times by archaeologists .
The view through the cloudy window and a well worn frame of the mysterious bath .
We do know that the bath was once replenished from a small stream said to be Holy Water that came from St Clement 's well that passes underneath St Clement Danes church in The Strand .
What we also know is that the bath was found on the site of Arundel House later to become Norfolk House , home to the Dukes of Norfolk .
During the reign of Charles II , Norfolk House was demolished , at which time the underground bath was first exposed .
It is thought to have been a covered over water - storage reservoir from its older Arundel House times .
The stream that once flowed down Strand Lane was much wider than the lane of today , and the water would run along its path into the Thames .
The Ferrymans seat along at Bankside near to where Shakespeares Globe now stands , has seen rather a lot of comings and goings .
Long ago , when there was only London Bridge to cross the river , there were many ferrymen waiting to take people from one side to the other .
It would have been among the many stews , the old name for brothels , that were lined along this side of the river on the South Bank , as well as actors and troubadours that performed at the Rose and the Globe theatres , with the large crowds that also came from the nearby bear - baiting ring .
Now it is set into the side of a modern building in exactly the same spot where the ferrymen rested all those years ago .
In 1736 Mahomet Weyonomon , a Mohegan Sachem ( chief ) , died in Aldermanbury in the City of London .
He was 36 years old .
Foreigners could not be buried in the City , so he was carried across the river and buried near St Saviours church , now Southwark Cathedral .
Mahomet had sailed to London to petition King George II for the return of stolen lands taken by early English settlers .
His tribe had helped the first English settlers in New England to survive the bitter cold and repel Indian attacks .
Despite support from Queen Annes Commissioners in 1705 , the lands were not returned .
While waiting for an audience with King George II , Captain John Mason and Mahomet contracted smallpox and died .
Two hundred and seventy years later a stone was brought from Mohegan lands and carved with forms that reflect ancient tribal customs .
The stone was unveiled on 22 November 2006 by the Queen , accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh , with tribal chairman Bruce  Two Dogs Bozsum , who presented the queen with a red stone peace pipe , and with the U.S. Ambassador - symbolically granting the audience Mahomet never received .
" Mahomet has his stone now  and his place in history ,  said Bozsum .
The original street bollards were adapted from the French cannons captured at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .
They were placed on street corners to stop the iron wagon wheels of carts mounting the kerbs and doing damage .
They proved so popular that they adorned many of the London streets and , once the real cannons were all used up , copies were made and are still to be seen on the streets of London today .
They continue to be made today in the same familiar shape , although todays replacements are now of the plastic variety .
The one pictured above , however , is an original French cannon which stands on the Southbank near to Shakespeares Globe .
This metal lighthouse tower is more than fifty miles from the nearest coast and opposite Kings Cross Station .
It has puzzled the passing populations for many years , with nobody knowing why it was erected in the first place .
Some will tell of the helter - skelter fairground ride that is said to have been here in early Victorian times .
Others claim that the shop below was once an oyster restaurant and that the lighthouse was added for effect .
I have even heard it said that an old seafaring sailor , pensioned out of the navy , had this eccentric loft conversion built to remind him of his beloved voyages .
Now a listed building and in a state of disrepair , with the entire building recently undergoing renovation With the Channel Tunnel mainline rail station across the road , and with its direct line to Paris , you would think it could be returned to an oyster bar once again .
North Kensington can boast the only remaining 19th - century tile kiln in London .
Originally known as the Piggeries and Potteries where high - quality clay was dug from about 1818 , and then fired in this very kiln that still stands in Walmer Road .
Once known as Cut - throat Lane , Pottery Lane nowadays has properties selling from anything upwards of £ 500,000 .
When Samuel Lake , whose rough trade of scavenging and chimney - sweeping compelled him in the early years of the nineteenth century to remove himself from premises in Tottenham Court Road , and set up a business in a more solitary spot here at Nottingdale , where gravel and sand were discovered under the grass , and soon his brickworks was making bricks for the wealthy owners of houses being built in North Kensington .
The pig- keepers of Tyburnia , present - day Marble Arch and Bayswater Road , soon made use of this district .
Meanwhile , some sixteen acres of adjoining land to the west were being dug for the brick earth by Stephen Bird , one of the principal brick makers in London , who was also a builder active in Kensington .
With the arrival of the potters , several of the principal ingredients were soon put together .
Many of the workforce employed were Irish labourers who could also turn their hands to bricklaying and building work , and so from this little acorn , North Kensington grew .
On the corner of a building almost opposite the Old Curiosity Shop is another amazing curiosity that goes unnoticed by most city dwellers .
It is an old metal sign claiming that orders are taken for the dispatch of newspapers , books and magazines to all parts of the world .
For this building was from 1929 to 1976 the headquarters of Messrs W. H. Smith & Son and the shrapnel - damaged sign that is still attached to the wall is now all that remains to remind us of the business that stood here on the night of the German air raid on 10 October 1940 .
The swastika fixed to the wall of the Indian High Commission , India House , in Aldwych .
The motif was cast long before the Nazi Party took over German politics during the 1930s , leading to Hitlers rise to power with the Third Reich .
The swastika was used as a religious symbol thousands of years ago and still commands reverence in several regions of Asia .
It has been found drawn on caves dating from the Neolithic times , where it was said to be a symbol of good luck .
It is only good luck which kept this sign on this building throughout the war years and beyond when it was once deemed a fascist icon and protesters called for its removal .
It now blends in well with the rest of the motifs along this wall that go largely unnoticed .
Not long after the Great Fire of London in 1666 , it was deemed important to differentiate between houses covered by insurance and those that were not , in order for firemen to battle the fire of insured properties first .
In 1697 it is recorded that the Hand - In - Hand Society ordered their treasurer to " pay for two hundredweight of lead eighteen shillings and for ye making of markes for ye Society " .
Men who went around with ladders to fix them on buildings often charged the clients a fee for their prompt services , otherwise , if a fire ensued , and there was no metal mark found , then insurance would not be paid , and properties were not insured until the metal mark was affixed to the outside wall .
In the days when addresses were given as vague directions like " on the south side of the road at Moulsey aforesaid between the Church and the Sign of the Swan " , although the house in question was quite a distance from the church , so some form of identification was truly needed to establish the correct insured property .
The fixing of plates on insured property gradually died out during the nineteenth century , although one or two companies still continued to do so almost to the turn of the century .
Albert Bridge , nicknamed " The Trembling Lady " because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it , has signs on both sides of the river entrances which warned troops to break step whilst crossing the bridge .
Built as a toll bridge , it was commercially unsuccessful .
Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were removed .
The tollbooths still remain in place and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London .
Despite the many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation , the Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence , other than for brief spells during repairs .
It is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced .
Like so many of Londons ancient monuments that get overlooked without any signage to reveal as to its former use , is this ancient ruin of the Manor House of King Edward III ( 1527-79 ) .
Situated just off Bermondsey Wall East , and opposite the famous Angel public house , this once moated manor house was built in 1353 .
Standing alongside the banks of the river Thames , with the excavated foundations clearly visible ; only now being constantly overlooked by a row of townhouses .
On the south wall of St Katherine Cree in Leadenhall Street , is a curious triangular arrangement of brass rods which on close inspection proves to be a sundial , with the motto ' Non- Sine Lumine ' .
This was put up in 1706 , but over the years this narrow thoroughfare has been overshadowed by some high buildings opposite .
It is therefore only at certain times of day that the dial is able to function correctly .
Built during the 18th century , the Royal Cockpit stood alongside Birdcage Walk .
Cock - fighting was first established in Tudor times and was a popular way to make money , as betting was heavy and the sport well regulated .
The cocks would have to be of the same height and weight , and with their wings and tail trimmed .
Public opinion turned against the sport during the 19th century with an Act of Parliament banning cruelty to animals in 1849 , thus making cock - fighting illegal .
The Royal Cockpit itself , however , was demolished in 1816 , although not completely , and these narrow stone steps at Queen Annes gate which once led into it still remain .
Once a regular feature in every street , cast iron coal hole hatches , set into the pavement , were used for unloading coal from the cart directly to the coal cellar , thus avoiding the dusty coal sacks being carried through the house .
The design of the coal hatch would vary from house to house and street to street .
Their style would generally reflect the household income .
The hatches are locked from the inside to prevent them being lifted from the street .
They were in use from the early 1800s to the mid-1900s , when the burning of coal was made illegal by the Clean Air Act .
The coal hole hatch in our picture , by the way , is from an expensive street in Pimlico .
Loudon's Parents ' Grave , in the graveyard of Pinner Parish Church , Middlesex .
In this remote churchyard in Pinner stands one of Loudon 's lesser - known achievements - this most unusual gravestone which he designed for his father in 1809 , with his mother also buried here in 1841 .
With the stone crib being projected some 50 ft towards heaven , it is a most unusual sight and well worth a visit .
John Claudius Loudon ( 17831843 ) .
Scottish - born agriculturist , encyclopaedist , landscape - gardener , horticulturist , editor of journals , the expert on cemeteries , architect and influential critic .
Loudon settled in London in 1803 .
Within only a year after his arrival , his first book ' Observations on the Formation and Management of Useful and Ornamental Plantations , on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening ' was published .
Over the coming years , he became renowned for his landscape gardening and architectural work .
In 1811 he invented an iron glazing - bar that made curved glazing possible and erected various prototype hot - houses incorporating his structural and other practical ideas .
This Loudon invention made possible the more famous works by Paxton at Chatsworth and then again with Londons Great Exhibition of 1851 - and of course the magnificent Crystal Palace .
Gibson Squares Temple
The Milner - Gibson family owned property in Theberton in Suffolk after making their fortune from plantations in Trinidad .
Major Thomas Gibson died in 1807 , leaving his one - year - old son , also Thomas , born in Trinidad , to develop their Islington estate when he was old enough .
By the time Thomas had reached thirty , the building work had already started with Gibson and Milner Squares on his Islington fields .
Thomas Milner - Gibson the younger ( 1806 - 84 ) was also M.P. at various times for Ipswich , Manchester and Ashton - under - Lyne , becoming an active anti-Corn law campaigner and President of the Board of Trade .
The plans for Gibson Square were made by Francis Edwards showing the usual layout of central gardens surrounded by railings with locked gates , open to resident key holders only .
By the 1930s the Square had become rather run down and the gardens up - keep was taken over by Islington Council .
During World War
II the gardens were dug up and air - raid shelters were installed .
Afterwards , it was restored and maintained to its conventional design .
London Transport in 1963 was busy building the Victoria Line and needed a ventilation shaft in an open space .
As the underground line runs beneath Gibson Square , it was considered a safe bet as the land belonged to the council , and it was thought an easy place to build without any neighbours opposing it .
The proposal was to build a fifty - foot ventilating tower of a functional pleasant design .
London Transport engineers were in for a big surprise from the now affluent owner - occupiers , who formed a society to fight this development tooth and nail for several years .
It was eventually decided to create a low - rise structure of a simulated temple with Pantheon overtones , designed by Raymond Erith and Quinlan Terry .
Now with the passage of time , the mellowing brick - work has given this air - vent Georgian authenticity .
Crossing over London Bridge from the City of London , where the entrance to London Bridge Railway Station meets with the busy Borough High Street junction , there is a clock with weeds growing high above this derelict corner of London .
If you observe the top of the clock just above the XII ( 12 ) , you will notice the head complete with horns of what looks like a deer .
During the Second World War , a large number of civilian metal stretchers were stored ready for a large number of casualties .
After the war , there was a problem with how to get rid of this huge amount of ironware .
The problem was solved with the need to build more blocks of flats to house the homeless who had been bombed out .
The stretchers were used as railings surrounding new estates like this one in Bermondsey .
St George the Martyr " Little Dorrits " church , giving Bermondsey a black look St George the Martyr ,  Little Dorrits church , giving Bermondsey a black look The first church of St. George , Southwark , was probably built at the beginning of the 12th century .
The present church was authorised by Act of Parliament for the Building of Fifty New Churches .
John Price designed the new church , with the foundation stone laid on St. George 's Day , 1734 .
The main part of the structure was completed by 1735 .
The grant from the Commissioners proved inadequate to cover the cost of furnishing the church and in 1735 a rate of one shilling in the pound was levied to set up the old organ , provide a clock , font , etc .
The church was opened in 1736 when numbered pew seats were allotted to 404 parishioners and their families .
The clock with four dials in the steeple was made by George Clarke of Whitechapel for £ 90 in 1738 .
The clock is unusual in that one of its four faces is never illuminated and painted black .
This came about because it faced the parish of Bermondsey , and when the church was asking for the one shilling donations from surrounding parishes , Bermondsey never gave a penny .
Dog And Pot
On the corner of Union Street and Blackfriars Road , just opposite Transport for London offices at Palestra , you might have noticed an effigy of a dog licking inside a pot .
The replica is a distinctive shop sign known to Charles Dickens and it was erected as part of the celebrations for the writer 's bicentenary in 2012 .
The original ' dog and pot ' sign belonged to an ironmonger 's , J. W. Cunningham & Co of 196 Blackfriars Road , and was mounted on a bracket that projected from the corner of the premises from the 18th century until 1931 .
Rowland Hill
House now occupies the site of the shop , opposite Palestra .
Dickens passed it regularly in the 1820s as he walked home from his work in a blacking factory at Charing Cross to his lodging in Lant Street .
The ' dog and pot ' image was also depicted on coal plates that were made in Union Street .
The sign is referred to by Dickens in a letter he wrote to his friend and biographer John Forster in 1847 which features in the book  The Life of Charles Dickens .
He wrote : " My usual way home was over Blackfriars Bridge and down that turning in the Blackfriars Road which has Rowland Hill 's Chapel on one side and the likeness of a golden dog licking a golden pot over a shop door on the other . "
The sculpture is based on the original sign ( the original brass and wood sign was sold in 1931 and is now on display in Southwark 's Cuming Museum ) carved in wood and stands on a bracket which is mounted on a tall reclaimed Victorian lamppost .
An inscription incised in stone on the ground in front of the post stands in a circular area defined by Victorian - style railings , with the gardens of Nelson Square behind .
I wonder if the bird perched on the dog's back knows what the dickens its doing there !
I must admit it looks so much better than the CCTV camera mounted almost opposite !
Police Hook
The police hook in Great Newport Street is difficult to find , but if you persevere with your search , on the north side near the junction of Upper St Martins Lane , you will eventually locate it .
The policeman 's hook or cloak hanger dates back to the horse and carriage times and days of the early motor traffic , when police were called for point duty at busy junctions .
We all know how quickly the weather changes so a cloak to shield from the rain was essential if you needed to stand around for ages .
If the cloak was n't needed , but hands were to direct the traffic , then a place to hang the garment was essential .
In those long gone days there would have been plenty of busy cross roads with policemen's hooks , but due to this hard to see cloak hanger , thankfully it has been overlooked .
Bow Street Police Station The Bow Street Police Station and Magistrates Court , home of the original Bow Street Runners , has a unique feature that no other London police station has .
When blue lamps outside Bow Sreet police stations were first introduced in 1861 , Queen Victoria was not too amused .
She objected to seeing the blue lamps every time she visited the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden , for it reminded her of the blue room in which Prince Albert , her husband , had died .
So the blue lamps were exchanged for white lamps , which have remained outside long after the police station was closed !

The grant from the Commissioners proved inadequate to cover the cost of furnishing the church and in 1735 a rate of one shilling in the pound was levied to set up the old organ , provide a clock , font , etc .
The church was opened in 1736 when numbered pew seats were allotted to 404 parishioners and their families .
The clock with four dials in the steeple was made by George Clarke of Whitechapel for £ 90 in 1738 .
The clock is unusual in that one of its four faces is never illuminated and painted black .
This came about because it faced the parish of Bermondsey , and when the church was asking for the one shilling donations from surrounding parishes , Bermondsey never gave a penny .
On the corner of Union Street and Blackfriars Road , just opposite Transport for London offices at Palestra , you might have noticed an effigy of a dog licking inside a pot .
The replica is a distinctive shop sign known to Charles Dickens and it was erected as part of the celebrations for the writer 's bicentenary in 2012 .
The original ' dog and pot ' sign belonged to an ironmonger 's , J. W. Cunningham & Co of 196 Blackfriars Road , and was mounted on a bracket that projected from the corner of the premises from the 18th century until 1931 .
Rowland Hill
House now occupies the site of the shop , opposite Palestra .
Dickens passed it regularly in the 1820s as he walked home from his work in a blacking factory at Charing Cross to his lodging in Lant Street .
The ' dog and pot ' image was also depicted on coal plates that were made in Union Street .
The sign is referred to by Dickens in a letter he wrote to his friend and biographer John Forster in 1847 which features in the book  The Life of Charles Dickens .
He wrote : " My usual way home was over Blackfriars Bridge and down that turning in the Blackfriars Road which has Rowland Hill 's Chapel on one side and the likeness of a golden dog licking a golden pot over a shop door on the other .
"
The sculpture is based on the original sign ( the original brass and wood sign was sold in 1931 and is now on display in Southwark 's Cuming Museum ) carved in wood and stands on a bracket which is mounted on a tall reclaimed Victorian lamppost .
An inscription incised in stone on the ground in front of the post stands in a circular area defined by Victorian - style railings , with the gardens of Nelson Square behind .
I wonder if the bird perched on the dog's back knows what the dickens its doing there !
I must admit it looks so much better than the CCTV camera mounted almost opposite !
The police hook in Great Newport Street is difficult to find , but if you persevere with your search , on the north side near the junction of Upper St Martins Lane , you will eventually locate it .
The policeman 's hook or cloak hanger dates back to the horse and carriage times and days of the early motor traffic , when police were called for point duty at busy junctions .
We all know how quickly the weather changes so a cloak to shield from the rain was essential if you needed to stand around for ages .
If the cloak was n't needed , but hands were to direct the traffic , then a place to hang the garment was essential .
In those long gone days there would have been plenty of busy cross roads with policemen's hooks , but due to this hard to see cloak hanger , thankfully it has been overlooked .
The Bow Street Police Station and Magistrates Court , home of the original Bow Street Runners , has a unique feature that no other London police station has .
When blue lamps outside Bow Sreet police stations were first introduced in 1861 , Queen Victoria was not too amused .
She objected to seeing the blue lamps every time she visited the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden , for it reminded her of the blue room in which Prince Albert , her husband , had died .
So the blue lamps were exchanged for white lamps , which have remained outside long after the police station was closed !

On his radio show today , former Rep. Bob Ney challenged former attorney general Alberto Gonzales to still defend waterboarding as not torture , after he tried it .
Ney said , “ If Alberto Gonzales wants to clear his name by saying he did n’t cooperate in torture , then let him try it himself . ”
Ney said that Gonzales is part of the Great Lie that was the Bush administration , “ When it comes to the worst abuses by the Bush administration , Alberto Gonzales is scurrying under every rock you turn up , Whether it was rushing to the sickbed of his predecessor , John Ashcroft , to try to pressure him to sign off on illegal warrantless wiretaps , or getting the Justice Department to approve clear violations of the Geneva Conventions , there was Alberto Gonzales .
He did n’t follow the law ; he did whatever he was told .
He ’s part of the ‘ Great Lie ’ that was the last administration . ”
If anybody is an expert on not following the law , it is Bob Ney .
Ney had to resign from the House in 2006 , because he faced criminal charges due to accepting lavish gifts from Jack Abramoff in exchange for political favors .
Ney definitely knows something about corruption .
Bob Ney was one of the Republicans that helped wreck the GOP in Ohio .

His feelings about Gonzales are not unique among both Congressional Democrats and Republicans .
Gonzales was equally despised by both sides , because he lied and misled constantly while testifying .
It is interesting to see just how desperate some Republicans are to put the Bush era behind them , but with Gonzales regularly appearing on CNN , and Dick Cheney all over the news , getting rid of the Bush administration is turning out to be easier said than done .
I had this idea two years ago and did it myself .

I am not giving up but think that next time I will try coating the material with an outdoor fabric protector to make it more waterproof .
I just want to be sure that it does n't impart a toxic impact to the herbs .
Perhaps I will stick to flowers if I can't be sure of that since I prefer to go organic and any chemicals make me weary .

After reading both WebProNews and TechCrunch on their articles about the new Twitter homepage , I am still left with questions .
Jeremy
Muncy does a great job breaking down the new Twitter homepage in his article Breaking Down Twitter ’s New Homepage for those needing a little more explanation .
I could care less that the front page looks a bit too trendy in design .
The problem is that as Jeremy pointed out , Twitter users would not be able to use this feature .
For me , being a Twitter addict , I would love to have access to this feature other than entering it in the search in the sidebar of my profile .
Right now , the Twitter search page is very plain and boring .
What , are current users ?
– chopped liver ?
There are no links to the main search page for Twitter users to directly visit .
I do think that the real - time search function is an awesome attribute of Twitter and I think it could play big in helping them finally monetize their product .
However , I revisit this one point again that I have in the past … when is Twitter going to tighten up on watching trending topics and specify what is spam .
If people are going to protest , at least pass around a petition link instead of repeatedly throw up on the stream a pointless message .
These type of trending topics could hurt Twitter when people visit the page .
As anyone knows , your first 30 seconds on a site will leave a huge impression .
If people are trending a topic that either seems immature , or pointless , they will turn away .
That is the impression I have already gotten in responses from bloggers and my own visitors .
What do you think of this ?
What would you suggest to Twitter ?
In the wake of Brock Lesnar 's win over Frank Mir at UFC 100 we are experiencing a focus on personality and theatrics in the fight game .
Rather than allow this to simply be passed over as a product of a former WWE star I will be taking a look back at the history of theatrics in combat sports in a multi-part series beginning today with Sonny Liston vs. Cassius Clay .
-------------------------
Clay comes out to meet Liston and Liston starts to retreat , if Liston goes back an inch farther he 'll end up in a ringside seat .
Clay swings with a left , Clay swings with a right , just look at young Cassius carry the fight .
Liston keeps backing but there 's not enough room , it 's a matter of time until Clay lowers the boom .
Then Clay lands with a right , what a beautiful swing , and the punch raised the bear clear out of the ring .
Liston still rising and the ref wears a frown , but he can't start counting until Sonny comes down .
Now Liston disappears from view , the crowd is getting frantic and our radaring stations have picked him up somewhere over the Atlantic .
Who on Earth thought , when they came to the fight , that they would witness the launching of a human satellite .
Hence the crowd did not dream , when they laid down their money , that they would see a total eclipse of Sonny .
Those words were written by Cassius Clay prior to his first fight with Sonny Liston .
As much as we romanticize Ali now the truth is , there was a large segment of the population that could not stand this young black man conducting himself in such an immodest manner .
In fact , LA Times writer Jim Murray had the following to say about the Liston / Clay fight :
the most popular fight since Hitler and Stalin -- 180 million Americans rooting for a double knockout .
The only thing at which Clay can beat Liston is reading the dictionary .
. . .
His public utterances have all the modesty of a German ultimatum to Poland but his public performances run more to Mussolini 's navy .
Obviously at the time this was not Muhammad Ali , American Hero .
Instead it was the shamelessly brash Cassius Clay , who was going to get his mouth shut by the 7:1 favorite Sonny Liston and his crushing power punches .
There were practically no sports reporters willing to go on record as giving Clay a chance , most even going as far as to say that Liston would knock out the kid in under a round .
The fight almost did n't happen due to Clay 's association with Malcolm X and his rumored conversion to Islam .
With Liston being such a big favorite it was a very real possibility that Clay 's conversion would kill whatever interest was left in the bout .
In the interest of not having the bout canceled and " selling " the fight to the public Clay agreed to wait until after the fight to announce his conversion ( the day after the fight he announced he had changed his name to Muhammad Ali ) .
In the weeks building up to the fight Ali was showing up at Liston 's training camp with a busfull of press and his entourage shouting insults at Sonny while he worked out .
He kept up the outbursts leading to the weigh - ins before the fight which saw Ali do the following :
Debate rages to this day as to if the challenger believed all that he said about Liston or if he was simply " talking to himself " to build up his confidence as Floyd Patterson asserted .
Ali himself had my favorite take on his hype and how much he believed .
From David Remnick 's great book " King of the World " :
Finally , the writer Mort Sharnik said , " Cassius , all these things you 're saying about Liston , do you really mean them ?
Do you really think you 're going to beat this guy ? "
" I'm Christopher Columbus , " he said slowly .
" I believe I 'll win .
I 've never been in there with him , but I believe the world is round and they all believe the world is flat .
Maybe I 'll fall off the world at the horizon but I believe the world is round . "
The world did prove to be round for Cassius as things went exactly as he had predicted ; he battered Liston with speed and movement forcing the champ to quit on the stool before the seventh round .
Following the win Cassius celebrated by declaring himself " the greatest " " king of the world " and talking about how Liston was not even a match :
The rematch highlights the fact that Clay ( now Ali ) was still seen as a villian as he was booed upon entering the ring and during fighter introductions .
After landing a right hand in the first round which knocked Liston down Ali stood over him shouting to " get up and fight , sucker ! " and posing over his downed opponent while the referee ( former world champ Joe Walcott ) tried to make the count resulting in the most famous picture in combat sports history :
One takeaway from this article for MMA fans should be that what Brock Lesnar does is not all that different from Ali in his prime .
Is he as eloquent or graceful in his style as Ali ?
Absolutely not .
But he is a man who sells fights despite a personality that flies in the face of what is expected and appreciated by the majority of the press and fanbase .
And the real question is this :
What is more of a pro wrestling tactic ?
For Brock Lesnar to be himself despite how abrasive his personality really is ... or for what has become the norm in MMA .
For guys to talk a big game , fight , and then hug before saying that they were just " selling the fight . "
Is n't that what sports entertainment is based around ?
Pretending that a storyline exists where it does not to get people interested in watching an event ?
I know some people wo n't like hearing it , but right now Brock Lesnar reminds me of Ali much more than he reminds me of a WWE star .
He is a guy who says and does what he wants despite what people think and lets that sell fights for him .
Guys like BJ Penn are the ones truly practicing sports entertainment tactics with pre-fight trash talk only to say afterward that they did n't mean it and were jusy hyping a fight for the fans .
Creating a storyline out of thin air is a WWE move , just being a jerk because that is your true personality is not .
I just want to say one last thing .
Certain members of the MMA press need to study up on thier combat sports history and stop pretending that somehow Brock Lesnar is a first of his kind personality shattering the norms of combat sports .
To me he is just another outspoken combat athlete trying to prove that his world is round .
Heres what Loathsome bastard Lt. Col. Ralph Peters had to say about captured soldier Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl :
He is an apparent deserter .
Reports are indeed that he abandoned his buddies , abandoned his post , and walked off .
Well see what the ultimate truth of it is , but if he did … hes a deserter at wartime ….
On that video , he is collaborating with the enemy .
Under duress or not  that s really not relevant  hes making accusations about the behavior of the military in Afghanistan that are unfounded , saying that there are no rules , hes lying about how he was captured , saying he lagged behind the patrol . …
So we know that this private is a liar .
We re not sure if hes a deserter .
But the media needs to hit the pause button , and not portray this guy as a hero .
…
Hes making anti-American statements , I mean , he wants to investigate Islam , blah blah blah . …
If he walked away from his post and his buddies at wartime … I dont care how hard it sounds , as far as I m concerned , the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills .

Some legal experts question the constitutionality of a $ 1.92 million fine given to a woman accused of pirating 24 songs .
A Minnesota jury ordered Jammie Thomas - Rasset to pay that yesterday , saying she " willfully " violated music copyrights and should cough up $ 80,000 per illegally downloaded track .
The verdict brings a new twist to a seemingly endless legal battle brought about by the Recording Industry of America ( RIAA ) .
The case originally culminated back in 2007 , when a different jury slapped Thomas - Rasset with a $ 220,000 penalty ( only about $ 9100 per song ) .
Soon after , Thomas - Rasset filed an appeal and received a retrial , which led to this week 's even costlier conclusion .
Jammie Thomas and the $ 80,000 Question
If $ 80,000 a song sounds unreasonable to you , you are n't alone :
The blogosphere , as well as Twitter users , are buzzing with outrage .
The shockwaves , by some accounts , started mere seconds after the verdict was announced .
" I think $ 2 million for downloading 24 songs strikes almost everyone as being a little disproportionate , " says Fred von Lohmann , a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" According to people who were in the courtroom , almost everyone inside uttered an audible gasp when that verdict came in . "
The size of the fine was guided by U.S. copyright law , which provides for a penalty of anywhere from $ 750 to $ 150,000 per violation .
It was up to the jury , however , to decide where to land within that spectrum .
The problem , von Lohmann says , is that there are no meaningful guidelines on how that decision should be reached .
" The copyright law entitles people to essentially pull a number out of a hat , all the way up to $ 150,000 per song , " he says .
" If the copyright law were more reasonable -- if , say , you had to make some sort of reasonable guess as to what the actual harm was -- then I think juries would come in with more reasonable results . "
The RIAA Case and the Constitution
Here 's where things start to get dicey :
The Supreme Court has previously indicated that " grossly excessive " punitive damage awards are a violation of the U.S. Constitution .
An award can be considered " grossly excessive " if there 's too big of a gap between the actual harm done and the amount of money being named .
Courts can also consider the " degree of reprehensibility " of the defendant 's actions , along with how the penalty compares to similar ones issued in the past .
It seems , then , there may be a clash between two ideals :
The parameters of the copyright law and the protection provided by the Constitution .
What 's more , as the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out , recent Supreme Court rulings suggest a jury should determine damages based only on what 's justified for the single defendant -- not for the broader purpose of " sending a message " to the general public .
There 's also the issue that the recording industry recently backed down from its heavily criticized process of suing suspected music sharers -- people like Jammie Thomas - Rasset -- and said it would instead start working with Internet service providers to find offenders and restrict their access .
That means Thomas - Rasset 's case is , to a large degree , a fight over the past .
" File sharers today doing exactly what Jammie Thomas had been doing do not stand any chance of being dragged into court , " von Lohmann says .
" The irony here is that five years and 35,000 lawsuit threats later , we have only one case that goes to trial -- and it ends up giving us an outcome that I think everybody thinks is unsatisfactory . "
The Next Steps
So what now ?
Any number of things could happen : Thomas - Rasset could move to settle the case ; she could ask the judge to reduce the penalty ; or she could file an appeal based on the constitutional concerns .
She could also declare bankruptcy to try to avoid having to pay the full cost .
" It 's hard to predict what exactly will happen next , " von Lohmann says .
" But it 's certainly far from over . "

Police will today unveil their latest weapon in the battle against violent crime — officers with evidence - gathering video cameras mounted on their uniforms .
Officers have been trained to use the equipment in potentially violent situations and while making arrests to help them to record and deal quickly with crime and anti-social behaviour .
The technology , which was due to be launched by the PSNI in Lisburn today , is already being used by a number of forces across the UK .
The PSNI and Policing Board members hope that the equipment will help officers gather high quality evidence , particularly in domestic abuse and anti-social behaviour cases .
The video cameras can be attached to a police officer ’s body armour , cycle helmet or other accessories .
They will be used openly by officers in uniform and strict rules and regulations will surround the use of this type of recording equipment .
It is thought the cameras could also help reduce bureaucracy with officers not having to spend as much time writing long statements when they can refer to the video footage .
The scheme was piloted in Carrickfergus earlier this year and was to be rolled out in the Lisburn area today .
“ It is hoped the scheme will then be expanded to all police districts across Northern Ireland .
UUP Policing Board member Basil McCrea said : “ This is a way of equipping officers with modern technology to obtain high quality evidence which will assist in the investigation of crime and presentation of cases in court .
“ It should be seen as an additional tool in the fight against crime .
It is a useful tool which ensures those who are guilty of crime and anti-social behaviour do not escape justice .
“ I really think they are a great idea and I have been pushing for this for a long time .
I think they will be particularly useful in domestic violence cases and cases where someone is reluctant to give evidence as the cameras will be able to pick up evidence . ”
Mr McCrea said he believes the cameras could also provide an opportunity to assess the conduct of police officers when dealing with the public , particularly in difficult situations such as the Taser incident in Londonderry last year when police used the weapon on a father - of - two .
Specialist PSNI officers used a Taser gun to subdue 38 - year - old Declan Smith , of Elaghmore Park after receiving a report in the early hours of the morning that he had locked himself in a house and was threatening to kill himself and his two young children — charges he was later acquitted of in court .
He was tasered after emerging from the property following three hours of negotiations .
The officer who discharged the weapon said he felt it was necessary to stop the situation escalating .
Smith disagreed saying he felt his civil rights were taken away and he was unjustly tasered .
The Police Ombudsman , however , said the response was justified and proportionate ,
“ This is the sort of case where the cameras would come in very useful .
Officers would be able to show on camera the type of situation they were faced with and their response to it , ” said Mr McCrea .
“ As well as helping to gather evidence these cameras will help keep an eye on how police interact with the public . ”
The Police Federation said it is aware of the scheme .
“ It is an officer safety issue , ” a spokesman said .
Belfast Telegraph
The public sector will have to embrace a business attitude if it is going to make a success of cloud computing , according to a NetApp executive .
In a meeting with IT PRO , Paul Wooding , head of Public Sector for NetApp in the UK , described how the public sector is too protective of its IT systems at the moment to fully embrace cloud computing .
He said : " There is too much personality .
When people build something up they then have the attitude that it is ' my baby ' and want ownership of it . "
Wooding said this attitude needs to go , and public organisations must instead embrace a business ethos of getting the most out of a system for the least cost .
He said : " We have made the move towards shared services , we now need to move towards cloud computing .
There are too many separate IT departments [ which could be consolidated ] .
Their IT guys are only too happy to make the move , if it is their department that becomes the hub . "
" Of course it will lead to redundancies and that is a political gamble , but it would easily reduce costs and increase efficiency if the government really took up the cloud . "
He cited an example from Ealing Council which cut IT costs , leading to a reduction in council tax for their residents - although it did also lead to several redundancies .
In a letter to four key Republican Congressmen ( Camp , Barton , Kline , and Ryan ) , the Congressional Budget Office destroys the House Democrats ’ implementation of the President ’s goal of long - term fiscal responsibility through health care reform .
With this analysis the fight about the House bill is over by a technical knockout ( TKO ) .
The proposed income tax increases were the key vulnerability .
I will walk you through the analysis and why I reach the following conclusion .
Conclusion : CBO says that because the proposed new health spending would grow faster than the proposed new income tax increases , the House health bill would increase the long - term deficit .
Since the President has said he would not sign a bill that increases the long - term deficit , the bill is dead in its current form .
Any tax increase that would grow more slowly than the proposed new spending faces the same irreconcilable problem .
The only way to solve this problem and meet the President ’s long - term goal is to cut health spending or tax employer - provided health insurance .
We can start by looking at the short - term budget effects of the House Tri-Committee health bill over the next ten years :
10 - year deficit effect
(+ means increases deficit )
New coverage provisions +
$ 1,042 billion Medicare savings – $ 219 billion Other provisions
( primarily income tax increases ) – $ 583 billion Net deficit increases + $ 239 billion
The new CBO information is about the long run deficit .
Here is the key paragraph from the 18 page CBO letter :
Looking ahead to the decade beyond 2019 , CBO tries to evaluate the rate at which the budgetary impact of each of those broad categories would be likely to change over time .
The net cost of the coverage provisions would be growing at a rate of more than 8 percent per year in nominal terms between 2017 and 2019 ; we would anticipate a similar trend in the subsequent decade .
The reductions in direct spending would also be larger in the second decade than in the first , and they would represent an increasing share of spending on Medicare over that period ; however , they would be much smaller at the end of the 10 - year budget window than the cost of the coverage provisions , so they would not be likely to keep pace in dollar terms with the rising cost of the coverage expansion .
Revenue from the surcharge on high - income individuals would be growing at about 5 percent per year in nominal terms between 2017 and 2019 ; that component would continue to grow at a slower rate than the cost of the coverage expansion in the following decade .
In sum , relative to current law , the proposal would probably generate substantial increases in federal budget deficits during the decade beyond the current 10 - year budget window .
In the long run , it ’s all about growth rates .
Let ’s go to the chalkboard .
All numbers are from CBO ’s July 14th estimate of the House bill , Joint Tax Committee ’s July 16th estimate , and CBO ’s July 26th letter to Mr. Camp .
We start with the short run , and look just at the new coverage provisions in green , and the net spending increase in blue .
Proposed Medicare savings bring the gross new coverage spending of the green line down to the net spending increase of the blue line .
As always , you can click on any graph to see a larger version .
Spending would start in 2013 and ramp up to its long - term path by 2015 .
In 2019 the bill spends $ 202 B on the new coverage provisions and saves $ 51 B from Medicare , for a net spending increase of $ 151 B .
A small caveat : both the new coverage section of the CBO estimate and the Medicare savings include some indirect revenue effects , such as the higher taxes that would be collected from individuals and employers who do n’t comply with the mandates .
So technically these lines show the net deficit effects of the “ New coverage ” and Medicare sections of the bill .
The revenue components are relatively small , and this oversimplification does not affect the analysis , so I ’m labeling the blue line “ net spending increase . ”
In addition , this is how CBO packages things , so I am confident it ’s a safe oversimplification .
Now let ’s add to the graph the tax increases in the House bill as a new yellow line .
Everything else is the same as on the first graph .
The House bill raises $ 87 B of taxes in 2019 , compared to the $ 151 B net spending increase in that year .
The area between the light blue and yellow lines is the deficit impact .
Up to 2013 , the bill collects more in taxes than it spends , so the bill actually reduces budget deficits in the early years .
After 2013 , the light blue net spending line is above the yellow tax line , so the bill adds to the deficit .
In 2019 , the bill increases the deficit by $ 151 B – $ 87 B = $ 64 B .
The net of the deficit - reducing and deficit - increasing areas is the $ 239 B deficit increase over 10 years from the first table above .
Again , all of these are CBO and Joint Tax Committee numbers .
Now we turn to the long run , relying on that key CBO paragraph .
Here are the key numbers :
The net cost of the coverage provisions would be growing at a rate of more than 8 percent per year in nominal terms between 2017 and 2019 ; we would anticipate a similar trend in the subsequent decade .
…
Revenue from the surcharge on high - income individuals would be growing at about 5 percent per year in nominal terms between 2017 and 2019 ; that component would continue to grow at a slower rate than the cost of the coverage expansion in the following decade .
CBO phrases this a little bit carefully , so I want to be clear that this last graph represents my interpretation of the above language , rather than explicit calculations provided by CBO .
I ’m going to extend the blue and yellow lines from the graph above through the second decade .
Here are some details for the technicians :
All figures through 2019 are from CBO ’s July 14th estimate and Joint Tax ’s July 16th estimate .
The average annual growth rate of the yellow line from 2017 to 2019 is 5.1 % , derived from the JCT July 16th estimate .
Beyond 2019 , the yellow line is the 2019 figure of $ 87 B from Joint Tax , grown at a 5.1 % annual rate .
The average annual growth rate of the blue line from 2017 to 2019 is 8.7 % , derived from the CBO July 14th estimate .
Beyond 2019 , the blue line is the 2019 figure of $ 151 B , grown at an 8.7 % annual rate .
The $ 205 B deficit increase in 2029 is simply the delta between the two calculated points for that date .
I am being a little more precise than CBO ’s language .
They were careful not to explicitly say that the growth rates would be precisely 8.7 % and 5.1 % over the next decade , but it ’s the most reasonable conclusion from their language if you have to pick numbers .
It ’s not fair to say that the $ 205 B figure is a CBO number — it ’s not .
It is fair to say that the ever - widening red area , representing large and increasing long - term deficit increases , represents CBO ’s conclusion .
What does this mean ?
This is the most important analysis CBO has done of the House health bill .
Remember the President ’s three part test :
A bill should not increase the budget deficit in the short run ( the first ten years ) .
A bill should not increase the budget deficit in the tenth year .
A bill should “ bend the health cost curve down ” in the long run .
( More recently , a weaker test that a bill must not increase long - term deficits . )
I would prefer stronger tests , which I proposed six weeks ago .
The second graph demonstrates that the House bill would fail the first two tests .
CBO and Joint Tax said that in their July 14th and July 16th estimates .
The House bill increases deficits by $ 239 B over the next decade , and by $ 64 B in the tenth year .
The new information is CBO ’s conclusion that the House bill would increase long - term budget deficits , because the new spending will grow faster than the income tax increases .
This is logical : if the net spending increases start the second decade $ 64 B higher than the tax increases , and if the spending will grow 8.7 % per year while the taxes will grow only 5.1 % per year , then the gap between the two , the budget deficit , will only grow over time .
CBO has concluded that the House bill would make America ’s long - term deficit problem dramatically worse than it is under current law .
This clearly fails the third Presidential test .
There ’s another conclusion that is implicit in CBO ’s analysis .
Because of the different growth rates , there is no way to solve this problem by raising income taxes like the House bill does .
If you want to include tax increases in your bill , they have to match the net spending increase in the tenth year , and they have to grow at least as fast as the 8.7 % growth rate of long - term net spending .
The only thing that has a chance of doing that is the taxation of health benefits .
I think this is fatal to the House bill .
The income tax increases were already in serious trouble because of opposition from Blue Dog Democrats who do not want to raise taxes on small business owners , and who do not want to be BTU ’d ( again ) by Senate Democrats who have said they wo n’t raise income taxes .
But House Democratic
Leaders were relying on these tax increases to avoid having to make deeper entitlement spending cuts , tax employer - provided health insurance , or dramatically scale back their proposed new spending .
CBO has called the fight over by a technical knockout .
Where have I heard this before ?
If you are patient enough to have read this blog over the past few months , some of this may look familiar to you .
Here ’s what I wrote on June 12 :
Jim DeMint defends his Waterloo remark , saying that Republicans should oppose health care reform in order to hurt President Obama politically :
DeMint does n't realize it , but far from stopping the President , he 's actually helping make the case that Republicans are n't really concerned with health care -- they only care about politics .

President Barack Obama makes an opening statement during a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington , Wednesday July 22 , 2009 .

President Barack Obama said Wednesday night that Medicare and Medicaid are the " biggest driving force behind " massive federal deficits , and must be tamed as part of any health care legislation .
At a prime - time news conference marking six months in office , Obama said health care legislation was key to a strong economic recovery , and he added , " If we do not control these costs , we will not be able to control our deficit . "
The president noted he took office with the economy in the worst recession in half a century .
" As a result of the action we took in those first weeks , we have been able to pull our economy back from the brink , " he said .
The president stepped to the microphone as Congress labored over his call for sweeping legislation to expand health care to millions who lack it , as well as control the costs of medical care generally .
In his opening statement , he stressed the second of those two goals .
" In the past eight year , we saw the enactment of two tax cuts , primarily for the wealthiest Americans , and a Medicare prescription program , none of which were paid for . "
He vowed anew that he would n't sign health care legislation that was n't paid for , although his administration has exempted from that pledge an estimated $ 245 billion to raise Medicare fees for doctors .
" This debate is not a game for these Americans , and they cannot afford to wait for reform any longer , " Obama said .
" They are looking to us for leadership .
And we must not let them down . "
" This debate is not a game for these Americans , and they cannot afford to wait for reform any longer . "
The stakes are huge not just for everyday Americans , but also for Obama , who is putting much of his credibility on the line to gain passage of congressional legislation .
His stepped - up public role comes as he faces rising criticism from Republicans , sliding public approval ratings and divisions within his party .
Holding his 10th extended news conference , Obama was renewing a message that the White House says he cannot pound enough : making health coverage affordable and sustainable is so vital that anything less will erode the economic stability of families , businesses and even the government .
The complex work of getting bills through the House and Senate is proving difficult .
Republican leaders contend Obama 's effort and the emerging bills are rushed and risky , and members of Obama 's own Democratic Party are split on how to structure and pay for a daunting overhaul .
Obama sought to get beyond that and connect with Americans - and , in turn , the White House hopes , to pressure Congress .
" I understand how easy it is for this town to become consumed in the game of politics , to turn every issue into a running tally of who 's up or who 's down , " he said .
His words came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats have the votes to pass a massive health care bill in that chamber , prompting surprise and some criticism from conservatives within her party .
Congress is struggling to figure out how to pay for adding millions to the ranks of the insured and slowing the long - term costs of health care in the U.S .
In his comments , Obama reiterated his pledge that any bill he signs will not add to the nation 's soaring deficit .
" And I mean it , " he said .
Meanwhile , a nervous public is being hit by TV ads and claims from all sides .
And other issues have n't gone away as Obama steps before the cameras .
Still looming are an economy that keeps losing jobs , wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Obama 's January deadline to shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention facility .
The timing is critical as Obama appeals Wednesday night to a national viewing audience .
He wants the House and Senate to vote on comprehensive health care bills before they break for the summer , a window that is scheduled to shut by the first week in August .
That timetable is growing tenuous , though , with up - and - down developments by the day .
So Obama is everywhere on health care : giving Rose Garden statements , visiting health clinics , talking to bloggers , granting interviews .
" He 's prepared to do this as many times as he has to , " said Michael Traugott , a University of Michigan professor who specializes in political communications .
" The president has a special advantage because he 's readily identifiable .
The Congress is a less well known institution , and less popular in the public 's eye . "
Obama 's approval rating stands at 55 percent , according to a new Associated Press - GfK poll , down from 64 percent in late May and early June .
Some 50 percent approve of his handling of health care , but 43 percent disapprove , and that number has risen sharply since April .
With public opinion still waiting to be shaped on health care , and with the legislative details in flux , what 's clear is that people care .
Nearly 80 percent of those polled say health care is an important issue to them .
Obama is seeking to extend coverage to millions who do n't have it and to hold down the long - term costs of health care .
How to pay remain a complex political question .
It did n't help the White House when the Congressional Budget Office last week said the bills moving through Congress would add to the nation 's long - term costs , not reduce them .
Obama has been emphatic that he will not sign a bill that adds to the government 's deficit .
Meanwhile , unemployment is at 9.5 percent and rising .
Talk of Obama inheriting an economic mess from George W. Bush is fading , and the American public is now grading the new president .
His approval rating on handling the economy has been slipping as impatience grows .
Obama says the country is moving in the right direction , and he points to legislation from his first half - year in office : a massive economic stimulus bill that is ultimately designed to work over two years , a law to overhaul the credit card industry , and another to keep tobacco companies from marketing to kids .
Still , he told CBS News on Tuesday : " As long as the economy is still shedding jobs and people do n't feel confident about a recovery , then , you know , I think there 's going to continue to be frustration .
And rightfully so . "
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that Obama is " feeling optimistic that he's on track , after his first six months in office , to fulfill his promise to sign a health care reform bill before the end of the year . "

The contradiction and tragedy of communist - anarchism Part V Share This :
NOTE : some of the discussion in this section is politically dated because the essay was written in 1983 .
The theoretical points and commentary , however , remain valid ( or not ) â€ ¦
Again , since I embrace the concept of â€˜property rightsâ€™ , my approach to capitalism varies significantly from Kenâ€ ™sâ€¦even though , like Ken , I vastly prefer the term â€œfree marketâ€  and do not see the two terms as interchangeable .
It should be noted , however , that Kenâ€™s position is far more consistent with that of the 19th century Tuckerite anarchists ; by contrast , I never accepted much of Tuckerâ€™s economic theory , largely due to the influence of Ayn Rand and ( especially ) Murray Rothbard .

CAPITALISM : FREEDOM PERVERTED
" Permit me to issue and control the money of a
nation and I care not who makes its laws . "
- Meyer A. Rothchild
Roosevelt , in blaming the depression of the ' thirties on " heedless self - interest , " played a cheap political trick for which the world has been suffering ever since .
The great crash of 1929 , far from being created by " free enterprise , " was created by government interference in the free market .
The Federal Reserve Board had been artificially controlling interest rates since 1913 .
The tax structure of the country was set up in such a way as to encourage ridiculously risky speculation in the stock market .
" Protective tariffs " destroyed anything that vaguely resembled a free market .
Immigration barriers prevented the free flow of the labour market .
Anti-trust laws threatened prosecution for charging less than the competition ( " intent to monopolise " ) and for charging the same as the competition ( " price fixing " ) , but graciously permitted charging more than the competition ( commonly called " going out of business . " )
With all these legislative restraints and controls , Roosevelt still had the gall to blame the depression on the " free " market economy .
But what was his answer to the " ruthlessness " of freedom ?
This is what he had to say on taking office in 1933 :
" If we are to go forward , we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice to the good of a common discipline , because without such discipline no progress is made , no leadership becomes effective .
We are , I know , ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good . " [ 82 ]
Many people , on hearing the individualist critique of governmental control of the economy , jump to the erroneous conclusion that we believe in capitalism .
I 'm sorry to say that some anarchists - who should know better - share this common fallacy .
In a letter to " Freedom " a few months ago I tried to clear up this myth .
Replying to an article by one of its editors , I had this to say :
" First let me look at the term ' anarcho - capitalist . '
This , it seems to me , is just an attempt to slander the individualist - anarchists by using a supercharged word like ' capitalist ' in much the same way as the word ' anarchy ' is popularly used to mean chaos and disorder .
No one to my knowledge accepts the anarcho - capitalist label* , just as no one up to the time of Proudhon 's memoir on property in 1840 accepted the anarchist label .
But , unlike Proudhon who could call himself an anarchist by stripping the word of its derogatory connotation and looking at its real MEANING , no one can logically call himself an anarcho - capitalist for the simple reason that it's a contradiction in terms : anarchists seek the abolition of the state while capitalism is inherently dependent upon the state .
Without the state , capitalism would inevitably fall , for capitalism rests on the pillars of government privilege .
Because of government a privileged minority can monopolise land , limit credit , restrict exchange , give idle capital the power to increase , and , through interest , rent , profit , and taxes , rob industrious labour of its products . " [ 84 ]
---------------------------------------------
* I have since been informed that " the term ' anarcho - capitalist ' is now in use in the USA - particularly amongst those who contribute to the Los Angeles publication ' Libertarian Connection ' . "
It seems to me that people accepting such a label must do so primarily for its shock value .
Very few people like capitalists these days , and those who do certainly do n't like anarchists .
What better term could you find to offend everyone ?
---------------------------------------------
Now most anarchists when they attack capitalism strike it where it is strongest : in its advocacy of freedom .
And how paradoxical that is .
Here we have the anarchists , champions of freedom PAR EXCELLENCE , complaining about freedom !
How ridiculous , it seems to me , to find anarchists attacking Mr. Heath for withdrawing government subsidies from museums and children 's milk programmes .
When anarchists start screaming for free museums , free milk , free subways , free medical care , free education , etc. , etc. , they only show their ignorance of what freedom really is .
All these " free " goodies which governments so graciously shower upon their subjects ultimately come from the recipients themselves - in the form of taxes .
Governments are very clever at concealing just how large this sum actually is .
They speak of a billion pounds here and a few hundred million dollars there .
But what does a figure like $ 229,232,000,000.00 ( Nixon 's proposed budget ) actually mean to the taxpayer ?
Virtually nothing .
It 's just a long string of numbers preceded by a dollar sign .
People have no conception of numbers that size .
But let me try to shed some light on this figure by breaking it down into a number the individual taxpayer can't help but understand : the average annual cost per family .
This is a number governments NEVER talk about - for if they did , there would be a revolt which would make the storming of the Bastille look like a Sunday school picnic .
Here 's how to calculate it : you take the government 's annual budget and divide it by the population of the country ; then you multiply the result by the average size of family ( 4.5 seems a reasonable number ) .
Doing this for the American case cited , we come to $ 4,800 ( i.e. 2000 pounds per family per year !* ) .
And that is just the FEDERAL tax bite .
State and local taxes ( which primarily pay for America 's " free " education and " free " public highways ) have yet to be considered .
I leave it as an exercise to the British reader to see why their " welfare state " also prefers to mask budgetary figures by using astronomical numbers .
----------------------------------------------
* I am usually quite conservative in my use of exclamation marks .
When I used this example in a recent letter to " Freedom " , the editors saw fit to insert one where I had not .
In keeping with their precedent , I will do likewise .
----------------------------------------------
One thing should be clear from this example : nothing is for nothing .
But the Santa Claus myth dies hard , even - or should I say especially ?
- among anarchists .
The only encouraging sign to the contrary I have found in the anarchist press of late was when Ian Sutherland complained in the columns of " Freedom " : " I object , strongly , to having a large section of my ' product ' , my contribution to society , forcibly removed from me by a paternalistic state to dispense to a fool with 10 kids . " [ 85 ]
Unfortunately , I suspect that Mr Sutherland would only replace the " paternalistic state " by the " paternalistic commune " - and in so doing would still end up supporting those 10 kids .
My suspicions were nourished by what he said in the very next paragraph about " laissez faire " anarchists : " perhaps they should join the Powellites . "
Perhaps Mr Sutherland should learn what laissez faire means .
Laissez faire is a term coined by the French physiocrats during the eighteenth century .
John Stuart Mill brought it into popular English usage with the publication in 1848 of his " Principles of Political Economy , " where he examined the arguments for and against government intervention in the economy .
The " con " side of the argument he called laissez faire .
" The principle of ' laissez faire ' in economics calls for perfect freedom in production ; distribution of the returns ( or profit ) to the factors of production according to the productivity of each ; and finally , markets in which prices are determined by the free interplay of forces that satisfy buyers and sellers . " [ 86 ]
I find it difficult to see how any advocate of freedom could possibly object to a doctrine like this one .
Unfortunately , what happened in the 19th century was that a handful of capitalists , who were anything but believers if freedom , picked up this nice sounding catch phrase and decided to " improve " upon it .
These " improvements " left them with the freedom to exploit labour but took away labour 's freedom to exploit capital .
These capitalists , in perverting the original meaning of laissez faire , struck a blow against freedom from which it still suffers to this day .
The capitalist who advocates laissez faire is a hypocrite .
If he really believed in freedom , he could not possibly condone the greatest invader of freedom known to man : government .
The capitalist necessarily relies on government to protect his privileged RIGHTS .
Let us look at the foremost advocate of capitalism today , Ayn Rand .
Her book " Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal " has two appendices .
The first is on " Man 's Rights " where she say , " INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ARE THE MEANS OF SUBORDINATING SOCIETY TO MORAL LAW . " [ 87 ]
( Her emphasis ) Once again we are back to " rights " and " morals " which Stirner so strongly warned us about .
And where does this lead us ?
Directly to Appendix Two , " The Nature of Government , " where she says that government is " necessary " because " men need an institution charged with the task of protecting [ you guessed it ] their rights . " [ 88 ]
Let 's see what some of these precious rights are :
I. Chapter 11 of Miss Rand 's book is devoted to a defence of patent and copyright laws .
In it she calls upon government to " certify the origination of an idea and protect its owner 's exclusive right to use and disposal . " [ 89 ]
Realising the absurdity of PERPETUAL property in ideas ( " consider what would happen if , in producing an automobile , we had to pay royalties to the descendants of all the inventors involved , starting with the inventor of the wheel and on up . " [ 90 ] ) , she goes into considerable mental acrobatics to justify intellectual property for a LIMITED time .
But by so doing , she only succeeds in arousing our suspicion of her motives , for it seems strange that a mere lapse of time should negate something so precious as a man 's " right " to his property .
Admitting that " a patented invention often tends to hamper or restrict further research and development in a given area of science [ 91 ] , our champion of the unhampered economy nevertheless manages to justify governmental " protection " to secure the inventor 's " rights . "
As for copyrights , our millionaire author thinks " the most rational " length of time for this governmental protection would be " for the lifetime of the author and fifty years thereafter . " [ 92 ]
How does she justify all this ?
The way she justifies most of her inane arguments - by quoting herself : " Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture Rearden Metal ? " [ 93 ]
Why indeed ?
II .
Capitalists are fond of proclaiming the " rights " of private property .
One of their favourite property rights is the right to own land without actually occupying it .
The only way this can possibly be done is , once again , by government protection of legal pieces of paper called " titles " and " deeds . "
Without these scraps of paper , vast stretches of vacant land would be open to those who could use them and exorbitant rent could no longer be extracted from the non-owning user as tribute to the non-using owner .
There is much talk these days of a " population explosion . "
It is claimed that land is becoming more and more scarce and that by the year such and such there will be 38.2 people per square inch of land .
But just how scarce is land ?
If all the world 's land were divided up equally , every individual would have more than ten acres apiece .
Even " crowded " islands like Britain and Japan have more than an acre per person on average . [ 94 ]
When you consider how few people actually own any of this land , these figures seem incredible .
It 's no wonder then that the absentee landlord is a strong believer in property rights .
Without them his vulnerable land might actually be used to the advantage of the user .
III .
Capitalists have always been great believers in the sovereign " rights " of nations .
Ayn Rand , for example , thinks it perfectly consistent with her brand of freedom that the United States government should tax the people within its borders to support an army which costs tens of billions of dollars each year .
It is true that Miss Rand opposes the war in Vietnam .
But why ?
Because " IT DOES NOT SERVE ANY NATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES . " [ 95 ]
( Her emphasis )
So we see that our advocate of " limited government " would n't go so far as to limit its strongest arm : the military .
Eighty billion dollars a year for national " defence " does n't seem to phase her in the least - in fact , she would like to add on a few billion more to make " an army career comparable to the standards of the civilian labour market . " [ 96 ]
As every anarchist knows , a frontier is nothing more than an imaginary line drawn by a group of men with vested interests on their side of the line .
That " nations " should exist is an absurdity .
That a highwayman ( in the uniform of a customs official ) should rob people as they cross these imaginary lines and turn back others who have n't the proper pieces of paper is an obscenity too indecent to relate here - there may be children reading .
But if there are children reading , perhaps they can enlighten their elders about the obvious - as they did when the emperor went out in his " new " clothes .
The nationalists of the world are strutting about without a stitch of reason on .
Can only a child see this ?
IV .
The cruelest " right " - and the one least understood today - is the exclusive right of governments to issue money .
There was a time about a hundred years ago when nearly everyone was aware of the currency question .
For several decades in the United States it was THE political issue .
Whole political parties formed around it ( e.g. the Greenback and Populist parties ) .
William Jennings Bryan , the three - time Democratic candidate for the presidency , rose to fame with his " easy money " speeches ; next to Lincoln 's Gettysburg address , his " cross of gold " speech is probably the best - known public oration of 19th century America .
Yet today virtually everyone accepts the currency question as settled .
Governments issue the money people use and they never give it a second thought - it 's just there , like the sun and the moon .
The capitalist is vitally interested in the government 's exclusive right to issue money .
The capitalist is , by definition , the holder of capital ; and the government , by making only a certain type of capital ( namely gold ) the legal basis of all money , gives to the capitalist a monopoly power to compel all holders of property other than the kind thus privileged , as well as all non-proprietors , to pay tribute to the capitalist for the use of a circulating medium and instrument of credit which is absolutely necessary to carry out commerce and reap the benefits of the division of labour .
A crude example of how this system works is given by the Angolan " native tax . "
The Portuguese whites in Angola found it difficult to get black labour for their coffee plantations , so they struck upon a rather ingenious scheme : tax the natives and the natives , having to pay their tax in MONEY , would be forced to sell their labour to the only people who could give it to them - the whiteman . [ 97 ]
The same thing goes on today on a more sophisticated level in our more " civilised " societies .
The worker needs money to carry out the business of everyday life .
He needs food , he needs housing , he needs clothing .
To get these things he needs MONEY .
And to get money he has to sell the only thing he 's got : his labour .
Since he MUST sell his labour , he is put into a very bad bargaining position with the buyers of labour : the capitalists .
This is how the capitalist grows rich .
He buys labour in a cheap market and sells his products back to the worker in a dear one .
This is what Marx called the " surplus value theory " of labour .
His analysis ( at least here ) was right ; his solution to the problem was wrong .
The way Marx saw out of this trap was to abolish money .
The worker would then get the equivalent of his labour by pooling his products with other workers and taking out what he needed .
I 've already exposed the weak points of this theory .
What is the individualist alternative ?

We 've been on that Keynesian road ever since .
The " larger good " has become larger and larger until today the only cure the politicians come up with for the economy 's ills is more of the same poison which made it sick in the first place .
The rationale for such a policy was expressed by G. D. H. Cole in 1933 : " If once a departure is made from the classical method of letting all the factors [ of the economy ] alone - and we have seen enough of that method [ have we ? ] to be thoroughly dissatisfied with it - it becomes necessary to control ALL the factors ... for interference with one , while the others are left unregulated , is certain to result in a fatal lack of balance in the working of the economic system . . " [ 83 ]

But by so doing , she only succeeds in arousing our suspicion of her motives , for it seems strange that a mere lapse of time should negate something so precious as a man 's " right " to his property .
Admitting that " a patented invention often tends to hamper or restrict further research and development in a given area of science [ 91 ] , our champion of the unhampered economy nevertheless manages to justify governmental " protection " to secure the inventor 's " rights . "
As for copyrights , our millionaire author thinks " the most rational " length of time for this governmental protection would be " for the lifetime of the author and fifty years thereafter . " [ 92 ]
How does she justify all this ?
The way she justifies most of her inane arguments - by quoting herself : " Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture Rearden Metal ? " [ 93 ]
Why indeed ?
II .
Capitalists are fond of proclaiming the " rights " of private property .
One of their favourite property rights is the right to own land without actually occupying it .
The only way this can possibly be done is , once again , by government protection of legal pieces of paper called " titles " and " deeds . "
Without these scraps of paper , vast stretches of vacant land would be open to those who could use them and exorbitant rent could no longer be extracted from the non-owning user as tribute to the non-using owner .
There is much talk these days of a " population explosion . "
It is claimed that land is becoming more and more scarce and that by the year such and such there will be 38.2 people per square inch of land .
But just how scarce is land ?
If all the world 's land were divided up equally , every individual would have more than ten acres apiece .
Even " crowded " islands like Britain and Japan have more than an acre per person on average . [ 94 ]
When you consider how few people actually own any of this land , these figures seem incredible .
It 's no wonder then that the absentee landlord is a strong believer in property rights .
Without them his vulnerable land might actually be used to the advantage of the user .
III .
Capitalists have always been great believers in the sovereign " rights " of nations .
Ayn Rand , for example , thinks it perfectly consistent with her brand of freedom that the United States government should tax the people within its borders to support an army which costs tens of billions of dollars each year .
It is true that Miss Rand opposes the war in Vietnam .
But why ?
Because " IT DOES NOT SERVE ANY NATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES . " [ 95 ]
( Her emphasis )
So we see that our advocate of " limited government " would n't go so far as to limit its strongest arm : the military .
Eighty billion dollars a year for national " defence " does n't seem to phase her in the least - in fact , she would like to add on a few billion more to make " an army career comparable to the standards of the civilian labour market . " [ 96 ]
As every anarchist knows , a frontier is nothing more than an imaginary line drawn by a group of men with vested interests on their side of the line .
That " nations " should exist is an absurdity .
That a highwayman ( in the uniform of a customs official ) should rob people as they cross these imaginary lines and turn back others who have n't the proper pieces of paper is an obscenity too indecent to relate here - there may be children reading .
But if there are children reading , perhaps they can enlighten their elders about the obvious - as they did when the emperor went out in his " new " clothes .
The nationalists of the world are strutting about without a stitch of reason on .
Can only a child see this ?
IV .
The cruelest " right " - and the one least understood today - is the exclusive right of governments to issue money .
There was a time about a hundred years ago when nearly everyone was aware of the currency question .
For several decades in the United States it was THE political issue .
Whole political parties formed around it ( e.g. the Greenback and Populist parties ) .
William Jennings Bryan , the three - time Democratic candidate for the presidency , rose to fame with his " easy money " speeches ; next to Lincoln 's Gettysburg address , his " cross of gold " speech is probably the best - known public oration of 19th century America .
Yet today virtually everyone accepts the currency question as settled .
Governments issue the money people use and they never give it a second thought - it 's just there , like the sun and the moon .
The capitalist is vitally interested in the government 's exclusive right to issue money .
The capitalist is , by definition , the holder of capital ; and the government , by making only a certain type of capital ( namely gold ) the legal basis of all money , gives to the capitalist a monopoly power to compel all holders of property other than the kind thus privileged , as well as all non-proprietors , to pay tribute to the capitalist for the use of a circulating medium and instrument of credit which is absolutely necessary to carry out commerce and reap the benefits of the division of labour .
A crude example of how this system works is given by the Angolan " native tax . "
The Portuguese whites in Angola found it difficult to get black labour for their coffee plantations , so they struck upon a rather ingenious scheme : tax the natives and the natives , having to pay their tax in MONEY , would be forced to sell their labour to the only people who could give it to them - the whiteman . [ 97 ]
The same thing goes on today on a more sophisticated level in our more " civilised " societies .
The worker needs money to carry out the business of everyday life .
He needs food , he needs housing , he needs clothing .
To get these things he needs MONEY .
And to get money he has to sell the only thing he 's got : his labour .
Since he MUST sell his labour , he is put into a very bad bargaining position with the buyers of labour : the capitalists .
This is how the capitalist grows rich .
He buys labour in a cheap market and sells his products back to the worker in a dear one .
This is what Marx called the " surplus value theory " of labour .
His analysis ( at least here ) was right ; his solution to the problem was wrong .
The way Marx saw out of this trap was to abolish money .
The worker would then get the equivalent of his labour by pooling his products with other workers and taking out what he needed .
I 've already exposed the weak points of this theory .
What is the individualist alternative ?
COME BACK TOMORROW FOR KEN KNUDSONâ€™S ANSWER .
Printer Friendly Wendy McElroy - Sunday 28 June 2009 - 13:13:03 - Permalink
I am delighted to publish an original essay by friend and Voluntaryist Ken Knudson on the intellectual contradiction that is " communist - anarchism " and the tragic debacle of trying to translate the contradiction into reality .
Wendymcelroy.com blog should be cited with a link back if the essay is quoted or reprinted .
Click on Part I ; click on Part II ; click on Part III : Revolution , The Road to Freedom ? ; click on Part IV Egoism - The Philosophy of Freedom .
NOTE : some of the discussion in this section is politically dated because the essay was written in 1983 .
The theoretical points and commentary , however , remain valid ( or not ) â€ ¦
Again , since I embrace the concept of â€˜property rightsâ€™ , my approach to capitalism varies significantly from Kenâ€ ™sâ€¦even though , like Ken , I vastly prefer the term â€œfree marketâ€  and do not see the two terms as interchangeable .
It should be noted , however , that Kenâ€™s position is far more consistent with that of the 19th century Tuckerite anarchists ; by contrast , I never accepted much of Tuckerâ€™s economic theory , largely due to the influence of Ayn Rand and ( especially ) Murray Rothbard .
The author invites your comments and feedback at menckenfanATgmailDOTcomCAPITALISM : FREEDOM PERVERTEDRoosevelt , in blaming the depression of the ' thirties on " heedless self - interest , " played a cheap political trick for which the world has been suffering ever since .
The great crash of 1929 , far from being created by " free enterprise , " was created by government interference in the free market .
The Federal Reserve Board had been artificially controlling interest rates since 1913 .
The tax structure of the country was set up in such a way as to encourage ridiculously risky speculation in the stock market .
" Protective tariffs " destroyed anything that vaguely resembled a free market .
Immigration barriers prevented the free flow of the labour market .
Anti-trust laws threatened prosecution for charging less than the competition ( " intent to monopolise " ) and for charging the same as the competition ( " price fixing " ) , but graciously permitted charging more than the competition ( commonly called " going out of business . " )
With all these legislative restraints and controls , Roosevelt still had the gall to blame the depression on the " free " market economy .
But what was his answer to the " ruthlessness " of freedom ?
This is what he had to say on taking office in 1933 :
Der Verleger bezeichnete gestern in derdie Presse als " vierte Gewalt " und behauptete , sie sei unverzichtbar für die Demokratie .
Das ist Unsinn .
In Sachen Berichterstattung über das Internet ist die Presse weithin keine vierte Gewalt mehr , sondern ein Lobbyist , der sich unter dem Deckmantel des Journalismus dem Staat andient .
Burdas
Text in der , in dem er Leistungsschutzrechte und noch eine ganze Menge anderer Rechte für die Zeitungsverlage verlangte , ist völlig unverständlich , wenn man nicht die Rede kennt , die Kulturstaatsministervor zwei Wochen auf der Jahreskonferenz der " Initiative Kultur - und Kreativwirtschaft " hielt .
Neumann versprach kleine Geschenke für verschiedene Kreative : so sollen die Schutzfristen ausübender Künstler von 50 auf 70 Jahre verlängert werden und die Mitarbeiter bei Film und Fernsehen leichter Zugang zu Arbeitslosengeld I erhalten .
Aber die fettesten Versprechungen machte er den Zeitungsverlagen .
Zum Beispiel : " In dermuss das Themafür Presseverlage auf die Agenda .
Sie sind bislang mangels ausreichender Rechte an ihren Presseerzeugnissen in weiten Teilen der Verwertungskette nicht in der Lage , ihre Rechtsposition angemessen zu schützen .
Das wollen wir ändern .
" Zwei Wochen später findet Hubert Burda das in dernoch nicht ganz ausreichend .
Er möchte kein einfaches Leistungschutzrecht , sondern ein .
" Nun kann man sagen , dass jede Branche in dieser Zeit großer wirtschaftlicher Veränderungen zu kämpfen hat und sich anpassen muss .
Diese Anpassung besteht insbesondere auch in der Einführung eines weiten Leistungsschutzrechtes , verbunden mit der Transparenz des Internets .
" Um das zu begründen , wird er kurz ein bisschen weinerlich .
Der Schnittmusterverleger nennt seine Produkte ein .
Sie seien unerlässlich für die Demokratie .
Habermas habe das gesagt , ja , Miriam Meckel habe das gesagt .
Ohne Presse keine Demokratie , sagt er .
Aber eigentlich droht er den Politikern im Wahlkampf : OhnePresse keineBurda will ein " weites Leistungsschutzrecht " und " Transparenz des Internets " .
Was ist damit gemeint ?
Dem Leser wird das an keiner Stelle seines Artikels an einem konkreten Beispiel aufgeschlüsselt .
Ein Leistungsschutzrecht für Verlage bedeutet , dass Verlage künftig auch ohne Einverständnis ihrer Autoren - ja sogar gegen den Willen ihrer Autoren - Zitate aus Artikeln in ihren Zeitungen schützen und damit kostenpflichtig machen können .
Diehat das kürzlich in einem zustimmenden Artikel genauer beschrieben : Gegründet werden soll eine " Verwertungsgesellschaft der Verlage .
Eine , die im Netz nach illegaler Nutzung fahndet - und fällige Gebühren eintreibt " .
Nicht für die Verbreitung ganzer Texte , das ist heute schon illegal , sondern für Zitate !
Für denbedeutet das zweierlei : Presseschauen wie die Feuilletonrundschau deswerden künftig kostenpflichtig .
Der Juristhatte im April in der angedeutet , wie weit das erträumte " Recht " gehen soll - bis hin zu" Snippets - also die mit " großem redaktionellen Aufwand erstelltender Artikel " .
Google dürfte keine Überschriften mehr zitieren ohne zu bezahlen .
Und Leser - oder ihre Kinder - die im Netz zum Beispiel in Kommentaren aus Zeitungsartikeln zitieren , werden künftig ebenfalls von den Verlagen zur Kasse gebeten .
Ob zu Recht , kann man dann vor Gericht mit den Anwälten der FAZ ausfechten .
Gegen denführen FAZ und SZ seit Jahren einen Prozess wegen seiner Berichterstattung über ihre Berichterstattung .
Aber wie , fragen
Sie sich vielleicht , soll die Zeitung herausfinden , wer ein Nutzer ist ?
Mittels " Transparenz des Internets " , wie Hubert Burda das nennt .
Kulturstaatssekretär Neumann war da etwas deutlicher : " Wir brauchenzwischen Providern , Rechteinhabern und Verbrauchern . "
Im Klartext : Wenn ein Verlag es fordert , soll der Internetprovider künftig Ihre Daten herausgeben müssen .
Jeder soll im Internet identifiziert werden können .
Das geht nur durch staatliche Kontrolle des Internets .
Das meint Hubert Burda mit " Transparenz im Internet " .
Was will Hubert Burda , wenn er ein " erweitertes Leistungsschutzrecht " fordert ?
Burda fordert für Verlage : " das Recht , im Netz von den Suchmaschinen nach objektiven , nachvollziehbaren Kriterien gefunden zu werden .
Das Recht , an den Erlösen der Suchmaschinen fair und zu überprüfbaren Konditionen zu partizipieren .
Das Recht auf Neutralität der Plattformen .
Und damit verbunden die Garantie , dass Inhalte unserer Transaktionsangebote von Suchmaschinen nicht für eigene Geschäftsmodelle genutzt werden .
Denn genau dies ist zurzeit technisch immer noch möglich .
" Er will , dass auch Suchmaschinen wiestaatlich kontrolliert werden .
Nur so kann man seine Forderung interpretieren , am Erlös der Google - Anzeigen beteiligt zu werden , denn freiwillig wird Google keinen Cent rausrücken .
Google ist ein privatwirtschaftliches Unternehmen .
Es ist nicht im Verlagswesen tätig , sondern in der .
Es organisiert das Netz .
Warum sollte es Verlage an den Erlösen aus dieser Leistung beteiligen ?
Das konnte auch Staatssekretär Neumann nicht erklären .
Aber er war überzeugt : " Es kann nicht angehen , dass ein Privatunternehmen künftig ein Monopol auf diesen essenziellen Teil unserer Kultur hat !
Die digitale Verfügungsgewalt muss in öffentlicher Verantwortung bleiben " , also in Verantwortung des Staates .
Die Vertreter der vierten Gewalt klatschten Beifall .
Hubert Burda behauptet , all diese Maßnahmen seien unumgänglich , um den " Qualitätsjournalismus " und damit die Demokratie zu schützen .
Aber nicht der " Qualitätsjournalismus " ist wichtig für die Demokratie , sondern die Existenz einerPresse .
Die Presse ist aber nur frei , wenn sie von staatlichen Einflüssen unabhängig bleibt .
Doch genau das lehnen Zeitungsverleger jetzt ab : Sie rufen nach dem Staat .
Die Forderungen der Verlage umfassen inzwischen - eine vom Staat anzuschiebende Zwangsgebühr namens - eine staatlicheder Suchmaschinen ( denn auf nichts anderes läuft die Forderung Burdas hinaus ) , - eine vom Staat zu erzwingendeder Anzeigenerlöse der Suchmaschinen , - ein vom Staat zu verabschiedendes , das die Grundvoraussetzung für die Schaffung einer Gema für Onlinetexte wäre .- eine staatlichedes Internets .
Natürlich nur , um die Kulturindustrie vor Piraten zu schützen .
Dies alles wird gefordert nicht zugunsten einer freien Presse , sondern zum Schutz überkommener Geschäftsmodelle .
Die Zeitungen werden schamlos fürbenutzt und sprechen schon damit jeder Form von Qualitätsjournalismus Hohn .
Politiker hören diesen Ruf der Verlage nach dem Staat gern .
Überwachung ist eh ihr Konzept .
In Sachen Internetsperren passte kein Blatt zwischen die großen Zeitungen und .
Die Versuchung für Zeitungsjournalisten war unwiderstehlich , Kinderpornografie mit dem " " ( so die FAZ ) gleichzusetzen und so ein missratenes Gesetz nicht kritisch zu überprüfen , sondern für eigene Zwecke umzumünzen .
Die Verlage scheinen sich ganz sicher zu sein , dass die staatliche Überwachungsmaßnahmen , die sie zur Sicherung ihrer Profite fordern , nie sie selbst betreffen werden .
Wie nah müssen sie sich der Regierung fühlen .
In eigener Sache haben die einstigen Kontrolleure von Parlament , Verwaltung und Rechtsprechung ihren Anspruch aufgegeben , vierte Gewalt zu sein .
Die vierte Gewalt ist jetzt im Netz .
A few months from now , or perhaps 5 - 10 years from now , we will know whether or not EEStor can make good on its promise to sell a electrical storage device capable of propelling a reasonably - sized automobile down a freeway for a couple hundred miles before needing a recharge .
There are some indications that they are making progress and that this could happen , but there are many reasons to remain skeptical .
In this post , I will wade into these waters -- and then get out quickly .
Will EEStor revolutionize motor transportation and more ?
Will it even work ?
The human quest for energy is an interesting topic .
Mostly by burning things , we have transformed our relationship with the planet and each other .
It has been said that we are addicted to oil , but it is more the case that we are addicted to what harnessed energy can do .
As it is learned that some utilization of energy is not sustainable for environmental reasons , or for lack of supply , the natural response is to search for other ways of doing the same activity but with another energy supply .
And conventional economics promises us that something will come along .
In modern times , one of our sacred rights ( or rites ? ) is the ability to drive a 1 - 2 ton vehicle up to a fuel station , fill it up without spending a fortune or more than a few minutes of time , and then drive around at 70 miles per hour without worrying about needing more fuel for awhile .
A car with a battery and an electric motor , for whatever reason , did n't bring us to this present state of mind .
But take away the gasoline ( or diesel ) , and the dream lives on -- even better , because maybe we can skip the trip to the gas station and refuel the car at home .
Zenn Motor Company makes and sells electric cars , and they are clearly appealing to those with this dream :
Imagine a car that was whisper quiet at highway speeds , could go for hundreds of miles and left no trail of emissions behind .
This car would never need to visit a gas station , and would top off its ‘ tank ’ within a few minutes .
The car is electric … and it ’s powered by a revolutionary energy storage system : EEStor ’s EESU ( Electrical Energy Storage Unit ) .
To put this into perspective , imagine a car that enabled guilt - free driving , eliminated dependency on foreign oil and that completely changed transportation as we know it .
Zenn electric car : automotive absolution
Ah yes , " guilt - free driving " .
I wo n't get into that right now .
What is the EEStor EESU ?
The aforementioned EESU is essentially a capacitor which is designed to be charged up and then slowly drained to power an electric vehicle , similar to a battery or fuel cell .
In the simple model below , an external voltage is applied across two conducting plates separated by a small distance , usually with a dielectric or insulator in the gap .
Charge flows until the voltage across the plates equals the applied voltage .
Figure 1 . Charging a capacitor
The charge that is dislocated per volt applied is termed the capacitance .
With the external voltage is removed , the charge remains .
Place an external load across the plates , and current will flow through the load ( providing power ) , with the voltage available decaying with time .
The energy stored by the capacitor is thus a function of the specifics of the capacitor and the voltage to which is is charged .
Typical capacitors found in electronics store very little charge ( or energy ) compared to what is needed to power devices ( not to mention cars ) in continuous operation .
There would seem to be two options a ) find new capacitor technology with a higher capacitance , or b ) ramp up the voltage .
At first glance , it would seem logical to take the latter route , as the energy stored increases with the square of the voltage .
As we will see , it has n't work out that way in practice up to the present .
Most research and development has focused on new materials .
Before continuing , it might be helpful to highlight a few terms used to characterize capacitance :
Capacitance Terms
dielectric : another term for an insulator , which emphasizes the fact that it polarizes in response to an external electric field ( as when placed between the plates of a capacitor connected to a voltage source )
: another term for an insulator , which emphasizes the fact that it polarizes in response to an external electric field ( as when placed between the plates of a capacitor connected to a voltage source ) permittivity : a measure of how much a dielectric can be polarized ( i.e. how it responds to an electric field )
: a measure of how much a dielectric can be polarized ( i.e. how it responds to an electric field ) dielectric constant : the permittivity of a material divided by that of free space ( therefore , dimensionless )
The capacitance is determined by the geometry of the two plates , the distance between them , and the electrical properties ( permittivity ) of the gap material .
For large plates relative to the separation distance , the following approximation can be used :
To make capacitors with large values of C , the most common approach is to ( dramatically ) increase the area .
One way to do this is to employ porous materials with intrinsically large surface areas .
The term ultracapacitor is usually used to characterize such devices which are designed to store a lot of charge .
One common type of ultracapacitor , electrochemical double layer capacitors , utilize high surface area materials and also the charge - storage properties of the interfacial region between the surface and an electrolyte in solution .
An internet search will reveal a wealth of information about recent developments in ultracapacitors .
Why the Fuss About EEStor ?
What has raised much cash and many eyebrows are the stated specifications for the EESU :
52.22 kW-h of energy storage , or 188 MJ
Weight of 281.56 lbs , or 127.71 kg
31,351 capacitors stacked and connected up in parallel , each with dielectric layers of 9.732 micron thickness
Each capacitor layer consists of alumina - coated composition - modified barium titanate ( BaTiO 3 ) powder sandwiched between two thin poly ( ethelene terepthalate ) layers and aluminum electrodes .
The BaTiO 3 has relative permittivity ( dielectric constant ) of 21,072 and the overall dielectric permittivity ( including PET layers and alumina coating ) is 18,543 .
) powder sandwiched between two thin poly ( ethelene terepthalate ) layers and aluminum electrodes .
The BaTiO has relative permittivity ( dielectric constant ) of 21,072 and the overall dielectric permittivity ( including PET layers and alumina coating ) is 18,543 .
Total capacitance of 30.693 Farads , and total volume of 2.628 cubic feet .
Temperature stable to 85 °C and voltage stable to 5000 V , with 0.1 % discharge over 30 days
One million recharge cycles from 0-3500 volts and back again
Can be charged in 3 - 6 minutes
Manufactured by screen printing and sintering
The above information was obtained from the patent which was granted to EEStor , Inc. in December , 2008 ( EEStor has applied for more ) .
The key material , alumina - coated composition - modified barium titanate powder , is made in a process described in a patent application by the same inventors .
The modified powder is then mixed with about 6 % PET and binder and suspended in nitrocellulose resin and solvent for use as a screen printing ink .
The surrounding PET and aluminum layers are also formed via screen printing .
Put the layers down in succession , baking in between until golden brown .
Let cool and then serve .
One thing that catches one 's attention is the excessive number of significant digits in the figures .
What is apparently the case is that the configuration of the overall EESU is designed to match the energy storage density used by the battery in the Tesla .
Measured capacitance values for a proof - of - concept unit ( 100 layers ) were then used to determine the overall requirements for the full unit .
The values for energy storage , volume , and weight translate to energy densities of 1.47 MJ/kg and 2.52 MJ / liter , a 2 - 3 fold improvement over lithium batteries , but still wanting when compared to gasoline ( ~45 MJ/kg and 33 MJ / liter ) .
( Note that , because an internal combustion engine is much less efficient than an electric motor , the comparable values will be perhaps 20 % of these figures . )
As of now , there is a lot of scattered information including this patent and previous filings as well as some apparent verification of some aspects of the manufacturing and materials by supposedly independent experts .
There is also some investors and some negotiated agreements with partners , most prominently Zenn cars ( see the news item bar on the home page ) , and Lockheed Martin .
A lot of initial reaction is detailed in an issue of MIT Technology Review from January 2007 .
Reactions by everyone else run the gamut from giddy true belief to skepticism to accusations of fraud .
For some interesting reading , check out the following discussions :
Sort of a game of " choose your F word " ( fact , feasible , fantasy , fallacy , fiction , fraud , ... ) .
But unlike other controversies that get batted about endlessly , this one would seem to have a clear endpoint : either EEStor can make it or they can't .
Of course , a negative result might take awhile , as exemplified by the example of cold fusion research twenty years from the initial media splash .
In that case , the dream that abundant energy can be obtained quite easily has kept research alive , despite the absence of either clear evidence or a plausible physical explanation .
In contrast , some ideas that " should " work take awhile to become reality because of engineering difficulties .
Conventional fusion - based electricity generation and high - temperature superconductors probably fall into this category .
Which is the case with the EEStor capacitor ?
The Road Less Taken
The principle material used in the EESU , barium titanate , has been of interest for along time .
If you have access to the bound set of the Feynman 's Lecture Series ( 1963 ) , you will find it discussed in depth in Volume 2 , Chapter 11 .
Barium titanate is a common material for both capacitors and actuators ( a related application where an applied voltage deforms a material , allowing precise movement of objects ) .
This article provides a good background on the utility of barium titanate as a dielectric in capacitors in general and in multilayer capacitors in particular .
EEStor 's improvement over what is currently available is an increase in the voltage to which the capacitor ( or a stacked set of capacitors ) can be charged to .
Thus , though the target capacitance of 30 farads listed above is not particularly high in the world of ultracapacitors , by assuming a large voltage , the energy that can be stored goes up considerably ( with the square of the voltage ) .
What is the downside , and why does n't everybody just design for a higher voltage ?
First , high voltages ( 3500 volts ) in many situations would not be practical .
Second , the capacitor has to withstand the voltage applied ( i.e. not break down ) .
But there is one more problem : the simple formula for energy stored in a capacitor assumes that the permittivity of the dielectric is constant .
In practical application , there exists the phenomenon of dielectric saturation .
Getting Saturated
A material with a high permittivity means that it distorts in response to an external electric field .
This can be just a displacement of the electrons with respect to the nuclei , or it can include relative displacements of the nuclei .
In the case of electrochemical double layer capacitors , it also includes relative positions of ions and solvent near the surfaces .
Perovskite oxides ( which includes barium titanates ) have high permittivities because they can , in effect , store a lot of energy by distorting when an electric field is applied .
But there are limits to the amount of distortion possible ; with increases in voltage above a certain point , permittivity begins to decrease , with large changes in voltage moving less and less charge .
Companies have spent a lot of money trying to develop capacitors which do not have this limit , but without success .
( See http://bariumtitanate.blogspot.com/2009/04/intelligibility-of-eestors-re...)
Skeptics have politely mentioned this " feature " of dielectrics in discussions for awhile now , but EEStor and Zenn have recently put out PR which says that independent permittivity tests on EEStor 's barium titanate powders have shown that they support their claims .
Their patent clearly suggests that dielectric saturation is not observed for their samples .
Much of the recent debate is thus about whether this is really plausible , based on a review about is known about BaTiO 3 from prior research or first - principles calculations .
One unabashed enthusiast ( I 'll call him " true believer " , or TB ) has reported that ( according to Zenn and / or EEstor ) their materials are in a particular phase ( paraelectric ) which does not exhibit dielectric saturation at these voltages .
However , there is a paper published which indicates that dielectric saturation does indeed occur in the paraelectric ( cubic ) phase .
Meanwhile , TB from above has contacted the independent tester and found that the voltage used in the test was 1 volt , but that measurements were made at multiple temperatures and there was no observed temperature dependence to the permittivity .
And according to a source of TB , temperature dielectric saturation always accompanies the voltage kind .
Maybe they perhaps have some phase that has n't been seen before .
Even more interesting is TB 's blog post with interview snippets with other researchers in the field .
This snippet is from a discussion with Dr. Eric Cross of Penn State :
B : So your view is EEStor is possibly on to something but the information they have released is not a good body of evidence from which to draw any conclusions .
EC : I would go along with that yes .
I think they have something interesting and they may not know that they have a tiger by the tail .
B : Meaning that the complexity may lie ahead for what they are working on ?
EC : I think that 's true .
One needs to understand in detail what one is doing .
This is an area of extreme interest at the moment .
I can't say more about it .
B : It 's of extreme interest just because of the applications , right ?
Not because there 's some sort of breakthrough ?
I do not understand .
EC : I think these people are scientists and I think they have made an interesting discovery but their explanations of what they have discovered are not reasonable ... which is not to say that what they have discovered is not itself reasonable .
That I wo n’t say any more about it .
A Peaceful Queasy Feeling
As I have looked into what is known about the EEStor technology , and read as much as I could stand , I have gone back and forth as to whether I believe they have indeed created a dielectric material which has the necessary properties to make the EESU function as promised .
It 's hard for me not to root for these guys , as there is something noble about someone striving for 20 years to bring one 's ideas to fruition .
The problem is that , while creative ideas and persistent attention to detail in engineering can solve almost any problem , you are sometimes stuck with what nature hands you .
That they came up with a secret recipe which has eluded so many others sure seems very unlikely -- but not impossible .
Will it work ?
Ask me tomorrow .
At this point , the only people who really know what their technology is and whether they have something that can really be brought to market soon is EEStor ( and they probably do n't either ) .
Everybody else ( including Zenn , until they get one in hand ) is relying on partial information .
But if EEStor succeeds , it will be an amazing scientific and engineering achievement by a couple of people with limited resources .
Seem Warm To You ?
But what if it works ?
Before it can be used in automobiles , many other questions remain -- although many of these apply to electric cars in general .
Where will the electricity for this really come from in the next few years ?
Charging infrastructure ?
Safety ?
Assorted colors ?
Some of these I will reserve for another article .
But I will consider here the issue of safety , which is given scant mention in the EEStor patent .
None of the EESU materials used to fabricate the EESU , which are aluminum , aluminum oxide , copper , composition - modified barium titanate powder , silver - filled epoxy , and poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) plastic will explode when being recharged or impacted .
The inherent danger is not necessarily the risk of explosion , but simply the sudden release of 52 kilowatt - hours of energy if the capacitor self - discharges .
As shown in this illustration from the patent ,
the individual energy storage units ( capacitors ) are connected in parallel such that , at full charge , a potential of 3.5 kV sits across each of the 31,351 units of 10 microns thickness .
Although the dielectric breakdown voltage is sufficiently high such that leakage current is low , there is a finite probability that a stress fracture from impact due to an accident or a manufacturing defect propogated as the EESU ages results in electrical breakdown in one of the units .
If this occurs , all of the energy stored in the EESU ( 52 kilowatt - hours ) could potentially be released in a very short period .
It is somewhat disingenuous to stress the large amount of energy which can be stored in the device and the rapidity of charging and discharging without acknowledging the downside of these .
In a rapid electrical breakdown of the device , the stored energy would essentially result in the instantaneous generation of a vast amount of heat .
For example , the EESU is made primarily of barium titanate , which has a heat capacity of 434 J / kg - K .
The 52 kW - hr released will heat the 280 lb unit to about 3400°C .
Of course , it would probably start heating up everything around it before it got that hot .
One ton of steel ( with about the same value for heat capacity ) would heat up to 460°C .
Best to get out fast .
There are possibly ways to deal with this risk , but preferably not the Ford Pinto strategy .
In any case , an extensive testing phase is warranted to assess both damage and age - related risk for a catastrophic self - discharge event .
Crash - test dummies are cheaper than lawyers .

Producing hydrogen from urine
You do two things at motorway services : fill up one tank and empty another .
US chemists have combined refuelling your car and relieving yourself by creating a new catalyst that can extract hydrogen from urine .
Chemistry World reports that the catalyst could not only fuel the hydrogen - powered cars of the future , but could also help clean up municipal wastewater .
Gerardine Botte of Ohio University uses an electrolytic approach to produce hydrogen from urine – the most abundant waste on Earth – at a fraction of the cost of producing hydrogen from water .
Urine ’s major constituent is urea , which incorporates four hydrogen atoms per molecule – importantly , less tightly bonded than the hydrogen atoms in water molecules .
Botte uses electrolysis to break the molecule apart , developing an inexpensive new nickel - based electrode to selectively and efficiently oxidise the urea .
To break the molecule down , a voltage of 0.37V needs to be applied across the cell – much less than the 1.23V needed to split water .
Her work is described in the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Chemical Communications .
“ During the electrochemical process the urea gets adsorbed on to the nickel electrode surface , which passes the electrons needed to break up the molecule , ” Botte told Chemistry World .
Botte believes the technology could be easily scaled - up to generate hydrogen while cleaning up the effluent from sewage plants .
“ We do not need to reinvent the wheel as there are already electrolysers being used in different applications . ”

On his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh defended Germany for the Holocaust by saying that Obama is ripping Germany to shreds for something they did 60 years ago , one day after praising all of Islam .
Rush is saying that the Holocaust should be forgotten about .
I guess the killing of 6 million Jews is n’t as important to him as painting Obama as a Muslim lover .
Here is the audio from Media Matters :

Limbaugh said , “ He is beating Germany up .
He is ripping them to shreds over something they did 60 years ago .
One day after praising all of Islam .
Now can you imagine , there ’s of course Elie Wiesel gets up there and he does his thing but it ’s 65 years here or close to it …
He ’s up there and he ’s ripping Germany for what it did 60 or 65 years ago , blah , blah , blah , blah .
One day after praising to the hilt Islam , and talking about Islam , how America is a Muslim nation , so forth . ”
Limbaugh is saying that Holocaust is no big deal anymore , because it happened almost 70 years ago .
We should forget about it all .
I watched Obama ’s speech and I did n’t see any of the animosity between Merkel and Obama that Rush claimed existed .
Limbaugh also managed to dismiss Elie Wiesel ’s Nobel Peace Prize winning work and his lifetime of effort to make sure that the Holocaust is never forgotten .
According to Limbaugh we should tell all of the Holocaust survivors to get over it .
It is ancient history .
Did you ever notice that these right wing radio hosts are infatuated with the Nazis ?
Every day Limbaugh , Beck , or Savage seems to make a comparison to either fascism or the Nazis .
It is almost a collective obsession with the right wing .
It is statements like this from that prove Al Franken correct .
Rush Limbaugh really is a big fat idiot .
U.S. Army Releases June Suicide Data
By Gilbert Mercier , NEWS JUNKIE POST
Today , the US Army released suicide data for the month of June .
Among active - duty soldiers there were no confirmed suicides and nine potential ones .
In May , the Army reported one confirmed suicide and 16 potential suicides .
Since that time seven have been confirmed and nine remain under investigation .
So far , there have been 88 reported active - duty suicides in the Army for 2009 .
Of these , 54 have been confirmed , and 34 are pending determination of the cause of death .
For the same period in 2008 , there were 67 confirmed suicides .
During June 2009 , among reserve soldiers not on active duty , there were no confirmed suicide and two potential suicides .
To date , among that same group there have been 16 confirmed suicides and 23 potential suicides currently under investigation .
For the same period in 2008 , there were 29 confirmed suicides among reserve soldiers not on active duty .
The Director of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force , Brigadier General Colleen McGuire stated :
“ Every soldier suicide is different and tragic in its own way .
Our current research and prevention efforts are identifying common denominators that lead soldiers to take their own life .
It is often the combination of many factors that overwhelm an individual .
Although suicide can impact anyone , we are finding that male soldiers , in combat - arms occupational specialties , between the age of 18 and 27 are more vulnerable .
That is why we are looking at existing programs & other institutional safety nets to see what works , and what need to be changed to enhance the support network of trained leaders and behavioral health - care who can identify and treat risk factors before young soldiers get to the point where they feel there is no way out . ”
In most organizations , the salary list is a tightly guarded secret .
But in President Obama ’s White House , it is posted on the website .
For the Washington obsessed , the information posted Wednesday afternoon is full of fascinating factoids .
For example , the best known aides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue – Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , senior adviser David Axelrod , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs – are not the best paid .
That distinction goes to David Marcozzi , the president ’s director of public health policy , who makes $ 192,934 a year .
His home agency is the Department of Health and Human Services and he is a “ detailee ” at the White House .
The lofty " assistant to " title
After Mr. Marcozzi , the next best paid are National Security Adviser James Jones and 21 who carry the title Assistant to the President .
Members of this group – including Messrs Emanuel , Axelrod , Gibbs – make $ 172,200 .
That is the same salary as former President Bush ’s top aides .
Mr. Obama promised to freeze White House salaries above $ 100,000 when he came into office , paying his top staffers staff at the same level as President Bush in his final year .
Total salary cost comparisons between the Obama and Bush White Houses are difficult , because President Obama has released more information on compensation than his predecessor .
He also appears to have a bigger staff than Bush .
Hotline ’s On Call blog calculates that the Obama administration is spending about $ 5.1 million more on staff in 2009 than the Bush administration did in 2008 .
Working for the love of it
At the low end , two staffers are listed as receiving no pay .
They are Michael Warren , a senior adviser for economics in the department of personnel , and Patricia McGinnis , who is listed simply as an adviser .
For those who are being paid , the lowest salary is $ 36,000 .
The $ 172,200 assistant to the president pay level goes to individuals with a wide range of experience , the Washington Post notes .
They range in age from 28 - year - old Jonathan Favreau , the president 's director of speechwriting to Mr. Jones , a 66 - year - old retired general .
It pays to work for the president
And , not surprisingly , who you work for makes a difference in your paycheck .
The press secretary to First Lady Michelle Obama is paid $ 80,000 .
The press secretary to the President makes $ 172,200 and Gibbs 's deputies make $ 113,000 .
Many White
House workers labor long hours for modest pay in return for the thrill of being where the action is .
As Michael Shear writes in the Washington Post ’s “ 44 ” blog , “ The vast bulk of the employees appear to earn between $ 40,000 and $ 55,000 per year , making the White House quite a modestly paid enterprise for most of the workaholics who spend time there . ”
The president himself makes $ 400,000 .
The vice president , $ 227,300 .

It 's almost embarrassing what they will try to spin as " good " economic news these days .
( Bloomberg ) --
Home prices saw a “ striking improvement in the rate of decline ” in April and trading in funds launched today indicates investors believe the U.S. housing slump is nearing a bottom , said Yale University economist Robert Shiller .
“ At this point , people are thinking the fall is over , ” Shiller , co-founder of the home price index that bears his name , said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today .
“ The market is predicting the declines are over . ”
“ My guess would be that home prices are going to level off -- they ’re not going to keep falling , ” Shiller said in a separate interview with Bloomberg Television .
Wow !
That sounds wonderful !
So what is this incredible news about housing that has caused such a stir ?
While the Standard & Poor 's / Case - Shiller index of 20 major cities tumbled by 18.1 percent , it marked the third straight month the decline was not a record .
Uh ... so the fact that the losses are no longer historical records is supposed to be " wonderful " news ?
Now a punch in the mouth may be better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick , but I do n't consider either to be a sign of good things to come .
The index decreased 18.1 percent from a year earlier following an 18.7 percent drop in March .
Economists predicted the index would drop 18.6 percent , according to the median of 33 responses in a survey conducted by Bloomberg .
The measure fell 19 percent in January , the most since the data began in 2001 .
If you really wanted to get back to reality , a change of less than 1 % is really nothing more than statistical noise in the margins .
In an election , which has more reliable results than a housing survey , 1 % will draw a call for a recount .
These efforts by the financial media amount to nothing more than putting lipstick on a pig .
No one argues that the staggering deficits run up by the American government in a bid to rescue the economy are desirable , healthy or even sustainable  not if the national debt continues to swell at its current pace .
But considerable debate centers on when and how vigorously to start easing off Washington ’s borrowing habit , with substantial risks at both extremes .
Pull back on government spending now , the argument runs , and condemn an already hobbled American economy to years of mass joblessness and anguish .
Indeed , some economists are already arguing that with unemployment near double digits , the government must consider giving another dose of stimulus spending now , despite the fact that this will add to the deficit .
Keep spending with abandon , goes the counterargument , and invite the possibility of a debt crisis with spiking interest rates , crippling inflation and a plunging dollar .
Those arguing for tighter federal spending to contain the budget deficit contend the nation has already borrowed so much money that the people who have lent it may get spooked and abruptly refuse to supply more .
Online music site Pandora has been saved from closure after the music and internet industries finally reached a deal over royalty rates .
It ’s a major boost for the online radio industry , though there ’s still a significant disparity between online and over - the - air radio .
Online radio in the US is governed by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and operates under legally mandated royalty rates .
In early 2007 , the panel of judges which sets these rates decided on a steep rise which would take royalties from 0.08 cents to 0.19 cents per song starting next year .
These seemingly tiny sums mount up : in Pandora ’s case , it would have taken the proportion of its revenue which it had to spend on royalties from just under 30 % to around 70 % , making the business financially unviable .
After a lengthy debate , which included Pandora and other online stations successfully lobbying Congress for extra time to iron out a deal , the record industry has agreed to a plan .
As might be expected from such intense negotiations , it ’s a far from simple compromise .
The key points are that online streaming services earning more than $ 1.25 million a year will either pay royalties of 0.093 cents per song ( rising gradually to 0.14 cents in 2014 ) , or a flat rate of 25 % of revenue , whichever is the higher figure .
Smaller firms wo n’t pay per-song revenues and will usually pay a smaller percentage of royalties , though some firms may pay based on their overall costs .
The deal only applies to sites which solely deal in streaming music and do n’t sell other goods or services .
In theory , internet firms do n’t have to sign up to the deal and are open to attempt separate negotiations .
However , assuming the deal gets Congressional approval ( which appears likely ) , any firm has an automatic right to sign up for the new rates and can then operate without fear of the music industry pursuing them for extra cash .
As Pandora will likely wind up having to pay the per-song royalties , it ’s introducing user fees for the first time .
Users will still be allowed free accounts , but these will be limited to 40 hours per month .
Those who want to exceed this limit – which around 10 per cent of users currently do – will have to pay a 99 c fee each month .
Despite the deal likely saving his business , Pandora owner Tim Westergren remains disgruntled that internet radio stations must pay royalties while over - the - air stations do n’t pay any fees to music companies .
He ’s still lobbying for a system by which all types of radio pay the same royalties .

Limbaugh Warns Of Third Obama Term
Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh wonders if President Obama is laying the foundation to " serve beyond 2016 . "
Transcript below .
You have to wonder if Obama is just trying to lay a foundation for not being a hypocrite when he tries to serve beyond 2016 .
I would n't be at all surprised if in the next number of years there is a move on the 22nd Amendment , which term limits the President of the United States .
He may not do it that way , he may not openly try to change the Constitution .
But there might be this movement in the country from his cult - like followers to support the notion that a democratically - elected leader who is loved and adored has carte blanc once elected .
Just serve as long as he wants because the people demand it , because the people want it , because the people love it .
And I would n't put it past Obama to be plotting right now how to serve beyond 2016 and I think the way he 's reacting to what 's happening in Honduras - Look , they 've got a constitution , they 're a democratically - elected set of officials down there and you had a guy running the country , Mel Zelaya , who was just going to basically rip that country 's democracy to shreds and the country moved in to stop in him from doing it and Obama sides with the guy who wanted to rip up the constitution .
He sides with other dictators in the region .
Regardless , I mean , one thing is clear here : Obama is nothing if not a hardcore liberal .
Always , always more sympathetic , appearing to side with the bad guys on the world stage .
And I 'll tell you folks , this business about running beyond 2016 , you know , the thing that when you look at Obama 's followers - and we 've discussed it here - they are a cult - like bunch and their attachment to him is not political , it 's not ideological , it is not issue - wise , it is cultish .
It includes a wide percentage of minorities , by the way , who for different reasons , who will come to think that he simply cannot be replaced .
Let him succeed with amnesty , for example , and all the illegal aliens who are instantly made citizens .
He 'll be too important .
Just like right now he 's too big to fail as far as the drive - bys are concerned , he 's too important to be replaced .
No one else can lead the nation , they will say .
And they wo n't care a whit about the legalities that might be trampled .
Half of the legalities if they do n't even know about them because they have n't been properly educated .
I think this situation in Honduras is very instructive .
Anybody who thinks that he intends to just constitutionally go away in 2016 is nuts ...
These are people who seek power for reasons other than to serve .
They seek to rule .
Real Clear Politics Video now has comments .
Click the " Comments " link below or click here to comment on this article .
There are things that happen in the world that are bad , and you want to do something about them .
You have a just cause .
But our culture is so war prone that we immediately jump from , " This is a good cause " to " This deserves a war . "
You need to be very , very comfortable in making that jump .
The American Revolution - independence from England - was a just cause .
Why should the colonists here be occupied by and oppressed by England ?
But therefore , did we have to go to the Revolutionary War ?
How many people died in the Revolutionary War ?
Nobody ever knows exactly how many people die in wars , but it 's likely that 25,000 to 50,000 people died in this one .
So let 's take the lower figure - 25,000 people died out of a population of three million .
That would be equivalent today to two and a half million people dying to get England off our backs .
You might consider that worth it , or you might not .
Canada is independent of England , is n't it ?
I think so .
Not a bad society .
Canadians have good health care .
They have a lot of things we do n't have .
They did n't fight a bloody revolutionary war .
Why do we assume that we had to fight a bloody revolutionary war to get rid of England ?
In the year before those famous shots were fired , farmers in Western Massachusetts had driven the British government out without firing a single shot .
They had assembled by the thousands and thousands around courthouses and colonial offices and they had just taken over and they said goodbye to the British officials .
It was a nonviolent revolution that took place .
But then came Lexington and Concord , and the revolution became violent , and it was run not by the farmers but by the Founding Fathers .
The farmers were rather poor ; the Founding Fathers were rather rich .
Who actually gained from that victory over England ?
It 's very important to ask about any policy , and especially about war :
Who gained what ?
And it 's very important to notice differences among the various parts of the population .
That 's one thing were not accustomed to in this country because we do n't think in class terms .
We think , " Oh , we all have the same interests . "
For instance , we think that we all had the same interests in independence from England .
We did not have all the same interests .
Do you think the Indians cared about independence from England ?
No , in fact , the Indians were unhappy that we won independence from England , because England had set a line - in the Proclamation of 1763 - that said you could n't go westward into Indian territory .
They did n't do it because they loved the Indians .
They did n't want trouble .
When Britain was defeated in the Revolutionary War , that line was eliminated , and now the way was open for the colonists to move westward across the continent , which they did for the next 100 years , committing massacres and making sure that they destroyed Indian civilization .
So when you look at the American Revolution , there 's a fact that you have to take into consideration .
Indians - no , they did n't benefit .
Did blacks benefit from the American Revolution ?

Slavery was there before .
Slavery was there after .
Not only that , we wrote slavery into the Constitution .
We legitimized it .
What about class divisions ?
Did ordinary white farmers have the same interest in the revolution as a John Hancock or Morris or Madison or Jefferson or the slaveholders or the bondholders ?
Not really .
It was not all the common people getting together to fight against England .
They had a very hard time assembling an army .
They took poor guys and promised them land .
They browbeat people and , oh yes , they inspired people with the Declaration of Independence .
It 's always good , if you want people to go to war , to give them a good document and have good words : life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
Of course , when they wrote the Constitution , they were more concerned with property than life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
You should take notice of these little things .
There were class divisions .
When you assess and evaluate a war , when you assess and evaluate any policy , you have to ask :
Who gets what ?
We were a class society from the beginning .
America started off as a society of rich and poor , people with enormous grants of land and people with no land .
And there were riots , there were bread riots in Boston , and riots and rebellions all over the colonies , of poor against rich , of tenants breaking into jails to release people who were in prison for nonpayment of debt .
There was class conflict .
We try to pretend in this country that we 're all one happy family .
We 're not .
And so when you look at the American Revolution , you have to look at it in terms of class .
Do you know that there were mutinies in the American Revolutionary Army by the privates against the officers ?
The officers were getting fine clothes and good food and high pay and the privates had no shoes and bad clothes and they were n't getting paid .
They mutinied .
Thousands of them .
So many in the Pennsylvania line that George Washington got worried , so he made compromises with them .
But later when there was a smaller mutiny in the New Jersey line , not with thousands but with hundreds , Washington said execute the leaders , and they were executed by fellow mutineers on the order of their officers .
The American Revolution was not a simple affair of all of us against all of them .
And not everyone thought they would benefit from the Revolution .
We 've got to rethink this question of war and come to the conclusion that war cannot be accepted , no matter what the reasons given , or the excuse : liberty , democracy ; this , that .
War is by definition the indiscriminate killing of huge numbers of people for ends that are uncertain .
Think about means and ends , and apply it to war .
The means are horrible , certainly .
The ends , uncertain .
That alone should make you hesitate .
Once a historical event has taken place , it becomes very hard to imagine that you could have achieved a result some other way .
When something is happening in history it takes on a certain air of inevitability :
This is the only way it could have happened .
No .
We are smart in so many ways .
Surely , we should be able to understand that in between war and passivity , there are a thousand possibilities .
Most expensive cars in the world – what are they and how much do they cost ?
We ’ve gathered a collection from 10 most expensive autos all over the world – …
Here ’s why I ca n’t stand Jews .
They ’re boring .
They keep complaining about being oppressed .
They keep talking about the same damn things all the time — Holocaust this and Israel that .
They always claim they ’re victims .
They only constitute a small percentage of Americans — probably because they can’t win over any converts .
They still complain about how state Constitutions bar them from holding office — really , only six of them do — even though the Supreme Court has said those provisions are unenforceable .
They want affirmative action for their kind — one representative from the “ pity - poor - me ” school of Jews even said they need “ safe spaces ” at colleges !
They assume everyone who does n’t agree with them is “ beyond stupid . ”
They never want to take on the serious arguments that theologians have made in favor of the Christian god .
Some Jews think Jesus never even existed .
So what do they know ?
They ’re not rational .
They ’re just angry .
Angry because they think the world is unfair to them .
Angry that someone forced them to go to church as a child .
Some Jews are so angry , they sued the government to prevent a Christian prayer from being spoken at President Obama ’s inauguration .
The gall !
Now … if I actually believed that , I ’d be called every name in the book .
And rightfully so .
Those are ignorant , bigoted , hateful remarks .
They ’re also wildly stereotypical and extremely inaccurate .
When Charlotte Allen says the exact same things about atheists , however , she gets published in the Los Angeles Times .
I ’ve been staring at this article for a while … partly wondering what was going through Allen ’s head , and partly wondering why the LA Times would publish such garbage .
There ’s one up side to the piece , though :
If Allen can get crap like this published , it gives every other aspiring author hope .
Sam Harris often posts articles that mention his name on his website without comment .
When he posted this one , he felt a need to add one statement :
[ Harris ’ Note :
This is , without a doubt , one of the most embarrassingly stupid attacks on the “ new atheists ” to be published in a major newspaper . ]
I await Allen ’s response about how Harris is just letting out his atheist anger …

" iPhone is much more powerful than Wii " - Telltale Games Developer puts Tales of Monkey Island framerate issues down to WiiWare restrictions
Kath Brice Thursday 30th July 2009
Share this article Share
Companies in this article Telltale Inc .
The iPhone is a more powerful platform than Nintendo's Wii , and frame rate issues experienced in the Wii version of Tales of Monkey Island are down to hardware and file size restrictions , according to a Telltale Games developer .
Complaints over frame rate issues in the WiiWare version of the game on the developer 's official forums triggered the response from a TellTale programmer going under the name of Yare , reports GameZine .
" The voices and textures are the way they are because we 're limited to 40 megs for WiiWare titles , " he stated .
"
The PC versions of our games are usually 150 + megs , and most modern games range anywhere from one to ten gigabytes or more .
Talk to Nintendo about this one .
" Frame rate issues will probably get sorted out eventually , but keep in mind that the Wii is just not a powerful console .
An iPhone is much more powerful than a Wii , even . "
In a later post , the alleged representative said he stood by his comments , adding :
" The Wii and DS are extremely underpowered and their popularity does n't remove the hardware limitations . "
Even with the technical issues it experienced on Wii , Tales of Monkey Island has been one of Telltale 's most successful launches , as Telltale founder Dan Connors told VideoGamer .
" It s been pretty shocking how much love there is still out there for the Monkey Island series .
It seems like a generational thing as well .
" Unfortunately I cant get into the specific numbers , but I would definitely say its our strongest performing franchise to date .
We re pretty excited .
It was number one on Steam for a few days .
It did really well .
It s been our best performing title from our side as well . "
Here are some quick tips to help you sleep more soundly :
1 . Do n’t do anything else in bed , but sleep .
Use reading or T.V. watching as a way to help you fall asleep , but if you find yourself making your way through chapters or the late night movie then do those activities out of bed .
2 . Do n’t hang out in bed in the mornings .
Jump out of bed in the morning .
Even on the weekends –
This way your body will get used to waking up right away and associate the bed with only sleepy moments .
Again avoid reading the Times on Sunday mornings in bed , since your body will come to associate the bed with feeling relaxed but not necessarily sleeping .
3. Count Sheep !
Or invest in the modern day version .
Get a white noise machine and FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION SOLELY on that sound .
If you find yourself getting distracted , then challenge your attention .
This activity alone will tire out your brain and help you to fall asleep .
4 . Slow down your breathing and allow your stomach to expand when you inhale and relax when you exhale .
( See my post in breathing on specific instruction ) .
Diaphragmatic breathing done in this manner and at the rate of approximately 5 - 6 breaths a minute is not only associated with positive health benefits also induces sleep .
5 . Invest a little time and money .
If you have trouble falling asleep , due to anxiety then think about taking your breathing training a bit further .
Invest in a biofeedback device or see a behavior specialist .
Commit to 15 minutes of proper breathing training daily during the day .
This will calm your nervous system and teach your body a new way to respond to stress and help you to fall asleep faster in addition to releasing you from anxiety .
6 . Change your priorities !
Make sleep a priority .
Schedule your bedtime and commit to it .
If you do n’t fall asleep on time , DON ’T allow yourself extra time in the morning to make up for it .
The idea is to create a consistent bedtime so that your body learns to respond to your new cycle and not let the cycle lead your body .
7. Experiment to see where you benefit .
If you sleep 6 hours now , try 7 and see how you feel .
If you sleep 7 , try 8 hours a night for 2 weeks and see what happens .
There are plenty of reasons to honor your sleep , see where you feel you benefit most .
Track your mood , energy level , weight , skin appearance , etc for 2 week to assess the immediate benefits .
8. Create a sleep zone with lavender oils .
The tone of the room should emulate a place of rest and rejuvenation .
Use lavender oils or scented pillows to elicit other pathways to the sleep response .
Smell is a very primitive response , thus we respond to it without much thought .
Take advantage of that !
9 . Workout the 1st thing in the am .
I know most people hate this idea or think it ’s impossible , but it will change your energy level throughout the day and help you fall asleep faster at night .
Plus if you workout in the am you can be sure that your lifestyle wo n’t get in the way of your daily routine .
10 . Challenge your self to stay awake .
– if you really cannot fall asleep go with the paradoxical approach - try to stay awake and active .
Challenge yourself to read a full chapter in a novel .
Do n’t take naps the next day if you are tired .
Eventually your body will give in to the rhythm !

Well , folks , we ’ve got our first look at Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger in the new version of A Nightmare on Elm Street .
It ’s a darkly lit pic and you can’t really see his face at all , but it ’s something , is n’t it ?
Frankly , I think it looks pretty cool .
It ’s really got the spirit of the flicks ( the better ones , anyway ) down to a tee , and it ’s nice and creepy to boot .
Haley was already a pretty inspired choice for the part .
Maybe this one wo n’t be too shabby !
Thoughts ?
UPDATE !!!
Now we ’ve got us a brand spankin ’ new poster for the movie and to be honest , I think it looks pretty damn cool !
All this really bodes well .
Platinum Dunes might just have a winner on their hands .
( God knows it ’s better than what they did to Jason Vorhees . )
In his morning note today , Gluskin Sheff ’s David Rosenberg argues not only that stocks are n’t cheap today , but that the lows we hit back in March were n’t , well , very low .
… This notion that we had moved to Armageddon lows in equities [ back in March ] does not seem to hold water .
After all , the forward P/E multiple on the S&P 500 at the lows was 11.7 x .
That was not a multi- decade low or some massive standard - deviation figure — we were actually lower than that at the October 1990 lows when the multiple was 10.5 x and frankly , coming off the 1987 collapse , the forward P/E had compressed to 9.8x .
As it now stands , the multiple is back very close to where it was at the October 2007 market high , when the multiple had expanded to 15.0 x .
The range on the forward P/E over the last quarter - century is between 9.8 x and 21.8 x ( excluding the tech bubble ) , so at 14.5 x currently , it is hardly the case that this market can be viewed as a bargain .
… With the U.S. government now putting its fingers into more than one - third of the economy ( health , finance , autos , energy , housing ) , one would expect that the fair - value multiple in the future will be lower than it has been — given the implications for productivity and the potential non-inflationary growth potential .
The parent company of Liverpool FC , owned by Tom Hicks and George Gillett , lost £ 42.6 m in the year to August 2008 .
The loss was mainly due to the £ 36 m of interest payments that Kop Football Holdings had to make to service the debt taken on to buy the club .
Its auditors warned that the need to refinance loans by 24 July cast " significant doubt " on the future of the group as a going concern .
But they added the club 's owners were confident they would secure the funds .
The US owners bought Liverpool in February 2007 , promising to build a new stadium .
Player sales
In their accounts , they say they are " committed to building a new stadium and actively seeking funding to complete the project " .
But they admit that " the opening of the new stadium will be delayed until 2012 " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The parent company 's loss came despite the £ 10.2 m pre-tax profit reported by the football club in the same period .
The profit was helped by increased television revenues and the sale of players such as Peter Crouch , John Arne Riise and Scott Carson .
The results for the parent company showed net debt on 31 July 2008 of £ 300m .

The trail , picked up by a special cybercrime unit of the French Interior Ministry , led to a French computer specialist , Alain Quiros .
He was caught in Mohammedia , Morocco , and questioned by French and Moroccan officials there ( It is not clear from the case file exactly when ) .
Mr. Quiros initially denied any knowledge of the lab hacking , but when presented with incriminating evidence found on his computer , he confessed , telling investigators he had been paid € 2,000 to € 3,000 , or $ 2,800 to $ 4,000 , for hacking into the lab .
He identified Thierry Lorho , head of Kargus Consultants , a corporate intelligence company in Paris , as having instigated the computer attack .
Then things got complicated .
As the French authorities delved more deeply into Mr. Quiros ’s computer , they found a copy of the hard drive of Yannick Jadot , the former campaign director of Greenpeace France , as well as that of Frédérik - Karel Canoy , a French lawyer and shareholder rights activist who has battled some of the country ’s largest companies , including Vivendi and European Aeronautic Defense & Space , the parent of the aircraft manufacturer Airbus .
Mr. Lorho , a former French intelligence agent , acknowledged his role to the French officials .
He told them that he had handed off the lab data to another man , Jean - François Dominguez , who had paid him for it .
Both men are being formally investigated .
Mr. Lorho also admitted that he had collected data on Greenpeace .
His client that time , he said , was Électricité de France , which had paid him for “ strategic intelligence ” on anti-nuclear campaigners .
Mr. Lorho has said his contacts at E.D.F. were “ perfectly aware ” of the hacking and that such activities were understood to be included under the two one - year contracts he signed with the company .
One , signed in April 2004 , paid Mr. Lorho ’s company € 12,000 a month ; a second , signed in November 2006 , provided for € 3,900 a month .
The investigation found that in addition to information on Greenpeace in France , E.D.F. obtained data on the environmental organization ’s activities in Spain , Belgium and Britain , where E.D.F. last year agreed to buy the largest nuclear power company there , British Energy .

Afghanistan
29 July 2009
Orders are given before every operation .
The orders filter down through various unit levels involved , until each platoon finally recieves its specific mission .
The concept for this mission came down from the 2 Rifles Battlegroup ( battalion ) to the companies , including elements of the Afghan National Army and their British counterparts from the Welsh Guard , and down to each 2 Rifles platoon involved .
So for any mission there might be literally dozens ( or more ) orders and rehearsals until each man and woman knows the perceived enemy situaton , their specific tasks , and much more .
While soldiers here at FOB Jackson received orders , undoubtedly pilots and others , stationed far away , perhaps on an aircraft carrier or even farther afield , were finalizing related plans .
On 23 July , the afternoon before the mission , a call came into headquarters that two British soldiers had been wounded by two IEDs , and that the American helicopter medevacs known as “ Pedro ” had been called to extract the casualties .
Pedro is a potent morale booster ; British soldiers know that their American brethren in the medevac helicopters will come for them anytime anywhere , guns blazing if needed .
Medevac is dangerous work ; earlier this month , a bomb detonated , killing and wounding soldiers from 2 Rifles , and when they moved to prepare for medevac , another bomb exploded .
In all , five soldiers were killed and many wounded .
Yet the soldiers know that if they can get their buddies while still alive onto Pedro , chances for survival are dramatically increased .
In addition to carrying outstanding medical crew , Pedro would roar back to Camp Bastion ’s first - rate trauma center in about fifteen minutes .
Night or day , gunfight or not , Pedro will be there .
After breakfast , the soldiers pulled on their body armor and what seemed like dozens of sorts of weapons : rockets of various sorts , different types of machine guns and rifles , grenade launchers with odd sorts of grenades , hand grenades , pistols , knives , radios ( probably most deadly of all ) and lots of attitude .
A few soldiers smoked last cigarettes and then we trod on foot into some of the most bomb - laden stretches of Afghanistan .
Everyone wore night vision gear , but it was so dark that I left the PVS - 14 flipped up , on standby mode , and used what little ambient light was there .
The camera was nearly useless ( as the shot above will attest ) , but in fact the enhancement below shows the eerie apparition of the soldier as we headed into the battlefield .
With water crossings ahead and the darkness , the camera was better stowed in the waterproof bag inside the rucksack , so was soon tucked away .
This is an active battlefield — even as I write these words on 27 July an Apache is firing down with its 30 mm ( killing four Taliban ) nearby and combat occurs many times per day — and so this mission can only be described in general terms .
In broad strokes , the mission on 24 July was to bait the enemy to take certain actions , and there were multiple moving parts to our side , making it difficult for the enemy to keep track of our combat elements .
Though we would leave obvious boot tracks through fields and neighborhoods , our units split and went here and there , and so despite that the enemy had home field advantage , we could still achieve relative surprise for at least short periods .
As the soldiers quietly sweated and moved through the darkness , dogs barked in the night ; the canines sometimes go nuts at quiet but high - pitched emanations from the metal detectors .
Other sections pushed forward and entered a compound where more than a half dozen Afghan women and girls were sleeping in the open on a raised platform , under the Milky Way , where it was cool .
The lights inside bathed the compound with an amber glow .
The interpreter explained our situation to the women and girls , who hardly seemed startled and not the least bit afraid .
Everyone knows that women and children will be treated well , and I kept the camera mostly out of sight and away from the women .
The British soldiers stayed away from the open area where the women and girls just watched us from the platform , though a couple of them seemed to fall back asleep .
FDA Slaps Strong Warning on Darvon , Darvocet
The agency warns of a fatal overdose risk but still allows the drug on shelves .
WASHINGTON , July 8 , 2009  -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has called for a boxed warning of overdose risk on packages of Darvon , Darvocet and other painkillers containing the drug propoxyphene -- but it will not order their withdrawal from the market .
The agency ordered manufacturers to study higher - than - expected fatality rates in propoxyphene overdoses compared with other painkillers -- and possible toxic effects on the heart in when consumers exceed recommended doses .
However , the FDA rejected a petition from the consumer group Public Citizen calling for phased withdrawal of these products .
In its action , announced during a press briefing on Tuesday , the agency rejected the advice of its own advisory panel , which voted 14 - 12 for a ban on propoxyphene products because of overdose risk and doubts about their painkilling effectiveness .
Propoxyphene is an opioid painkiller chemically similar to methadone .
Some pain specialists , such as Dr. Lloyd Saberski of the Yale - New Haven Hospital in Connecticut , criticize propoxyphene as a weak narcotic with no place on the shelf .
" There is no legitimate medical advantage to keeping propoxyphene available , " Saberski said .
" You are much better off using small amounts of a potent narcotic ; there will be little in the way of side effects . "
Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , defended propoxyphene as an effective combination treatment option that goes beyond the strength of acetaminophen -- commonly known by the brand name Tylenol -- alone .
" All current pharmacologic options for pain have significant liability , " she said in a media briefing .
" Given the data currently available to FDA , propoxyphene is an acceptable choice for the treatment of mild to moderate pain when it 's taken as directed . "
Today 's announcement comes just a week after an FDA advisory panel recommended a black box warning for prescription products containing acetaminophen .
That panel also voted by a narrow margin to recommend that the FDA pull prescription acetaminophen - containing analgesics from the market .
Experts Split on Darvon , Darvocet
Propoxyphene - containing analgesics may have fewer adverse effects than other options for mild to moderate pain in older patients when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are inappropriate , said Dr. Sharon Hertz , also of the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research .
She said they do n't have the same constipation risk as codeine - containing agents or the confusion and sedation risk of painkillers containing hydrocodone .
She also noted that the American Geriatrics Society has discouraged use of NSAIDs in the elderly .
This assessment drew sharp remarks from Dr. Sidney Wolfe , acting president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen .
" The agency has decided to allow the continued marketing of a drug with the most patient - unfavorable ratio of risks of any drug I have ever seen , " Wolfe said .
" We will either appeal this anti-public health decision to the new FDA commissioner or argue in federal court that the decision was arbitrary and capricious . "
In its decision , the FDA opted to mitigate the risks of propoxyphene while keeping the option open for patients .
The agency will require manufacturers to provide a medication guide with all prescriptions and refills stressing the importance of taking the drugs as directed to reduce overdose risk .
In addition , Woodcock said there are plans underway with the Medicare and Veterans Administration systems to conduct additional studies , including one that involves the safety and prescribing patterns of propoxyphene among the elderly , specifically with regard to the rates of fatalities and hip fractures .
The FDA will also analyze a review of medical examiners ' data in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration 's Drug Abuse Warning Network ( DAWN ) .
So far , there 's been little data available on overdoses , since intentional overdoses are typically not reported to the FDA , said Dr. Gerald Dal Pan of the agency 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research .
Little Data Exists on Darvon , Darvocet Overdoses
Over a 35 - year period , 91 deaths related to propoxyphene have been reported to the FDA .
But most were suicide attempts with multiple drugs , so it 's hard to establish a direct causal role for propoxyphene , Dal Pan said .

What happened
Sarah Palin said in televised interviews Tuesday that she knew her resignation as Alaska 's governor could hurt her political career .
Palin announced she was stepping down just as she was expected to start planning a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 .
" You know , politically speaking , if I die , I die .
So be it , " she said .
( Associated Press in the New York Daily News )
What the commentators said
Sarah Palin can be a lot of things now that she has quit as Alaska 's governor , said Tish Durkin in TheWeek.com .
She can be an " obscenely paid " author , a big bucks public speaker , an " influential Republican fundraiser - thus - powerbroker . "
And she still has fans who would follow her anywhere — just not enough to get her elected president .
" Therefore , she is never going to be president . "
" It 's silly " to claim Sarah Palin has no chance to be elected president , said William Kristol in The Washington Post .
She survived a rough campaign as the GOP vice presidential candidate in 2008 , and is still " a co-front - runner in polls of GOP primary voters for 2012 . "
So why are the mainstream media and the Republican establishment trying to " bury her chances " of being nominated to challenge President Obama ?
They 're panicking because they know she could pull off an upset .
If this is n't Sarah Palin's " adieu to political life , " said Martin Peretz in The New Republic , the Republican Party will be tested in 2012 " as to whether its penchant for nutcases will override its lingering instincts as a political institution . "
One thing 's certain — despite my " apprehensions about how feebly Barack Obama is conducting our foreign policy ...
I am glad he and his advisors are sitting around that big table at the White House .
And not John McCain . "
Primary care trusts are to set up anti-viral drug distribution centres and swine flu testing clinics amid fears that the infection could spread out of control .
The Chief Medical Officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , wrote to health authorities last week urging hospitals to test all patients who show signs of flu - like symptoms .
He wrote : " Transmission from person to person in this country is increasingly common .
There is evidence that sporadic cases are arising with no apparent link either to cases elsewhere in the UK or to travel abroad . "
The letter followed an earlier warning from Sir Liam that millions of Britons could fall victim to swine flu in the coming months .
Government officials admitted last night that illness rates from the virus could reach 50 per cent .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Primary care trusts are now being briefed to expect that the pandemic could affect as much as 40 per cent of the workforce before the end of the year , with many worried that there could be a surge of cases in the autumn , according to health industry sources .
The Department of Health sought to reassure the public last night .
A spokesman said : " Previous pandemics have seen total illness levels of 25 - 35 per cent .
So our plans are as robust as possible , we have based them on illness rates of 50 per cent , though we do not anticipate it being this high in the current pandemic .
Based on this figure , the workforce could be reduced by 15 - 20 per cent at the pandemic 's peak .
In the unlikely event that every school closed , this could rise to 35 per cent . "
He said it was impossible to predict when the pandemic would peak , but added : " As part of ongoing planning , the NHS is being asked to ensure that antiviral collection points could , if needed , be put into action in a week . "
Keen to avoid panic , the Government is careful to present official statistics showing " laboratory - confirmed " cases , which currently stand at 2,244 .
Yet the true scale of infections is far higher than headline figures suggest .
The total number of cases either confirmed by laboratory tests or " clinically presumed " currently stands at 3,725 .
Almost 400 cases of swine flu in Britain have occurred as a result of in - country transmission , according to latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Control .
The virus is continuing to gain ground , with a number of people falling ill without having been abroad or in contact with previously confirmed cases – a signal that transmission is " growing in some areas of the country " , according to the Health Protection Agency .
The HPA said : " We would need to have a significant number of people where you really do n't know how they have got it for it to be classified as sustained community transmission .
We are getting closer to that , but are not there yet . "
This comes a week after Jacqui Fleming , 38 , of Glasgow , became the first person to die from swine flu outside North America .
Since then , health officials in Birmingham have said they can no longer contain the spread of the virus , and in Glasgow , a series of swine flu testing clinics have been set up .
Meanwhile , calls to NHS hotlines have almost doubled in the past week .
Latest figures from NHS Direct reveal that 2,356 calls about swine flu were made on Thursday 18 June , up from 1,280 a week earlier .
Under a new scheme that began in June , hundreds of people calling NHS Direct about swine flu have been sent swab kits to return for testing .
Economic toll : Pandemic to cost Britain £ 42bn
£ 42bn losses are predicted to hit Britain as a result of a three per cent fall in gross domestic product ( GDP ) due to the swine flu pandemic , according to a new report from the Oxford Economics think tank , due to be released tomorrow .
Researchers claim that swine flu could threaten already fragile businesses and put further strains on financial markets in what could become a " vicious cycle that postpones the recovery " .
Deflation is a " significant risk " as a result of the pandemic 's impact on the economy – putting back economic recovery by two years , says the report .
The predictions are based on a 30 per cent infection rate , should a pandemic begin in October and last for six months .
A $ 2.5 trillion cut in global GDP is a possibility – with a flu outbreak in the autumn hitting the world economy just as it starts to recover from the credit crunch .

( When Mr. Fornal met Ruben Diaz Jr. , the Bronx borough president , recently , he introduced himself as Baron Ambrosia . )
The Baron ’s hamminess comes naturally .
Handed a bottle of hot sauce , Mr. Fornal will reflexively act as if his fingers are burning .
He mugs ceaselessly , making faces like an old - time movie villain : clownish , dastardly , suave .
His eyebrows are almost permanently arched .
“ You see these owners joking with me , and I ’m acting like a buffoon , ” Mr. Fornal said .
In “ The Chitlin ’ Rapture , ” which includes his recipe for a potlikker martini , the Baron proselytizes about the soul - healing virtues of the titular food in the cadence of a Southern Baptist preacher .
“ Hallelujah , amen ! ” the patrons at Berzet ’s Soul Food yell gamely .
But no scenario is too preposterous if it helps advance his goal of demystifying the Bronx and its cuisine .
Crossing racial , social and class lines in search of , say , the borough ’s best cuchifritos  and convincing others to do the same  is what he is proudest of .
“ People have written to me and said , ‘ I ’m West African , and I ’ve never gone to an Albanian restaurant until I saw it on your show , ’ ” he said .
After lunch  Mr. Fornal took the leftovers ; doggie bags are his stock in trade  the two - person crew headed to the next location , Casa Amadeo , a historic record store that specializes in Latin music .
Plot break : Mr. Fornal got the idea for “ Joe Bataan Stole My Girlfriend ” when he met the musician after one of his concerts and later took him to lunch .
( The Baron is very persuasive . )
The story , roughly , begins with the Baron and his Dominican girlfriend sitting on the hood of the P - Rex in a romantic moment .
“ For the first time in the series he is truly in love , ” the script reads , “ as she makes the best pernil he has ever tasted . ”
But his lady only has eyes for the dapper Mr. Bataan .

Heartbroken , the Baron visits Casa Amadeo to learn more about his rival , and discover his weakness .
Enter the cemita de milanesa .
At some point the mariachi band from Xochimilco gets involved  the Baron stuffs them into his trunk  and the episode ends with a climatic game of chicken between Mr. Bataan and the Baron .
The winner gets the girl , or maybe the pernil .
Matt Cassel , a career backup in college and in the pros , parlayed a great 2008 season into a lucrative franchise tag .
Now , he 's locked himself into a deal to be the long - term quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs .
Cassel and the Chiefs worked out a six - year deal that will pay him in excess of $ 10 million a season , according to a source .
The contract will keep Cassel with the Chiefs until 2014 .
The deal is for $ 63 million , with $ 28 million guaranteed , according to a source .
He 's going to make $ 40.5 million in the first three years of his contract .
Cassel was designated as the New England Patriots ' franchise player in February and signed a one - year deal that paid him $ 14.561 million .
He was then traded to the Chiefs along with linebacker Mike Vrabel for a second - round draft choice .
" We are excited to be able to reach a long - term agreement for Matt Cassel to be a Kansas City Chief for many years to come , " owner and board chairman Clark Hunt said in a statement .
" His proven leadership on and off the field will be a tremendous asset to the organization . "
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran is preparing a new package of “ political , security and international ” issues to put to the West , its foreign minister said on Saturday .
“ The package can be a good basis for talks with the West .
The package will contain Iran ’s stances on political , security and international issues , ” Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a news conference .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Wednesday that the Group of Eight major powers would give Iran until September to accept negotiations over its nuclear ambitions or face tougher sanctions .
In Iran ’s first reaction to Sarkozy ’s statement at the G8 summit in Italy , Mottaki said the Islamic Republic had not received “ any new message ” from the summit .
“ We have not received any new message from the G8 .
But based on the news we have received , they had different views on different issues which did not lead to a unanimous agreement in some areas , ” Mottaki said .
Britain ’s Foreign
Office said it could not comment on Mottaki ’s remarks as the package was still being prepared .
The White House had no immediate comment .
U.S. President Barack Obama warned Iran on Friday that the world would not wait indefinitely for it to end its nuclear defiance , saying Tehran had until September to comply or else face consequences .
EU powers Britain , France and Germany have led negotiations with Iran over nuclear work that the West suspects is aimed at bomb - making .
Tehran says its nuclear work is wholly peaceful and remains defiant in the nuclear row with the West , saying Iran will not back down “ even one step ” over its disputed program .
Together with the United States , Russia and China , the EU nations have offered a package of economic and other incentives to Iran if it will stop enriching uranium , a process that can produce fuel for power plants , or , potentially , a nuclear bomb .
Iran has rejected the demand , saying it has the right to pursue such work as a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
In a separate statement , the G8 said it was committed to finding a diplomatic solution to Iran ’s nuclear program .

Note on this Hive :
We did our best to divide the wide range of votes into easy to digest categories .
Garmin and TomTom , for example , both make a wide variety of models , but Garmin appears twice on the list because both their handheld line and their dashboard line received a large number of votes separately .
In the same vein , the iPhone received a large number of votes independent of the general pool of votes for GPS - enabled cellphones .

The Garmin GPSMap series received much praise for its rugged and compact design coupled with useful features .
Many of you noted that because of the waterproof design of the handheld GPSMap units , you could easily take the unit from a day of hiking and mountain biking to the city streets on a dashboard mount .
The GPSMap line tends to be very sensitive , tuned to pick up signals when you 're deep in a canyon or a dense forest thicket , a trait that transfers well to being deep in the urban jungle .
The GPSMap line integrates with your computer via microSD and USB .
If you 're using it away from car , you 'll be able to squeeze nearly a day of continuous operation out of the GPSMap series while still taking advantage of the bright , sunlight - friendly , high - contrast display .
Whether you 're out geocaching or taking a road trip , the GPSMap handheld units can keep pace .

Although most people would n't run out and buy a phone and sign a contract for two years just to get a GPS device , the built - in GPS device in the iPhone is capable and has one advantage most of the other contenders do n't .
On top of being hand held and nearly always with you , the iPhone GPS chip can be used by applications downloaded from the Apple App Store which greatly extends its usefulness .
You can use the basic Map +
Compass features — although the digital compass is only available in the new 3GS series — or one of the current or upcoming GPS apps from the App Store to get around with more than adequate tools like turn - by - turn directions , route creation , and such .
Add in some other free or low - cost applications from the App Store , however , and you can do all sorts of interesting things , like turn the iPhone into an exercise companion , a geocaching buddy , and a tool for other specialized location - based tasks .

Netzaktivisten werden politisch : Die Wandlung der Freaks
Blogger , Hacker und Internetuser mischen sich mehr und mehr politisch ein .
Wie konnte aus den eigenbrötlerischen Sonderlingen von früher eine politische Bewegung werden ?
Eine Piratenpartei , die sich für Netzbürgerrechte einsetzt , tritt zur Bundestagswahl an .
Eine Onlinepetition gegen das Verbot von Killerspielen knüpft mit über 57.000 Unterzeichnern an den Erfolg der Petition gegen Kinderpornografie - Sperren im Internet an .
Und eine Großdemonstration im September soll erneut Zehntausende gegen die digitale Überwachung auf die Straße bringen : Die Netzaktivisten haben sich nicht nur einmalig erhoben , sondern wollen auch über das Thema Internetsperren hinaus politisch mitmischen .
Das ist eine Entwicklung , die von vielen aus Politik und Medien erstaunt beobachtet wird .
Lange galten Netzarbeiter , Blogger und Hacker nicht gerade als politisch interessiert , sondern als bleiche , sozial isolierte Grottenolme , die in Computerräumen hausen .
Oder aber als berufsjugendliche Dampfplauderer , die damals , zu Dotcom - Zeiten , massenweise Risikokapital verschwätzt haben .
In jedem Fall jedoch nicht als Gruppe , die gemeinsame politische Anliegen teilt .
Doch die aktuelle Gesetzgebung , von den Internetsperren für Kinderpornografie bis hin zu Debatten um digitale Urheberrechte hat in der Netzgemeinde für Unruhe und Zorn gesorgt - und hat sie im Interesse einer freien , digitalen Gesellschaft zusammengeschweißt .
Lautsprecher der Netzfrickler Chaos Computer Club : Verein von Hackern , die sich seit 1984 für Informationsfreiheit , Datenschutz und ungehinderte weltweite Kommunikation einsetzt .
www.ccc.de AK Vorrat : Lose Initiative aus Netzaktivisten , die sich aus dem Widerstand gegen das Gesetz zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung gegründet hat .
www.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de AK
Zensur : Neu gegründeter Arbeitskreis um den Blogger Alvar Freude , der sich gegen die Pläne von der Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) zur Internetsperrung und gegen die Zensur wenden .
www.ak-zensur.de Piratenpartei : Deutscher Ableger der schwedischen Piratenpartei , die lose auch mit der Bittorrent - Tracker - Seite " Pirate Bay " verknüpft ist und sich für ein freies Internet einsetzt .
www.piratenpartei.de netzpolitik.org : Politblogger Markus Beckedahl und seine Mitschreiber informieren und kommentieren das netzpolitische Geschehen in Deutschland , Europa und anderswo auf der Welt .
www.netzpolitik.org
" Das ist unser sozialer Raum - und dort ist alles viel regulierter und überwachter als in der normalen Welt " , sagt Markus Beckedahl , netzpolitischer Aktivist des einflussreichen Politblogs netzpolitik.org .
Er vergleicht die aufkeimende politische Einmischung der Blogger , Hacker und Internetuser mit dem Entstehen der Umweltbewegung in den 1970er - Jahren : " Wie damals die Natur kann man auch das Internet als Raum verstehen , an dem Raubbau betrieben wird . "
Wie damals die Umweltfragen sei auch die Netzpolitik ein Thema , das von großen Parteien nicht oder nicht ausreichend aufgenommen wurde .
Auch Netzaktivisten versuchen , " regenerative Systeme " wie Netzneutralität oder das Betriebssystem Linux zu fördern .
Kein Höhlendasein mehr
Und wie die Umweltbewegung kämpft auch die neue Netzbewegung noch um Anerkennung .
Derzeit wächst die Zahl derjenigen , die mit dem Internet aufgewachsen sind , ebenso wie die Zahl der Breitbandanschlüsse in Deutschland .
Großteile der privaten und beruflichen Kommunikation laufen online - anders als noch vor 20 Jahren , als PCs und C64 erst langsam Einzug in deutsche Haushalte hielten .
Auch die Klasse der Computer - und Netzspezialisten hat sich stark verändert : Dank Laptops müssen Programmierer kein Höhlendasein hinter Rechnerburgen mehr führen .
Und durch die Weiterentwicklung von Software ist auch die technische Hürde gesunken , die man nehmen muss , um das Internet zu nutzen .
Vor allem aber sind die Netzfrickler aller Couleur diejenigen , die die Technik und ihre Daten so weit unter Kontrolle haben , dass sie in der Lage sind , ein selbstbestimmtes digitales Leben zu führen .
Sie konsumieren im Internet nicht nur , sondern verstehen , welche Prozesse im Hintergrund ablaufen .
Und stehen damit viel weniger idiotisch da als Leute , die von " dem Internet " nichts verstehen , hilflos dasitzen , wenn der Windows - Rechner nicht funktioniert oder " keine Mail machen " können .
Allen voran der Chaos Computer Club ( CCC ) : Einst als sinistre Hackervereinigung verschrien , schreibt er heute Gutachten , in denen er die Bedrohungen der Vorratsdatenspeicherung erklärt , darlegt , warum Wahlcomputer fälschungsanfällig sind und wie einfach die " Internet - Stoppschilder " gegen Kinderpornografie umgangen werden können .
Doch die Kluft zwischen den Geeks , wie die digitalen Spezialisten sich gern nennen , und der heutigen Riege von Spitzenpolitikern , die das Internet meist erst als Erwachsene kennengelernt haben , ist groß .
Ohne Frage vergreifen sich viele Blogeinträge , Tweets und Kommentare im Ton , wenn sie politische Entscheidungen wie die Kinderpornografiesperren kritisieren .
Doch das kann nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen , dass unter denen , die dort so harsch pöbeln , die besten Experten sind , die man sich für netzpolitische Fragen wünschen kann .
Grund für die scharfe Kritik der deutschen Blogosphäre ist das Entsetzen über die technische Ahnungslosigkeit , die aus den politischen Versuchen zur Regulierung des digitalen Raums spricht .
Politik und Wirtschaft täten darum gut daran , den Einwänden der Netzaktivisten ihre Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken - so wie das Bundesverfassungsgericht , das den CCC als Gutachter beauftragt .
Wer sind diese Menschen ?
Bundestagspolitikern fällt es aber offenkundig schwer zu verstehen , wer eigentlich diese jungen Menschen sind , die sich derzeit für digitale Bürgerrechte erheben .
Häufig zieht man sich darauf zurück , die Netzaktivisten als besserwisserische , beratungsresistente Spinner abzutun .
Wenn Blogger Beckedahl Gespräche mit Politikern führe , sei es für sie oft schwer einzuschätzen , wessen Interessen er vertrete , wer hinter ihm stehe , berichtet er , der seit Jahren netzpolitisches Lobbying betreibt .
" Wir werden nicht ernst genug genommen , weil die Politik unsere diffusen Ad - hoc - Netzwerke nicht versteht " , sagt Beckedahl und meint damit die blitzschnelle Verbreitung von Informationen und Aufrufen über Blogs , Twitter und soziale Netzwerke .
Das sei etwas anderes als eine Gewerkschaft oder Sportschützenverbände , die eine nachvollziehbare Zahl von Mitgliedern habe .
Traditionell ist die Mitgliedschaft in Organisationen oder gar Parteien unter Geeks nicht sonderlich populär .
" Die Netzgemeinde " , von der derzeit so viel zu lesen und zu hören ist , gibt es nicht - sondern nur einen Haufen engagierter Nutzer , Rechnerarbeiter , PR - Blogger und Hacker , die einzig der Kampf für ein freies Internet und digitale Privatsphäre zusammenschweißt .
Doch vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen Ereignisse ist die Einsicht gewachsen , dass man mit postpubertären politischen Verweigerungshaltungen nicht weiterkommen wird - und stattdessen ein gemeinsames Auftreten die eigene Position stärkt .
Aus diesem Grund erfährt auch die Piratenpartei derzeit großen Zuspruch .
" Die meisten Leute sind von der Parteiidee erst mal abgeschreckt .
Das war ich bis vor Kurzem auch " , gibt Jens Seipenbusch , Vorsitzender der Piratenpartei , zu .
Er glaubt , dass die Piratenpartei die " Generation C64 " hinter sich versammeln könnte .
" Gerade sind Ad - hoc - Netzwerke unsere Stärke , aber nicht die längerfristige Lösung .
Sie produzieren einen Aufschrei - aber damit kann man nicht Politik machen . "
0,9 Prozent der Stimmen bei der Europawahl , Mitgliederzuwachs und jede Menge mediale Aufmerksamkeit anlässlich ihres Antretens bei der Bundestagswahl scheinen den Piraten Recht zu geben .
Und zeigen , dass Beckedahls Analyse zutreffend ist : Endlich , so scheint es , hat " die Netzgemeinde " eine politische Vertretung , eine Autorität , die Standpunkte formuliert , an die man sich wenden kann .
Noch zu unerfahren
Seipenbuschs Piraten wollen Netzaktivisten eine politische Heimat jenseits von Links - rechts - Schemata bieten .
Doch der Fall von Bodo Thiesen , einem Piratenpartei-Funktionär , dessen frühere krude Aussagen zum Holocaust für Kritik an der jungen Partei für jede Menge Kritik sorgten , zeigen , wie schnell diese apolitische Haltung der Piraten an ihre Grenzen stößt .
Derzeit scheint es nicht so , dass sich die gesamte Bewegung hinter den Piraten versammelt .
Viele altgediente Netzaktivisten aus den Arbeitskreisen zu Vorratsdatenspeicherung und Zensur ( AK Vorrat / AK Zensur ) , die sich seit Jahren politisch engagieren und vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht sogar schon Teilerfolge einstreichen konnten , halten sich von der Piratenpartei fern , und das nicht erst seit deren Zuwendung zu dem umstrittenen Bodo Thiesen und dem Ex-SPDler Jörg Tauss .
Auch Blogger Beckedahl sieht die Piratenpartei nicht als Sprachrohr der Bewegung , auch wenn er viele ihrer Ziele teilt .
Zu politisch und medial unerfahren seien viele , politische Vorschläge würden etwa von den Grünen einfach kopiert , zu wenig Frauen seien in der Partei .
Auch Beckedahl warnt davor , dass sich die Aktivität für digitale Bürgerrechte auf das Unterzeichnen einer Onlinepetition beschränkt .
" Wohlfühlaktivismus " nennt er das .
Doch er steht für eine andere Strömung der Netzaktivisten als die Piratenpartei :
Er wirbt dafür , weiter Lobbyismus bei etablierten Parteien zu betreiben und dort nach netzpolitischen Verbündeten zu suchen .
Wie zäh das ist , weiß er , wenn er sagt : " Demokratie ist halt generell ein bisschen uncool " .
Doch allen Grabenkämpfen zum Trotz : Derzeit deutet sich nicht an , dass die Geeks und Netzaktivisten ebenso schnell von der politischen Bildfläche verschwinden werden , wie sie gekommen sind .
Die politischen Schlachten um die Regulierung des Internets haben gerade erst begonnen .
Als Nächstes werden Urheberrechtsfragen an die Reihe kommen - im schlimmsten Fall sogar in Form des französischen Modells , das vorsieht , mutmaßlichen Filesharern die Internetverbindung zu kappen .
Ein Horror für eine Generation , die ihren freien Lebensraum im Netz verteidigen möchte .
" Wir stehen erst ganz am Anfang .
Momentan fängt eine ganze Generation den Marsch durch die Institutionen an : Journalisten , Politiker und viele andere .
Wenn wir Pech haben , dauert es noch 20 Jahre - aber die Bewegung wächst jeden Tag " , sagt Blogger Beckedahl .
Und das erinnert nun tatsächlich an die Umweltbewegung .
That does n’t mean Los Angeles and San Francisco are in any danger of turning into Detroit and Buffalo .
To the contrary , Gyourko calls them “ superstar cities , ” places that offer “ a rare blend ” of stimulating leisure activities and a highly productive work environment .
A life that looks “ rushed ” and “ materialistic ” to the folks headed for North Carolina feels exciting and creative to die - hard urbanites .
As a friend who recently moved from Manhattan to Santa Monica once said to me , “ When people say a place is ‘ good for raising children , ’ that means it ’s boring . ”
But not everyone with a taste for urban amenities can afford the superstar life .
As the number of affluent Americans grows , the rich are bidding up the price of living in these special places , increasing the gap between the superstar cities and everyplace else .
People in these high - price areas respond that they have no control over housing costs .
Everyone wants to live in California , and the land is already full of houses .
This is n’t Texas , with its miles and miles of empty old cotton fields .
True , land is cheaper and more plentiful in less - developed parts of the country .
But high - price areas could put many more units on the land they have .
Research by Gyourko , Glaeser , and Raven Saks found that the lowest - density areas around expensive cities tend to have the least new construction and the most land - use restrictions .
It ’s actually somewhat easier to build in more densely populated towns and neighborhoods — the opposite of what you ’d expect if a shortage of empty land were the problem .
Some of the higher price of L.A. real estate does reflect the intrinsic pleasure of living there , as I ’m reminded every time I walk out my door into the perfect weather .
Some of the price reflects the productivity advantages of being near others doing similar work ( try selling a screenplay from Arlington , Texas ) .
All of these benefits — and the negatives of traffic and smog — are reflected in the price of land .
But what exactly is that price ?
Consider two ways of computing the price of a quarter acre of land .
You can compare the value of a house on a quarter acre with that of a similar house on a half acre .
Or you can take the price of a house on a quarter acre and subtract the cost of the house itself — the price of construction .
Either way , you get the value of an empty quarter acre .
The two numbers should be roughly the same .
But they are n’t .
The second one is always bigger , because it includes not just the property but the right to build .
Expanding your quarter - acre lot to a half acre does n’t give you per- mission to add a second house .
In a 2003 article , Glaeser and Gyourko calculated the two different land values for 26 cities ( using data from 1999 ) .
They found wide disparities .
In Los Angeles , an extra quarter acre cost about $ 28,000 — the pure price of land .
But the cost of empty land is n’t the whole story , or even most of it .
A quarter - acre lot minus the cost of the house came out to about $ 331,000 — nearly 12 times as much as the extra quarter acre .
The difference between the first and second prices , around $ 303,000 , was what L.A. home buyers paid for local land - use controls in bureaucratic delays , density restrictions , fees , political contributions .
That ’s the cost of the right to build .
Please note :
This piece does n't discuss my personal sex life in lurid detail , but it does discuss it .
Family members and others who do n't want to read that , please do n't .
This piece was originally published on the Blowfish Blog .
What does it mean to " want " sex ?
There was a letter to the Perv Panel advice columnists at Carnal Nation that 's shoved this question into my mind .
In the Lesbian Bed Death letter , the author says that , after four years in a committed relationship , neither she nor her partner has any real interest in sex anymore .
In one sentence , she says they 're content ; in the next sentence , she says she feels like they should do something about it .
The advice from the Perv Panel was fine , as far as it went .
But I think there 's a very important core concept here that none of the advisors really got into .
It 's this :
There is more than one way to " want " sex .
When we talk about " wanting " sex , we tend to mean the immediate animal urge .
The hard cock or clit .
The overpowering physical desire to get busy , now .
But there are other ways of " wanting " sex .
You can want the effect sex has on your life , and on your relationship .
You can want the closeness and intimacy it gives you with your partner .
You can want the affirmation it gives , the feeling of being desired and valued .
You can want the confidence and poise that being an actively sexual person can give .
You can want the transcendence that sex can create , the experience of epiphany and transformative joy .
And for that matter , you can want the pure animal pleasure of sex ... without having the immediate physical desire for it .
You can know in your head how great sex can feel , and want to re-create that feeling -- without your dick or clit being hard right that second .
( Sick people often do n't feel much appetite for food -- but if they 're smart , they know that food will make them feel better , and they know that once they start eating , their appetite is likely to return . )
This is a bit of a tricky distinction .
So let me draw a couple of analogies before I move on .
I very rarely " want " to go to the gym .
When I have a rare free moment , and I stop and think , " What do I most want to do right now ? " , the answer is very rarely , " What I most want is to lift weights and walk on a treadmill . "
And yet , once I 'm at the gym , I enjoy it .
I actually do have fun working out once I 'm doing it .
Of course it gives me medium - and long - term payoffs in stamina and mental health and such ... but I 'm not even talking about that .
Walking on a treadmill and lifting weights is a positive sensual pleasure .
Sometimes even an erotic pleasure .
I just have a hard time remembering that until I 'm actually doing it .
That may not be the best example .
I realize I 'm a bit of a freak , and not everyone is tickled to be at the gym once they 're there .
So I 'll give another example before I get back to the point : Dancing .
If I 'm tired at the end of a long day , I often do n't " want " to get in the car and drive across town to go dancing .
What I " want " is to sleep .
Or watch SpankingTube and jerk off .
Or collapse on the sofa , order takeout , and watch The Simpsons .
And yet , I love to dance .
At its best , dancing makes me feel transcendently connected with humanity and the universe .
At its worst , it 's a heckuva good time .
It is one of the great pleasures of my life : a creative pleasure , an intellectual pleasure , a source of expansive shared joy with a community , a source of intimate shared joy with my wife .
And on a purely physical , sensual level , it just feels good .
Once I 'm dancing , I am never , ever sorry that I went .
And in the same way , I am never , ever sorry that I had sex ... even if I was n't in the mood when we started .
It can be hard to overcome inertia and find the energy to do the things that we love .
It 's easy to focus on the necessities of survival and getting through the day , and then just blob out once those necessities are handled ... at the expense of the things that give our lives meaning and joy .
Especially if we 're overscheduled and overworked .
And for many of us , this gets harder as we get older .
The automatically exuberant energy of youth often gives way as we age , and it takes more work and conscious effort to fan the flames into life .
Especially when it comes to sex .
And double especially when it comes to sex in long - term relationships .
And yet , one of the main things that defines being a mentally healthy grownup is that you can distinguish between the things you want right this second , and the things you want in the long run .
Or even in the medium run .
One of the things that defines being a mentally healthy grownup -- and this is n't a buzz - kill , this is one of adulthood 's greatest joys -- is that you have the knowledge and self - discipline to defer the gratification of immediate desires , in order to fulfill larger , more deeply satisfying desires .
This can mean passing on sex that you know is a bad idea even though you have a strong , urgent desire for it ... but it can also mean pursuing sex that you know is a good idea , even though you have a strong , urgent desire to just order a pizza and then go to sleep .
And one of the things about getting older -- and about being in a long - term relationship -- is that sex tends to shift away from being a relentless , urgently demanding physical desire , and toward something familiar that 's easy to put on the back burner ... but that 's richly and complexly satisfying when you set aside time and energy for it .
It shifts away from , " I am totally starving right now , if I do n't get a burger in the next ten minutes I am going to pass out and die , " and moves toward , " We have some free time this Saturday -- why do n't we cook something special ?
Let 's make that roast chicken you like so much , or try that recipe for polenta with red pepper sauce we keep looking at . "
These are two very different ways of " wanting " food .
And do n't get me wrong , both have their charms , I am a big fan of the starving hamburger lust .
But it would be a huge mistake to say that only starving hamburger lust counts as " wanting " to eat .
Setting aside time to plan and cook a meal also counts as " wanting " to eat , " wanting " the sensual pleasure and rich satisfaction that food can give you ... even if you are n't hungry right that second .
I 've written something like this before : how , in order for sex to be satisfying , you do n't have to be in the mood when it starts .
You just have to be willing to get in the mood .
But I had n't thought of it quite this way before now .
Being willing to get in the mood -- being willing to seduce and be seduced , to be drawn in by the pleasures of sex even though you 're not feeling it when you start -- is really just a different way of wanting it .
It 's an acknowledgement that , even though you may not " want " sex in the more immediate and narrow sense of the word , you still " want " it in the larger and broader sense ... and that therefore , you 're willing to prioritize it and make room for it in your life .
If you really , truly do n't want or care about sex on any level ... okay .
I personally have a hard time getting my mind around that -- heck , I have a hard time understanding people who say they do n't like to dance -- but I trust that , for a handful of people , it 's probably true .
But I did not get that from this letter at all .
Maybe I 'm misreading it : but I did not get the sense that the author of this letter was genuinely happy with the status quo .
( For one thing , if she were , she would n't be writing to sex advice columnists . )
The author of this letter seemed dissatisfied and sad .
It seemed like sex was important to her , or used to be important to her , and that even though the overpowering physical urge for it had dissipated , she still missed it .
So if what you mean by " I do n't seem to want sex anymore " is " I no longer feel the immediate physical urge for sex that I used to , but it 's still important to me and I want it in my life " ... then I think it might behoove you to rethink what you mean by " wanting sex . "
I think it might behoove you to stop thinking of " an immediate and overpowering physical lust " as the only meaningful definition of " wanting sex " ... and to give the " it 's important to me and I want it in my life " meaning every bit as much weight .
President Obama mentions Jesus in big speeches more frequently than George W. Bush did , said Eamon Javers in Politico , " even though Bush ’s Christian faith was at the core of his political identity . "
Obama has invoked the Christian messiah " while talking about abortion and the Middle East , even the economy . "
Clearly this is a president who feels comfortable talking about his faith .
And there 's nothing wrong with that , said Jonah Goldberg in National Review .
What is " mildly amusing " — " but hardly surprising " — is that Obama followers who criticized Bush for injecting religion into government business do n't seem to care when their man does the same thing .
President Obama has good reason for trying to reflect " a different kind of Christianity , " said John Esposito in The Washington Post and Newsweek .
Bush 's talk of " crusades " made many Muslims see the U.S. fight against Islamofascism as a war on Islam .
Obama is trying to fix things by showing Muslims that his faith is more " empathetic " and accepting of them than are the beliefs the Christian right .
From Congressman Alan Grayson , member of the House Financial Services Committee and representative to the 8th Congressional District of Florida :
Hi , Alan Grayson here .
I just questioned Ben Bernanke in a Financial Services Committee hearing over the Federal Reserveís use of swap lines .
You can watch the clip here .
There was some good discussion on the subject , and I enjoy reading the posts and the comments .
I asked the question because I genuinely wanted to know which foreign banks ( or others ) or else got the $ 500,000,000,000 in loans , and what they did with the money .
Chairman Bernanke said he did n’t know .
This is puzzling .
Yves Smith wondered why Bernanke stonewalled , as did this anonymous economist .
For the record , I do not think the currency swaps in question — half a trillion dollars to foreign central banks — was what caused the US nominal dollar exchange rate to “ appreciate ” .
In the past year , dollar appreciations have been perfectly correlated with declines in the Dow , the seizing up of financial markets , and a diminishing in investor appetite for risk .
The Fed ’s actions were almost certainly in response to this .
What happened was , banks all over the world suddenly want to hold either T - bills or dollars , taking as little risk as possible , and not wanting to hold riskier assets such as the Pound or Euro .
Everyone wants this at the same time , so to alleviate the demand , the Fed gives other countries half a trill in dollars in return for half a trillion their currencies …
This , if anything , should slow the appreciation of the dollar , which is a good thing .
I cannot fathom why Bernanke could not just elucidate this , except to say that perhaps Bernanke is taking his marching orders from someone else and does n’t himself quite understand the rationale …..
This conventional storyline might be correct .
Or China might have threatened to sell its Treasury bonds , so the Federal Reserve might have lent this money to friendly banks to backstop the Treasury market .
Or you can spin out any number of possibilities here .
We do n’t actually know which one is correct .
That ’s the point .
The Constitution grants to Congress power over the currency and power over the public purse strings for a reason – because we are accountable to ordinary citizens through the ballot box .
The Federal Open Market Committee is n’t .
$ 500,000,000,000 is ten times the size of the entire State Department budget .
Publicly elected lawmakers proposed and debated over 100 amendments to the much - smaller State department budget .
Thatís how democracy is supposed to work — not through secret deliberations in which 12 unelected bankers trample on Congressís Constitutional authority to appropriate funds , approve treaties , and coin money .
Over the past few weeks , the environmental audit committee ( EAC ) has been interviewing scientists , climate change campaigners and others to determine whether the carbon budgets recommended by the Committee on Climate Change ( CCC ) are ambitious enough .
I attended the EAC to give evidence with Professor Sir Brian Hoskins of the CCC .
Brian is a leading UK climate scientist and has been working to convince people of the seriousness of climate change for over 30 years .
This was our opportunity to explain why our carbon budgets are both ambitious and feasible .
The science of climate change increasingly shows that a 2C temperature rise will put us into a global danger zone .
Already there are impacts being felt in some parts of the world .
However , global emissions are increasing at a rate that means it is no longer possible to avoid 2C with certainty .
The CCC 's 2050 emissions reduction target is designed to maintain a 50 - 50 likelihood of keeping warming to within 2C , while also reducing the likelihood of an extremely dangerous 4C rise to very low levels .
It is based on the latest science , including the consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and more recent studies .
Modelling work by the Met Office Hadley Centre suggests that our target can be achieved if global emissions peak before 2020 , with a 50 % cut by 2050 and further reductions afterwards .
Accepting that a cut of at least 50 % is desirable , we then had to consider what the UK 's contribution should be .
In doing this , we looked at different models of burden sharing .
In the end , we determined that it is difficult to imagine a global deal to cut emissions which allows developed countries to have emissions per person in 2050 which are significantly above a global average .
Globally , we need to reduce emissions to an annual average around two tonnes per person in 2050 , implying that the UK should reduce emissions by at least 80 % relative to 1990 levels .
Our analysis suggested that a 42 % cut in 2020 was sufficiently ambitious to put us on the path to an 80 % cut in 2050 .
We argued that we should plan for a 42 % cut , but should enact a lower but still ambitious cut of 34 % before a global emissions reduction deal is achieved .
We argued that only when other countries are fully committed to tackling climate change should we move to the higher level of ambition ; this is the same approach adopted by the EU .
We set out a range of measures to meet the 34 % cut that would facilitate the transition to the 42 % cut at the appropriate time .
In producing the carbon budgets , we analysed the potential to reduce emissions across the UK economy from power , transport , buildings , homes , agriculture and aviation .
Domestic cuts of 80 % can feasibly be made by firstly decarbonising electricity generation and then using this cleaner electricity for heat , transport and power .
We estimate this will cost no more than 1 % of GDP by 2020 , or around £ 240 per person on average .
There are " quick - wins " which could be achieved through making homes more energy efficient , and untapped potential which can be harnessed , for example , in the agricultural sector .
The government has recognised these opportunities and will next week publish its strategy for building a low - carbon future .
We realise that it is hard for people to imagine what such radical reductions might mean for their lifestyle in the future .
In October , we will set out a much clearer picture of what we can all expect and what policies will be required to make this a reality .
We are clear that a low - carbon model is the only one that will work in a future threatened by climate change .
We are also clear that this wo n't mean people having to sit in the dark or not be mobile , or that everyone should become vegetarian .
This is about living more sustainably , not limiting our growth or happiness .
What we need now is a clear plan of how we can achieve required cuts and create a more sustainable and secure future , and what opportunities there are for individuals and firms to make their contribution .
We will be working with the government in the next months to ensure that such a plan is in place .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Presidents typically enjoy positive approval ratings during the early stages of their presidencies , commonly known as the " honeymoon " period .
Barack Obama is no exception , with ratings that have generally been above 60 % .
But recent presidents ' honeymoons have typically ended much sooner than those of their predecessors .
Whereas presidents from Harry Truman through Richard Nixon spent an average of 26 months above the historical average 55 % presidential job approval rating after they took office , presidents from Gerald Ford to George W. Bush spent an average of just seven months above this norm .
A honeymoon period has an obvious beginning -- when the president takes office -- but no obvious end .
But given that honeymoons are characterized by above - average ratings , one way to define the end point is by marking the point at which the president 's ratings become " average . "
And the historical average presidential job approval rating in all Gallup Polls is 55 % .
Using this standard , each president from Truman to Nixon had a honeymoon that lasted at least into his 10th month in office .
This includes popular presidents such as Dwight Eisenhower , who did not drop to 55 % approval until his fourth year in office , and John Kennedy , who never did , but bottomed out at 56 % in September 1963 , his 32 month in office ( for the purposes of this article , this 56 % rating is considered the end of his honeymoon ) .
But only one of the last six presidents -- George H.W. Bush -- had a honeymoon that extended beyond his ninth month in office .
Bush 's ratings actually climbed for much of his first year and a half in office as the economy remained strong , several communist regimes fell in Europe , and the U.S. military was able to capture Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and remove him from power .
One reason earlier presidents had longer honeymoons is because they enjoyed much greater public support in the early part of their presidencies .
The five presidents from Truman to Nixon averaged 74 % job approval in their first quarters in office , compared with a 60 % average for presidents from Ford through George W. Bush .
But the earlier presidents were able to maintain their lofty ratings well into their second quarter ; only Truman was unable to maintain or improve upon his first - quarter average approval rating in his second quarter in office .
This group includes Nixon , who had a lengthy honeymoon despite starting out with initial ratings near 60 % -- similar to what more recent presidents have had .
The six presidents from Ford to George W. Bush were not as successful in maintaining or increasing their average ratings from the first to the second quarter ; only Ronald Reagan and the elder Bush were able to do so .
Ford and Bill Clinton in particular showed rather steep declines during their second quarters in office .
Ford 's decline was largely the result of his unpopular decision to pardon Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal .
Clinton's was the result of a series of early missteps in filling key administration positions , controversy over his attempt to revise military policy toward gays , and the public relations nightmare that resulted from his tying up runway traffic at Los Angeles International Airport to receive a high - priced haircut aboard Air Force One .
The Obama Honeymoon
Obama 's initial approval rating was 68 % , generally higher than what other recent presidents had at the beginning of their terms .
He averaged 63 % for his first quarter in office .
Now well into his second quarter as president , his approval rating has stayed above 60 % for the most part , but he has had a number of ratings in the 50s , including a low of 57 % three times in Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
Because Obama has been able to maintain above - average approval ratings , he is arguably still in the honeymoon phase of his presidency .
Now in his sixth month in office , his honeymoon has already exceeded the durations of those for Ford , Clinton , and George W. Bush .
If he can maintain ratings above 55 % through the summer , his honeymoon will match the length of those for Jimmy Carter and Reagan .
Obama 's continuing honeymoon could be considered impressive , given that few of his predecessors faced such trying economic and international conditions upon taking office .
He has taken swift action to pass legislation to help improve the economy , but soon Americans will be looking for results and will hold him accountable if they are not there .
Meanwhile , he is turning his attention to his domestic agenda -- most notably in trying to reform the U.S. healthcare system -- while trying to respond to the international situations that affect U.S. interests and security , including in Iraq , Afghanistan , Iran , and North Korea .
His ability to successfully address these challenges will ultimately determine how long his honeymoon lasts .

Britain must not bury its head in the sand over food supplies , warns the environment , food and rural affairs committee
Britain should grow far more fruit , vegetables and cereals to help feed the extra 2.7 billion people there may be in the world within 40 years , said a powerful committee of MPs in a report published today .
Michael Jack , who chairs the environment , food and rural affairs ( Efra ) committee , said : " If people go hungry then political stability goes out of the window .
This is a key lesson that government must learn from last year 's global food price rises when some countries ran short of food .
What happened showed just how fine the line is between full supermarket shelves and empty stomachs . "
It is estimated that world food supplies would have to double in the next 40 years to feed a population of nine billion , while at the same time , farmers must cope with climate change , oil price rises and new plant and animal diseases .
But the government has taken the supply of food in the UK largely for granted , said the committee .
" Doing nothing will be morally unacceptable at a time when a fundamental shift in thinking [ about agriculture ] is required .
The UK must not bury its head in the sand " , said the MPs .
A combination of climate change , the increasing use of food for biofuels , changing food tastes in countries such as China , and growing populations all raised food prices 13.9 % in Britain in 2008 and to unprecedented levels worldwide , said the report .
" There is a growing awareness among governments in developed countries that a food system that has appeared to work well since the second world war may not continue to do so , " said the MPs .
But they said that Britain should not try to become food self - sufficient because that could make us even more vulnerable to supply shortages .
A single disease could devastate staple foods and it might be seen as to exemplify an " every country for itself " approach , said the MPs .
Such a self - interested approach is already leading to land - grabbing in countries short of food and could destabilise the global market in food , they said .
" We are concerned that the government is not taking this phenomenon sufficiently seriously , " the report noted .
Instead they believe that Britain should carry on sourcing food from many countries .
In 2006 , 26 countries accounted for 90 % of the UK's food – the largest producer was the Netherlands , responsible for 13 % of our supplies .
But the UK could do far more to improve homegrown food production , said the MPs : " Only 10 % of the fruit consumed in the UK by value is grown here .
Apple orchards have reduced by nearly 33 % in just 10 years and less than a third of the apples eaten here are grown here " .
In addition , the MPs were concerned that the government was advising people to eat fish twice a week when it was not clear that the marine environment could sustain that level .
" Industry and government have a duty to encourage consumers to try less well known types of fish and shellfish , " it said .
The report called for more research money , particularly into GM and other hi-tech food production .
" This challenge will not be met unless government properly safeguards our agricultural science base .
It must heed the words of Prof Kell , the chief executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , and put in an extra £ 100 m [ towards food security relevant research ] .
We believe that the potential of GM should be explored further .
The government should make an effort to negotiate a ceasefire on the destruction of GM crops , " said the MPs .
Last year , the influential thinktank Chatham House called on the government to take urgent steps to revive Britain 's agricultural sector to avoid a major food crisis in the future .
• This article was corrected on 23rd July 2009 .
The quote from Prof Kell had referred to " GM research " .
This has been amended to " food security relevant research " .
The growing power of Australia 's biggest banks are the target of six influential economists who have petitioned the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to set up an inquiry into Australia 's financial system — the first in more than a decade .
In an open letter , the economists express alarm at the erosion of competition in banking since the global financial crisis , with smaller independent lenders disappearing and banks boosting their share of the home mortgage market from 80 per cent to 92 per cent .
The economists also question whether Australia 's comparatively strong financial performance amid the global crisis has been due to luck , rather than good regulation .
It is possible , they say , that a " good roll of the dice " has helped Australia avoid major failures such as those seen in Britain .
" In future crises , we may not be so lucky .
The Iranian government has accused the U.S. and Britain of interfering in its election .
Both countries have government - funded broadcasters that offer Persian - language reports .
British Broadcasting Corp .
BBC Persian launched television programming in January to supplement its longtime radio and Internet services .
The TV service quickly developed a following in Iran .
Tehran has accused the BBC of contributing to unrest in the country .
Behrouz Afagh , head of the BBC World Service ’s Asia -Pacific division , said BBC Persian ’s transmissions have been jammed on and off for two to three days .

Afagh said Thursday that the service had found a new satellite that would not be vulnerable to jamming from within Iran .
He rejected accusations of meddling or bias .
“ All we do is to report what ’s going on [ on ] the ground .
It ’s factual reporting of what ’s happening , ” Afagh said .
“ We ’ve had people from all sides , but it ’s more difficult to get from [ President Mahmoud ] Ahmadinejad ’s side .
But we do reflect their views . ”
With foreign reporters restricted in their movements , BBC Persian is relying heavily on videos and photos uploaded by Iranians , which BBC staff members try to authenticate before posting , the broadcaster said .

It said it also is increasingly airing footage from Iranian state television .
Voice of America
VOA ’s Persian News Network offers eight hours of Persian programming daily .
Like BBC Persian , it has been inundated with images and messages from Iranian civilians .
Last week , it received 2,000 e-mails during a single hourlong talk show , VOA spokeswoman Joan Mower said .
From June 10 to 15 , its Internet news pages saw traffic increase more than 200 % .

Though VOA is funded by the U.S. government , Mower said , it takes pains to steer clear of partisanship .
“ We are congressionally mandated to provide balanced coverage , ” she said .
“ We do n’t have in our charter ‘ promote democracy , ’ ‘ change the world . ’ ”
The Iranian government has intermittently jammed Persian News Network ’s broadcasts , often by using microwave trucks to disrupt signals .
In anticipation of that , the network sought additional satellite paths for its broadcasts before the election .
The network , which has about 200 employees , operates on a budget of about $ 17 million .

I try to highlight the stories of successful depressives whenever I find them because I know that we need that boost of confidence … to be reminded that our illness has nothing to do with our skills in the workplace , or our desire to accomplish great things .
We just have some interesting brain wiring that takes some time and energy to figure out .
Rhonda Rowland , former medical correspondent for CNN , writes a great blog post about depression and successful people on the very cool website that she and co-founder Diana Keough launched this month called Medical Mommas .
She describes the first moment her dad came to terms with his depression .
Writes Rowland :
I remember the moment well .
My phone rang at 9 a.m. sharp on a Saturday morning in 2002 , as if my dad had been watching the clock , waiting to call .
The first words out of his mouth were : “ Your mother told me about a story you ’re working on about some executives . ”
He and my mom lived in Florida .
At that time , my dad owned his own luxury home building business in the southwest part of the state but was beginning to phase himself out of it , in preparation for retirement .
When he called , I lived in Atlanta and worked at CNN . <
Yes , I was working on a story about my boss , Tom Johnson , former CEO and president of CNN .
Tom and another prominent Atlanta businessman , J.B. Fuqua had recently gone public with a secret they shared : both battled severe depression .
In the story , I described their secret lives - important meetings canceled at the last minute , lights out in their offices so they could sleep or hide , cowering in the corner and crying like a baby .
These men , who appeared to hold the world in their hands , were enveloped in a deep darkness that stole their self - esteem and self worth .
Depression .
" I think I might have that , " my dad said , matter of fact .
I could hardly breathe .
What ?!
My dad is always happy .
He has everything together .
He 's our family 's patriarch .
He 's the go - to guy when any of us have a problem .
He always listens and always has a solution .
I was incredulous !
How could I have missed this in my own father ?
A moment later , my dad started speaking , letting his secret spill out .
He told me he was in a very , very dark place and did n't know how to find his way out .
I could hear the fear in his voice .
Until this moment he had n't told anyone and I could almost feel his relief as he talked .
He spoke as if he was talking about someone else .
A stranger .
What I did next , was what I tended to do when I was reporting stories : I tried to put my feelings in a box .
It was too painful to think this was happening to my dad .
He needed help and needed it fast .
JERUSALEM  Iran seems to be hurtling toward nuclear weapons capacity , Hezbollah could win Sunday ’s election in Lebanon and Hamas is smuggling long - range rockets into Gaza again .
So why is President Obama focusing such attention on the building of homes by Israeli Jews in the West Bank ?
That , in essence , is the question being angrily posed by the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and underscores one of the biggest shifts in American policy toward the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in three decades .
While every administration has objected to Israeli settlement building in occupied lands , the Obama administration has selected it as the opening issue that could begin to untie the Gordian knot of the conflict .
American officials hope that by getting Israel to freeze settlement building on land where the Palestinians expect to build their future state , they can then press Saudi Arabia and other regional powers to offer Israel concessions like low - level trade or tourism .
In addition , stopping the construction would remove a major concern of the Palestinians that their land is slowly disappearing under settler housing .
In his Cairo speech on Thursday , the president again called for an end to the settlement building .
“ Obama may have found the soft underbelly of Israel , because ending settlements is a consensus issue in the world , among American Jewry and even among a majority of Israelis , ” said Yossi Beilin , a former leftist minister and member of Parliament who now runs a private consulting firm .
“ He needs a strong regional coalition to leave Iraq  and not to leave it to Iran .
And it seems like he sees ending settlements as a way to start this process .
The only question is whether Netanyahu can do what is needed . ”
While US tries to inject purpose into meeting , Italy is lambasted for poor planning and reneging on overseas aid commitments
Preparations for Wednesday 's G8 summit in the Italian mountain town of L'Aquila have been so chaotic there is growing pressure from other member states to have Italy expelled from the group , according to senior western officials .
In the last few weeks before the summit , and in the absence of any substantive initiatives on the agenda , the US has taken control .
Washington has organised " sherpa calls " ( conference calls among senior officials ) in a last - ditch bid to inject purpose into the meeting .
" For another country to organise the sherpa calls is just unprecedented .
It 's a nuclear option , " said one senior G8 member state official .
" The Italians have been just awful .
There have been no processes and no planning . "
" The G8 is a club , and clubs have membership dues .
Italy has not been paying them , " said a European official involved in the summit preparations .
The behind - the - scenes grumbling has gone as far as suggestions that Italy could be pushed out of the G8 or any successor group .
One possibility being floated in European capitals is that Spain , which has higher per capita national income and gives a greater percentage of GDP in aid , would take Italy 's place .
The Italian foreign ministry did not reply yesterday to a request to comment on the criticisms .
" The Italian preparations for the summit have been chaotic from start to finish , " said Richard Gowan , an analyst at the Centre for International Co-operation at New York University .
" The Italians were saying as long ago as January this year that they did not have a vision of the summit , and if the Obama administration had any ideas they would take instruction from the Americans . "
The US - led talks led to agreement on a food security initiative a few days before the L'Aquila meeting , the overall size of which is still being negotiated .
Gordon Brown has said Britain would contribute £ 1.1 bn to the scheme , designed to support farmers in developing countries .
However , officials who have seen the rest of the draft joint statement say there is very little new in it .
Critics say Italy 's Berlusconi government has made up for the lack of substance by increasing the size of the guest list .
Estimates of the numbers of heads of state coming to L'Aquila range from 39 to 44 .
" This is a gigantic fudge , " Gowan said .
" The Italians have no ideas and have decided that best thing to do is to spread the agenda extremely thinly to obscure the fact that did n't really have an agenda . "
Silvio Berlusconi has come in for harsh criticism for delivering only 3 % of development aid promises made four years ago , and for planning cuts of more than 50 % in Italy 's overseas aid budget .
Meanwhile , media coverage in the run-up to the meeting has been dominated by Berlusconi 's parties with young women , and then the wisdom of holding a summit in a region experiencing seismic aftershocks three months after a devastating earthquake as a gesture of solidarity with the local population .
The heavy criticism of Italy comes at a time when the future of the G8 as a forum for addressing the world 's problems is very much in question .
At the beginning of the year the G20 group , which included emerging economies , was seen as a possible replacement , but the G20 London summit in April convinced US officials it was too unwieldy a vehicle .
The most likely replacement for the G8 is likely to be between 13 - and 16 - strong , including rising powers such as China , India , Brazil , Mexico and South Africa , which currently attend meetings as the " outreach five "
But any transition would be painful as countries jostle for a seat .
Italy 's removal is seen in a possibility but Spanish membership in its place is unlikely .
The US and the emerging economies believe the existing group is too Euro- centric already , and would prefer consolidated EU representation .
That is seen as unlikely .
No European state wants to give up their place at the table .

The Joel Tenenbaum case opened today with a full , slogging day of jury selection , the defense reeling from Boston federal judge Nancy Gertner 's last - minute decision to remove Tenenbaum 's proposed fair use defense from the closely watched copyright case .
Tenenbaum 's hopes of letting the jury determine whether his acts of alleged infringement constituted fair use under the Copyright
Act were dashed by an order e-mailed to the parties this morning at 1:37 am , granting the record label plaintiffs ' motion for partial summary judgment on the fair use defense .
Judge Gertner ’s order , handed down less than eight hours before trial got under way , said the fair use defense proposed by Tenenbaum failed because it would " shield from liability any person who downloaded copyrighted songs for his or her own private enjoyment " and would " swallow the copyright protections that Congress has created . "
The court 's sound rejection of the fair use defense leaves Team Tenenbaum with an extremely steep uphill climb on the basic issue of whether he will be found liable for committing the acts of copyright infringement of which he stands accused , namely downloading and sharing thirty songs using the KaZaA peer - to - peer network .
Tenenbaum has repeatedly admitted , including under oath at his two days of deposition , that he used KaZaA to download and share songs , and the record labels have mountains of evidence to confirm what Tenenbaum admits : testimony and computer forensic evidence from MediaSentry ( anti- piracy investigators retained by the plaintiffs ) , Cox Communications ( Tenenbaum ’s ISP on August 10 , 2004 , the date of the detected sharing ) , and their expert , Dr. Douglas Jacobson of Iowa State University .
Indeed , given Tenenbaum ’s own admissions , Judge Gertner questioned today whether the MediaSentry testimony was even needed for the plaintiffs to prove Tenenbaum ’s infringement .
The real action will be in determining the amount of damages , which could range from a low of $ 750 per work all the way up to $ 150,000 per work — potentially $ 4.5 million — in the case of willful infringement .
Judge Gertner said again today that , should the jury award statutory damages , she intends to hold a separate post - trial hearing to determine whether any such award is so excessive as to violate the US Constitution 's guarantee of due process of the law .
Day of torture
Nearly the entire day was consumed with what Gertner termed " one very long , very tortured day of jury selection . "
It started with jurors filling out forms asking basic biographical information , as well as their , and their friends ' and family members ' , experiences with the use of peer - to - peer software like KaZaA and Limewire to obtain and distribute music .
After the attorneys had the chance to sift through the completed forms , the judge , attorneys , clerks , and spectators all moved to the adjacent courtroom , while the potential jurors waited in the original courtroom to be called next door for their seriatim grillings by each side , as well as by Judge Gertner herself .
The dragged - out process stood in stark contrast to that conducted by Minnesota federal judge Michael Davis , who presided over the recent retrial of Jammie Thomas - Rasset , conducted voir dire en masse , and wrapped the whole thing up in about an hour and a half .
The questions from label attorney Matt Oppenheim were conventional : " Do you have an opinion about record companies ? "
" Have you heard about the record companies ' suits against individuals accused of copyright infringement ? "
" Do you believe they are justified in enforcing their rights against those who infringe their works on the Internet ? "
The questions from Tenenbaum 's lead counsel , Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson , were , to no one 's surprise ... not so conventional .
Nesson began his questioning of many of them by asking whether they were " offended " by his decision to wear a Steve Jobs - esque black turtleneck ( with blazer ) in lieu of a business suit .
" I ’m a teacher in my normal life , " explained Nesson .
" This is what I wear every day . "
Nesson also questioned potential jurors about their views on marijuana decriminalization , even asking one woman how she would feel if she heard during the trial about Nesson 's own ( admitted ) pot-smoking .
She said she did n’t mind , though Judge Gertner quickly made clear that the trial would not delve into that subject .
The parties sparred repeatedly about whether the half - dozen or so potential jurors who admitted to using peer - to - peer networks to obtain music without paying for it should be excluded from the jury for cause .
Judge Gertner repeatedly sided with the plaintiffs , who objected to the presence on the jury of those who essentially admitted to the same activity of which Tenenbaum , a 25 - year - old Boston University graduate student , stands accused .
Nesson complained that removing such P2P users from the juror pool deprived Tenenbaum of his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial by a jury of his peers .
" By doing that , she excluded a whole generation , " Nesson lamented in a post - voir dire interview .
But , he added , " I think this is a jury I can talk to . "
Also excluded from the jury was the labels ' worst nightmare : a 40 - ish woman who had done graduate studies in theology and library sciences and said she " definitely ha[s ] a bias against record companies .
Information should be free . "
Team Tenenbaum was also able to toss its least - favorite juror : a 60 - ish man who proclaimed that " downloading music is almost like stealing , " and added , " If you go on the Internet and get it , you should have to pay for it . "
Nesson accused him of " bias , " and Judge Gertner — over the objection of plaintiffs ' counsel , who argued that the man was stating nothing more than that people should obey the law — expressed concern about the " moral opprobrium " he was attaching to copyright infringement .
The process ultimately resulted in a jury of five men and five women , all drawn from Boston 's suburbs .
According to a list provided by the court ( following a friendly in - chambers conference among Judge Gertner , counsel from both sides , and your humble correspondent ) , the jury consists of the following :
Certified nurse assistant ; F ; Somerset
Pet trainer / secretary ; F ; Plymouth Physician ; M ; Wayland Bank administrator ; F ; Quincy Registered nurse ; F ; Westford Plant quality assurance manager ; F ; Mansfield Associate director ; M ; Milton Salesman ; M ; Milton Medicinal Chemist ; M ; Wakefield ; Business development manager ; M ; Tewksbury
Exploding Styrofoam and Necker Cubes
Opening statements begin Tuesday morning at 9:00 am .
Plaintiffs asked for 20 - 30 minutes , Nesson for 40 .
Nesson gave a brief preview of his opening , at which he plans to use demonstratives , including a Styrofoam box that he said will be used " to show the difference between atoms and bits , which is central to our case . "
" We will object to the exploding Styrofoam , " deadpanned plaintiffs ' attorney Tim Reynolds , though his plea was rejected by Judge Gertner , even as she cautioned Nesson that this was to be an opening statement , not an argument .
Nesson also said he plans to display a poster of a “ Necker Cube . "
Asked why , he would only say , " Tune in tomorrow . "
And we shall , to hear opening statements and the plaintiffs ' first three witnesses : Sony attorney Wade Leak ( who famously testified at the Thomas - Rasset trial that an award of $ 150,000 in statutory damages per work was " absolutely " appropriate ) , Chris Connelly of MediaSentry , and Mark Matteo of Cox Communications .
Judge Gertner promised that the jury would get the case by Friday , though deliberations could potentially stretch into next week .

Codecs for < audio > and < video >
[ This message is bcc'ed to around 100 people who at some point or other sent comments to the WHATWG list on this topic . ]
After an inordinate amount of discussions , both in public and privately , on the situation regarding codecs for < video > and < audio > in HTML5 , I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that there is no suitable codec that all vendors are willing to implement and ship .
I have therefore removed the two subsections in the HTML5 spec in which codecs would have been required , and have instead left the matter undefined , as has in the past been done with other features like < img > and image formats , < embed > and plugin APIs , or Web fonts and font formats .
The current situation is as follows : Apple refuses to implement Ogg Theora in Quicktime by default ( as used by Safari ) , citing lack of hardware support and an uncertain patent landscape .
Google has implemented H.264 and Ogg Theora in Chrome , but cannot provide the H.264 codec license to third - party distributors of Chromium , and have indicated a belief that Ogg Theora 's quality - per - bit is not yet suitable for the volume handled by YouTube .
Opera refuses to implement H.264 , citing the obscene cost of the relevant patent licenses .
Mozilla refuses to implement H.264 , as they would not be able to obtain a license that covers their downstream distributors .
Microsoft has not commented on their intent to support < video > at all .
( Sorry if I 've mischaracterised any positions above ; the positions are relatively subtle and so it 's likely that I have oversimplified matters . )
I considered requiring Ogg Theora support in the spec , since we do have three implementations that are willing to implement it , but it would n't help get us true interoperabiliy , since the people who are willing to implement it are willing to do so regardless of the spec , and the people who are n't are not going to be swayed by what the spec says .
Going forward , I see several ( not mutually exclusive ) possibilities , all of which will take several years : 1 . Ogg Theora encoders continue to improve .
Off - the - shelf hardware Ogg Theora decoder chips become available .
Google ships support for the codec for long enough without getting sued that Apple 's concern regarding submarine patents is reduced . =>
Theora becomes the de facto codec for the Web .
2 . The remaining H.264 baseline patents owned by companies who are not willing to license them royalty - free expire , leading to H.264 support being available without license fees .
=> H.264 becomes the de facto codec for the Web .
When either of these happen , I will reconsider updating HTML5 accodingly .
The situation for audio codecs is similar , but less critical as there are more formats .
Since audio has a much lower profile than video , I propose to observe the audio feature and see if any common codecs surface , instead of specifically requiring any .
I will revisit this particular topic in the future when common codecs emerge .
I would encourage proponents of particular codecs to attempt to address the points listed above , as eventually I expect one codec will emerge as the common codec , but not before it fulfills all these points : - is implementable without cost and distributable by anyone - has off - the - shelf decoder hardware chips available - is used widely enough to justify the extra patent exposure - has a quality - per - bit high enough for large volume sites
This topic received hundreds of e-mails .
Most covered the same points , and I have not replied to each one individually .
I include below a small sample of some of the more interesting e-mails that were sent on this topic , along with some comments .

I agree in principle .
Sadly it seems that we are unable to force the issue through the spec .

It 's unclear to me why Dirac has n't received as close investigation as Theora and H.264 .
I encourage you to approach the browser vendors directly and discuss it with them .
I expect , however , that the situation is basically the same as with Theora ( some UAs would be happy to support it ; others would cite lack of off - the - shelf hardware decoders and an unclear patent landscape ) . >

Is the hardware support something that could be used by Apple in iPods ?

I think this gives the spec more power than it actually has .

Sadly , even if the spec does require something , it 's no guarantee that it 'll remain implemented .
The spec does n't force browsers to do anything .
Implementors only do the parts they want to do .

By making OGG part of the spec .
Unfortunately , it seems that this would not force Apple to implement it .

Joseph is right that I can be bought ... but sadly for me this has never happened with HTML5 . :-(

The problem is that at this point whether the spec requires
Ogg or not wo n't affect which browsers support it .
All the browsers that would support it do support it ; the other browsers would just ignore that part of the spec , which seems like a bad precedent to set .

The text was removed not because of any specific reason Nokia or Apple gave , but because they wo n't implement the requirement .
It actually does n't matter what the reason is in terms of editing the spec .
Mozilla could say " we do n't want to support H.264 because numerology says that 264 is an evil number " , the end result would be the same -- if a browser refuses to implement something , then we can't require it .
( The reasons are relevant when trying to convince them to change their mind , of course , or when trying to find a solution that they would agree to instead -- I 'm not saying we should ignore the reason altogether . )

Putting Ogg Theora in the spec does n't lead to Apple implementing it , it just leads to them ignoring that part of the spec . >

YouTube is n't going to not support the iPhone just because Apple does n't follow HTML5 .
They 're just going to send the iPhone H.264 content ( as they do now ) , leading to Apple 's products using less bandwidth or having higher quality video that the implementations that did follow the spec .
That does n't sound like a particularly good win for the spec . >

But it does mean we end up with exactly the situation we 're in now , with different implementations supporting different codecs and the spec not having any power over this .
I would rather the spec not say anything than say something that will be ignored .

I am incredibly sorry about the state of video codecs in HTML5 .

This is a terrible situation for the spec to be in .

Well we can have the implementations , but there 's not much point having the spec require it if it 's not going to be followed by everyone .

Mozilla also has the power of veto here .
For example , if we required that the browsers implement H.264 , and Mozilla did not , then the spec would be just as equally fictional as it would be if today we required Theora .

No , I 'm just saying that there 's not much point requiring a codec unless everyone implements it .
We do n't gain anything saying " you can do Theora , or you can do something else , you know , whatever you feel like " .
Generally speaking , we do n't specify what other formats are to be supported by an HTML implementation , the only reason to make an exception would be if we could get uniform support across all implementations .

I would be happy to change the spec as soon as all the implementors are willing to implement a common codec . >
Finally , what is Google / YouTube 's official position on this ?
As I understand it , based on other posts to this mailing list in recent days : Google ships both H.264 and Theora support in Chrome ; YouTube only supports H.264 , and is unlikely to use Theora until the codec improves substantially from its current quality - per-bit .

Unfortunately , the organisation to which you refer does not create a standard that can be implemented in and distributed by free and open source software projects , so it does n't really solve the problem at all .

Having significant content using Theora would definitely be one way to address this logjam , in that it would encourage hardware manufacturers to support Theora , and would encourage companies like Apple to support Theora despite the increased patent exposure .

At this point , if a video publisher wants his video to work with existing < video > implementations , Theora and H.264 are the two codecs that are the most effective in each implementation .
I do n't think we need to provide much guidance at this point .
People are n't going to use , say , RealPlayer 's format , because it 's not supported and so would n't work .

Why is this the case for video but not images ?
We do n't require a particular image format for < img > either , but people know you can just PNG and JPEG .

Thank you for this detailed proposal .

MPEG - 1 is nowhere near good enough at this point to be a serious contender .
There have been suggestions that even Theora is n't good enough yet ( for example , YouTube wo n't use Theora with the current state of encoders ) , an it _far_ outperforms MPEG - 1 . -- Ian Hickson U+1047E ) \._.,--...., ' `` . fL http://ln.hixie.ch/

Advertisement Black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates has met the white officer who arrested him in his own home over a beer at the White House .
President Barack Obama organised the meeting between Mr Gates and Sgt Jim Crowley in a bid to defuse the race row triggered by the arrest .
As promised , the three men and Vice - President Joe Biden enjoyed a beer while they discussed the situation .
Mr Obama drew criticism when he described the arrest as " stupid " .
The president said Thursday 's meeting produced a " friendly , thoughtful conversation " .
" I have always believed that what brings us together is stronger than what pulls us apart , " he said in a statement .
" I am confident that has happened here tonight , and I am hopeful that all of us are able to draw this positive lesson from this episode . "
' Narratives about race '
Sgt Crowley said no one had apologised , but the meeting had been " cordial " , and " we agreed to move forward " .
He did not give details of what was discussed .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" What you had today was two gentlemen agree to disagree on a particular issue , " he said .
Mr Gates said he and Sgt Crowley had been cast together as characters " in a thousand narratives about race over which he and I have absolutely no control " .
He said they should both use the opportunity " to foster greater sympathy among the American public for the daily perils of policing on the one hand , and for the genuine fears of racial profiling on the other hand " .
Prof Gates was apprehended at his own home after a witness saw him apparently trying to force his way in .
He was held for disorderly conduct after allegedly accusing the arresting officer , Sgt Crowley , of racism .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This beer stunt is to make more people forget Obama 's disrespect of the our police force Grateful Free , Texas , USA
The arrest sparked a row about the treatment of ethnic minorities by police in America .
Statistics suggest that African - Americans and other minorities are more likely to be stopped by the police than white Americans .
Mr Obama commented on the incident at a televised press conference last week , saying the police had behaved " stupidly " .
He was subsequently criticised for expressing opinions without being in full possession of the facts .
Ahead of the meeting in the White House Rose Garden , Mr Obama dismissed the media 's naming of the meeting as a " beer summit " , saying it was just " three folks having a drink at the end of the day " .
He added : " It 's an attempt to have some personal interaction when an issue has become so hyped and so symbolic that you lose sight of just the fact that these are people involved , including myself , all of whom are imperfect . "
Mr Obama drank a Bud Light , Mr Gates a Sam Adams Light , Sgt Crowley a Blue Moon , and Mr Biden a non-alcoholic Buckler .

Probably the best part of following a logical - conclusion path is when people supporting you with pumping fists , hoots , and hollers start to pump their fists a bit less and do a lot less hooting .
So let me inform you all and the world that , after many months of work and negotiation , I have acquired 10 million expired threads from 4 chan ’s history .
Roughly half a decade ’s worth .
Why ?
Because it ’s part of online history , a study of the human soul when untethered by identity , a way to confirm statements made years ago … any range of reasons which I could not hope to compose out of the air for you .
That ’s not my job .
My job is to save things .
And now I ’ve saved this .
It ’s going on archive.org over the next week .
I ’ll let you know when it ’s done .
It ’s dozens of gigabytes , and I have it in XML , HTML and MYSQL formats , all of which show different parts of the data .
( Conversion strips out some data that original formats might not have , and so on . )
An awful lot of history that we have at our fingertips is because someone , somewhere , hit “ save ” instead of “ delete ” .
Someone did that in this case , and so here we go .
Plan accordingly .

This has been cancelled ( postponed , really , for a few years ) .

LA GRANDE - MOTTE , France ( AP ) 
If age is Lance Armstrong 's enemy , then experience is his friend .
With a savvy sense of the pack and a touch of luck , the 37 - year - old Texan surprised some of the younger Tour de France contenders Monday to move within striking distance of the yellow jersey .
CYCLING BLOG :
You are now entering Lanceland
He made up for what his legs lack in power with road smarts during the breezy third stage along the Mediterranean , rising from 10th to third place .
Armstrong hitched a ride with a breakaway group led by old sidekick George Hincapie 's Team Columbia .
Mark Cavendish , a Columbia rider from Britain , won the stage for the second straight day .
Race leader Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland kept the yellow jersey for a third day in a row .
The Swiss rider with Saxo Bank extended his lead and is ahead of Columbia rider Tony Martin of Germany by 33 seconds and Armstrong by 40 .
Most of the favorites were trapped by the wind during the 122 - mile ride from Marseille to La Grande - Motte .
Sensing the gusts were playing havoc ahead of a turn with about 18 miles to go , Armstrong simply stayed in front , outfoxing riders like Alberto Contador of Spain , the 2007 Tour winner and favorite this year .
" Good positioning , experience , a little bit of luck , " Armstrong said .
" Just before that corner I was 20 guys back and I decided just that idea to move up enough to be on their wheel .
And there it went . "
" Whenever you see a team lined up at the front like that , you have to pay attention , " he added .
" You know what the wind 's doing , and you see that a turn 's coming up , so it does n't take a rocket scientist to know that you have to go to the front . "
But Contador did n't .
Nor did Levi Leipheimer of the United States or Cadel Evans of Australia or 2008 Tour champion Carlos Sastre of Spain .
All lost 41 seconds to Cavendish , Armstrong and Cancellara .
Contador dropped from second to fourth overall , 59 seconds behind Cancellara .
Leipheimer , Armstrong 's Astana teammate , slipped from sixth to 10th , and is 1:11 back .
" I was moving up with a teammate and we ended up in no man 's land , " Contador said .
" I 'm not going to evaluate the team strategy because everyone will draw their own conclusions anyway .
In any case , the Tour wo n't be decided by what happened today . "
Armstrong , a seven - time champion coming out of retirement , agrees .
" Gained valuable time but most likely minor in scheme of 3 weeks , " he wrote on his Twitter account .
The race finishes July 26 in Paris .
" Onward . "
Armstrong said it was " not my objective " to gain ground on Contador , insisting he was " just trying to stay up front and out of trouble . "
But he may have delivered a psychological blow in this stage , leaving rivals to wonder what other opportunistic strikes await .
In any case , now they have to catch him .
Tuesday 's stage is a 24 - mile team time trial that starts and finishes in Montpellier .
Astana will have an edge by riding last and seeing how riders fare .
The teams set off at seven - minute intervals in a race against the clock .
If Astana wins with enough of a gap on Cancellara 's and Martin 's teams , Armstrong could take the yellow jersey .
Is it within reach ?
" Never say never , " Armstrong said .
His performance also fanned questions about who deserves the role of Astana team leader .
Manager Johan Bruyneel , who coached Armstrong during his record run of victories , has said it is Contador .
" I have tried to stay out a little bit of the debate about who is the leader ? "
Armstrong said .
" I have won the Tour seven times , so I think I deserve a bit of credit . "
Armstrong started the stage by playing catch - up .
Stalled by of interviewers and autograph seekers , he was so late to the start he did n't check in at the registration table .
All riders are required to sign in before every stage .
Tour competition director Jean - Francois Pescheux said Armstrong would receive the standard fine of 100 Swiss francs ( $ 92 ) .
Pescheux also criticized Armstrong for not making himself more available to fans .
" We simply asked his team to have a respectful attitude toward the public , " he said .
" They want to see the team , they have been here since 7 a.m. and they do n't see him . "
Armstrong 's comeback to cycling 's premier race after 3 ½ years of retirement has sparked considerable interest .
Big crowds surround the bus to catch a glimpse of him .
" It 's not that we do n't respect the public .
...
We always try to sign in as late as possible because it 's impossible for the riders to come back to the bus ( before the stage ) and there are too many people around Lance and Contador , " Astana team spokesman Philippe Maertens said .
Among those visiting the cycling star Monday in Marseille was actor Ben Stiller .
Armstrong had a brief role in Stiller 's hit comedy Dodgeball .
" I'm a big Lance fan , " Stiller said .
" It 's my first time on the Tour .
It 's the real deal here .
I 'm very excited . "
Riders set off at a snail 's pace in the heat and wind .
The average pace for the first three hours was less than 22 mph .
Cavendish , with his sixth
Tour stage win , finished in 5 hours , 1 minute , 24 seconds .
" It was brilliant , " Cavendish said .
" We were the only sprint team that wanted to ride today . "

Numerous BitTorrent - enabled TV devices are jostling for position next to your TV these days , but a new entrant to the market attracts the eye not because of what it has , but for what it does n't .
CinemaCube is a BitTorrent - enabled set - top box that goes for the less - is - more angle , at a price most people can afford .
Weighing in at a svelte 1.5 pounds and a compact 8.2 x 5.5 x 1.8 inches , CinemaCube is a brand new HD multimedia BitTorrent - enabled set - top box .
CinemaCube connects to your regular TV .
It has an HDMI port and supports HD content up to 720 p .
It has all the usual analog and composite connections , S - Video and S / PDIF and plays back a multitude of formats including Xvid , DivX , AVI , H.264 , MP4 , MP2 , RMVB , WMV , MP4 , MKV , JPEG , BMP and PNG .
Audio formats are also supported including FLAC , AAC , OGG and WAV .
Crucially for TorrentFreak readers , all of the above media can be acquired via the machine ’s built - in BitTorrent client or from your existing PC archive via the built in 10/100 network socket .
Of course , there are many other set - top style boxes with these type of capabilities these days but what sets CinemaCube out from the competition is what it does n’t have .
For starters the device does n’t have a built in hard drive .
Instead , CinemaCube has USB 2.0 connectivity which means that you can use your own external units or take advantage of small and cheap USB memory sticks which simply plug in .
For green - minded individuals , due to the lack of a hard drive CinemaCube does n’t have a thirst for power consumption either , using only 10 watts of electricity when downloading via BitTorrent .
Perhaps most importantly , the device also lacks a big price tag .
Unlike other admittedly higher - spec boxes , CinemaCube from brite - View costs just $ 89.99 , putting it in reach of even the most frugal BitTorrent user .
Graphene Energy are on track on have a graphene - based ultra capacitor by year 's end .
This will have at least twice the storage capacity of commercially available ultracapacitors .
Ultracapcitors promises to be a cost - effective , high - power and high - capacity energy storage solution .
Unlike batteries , Ultracapacitors can store and deliver energy in very short time , thus making them most suitable for high power density applications .
Graphene Energy are using Graphene for the capacitor electrodes with expectation of power densities surpassing any other known form of activated Carbon electrodes due to its large and readily accessible surface area .
" Graphene 's surface area of 2630 m2 / gram , almost the area of a football field in about 1/500th of a pound of material .
This means that a greater number of positive or negative ions in the electrolyte can form a layer on the graphene sheets resulting in exceptional levels of stored charge " says Graphene Energy .
The company is seeking funding , to enable them to setup manufacturing for this new ultra capacitor .
They will also need a large supply of graphene - which is still not available today .
They are in talks with several startups that produce Grapene , and might be able to scale up production .
A judge in the US state of South Carolina has ordered the closure of a funeral home where an employee cut off the legs of a 6ft 7in ( 2 m ) body .
The worker used an electric saw to sever James Hines 's legs at the calf to make his body fit the coffin in 2004 .
The owner had contested the revocation of his licence , saying he was absent when the incident happened and pointing to an otherwise unblemished record .
But after a brief hearing , the judge confirmed the business should close .
Earlier this year the owner of the funeral parlour in Allendale admitted that his father , who helped with cleaning and embalming bodies , had sawn off Mr Hines 's legs .
The admission came after a former employee told police about the incident , four years after it happened .
In April South Carolina 's funeral board exhumed the body and found the severed legs in the coffin .
Mr Hines has since been reburied in another coffin .
The occupying workers have told the BBC that management yesterday gave them a deadline of 22:30 to walk out of the factory and keep their redundancy pay , otherwise they would be sacked .
The workers ignored the threat .
“ Obviously we stayed in ” said one .
He added : “ We did n’t want it to come to this . ”
The occupying workers have now committed themselves – if they are forced to back down now , they will lose everything .
And the police are ( unlawfully ) increasing pressure – despite the claim of Inspector Paul Savill that “ we would only step in if there was a rise in criminality , and we have not seen that , ” and despite having no injunction to act on the private property of the Vestas site , police have occupied the lower floor of the building , preventing other workers from entering the occupation .
Some in riot gear have attempted to enter the occupied upper storey .
Most importantly , they have forcibly prevented protestors from delivering food to the workers inside , attempting literally to starve the occupiers out , and facilitating the disgraceful and demeaning offer from Vestas management to the occupiers that they would be given food if they came out of the building .
It is now vital that the occupiers receive concrete support from organisations and individuals .
There has been a picket line 200 - strong outside the factory , which has been described as ‘ crucial ’ to the morale of the occupying workers .
If you would like to join the picket , or the environmental camp reported to have been set up near the gates , or the community campaign being set up on the island to support occupiers and their families , details on travel to the Isle of Wight are at the bottom of this update .
If you cannot make it to the Isle of Wight yourself , convince other people who can – support at the factory itself is vital to the morale of the workers who in occupying the factory still have the power to force the government to step in .
Come to the Isle of Wight TODAY to join the community campaign :
We have set up a campaign for Vestas workers ’ families and Isle of Wight residents to show their support for keeping jobs at Vestas .
The families and communities campaign will be very important in keeping spirits up through this stressful time .
For more details call 07775 763750 .
PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION on Friday
Come to St Thomas Square in Newport at 5:30 pm on Friday 24th July where we will be making a very public display of how we feel about the Vestas closures !
If you cannot make it to the Isle yourself there are also things you can do from home to support the workers :
– Send messages of support to savevestas@googlemail.com – this lets the workers in the factory know that they have the support of people around the country and , hopefully , around the world .
– Donate to the Vestas Fighting Fund :
Cheques Payable to ‘ Ryde and East Wight Trades Union ’
Send Cheques to :
22 Church Lane
Ryde
Isle of Wight
PO33 2NB
( suggest writing in with the cheque that you wish it to go to the Vestas Fighting Fund )
– Bombard Ed Miliband : let the government know the public will not let them wriggle out of their commitment to green energy when they have an opportunity to bail out a green energy company the way they did the Oyal Bank of Scotland .

Anarchism , Violence , and Brandon Darby 's Politics of Moral Certitude
by MJ Essex Friday , Jun. 26 , 2009 at 12:59 AM
In post -Katrina New Orleans , anarchist truths found fertile , if toxic grounds to take root and grow .
New paths were walked on .
Antiauthoritarian principles emerged as important guides for both reconstruction and the struggle against disaster capitalism .
A million or more equally important stories can now be told about mutual aid , cooperation , subversion of authority , disruption of state and capitalist plans .
And yet Brandon Darby 's morality tale has become a media darling , due in no small part to his perfect and full adoption of his role as a state agent , regardless of whether it was official in 2006 , or whether the FBI is still cutting him paychecks .
We owe it to ourselves to tell these other stories of New Orleans , St. Paul and beyond .
brandondarby - 225.jpg , image / jpeg , 225x154
I was in Austin , Texas of all places when the story of Brandon Crowder and David McKay first broke ; two young men arrested in St. Paul , charged with planning to use firebombs during the RNC .
They were quickly demonized by the media , portrayed as dangerously idealistic young men bent on terroristic violence .
Crowder and McKay have been convicted and are serving sentences of two and four years respectively .
It was not long after their arrest when case files started to leak out .
By this time I was back in New Orleans , a place I 've been living and working , on and off since Katrina , since I came down here like thousands of others to work in solidarity with the displaced and dispossessed .
From the big humid city one day I remember reading a press report identifying one  Brandon Darby  as an FBI informant who would provide key evidence and testimony against Crowder and McKay .
Speculation was quick and intense : was this the same Darby from Austin , Texas who had worked in New Orleans after Katrina at Common Ground ?
Darby himself soon fessed up to the facts and revealed his status as an FBI informant in a now infamous open letter published on Indymedia .
Darby 's role as an FBI informant has been incredibly destructive .
He has directly facilitated the incarceration of two men through a diligent entrapment scheme .
The Minneapolis Star - Tribune reported after the conclusion of both trials that , McKay 's claims that he was entrapped by informant Brandon Darby gained ground with some of the jurors at his trial .
A mistrial was declared after the jury deadlocked .
McKay pleaded guilty before his second trial , facing an uphill battle against the prosecution and public opinion .
It is also likely that Darby has supplied federal agents with extensive information about dozens upon dozens of individuals who once worked with him , some who called him a friend , not just in Austin , but also in New Orleans , and perhaps elsewhere .
Darby 's betrayal of antiauthoritarian organizers , and the damage he has done runs even deeper than this , however .
Based on popular narratives being circulated in the media about Darby , told largely on his terms , he and his sympathetic profilers have developed a story about violence , morality and authority which tells us that for all its shortcomings , the state is benevolent , the police are our protectors , the feds are our friends , and in the end , authority is necessary .
Darby situates the story of his conversion into an authoritarian in his experiences running with radical antiauthoritarians in post -Katrina New Orleans .
In doing so he is now helping to obliterate some of the most profound truths about antiauthoritarian possibilities in the wake of the storm .
This may be his most destructive and lasting legacy , whether he was a state mole from day one , or really is just a volunteer collaborator with Uncle Sam .
New Antiauthoritarian Possibilities ?
The quick and over - bearing presence of certain arms of the state and certain kinds of bureaucratic forces in Katrina 's aftermath  the presence of heavily armed police , military units , and the private military corporations , as well as the highly criminalizing and punitive aid  agencies like FEMA  revealed the most basic function of the state in Louisiana : the protection of private and corporate property , and the maintenance of violent class , race , and gender inequalities .
The days and weeks after Katrina was a period of intense state ( and white vigilante ) violence directed at certain communities , the function of which was to make clear that the hurricane would in no way lead to any recasting of the social order along more egalitarian lines .
State and vigilante violence was overwhelmingly designed to reconstitute the pre-Katrina hierarchy by suppressing all thoughts of rebellion against wealth , power , and government .
Partly because of these ultra-violent state activities , Katrina 's aftermath resulted the simultaneous de-legitimation of state authority along with the exercise of collective , egalitarian powers through mutual aid and grassroots insurgency .
Several criminologists have gone so far as to define the behavior of state officials and government agencies during the Katrina crisis as a state crime of omission ,  marking them not only as illegitimate , but criminally negligent .
According to these unlikely critics ,  this failure to engage resources to lessen the impact of a known and profound threat represents a crime of omission in the same way that state crime scholars have framed governmental failures to address known harms such as HIV / AIDS , black infant mortality , environmental contamination , homelessness , and unsafe working environments . 
While many commentators have marked Katrina the nadir and unraveling of the Bush presidency , even more so , it was a crack in the monolithic authority of the US state through which the light of new political visions and possibilities stole through , if ever briefly .
Many were willing and able to see anew and believe that forms of autonomous power could exercised constructively inside the US .
That this all occurred during one of the bloodier stretches of the Iraq war , an occupation that has elicited significant opposition from the beginning , especially among working class Americans , further increased the significance of Katrina as a moment of anarchic angst and yearning .
More than yearning , this moment produced actual collective responses against the state crime that was Katrina .
Gulf Coast communities banded together in spite of the state to defend themselves .
Many communities have had to fight the government to secure a right of return .
This struggle has resulted in an interesting social mobilization marked by its anarchistic formations , tactics , and desires .
Imperfect and sometimes counterproductive , thousands of organizers and hundreds of thousands of regular folks have struggled across racial , class , gender , language , nationality , age and other lines of difference in ways that go beyond the standards of US activist reformism .
Post - Katrina New Orleans has seen experimental forms of self - organization and resistance  that while their practitioners may not describe as anarchistic are nonetheless of like mind and spirit .
New pathways of consciousness , solidarity , and struggle have been walked upon .
New political possibilities now exist because of the Right of Return Movement , even if much went wrong and many potentials were underdeveloped due to our own racism , class divisions , patriarchal tendencies and other internalized oppressions .
That these were evoked , challenged , and in some cases even transcended , all in the context of autonomous organizing has been a valuable developmental process in itself .
As the sociologist Paul Stock has pointed out , postimpact disaster periods may be one of the best examples of actual anarchy we have in the United States ,  because they involve local spontaneous cooperation and prosocial behavior , regardless , and often in spite of the state 's efforts to exert its authority and violent control over the situation .
As Stock has also been keen to point out , state officials and the corporate media seem to have recognized this also , albeit in ideologically polluted ways .
Their various statements and reports to justify the enormous police and military presence following the flood portrayed it all as necessary to prevent anarchy from breaking out .
Of course for them , anarchy ,  is a term drained of its actual meaning and instead serving only to conjure images of black looters and gun wielding  thugs ,  or irrational and incompetent activists playing in sandboxes while the real work of law , order , and reconstruction goes on around them .
These early attempts by politicians like governor Blanco ( who gave her infamous  shoot to kill  order days after the storm ) , and Jimmy Ries ( the New Orleans power broker who hired Israeli commandos to patrol his un-flooded neighborhood ) along with corporate news outlets to define anarchy during the catastrophe as a situation of antisocial violence was designed to make the heavy hand of the state appear necessary and good .
Only state violence could restore rational , pro-social behavior , and commerce , officials and media pundits proclaimed .
This was the first and foremost attempt of authoritarian institutions ( state , military , media , corporations ) to temper the larger post - disaster political narrative .
They sought to eradicate the emergent possibilities stemming from the state 's obvious violence and antisocial prerogatives .
Their goal was to stamp out the notion that explicitly antiauthoritarian and autonomous forms of organizing and aid had any positive role to play in the wake of the flood and future of New Orleans .
The Crescent City Connection Brandon Darby 's turncoat story , now popularized most conspicuously on state - funded radio's This American Life , and the flagship newspaper of the corporate media , The New York Times ( and many other media outlets ) is the second major attempt by the culture industry to popularize a misunderstanding of antiauthoritarian politics , one that is in fact totally anathema to anarchist history , theory , and practice .
Darby 's desire to sanctify his behavior ( and perhaps to recapture his heroic - rebel identity ) has offered up a compelling parable to this wider ideological project .
Darby 's narrative has been seized upon in no small part because it offers a simple and defamatory story about anarchism in America : that it is a movement of naive idealists and violent terrorists .
His story obscures many different , more widely experienced stories about antiauthoritarian currents in post - Katrina New Orleans ( and the anti-war movement ) , stories that offer a much more complex , challenging , and hopeful body of knowledge about wins and losses , mistakes and triumphs , pitfalls and possibilities .
Instead , Darby and the corporate / state media have managed to eclipse these knowledges with an egotistical morality tale and anti-political rant , one that ends with an anti-revolutionary conclusion .
For This American Life Darby 's interlocutor , Michael May , tells Darby 's story sympathetically and rather accurately , splicing a few critical moments here and there .
Darby , we are told , grew up in Texas , self - taught , troubled and angry with authority , and in his own words believed for years that the government was out of control and that it did n't have any concern for the average person , and then Katrina happened . 
Darby 's Katrina story is well known , even if has been embellished and exaggerated over time .
He went to New Orleans , made it into the flooded city , helped Robert Hillary King evacuate , helped to found Common Ground , and stayed on and off for several stints .
His days in New Orleans are remembered with very mixed feelings by those who knew and worked with him .
Almost everyone agrees that he was often shockingly reckless and erratic .
A statement from the National Committee to Free the Angola 3 , a group that supported King during his time in jail as one of these three , expressed shortly after Darby published his open letter that ,  there was always this manic , reckless side to him that was more than a little unsettling .
Many agree that he was also passionate and hard working .
Long before his role as an FBI informant was revealed he had gained notoriety among many organizers as a misogynistic and macho presence , an often loose canon .
After his open letter admitting his work for the FBI many New Orleans ' organizers remarked to me privately that they had always had doubts about the man .
 Dude was nuts ,  and dangerous ,  I have been told .
Others who were at common ground for considerable time and saw Darby come and go , especially as Operations Director in 2006 , remarked that they were n't at all surprised , and that his behavior at Common Ground now made more sense .
Some organizers recalled his divide and conquer tactics , his agitation , heavy handedness , and bullying ways .
Scott Crow and Malik Rahim are even quoted several times on This American Life .
Both agree that Darby 's overall presence at Common Ground almost tore the organization apart .
Many New Orleanians , including Rahim , have remarked that Darby must have been on FBI payroll then , employed to undermine Common Ground and the Right of Return Movement .
Whether this is true or not will be hard to prove , but it would hardly be the first time federal or local police tried to mow down grassroots New Orleans .
Rahim and other black radicals have many tales to tell about the FBI and NOPD 's calculating efforts to destroy them and their movements in the early 1970s .
Almost equally damaging as anything Darby could have done as an activists / agent in post - Katrina New Orleans , however , is what he is currently doing , through his eagerness to retell his story in the mass media .
It is another example of his cooperation with authoritarian institutions bent on shaping many people 's understanding of how radical anti-authoritarians responded to Katrina and the wider political possibilities that were opened up by the storm .
The looming narrative now being developed for a national audience is that Darby , once a radical and self - described revolutionary  has seen the inside of the radical anti-authoritarian movement within the United States , that a significant part of this inside scoop was acquired in New Orleans at Common Ground , and that at its core this movement is a threat to peace and freedom .
According to Darby , and told through the reporting of various journalists who have interviewed him , the antiauthoritarian movement is violent , irrational , nihilistic , and it must be stopped .
Darby points to several personal experiences during and after his days in New Orleans to justify his disillusionment and turn toward the badge of authority .
On This American Life he recalls a trip to Venezuela to speak to the government about hurricane aid .
He claims a Venezuelan official invited him to meet leaders of the FARC , a Marxist insurgency defined by the Columbian and US governments as narco - terrorists .
Darby says it was a major shock to him , and gives the impression to listeners that he refused out of moral repulsion .
For a story about Darby and the Texas Two , Rahim told a reporter from the Austin Chronicle , " I think that Brandon had a nervous breakdown in Venezuela and that when he came back he was messed up in the head [ . ]
At the very beginning , he was helpful , but after Venezuela , he became harmful .
...
He did everything he could to destroy St. Mary's , which was where we were housing the majority of our volunteers , by letting a bunch of crackheads move in there .
And he also drove a wedge between me and Lisa Fithian and eventually caused her to leave , too .
He was doing everything you 're supposed to do as a government agent in that situation .
Divide and conquer . "
Darby has recalled feeling angry at having been sent to Venezuela by Common Ground , and put in a position of seeking funds to undermine the Bush administration ,  feeling that this was a violation of his morals .
Another example is Darby 's recollection of his interactions with struggling New Orleans homeowners who when offered  Chavez Trailers  paid for by the South American leader Hugo Chavez , turned them down .
 Nah bro , I love my country ,  Darby recalls them saying .
 I do n't want a home paid for by the Ayatollah . 
What an Ayatollah ( a Persian - Islamic clerical title ) has to do with Venezuela , and why Darby conflates this Islamic term with a secular Latin American state in his story is not explained , but the impression is he gives is that Common Ground was purely out to do things designed to embarrass the US government .
He portrays the organization as making irrational anti-American postures , and seeking alliances with enemies of the Bush administration , anything but pursuing practical , egalitarian solutions to obstacles in the way of community recovery .
It 's interesting also to hear Darby 's list of reasons why Common Ground was problematic as it helps locate some of his own assumptions and motivations .
On this American Life and in several interviews with the press he briefly revisits conflicts within Common Ground over the structure of the organization , decision making processes , and leadership , all which led him to believe that consensus does n't work , that strong and clear lines of authority are required , that the police are our friends .
The anarchism  he depicts is an idealistic and counterproductive mental illness .
Again , this sounds like a scripted yarn , cooked up in some smoke filled room deep inside the J. Edgar Hoover Building by COINTELPRO - like strategists to undermine the collective experiences many of us have had in post - Katrina New Orleans .
In his radio interview he recounts railing against the attempt of kitchen staff to impose vegan diets on everyone , and against the attempts of other organizers to open up organizer 's meetings to wider numbers of Common Ground volunteers , or to delegate responsibilities more broadly in the organization .
Darby vented to one reporter that " for some , Common Ground might have been about creating a little anarchist utopia .
For me , it was about helping people have their rights heard and have their homes [ restored ] , and it was about getting things done . "
Getting things done , other organizers recall , meant to Darby that it was okay for him to run roughshod over others and assume positions of leadership without the consent of others .
Some of Darby 's broad brush criticisms about Common Ground and about the presence of self - identified anarchist ( mostly visiting young white men and women ) in New Orleans will ring with a kernel of truth for anyone who spent time in and around the organization 's various 9th Ward volunteer centers , distribution centers , and the House of Excellence ( computer / legal aid / media center ) .
I spent a total of two weeks at Common Ground in the Winter of 2005 , so my own perspectives are gleaned mostly from discussions with other long - term organizers of that collective .
It 's true that Common Ground was often too disorganized to be effective on some fronts .
Volunteers often made decisions that were n't in the best interest of the communities hosting them , and with whom they were attempting to work in solidarity with .
Many locals did n't share some of the particular critiques of government , the police , and capitalism that some Common Grounders proffered ( although members of the local community have actually articulated more radical and complex critiques of government and power than the average Common Ground volunteer ever has ) .
Of particular importance , some locals steered clear of Common Ground and many of the organization 's political protest tactics because of their fears of police reprisal , but certainly not out of a collective opposition to the organization 's politics .
For This American Life , the struggle of public housing residents against the demolition of their homes is presented as an example of the impracticality and foolishness of anarchist direct action .
Many out - of - town , white , antiauthoritarians volunteered to conduct confrontational direct action protests against the demolitions , often involving trespassing , whereas many residents and other black supporters of public housing feared the Housing Authority , the police , and federal government .
It was clear to locals , especially blacks , that the authorities would arrest anyone in their way , and that getting locked up as a working class black New Orleanian is a whole different ballgame than going to jail as a white , out - of - town organizer .
Locals often kept a low - profile at these protests , not because they differed with the visions and goals of Common Ground 's volunteers indeed , CG volunteers were attempting to take their cues from local organizers working closely with public housing resident leaders  but because they feared violent reprisal from the state .
Darby and This American Life leave us with an impression , however , of naive young radicals fighting a battle they knew nothing of , and which many locals did n't support .
The truth does n't matter to Darby , to Public Radio , and to millions of Americans for whom this little story proves a prejudiced point : cross racial and class alliances in post - Katrina New Orleans were silly and often wrong .
The state was acting responsibly and for the general welfare .
Common Ground Had Much Deeper Problems , Like Its Brandon Darbys Common Ground has been called an anarchist - inspired organization mostly because of its founders ' and volunteers ' affinity to this political philosophy .
It was built up by elder Black Panthers in cooperation with younger , mostly white radicals from Texas .
Others have noted the organization 's chaotic and decentralized  structure , and the absence of a clear chain of command , which when compared to the major disaster relief NGOs like Red Cross is a fair assessment .
But Common Ground was chaotic for reasons having less to do with its de-centered structure and more to do with egoism and internal power struggles between men like Darby .
One volunteer who left CG after a month to organize with migrant workers and the Peoples Hurricane Relief Fund wrote up an excellent critique of the organization ,  Finding Common Ground . 
This reflection was circulated in the Spring of 2006 and generated some productive discussion .
It mostly addressed the dominance of several male organizers , explaining how this obvious violation of egalitarian principles and a developing tyranny of structurelessness , combined with the raw bullying of some , was slowly debilitating the organization and preventing it from doing any good at all .
This volunteer 's main point was that making the organization more transparent , its leadership structure more accountable and representative of differences , and by making it all more participatory ( all very antiauthoritarian suggestions ) would strengthen Common Ground.viii Another excellent critique of Common Ground is Rachel Luft 's  Looking for Common Ground ,  an article that explores the racist - colonial tendencies of the organization through a detailed study of sexual assaults that took place within its 9th Ward volunteer center in the Spring and Summer of 2006 .
According to Luft , a series of sexual assaults , the vast majority perpetrated by white , male volunteers against white , female volunteers was dealt with poorly by the group .
Because these assaults were not approached intersectionally ( in a way that acknowledges the co-constitution of racism and patriarchy ) the group ended up focusing on an imagined threat from the external community ( the majority black neighborhood around them ) and failed to address the assaults occurring within .
Luft has coined a useful term for this and wider examples of sexism expressed in the post - Katrina context ,  disaster masculinity . 
According to Luft , this is a mode of behavior in which hyper - masculine attributes are exercised freely to dominate others in a crisis setting .
Darby , among others , has been extensively critiqued for this .
Common Ground co-founder Lisa Fithian has described Darby 's behavior as  Wild West shit ,  saying that , he was able to set some patterns in motion that I believe led to systemic issues of sexual abuse , sexual harassment , and violence .
He kicked the door down of a women 's center at 2 am to throw a guy out ; he kicked in the door of a trailer where there were volunteers with guns on them .
He did a lot of Wild West shit  Mister Macho Action Hero . "
Disaster masculinity was mostly unexamined by Common Ground and other antiauthoritarian organizers in post -Katrina New Orleans .
Nevertheless , Common Ground 's greatest failings during this phase in its existence had little to do with anarchism as an organizing principle , and a lot to do with the egos and authoritarian tendencies of many of the group 's leaders .
Ironically these were often expressed in a vulgar  I am more radical / anarchist than thou fashion , or in Darby 's case , in a creeping - authoritarian , masculine , and violent fashion posing as a pragmatic get shit done mentality .
However , to read popular media accounts of Darby 's time in New Orleans where he locates the origins of his doubts about revolutionary politics  gives a sense that anarchism is an inept ideal leading to incompetence , and frustrated acts of violence .
Darby and his media profilers portray him as someone hurried to accomplish good , to save lives , and that his efforts were impeded by these wild - eyed , utopian radicals .
Embracing the State Ultimately , Darby explains his full and final betrayal of friends and fellow organizers as a moral issue .
The invitation to meet FARC leadership , his realization that Common Ground was undermining  the US government , that his colleagues were making dangerous alliances with the  Ayatollah ,  the elder Black Panthers giving Common Ground and other organizations long - term vision ; he seems to be concluding that it was all misguided , serving only to create unnecessary violence in the world .
Recently Darby has made statements to the press concerning his love for country , his alliance with the FBI and state , and against anyone who would do harm to his patria .
If we are to believe his tale as it has been told through the corporate and state media , then in the end Darby , like most Americans , is simply a terrified authoritarian .
Sadly , this is the most conciliatory thing that can be said about him .
In bad faith he has fled from the ambiguity of freedom and the inner struggle required to assess each and every act of violence or nonviolence , justice or injustice , within the wider field of already occurring violence and injustice .
He has sought out moral certitude in the authority of the state , through an alliance with the FBI .
No statement of his better sums up this retreat from the ambiguity of freedom than this bizarre piece of advice to those seeking social justice : " I 've watched countless activists begin to work in the Legislature and begin to do things that participate in the system ; we have a system that is wide open for our involvement .
You can get involved and have a say so ; if you disagree with the way our city is run , you can get involved .
If you have an ideological bent that 's on social justice , you can become a law enforcement officer , you can get involved with the FBI , or a lawyer . "
Darby justifies his work as an informant by explaining that he was out to stop two young men from possibly doing harm to someone , from doing violence during the protest against the Republican National Convention .
As a contingency plan , after their shields had been confiscated by the police ( due to a tip from Darby actually ) McKay and Crowder had fashioned several Molotovs and planned to burn out police cars in a parking lot .
According to trial documents acquired by the RNC Felony Working Group , Darby conferred with McKay about the plans : Darby says he warned McKay of the consequences of using the Molotovs during this conversation , saying ( to paraphrase in brief ) " you have to willing to go to prison for a long time if you get caught .
I am a revolutionary but I dont think there is any shame in backing out now and I wouldnt tell anyone that you backed out . 
Darby says McKay claimed he still wanted to use them .
Darby says he asked McKay ,  What if an officer gets hurt ?  to which McKay responded  It s worth it if an officer gets hurt . 
Moral Clarity and Violence ?
This acceptance of an undesired hypothetical proposed by Darby was enough to send McKay to jail , along with Crowder , enough to malign the entire dominant narrative about the anti-RNC protests for those millions of Americans who simply digested it on the evening news , and enough to plant in the heads of millions of Americans reading stories about the Texas
Two that anarchy  is solely about violence and recklessness .
Darby explains himself after the fact , saying one morning , I woke up and realized that I disagree with the group I was associating with as much as I disagree with the Republican Party . 
He has even implied that his actions were to defend the rights of Republicans and peaceful protestors to gather in St. Paul for the RNC and to express themselves through their constitutional rights .
While McKay and Crowder never sought to kill or harm anyone , just to destroy police cruisers , they have been vilified along with the radical antiauthoritarian politics of justice they represent , their names and faces flashed across TV screens and in newspapers from coast to coast as examples of the enemy within .
All of which brings us to the question of violence and morality .
Alexander Berkman , a brilliant and brave organizer , a thinker and direct actionist who once attempted to kill a man of great wealth and authority with his own hands , wrote up this possible exchange between an authoritarian and a radical to try to inject some clarity into the subject of political violence :  Yes , Anarchists have thrown bombs and have sometimes resorted to violence .
 There you are ! " your friend exclaims .
" I thought so . "
But do not let us be hasty .
If Anarchists have sometimes employed violence , does it necessarily mean that Anarchism means violence ?
Ask yourself this question and try to answer it honestly .
When a citizen puts on a soldier 's uniform , he may have to throw bombs and use violence .
Will you say , then , that citizenship stands for bombs and violence ?
You will indignantly resent the imputation .
It simply means , you will reply , that under certain conditions a man may have to resort to violence .
The man may happen to be a Democrat , a Monarchist , a Socialist , Bolshevik , or Anarchist .
You will find that this applies to all men and to all times .
Just what these conditions are is up to each and every individual to decide .
This is the daunting freedom and discomfort of anarchism .
When one becomes a citizen ,  even an agent of the state , as Darby has done , she or he in - effect makes a choice to no longer have to make choices .
Now they can simply take orders , march in line , fire on command , and tune - in to the news at 10 where the corporate media presents parables like the case of the terrible Texas Two .
The Republican Party held its convention and at last count the only serious violence that occurred was police brutality against demonstrators .
Of course the authoritarian will argue that there might have been more like McKay and Crowder who without the intervention of the brave FBI would have done harm to someone , somehow .
But even if demonstrators had rushed police barricades , burned out police cars , stormed the convention and shut it down , even if they had gone so far as to physically attack , perhaps even kill some of those Republican Party bosses in attendance , particularly those in the party 's uppermost ranks who have more or less run the federal government from 2000 to 2008 , how would this violence morally compare to that which the Republican controlled United States of America has been visiting upon Iraq and Afghanistan during this span of time ?
How would it morally compare to the torture operations , the secrete prison network , extraordinary renditions , the assassinations , the firing of missiles and collateral  killing of civilians in North Africa , Pakistan , Yemen , and elsewhere ?
Is it equivalent ?
If it is different , how so ?
How is it different beyond the mere illusion of legitimacy provided by the state so that these murderers could gather last summer in Minnesota to nominate their next war president ?
Keep in mind again that Mckay and Crowder intended to do nothing remotely approaching these hypotheticals .
Their goal seems to have been to destroy police property as revenge against the police confiscation of a trailer filled with shields to protect RNC protestors from police assault .
Nevertheless , how would this hypothetical violence against the Republican Party 's leadership compare to the massive violence they are responsible for through the weapons manufacturing companies they own ( the majority of military contracting corporations are owned and operated by men who donate huge sums to the RNC , and sometimes take leaves of absence run for office through the Party , e.g. George H.W. Bush , Richard Cheney , Don Rumsfeld . et al. ) .
How would it compare to the federal , state , and increasingly private prison systems they operate ( which disproportionately lock up people of color , especially blacks ) ; the huge transnational energy and mining corporations they own and operate and which are responsible for unthinkable ecological crimes and human rights abuses , from the Gulf Coast to Nigeria and Indonesia ( again , another pair of industries strongly aligned with the RNC ) ?
What about the violence McKay and Crowder now face from guards and inmates , the people who will ass - rape us ,  as Darby described it to McKay and Crowder during one conversation in which he also teased them as tofu- eaters ,  and told them point blank : " I 'm going to shut this fucker [ RNC ] down [...] any group I go with will be successful .
[ The ] process is developed by working together , not by sitting down like lawyers to work it out first . 
Darby said he was n't there to fuck around - direct action is intense , and we can all expect to have violence used against us . "
What about that violence ?
One of the twisted lessons of Darby 's parable is that that violence is excused and ignored because it is state violence .
All state violence , were are to believe , has moral authority .
Anyone who accepts their freedom and responsibility to treat all others as beings with rights cannot accept this position , however .
Anarchism does n't offer moral certitude or eternal comfort in one 's choices .
It demand the recognition of ambiguity , complexity , contradiction , and the flux of life .
It requires that each and every individual make their own ethical judgements , not to seek comfort in the morality of authority .
Antiauthoritarianism offers a collective way of coming to moral consensus , or not , which stands counterposed to the state 's forceful hegemony .
As violent as it is , bending to the state 's demand for legitimacy , its Weberian core ( the state being an entity which proclaims the sole legitimate use of force in a given territory ) produces a feeling of comfort and assuredness in those who obey .
If it is anything , anarchism is a most uncomfortable and burdensome ethic because it gives us all freedom , and excuses no act of violence , whether it is perpetrated by the state , or a terrorist . 
All harm is harm .
We are already born into a world of incredible violence .
Most violence is in support of upholding ongoing structures of oppression .
To choose freedom and make ethical choices in this kind of world is inherently antiauthoritarian and daunting .
A major significance of the Katrina crisis for anarchist theories and practices has been the multiple , complex , and often contradictory experiences of people organizing in this context .
What can these experiences can teach us about liberation ?
What went wrong ?
What did we do right ?
Where did we fail to build solidarity and where did we succeed ?
In what ways did we successfully respond to the state 's omissions , its violence , or to the predatory behaviors of urban capitalism ?
And how did we respond to our own failures , our own acts of oppression and aggression ?
The world is a complicated and contradictory reality of already existing forms of violence , oppression , suffering , all sedimented in durable sets of power relations in which we must act .
While anarchists act toward common ideals , there are few self - identified anarchist who are utopian enough to believe that we can all agree on this end goal , or even if we could , that it would ever be reached .
Most self - identified anarchists I have met in New Orleans are like those I know across the United States : they do n't believe in unity around an end goal .
They recognize that utopian visions are more often than not components of authoritarian projects that justify violence in the name of order and progress .
They recognize the dreams of capitalist globalization and liberal democracy as possessing these imposing agendas , not unlike other political philosophies or projects that seek to create unity under state government , or one capitalist market .
Of utmost importance , anarchism offers no ultimate moral clarity for us to discover what needs doing , how it must be done , and why .
Instead , it offers a political philosophy of freedom and responsibility to act against the organized forms of authoritarian violence and hierarchical oppression of the state , capital , patriarchy , and white supremacy .
If it is anything , anarchism is a skepticism of concentrated power and authority and a creative exploration of increasingly egalitarian and free forms of relating to one another through cooperation .
It requires humility and agnosticism to questions of what is ultimately right and moral .
Instead , it challenges us to incessantly search for better means and ends , knowing that the search , the process itself is joyful and painful .
In post -Katrina New Orleans , anarchist truths found fertile , if toxic grounds to take root and grow in .
New paths were walked on .
Antiauthoritarian principles both emerged as an important guide for reconstruction and the struggle against disaster capitalism .
A million or more equally important stories can now be told about mutual aid , cooperation , subversion of authority , disruption of state and capitalist plans .
And yet Brandon Darby 's morality tale has become a media darling , due in no small part to his perfect and full adoption of his role as a state agent , regardless of whether it was official in 2006 , or whether the FBI is still cutting him paychecks .
We owe it to ourselves to tell these other stories of New Orleans , St. Paul and beyond .

Rising binge drinking is forcing changes to Italy 's relationship with alcohol Milan has banned the consumption and sale of alcohol to young teenagers in an effort to curb binge - drinking .
Parents of children under the age of 16 caught drinking wine or spirits will be liable to heavy fines of up to 500 Euros ( $ 700 ; £ 450 ) .
A third of 11 - year - olds in the city have alcohol related problems , it says .
In a country where for centuries wine has been part of local culture - and prohibition would be unthinkable - the ban has come as a shock .
But the authorities are deeply concerned about the increase in consumption of alcohol by children as young as 11 in the country 's industrial and financial capital .
So as an experiment , supplying alcohol - either wine or spirits - to youths under the age of 16 in bars , restaurants , pizza shops and liquor stores will be banned .
HAVE YOUR SAY A ban on adults setting a bad example might be at least as beneficial Rita Kleppmann , Essingen Heavy fines will be imposed on the parents of offending children and on shopkeepers or bar owners who serve them .
A national law banning the sale of alcohol to under - 16s is only loosely enforced , as Italian families are used to sometimes giving young children a teaspoon of wine as a family party treat .
In past centuries , Italian children would sometimes even be given wine to drink in preference to water which was often polluted .
There has been a storm of protest by bar owners who refuse to act as alcohol police for young people .
But changing social customs mean that old easy - going attitudes towards consumption of alcohol in Italy will have to change .

It ’s late .
We should be sleeping .
Instead we are packing up to leave after an extended stay in Indianapolis .
It ’s something of an emotional farewell .
Before we arrived in Indiapolis , we booked several nights online at a hotel that , for reasons that are about to become clear , I wo n’t mention by name .
Normally we book the absolutely cheapest room we can find–at least the cheapest room that is non-smoking , includes Internet access so Neil can log into work , and seems half - way clean and safe .
Based on these high criteria , we have managed to stay in some doozies .
“ The cheapest room in town ” is quite often under an Interstate , or in an industrial park , or surrounded by strip malls .
We wind up staying in neighbourhoods that are conveniently located for travelers seeking payday loans , Harley Davisdon accessories and tattoos , but not necessarily for finding independently - owned organic vegetarian cafes or going for a nice walk .
Then again , we ’ve stayed in rooms for as little as $ 28 / night .
For safety and vegetables , you pay extra .
So , following standard protocol , we booked a cheap hotel room , sight - unseen .
At extended stay hotels , we usually stay in a very modest studio room .
This particular property only had smoking studios available when we booked , but they had a great deal of a non-smoking Queen Suite , so we nabbed it .
And when we arrived , we fell in love .
This “ suite ” is bigger than several of the apartments we ’ve lived in .
Do n’t get me wrong , that does n’t mean this is big : our first apartment was a studio of about 400 square feet .
Unlike most apartments we ’ve lived in , the suite ’s kitchen has counter space .
( Who builds all these kitchens with no counter space ?
They drive me crazy . )
And there ’s more storage space than the house my family lived in when my brother and I were babies .
There ’s even a pull - out sofa !
Okay , the presence of a sofa may not impress you luxury travelers out there , but you have to picture a typical day for us in a hotel studio :
Neil is sitting on the only chair in the room programming all day , which leaves me sitting on the bed , ALL DAY .
I do n’t mind ; I ’m bed - oriented .
I ’d go so far as to say that beds are my natural habitat .
But to be in a suite with a sofa , and be able to get out the bed and sit on actual furniture during the day … I ’m telling you , it is the lap of luxry .
We checked into the room and we were awestruck .
We rhapsodized about the size , the space , the sweet spectacular splendour of it all .
In my family , when you really love something , you give it a name .
( Or when you loathe it .
Or sometimes when you ’re luke - warm on it .
We ’re pretty big on naming , now that I think about it . )
Neil and I cast about for a name for the hotel .
We started to call it the “ Taj Mahal , ” in deference to the pinnacle of luxury it represents .
But “ Taj Mahal ” is already taken ( obviously ) , and the name just seemed inadequate .
And then Neil had a stroke of brilliance : we could combine “ Taj Mahal ” and “ Indianapolis ” to make “ Taj Mahapolis . ”
And thus the monicker was born .
Why wo n’t I reveal to you the actual name of the Taj Mahopolis ?
Once we were here a few days , we noticed the stink of garbage in the halls , the TGI - Fridays level of customer service , the deeply frightening stain on the boxspring .
The furniture is chipped , the baseboards are scuffed , the wallpaper seams are peeling .
The decor is a depressing mixture of sad beiges and washed - out blues .
In short : it ’s the kind of hotel that men check into when their wives kick them out for having an affair .
A real up - beat kind of place .
And even factoring in the smell , the drab interior , the lackluster service : it is still one of the nicest places we have stayed in a year .
Which Neil and I find hysterical .
As dumpy as it is , it ’s the Taj Mahopolis to us .
Tomorrow we check out and head to Peoria , on our way to Minnesota .
The Taj Mahopolis has been good to us .
We will miss it .
I hope , no matter what your circumstances in life may be , that you can always enjoy the Taj Mahopoli that come your way .
As their colleagues on the ground signified the 40th anniversary of a man ’s stepping onto the Moon ’s surface , astronauts on the International Space Station tended to a more mundane task : fixing a toilet .
A pump on the recently installed toilet in the American laboratory , Destiny , broke Sunday , contaminating part of the system .
The pump ’s function was to inject chemicals that helped separate liquids from solid waste .
Col. Gennady I. Padalka , the station commander , and Frank De Winne , a flight engineer , replaced some of the parts , and the toilet was operational on Monday .

In the interim , the seven astronauts from the space shuttle Endeavour , which docked Friday , had to use the toilet on the shuttle while the six station crew members already aboard the station used a second toilet in the Russian module .

This article by Ralph Underwager and Hollida Wakefield examines the misuse of psychological tests in typical forensic settings .
Psychological tests are often used inappropriately and are misinterpreted and overinterpreted in the forensic setting .
This harms the person being evaluated and interferes with the cause of justice .
It also does a disservice to the reputation of psychologists and the science of psychology .
Actual examples of misuse of particular techniques and tests and misinterpretation illustrate what has been done in forensic settings .
A forensic evaluation is different from a clinical evaluation .
When an evaluation is done in the clinical setting , the conclusions are used to develop a treatment plan .
These conclusions form working hypotheses which can be confirmed or rejected during treatment .
However , in the forensic setting , a one - time decision is made about the individual - a decision which can markedly affect the person 's life .
If tests are misinterpreted in the clinical setting , the treatment plan developed from the evaluation may not be the most effective for the client .
However , since treatment plans are generally modified and revised throughout the course of treatment , the mistaken conclusions can be corrected .
But , an erroneous decision in the forensic setting can result in immediate and severe consequences , such as losing custody of a child or being jailed .
If decisions and recommendations by the psychologist are not based on adequate data , the psychologist is acting both incompetently and unethically .
In addition , conclusions drawn by the psychologist are subject to cross-examination in the adversarial setting .
If the conclusions are not based upon adequate data , the psychologist 's testimony will be discredited or impeached by a skillful opposing attorney .
Therefore , the psychologist should only present conclusions in reports and testimony which can be defended when challenged in cross-examination .
In the course of examining hundreds of reports , we have seen many examples of tests that are misadministered , misinterpreted , overinterpreted , or should never have been given in the particular setting .
We are presenting a sample of these to illustrate what should be avoided by any psychologist who does forensic evaluations .
DRAWINGS
Tests such as the House - Tree - Person ( HTP ) and Kinetic Family Drawings are often overinterpreted and misinterpreted .
There is a lack of validity and reliability in the use of drawings as projective assessment devices .
In a review of the Draw - A - Person test in the Seventh Mental Measurements Yearbook , Harris ( 1 ) notes that there is very little evidence for the use of " signs " as valid indicators of personality characteristics .
With children 's drawings there is so much variability from drawing to drawing that particular features of any one drawing are too unreliable to say anything about them .
The Tenth Mental Measurements Yearbook ( 2 ) , in reviews by Cundick and Weinberg ( p.422-425 ) continues the consistent finding since the first edition , 1938 , that interpretations of drawings ( as are often done in forensic evaluations ) are unsupported by empirical evidence .
Both reviewers note that there are no normative data establishing reliability and validity of the Kinetic Drawing System .
Projective tests generally , and the symbolic interpretation of drawings specifically , should be used only with great caution and with full acknowledgment of their lack of demonstrated validity and reliability .
If used , drawings should be interpreted conservatively as a means of generating hypotheses to be explored .
If unusual elements are present in the drawings , the client should be asked about them .
Example 1 The father , in a divorce and custody dispute , was accused of tying up his three - year - old son with a bicycle chain and then sexually abusing him .
Both parents were evaluated by a psychologist .
The father was tested and interviewed by the psychologist who left the office , leaving him to finish the drawings .
He took them home , finished them with the use of drafting instruments , and brought them to her office the next day .
The psychologist stated that the response style to the projective drawings suggested " obsessive - compulsive tendencies , high defensiveness and an intense need to control ... ( and ) his rigidly defensive posture does not adequately bind the underlying anxiety and trepidation of doing poorly . "
However , his Bender is completely normal .
His House - Tree - Person ( HTP ) drawings are careful and detailed .
He clearly had attempted to do as good as job as possible .
Given that his understanding was that these drawings would be interpreted to indicate whether or not he was an abuser , his choice to carefully complete them at home demonstrates an understandable effort to comply with the instructions and do the best job he could .
None of this was noted in the report .
There are no scientific data to support the interpretive comment quoted above .
It is meaningless jargon with no connection to an empirical base .
Example 2A four - year - old girl was asked to draw a picture of herself and the family doing something .
She instead , according to the school psychologist who was evaluating her , " seemed to be preoccupied with drawing circles within circles which she called ' caves . '
Her second representation bore a significant resemblance to male genitalia ( when asked what it represented , she reported that it was a ball rolling into a lion 's cave ) . "
This was interpreted as being suggestive of sexual abuse and the fact that the child has been subjected to some type of traumatic experience .
When we saw the child , now age five , we tested her and found borderline to low - average intelligence and no ability to draw anything other than scribbled circles .
The child clearly had difficulties with visual motor perception and indeed , could not draw , a fact which was ignored by the other evaluator .
This example , therefore , illustrates the importance of recognizing the child 's developmental level .
Example 3
In a similar example with an older child , a 15 - year - old boy 's drawings of a person were interpreted as " rather primitive for an adolescent of his age and ... suggests that ( the boy ) has the psychological characteristics of a person who acts out their anger in sexualized ways . "
But when we tested this boy , we discovered that he was blind in one eye , performed below what was expected for his age on the Porteus and the Bender , and had a performance IQ on the WISC -R of 67 .
This is why his drawings were " primitive . "
None of this had been assessed or discussed as a possibility .
Example 4A seven - year - old girl was asked to draw a picture of her family doing something .
She drew a picture of herself and her sister with their hands up in the air with the father standing next to them and smiling .
The child told the psychologist that she and her sister were " cheering at a show . "
The psychologist disregarded what the child told her about the drawing and claimed that this really signified a " helpless posture . "
She saw it as significant that there were no fingers drawn on the hands and that the hands were large on the father .
She asserted that abused children put large hands on the drawings of their perpetrators .
She also claimed that the thick lines in the crotch in the picture of the father meant an emphasis on genitals , was probably a penis , and showed anxiety about the father .
She therefore concluded that the girl , who denied the allegations of sexual abuse by the father , had most likely been sexually abused by him and should " be protected from further abuse by him . "
The behavior of the psychologist in her interpretation is particularly bad because she ignored what the child herself said about the drawing .
Example 5A four - year - old girl 's drawing of a tree in the HTP was considered significant because the child , when asked to draw a tree , also drew a cactus .
This was interpreted in terms of " unconscious expression of danger and fearfulness . "
However , the child was not asked if she had a cactus in her yard ( this was in Texas ) .
The child also brought a drawing of a clown 's face to the therapist which she had ostensibly drawn while in the waiting room with her parents .
The clown was interpreted as being significant because " there is an element of sadness in the clown 's eyes . "
This clown is of much greater sophistication and detail than the child 's other drawings .
When pressed about this in his deposition , the psychologist acknowledged that the parents probably drew it and she colored it .
This example illustrates both problems in administration and in interpretation .
Example 6 This was a day care case with allegations of ritualistic satanic abuse complete with costumes , masks , dead animals , sacrificed babies , blood , feces , skeletons , and monsters .
These bizarre allegations surfaced during therapy .
The therapist who saw two of the children depended heavily upon the children 's drawings in forming conclusions about ritualistic , satanic abuse .
The case file included a large stack of drawings over a two - year period - probably over 500 from the two girls .
These drawings are typical of the types of scribbles and rudimentary figures drawn by three - and four - year - olds .
These had been saved because they were considered significant .
In her deposition the psychologist was asked about the drawings in detail .
What she believed was significant included :
Shapes that are untypical for three - and four - year - old children
Shapes that are phallic symbols
Jiggly lines that indicate anxiety
Straight mouths that mean people can't say anything .
Jagged mouths that mean anxiety
A mouth that is open and oval shaped
Darkened eyes
Eyeballs that are scribbled around
Eyes that are two different colors
Drawing something and then covering it up
Drawings something and not talking about it
Colors are very important and significant :
Black means the child is frightened or distressed ; black is a morbid down color
Red means angry , unless the child is drawing a pretty red flower , when it is healthy
If every thing is the picture is red or red and black , this is very suspicious .
Blue , brown , and orange mean fear , anger , and depression
Pink , red , and green are healthy colors .
There is no empirical evidence to support any of these theories .
Also , these were not House - Tree - Person drawings or Kinetic Family Drawings but were simply drawings done in therapy sessions or at home and brought to the therapist by the parent .
There was no effort to standardize the administration .
Example 7
This example shows a gross overinterpretation of a Bender given to an adult .
Whereas the Bender is a useful screening test for possible organic dysfunction and is an efficient measure of perceptual - motor development in young children , its use as a projective technique for emotional psychopathology is questionable .
When used as a personality instrument or projective technique , great caution should be used and it should never be used as the main measure of psychopathology (
3 ) .
In this custody evaluation , the psychologist gave three personality tests , Bender Gestalt , HTP , and TAT , all which were interpreted in the direction of finding extreme psychopathology .
MMPIs or other objective testing were not used .
The Bender interpretation for the woman is :
There appears to be no visual / motor neurological dysfunction with the Bender Gestalt .
Personality interpretation reveals difficulty with dissonant elements of her personality , anxiety , timidity , possible paranoia , and marked ambivalence .
She seems emotionally constricted , may lack impulse control , is perfectionistic and obsessive - compulsive , and may manifest dissociation , splitting , or isolation mechanisms .
She may feel impotent .
In addition she indicates much difficulty with sexuality and aggression .
She may have a fear of penetration , anxiety about phallic symbols , or castration anxiety .
She may have a desire to return to the womb and / or possible suicidal tendencies .
She may have significant problems with ego boundaries .
The HTP and TAT were similarly interpreted as indicating extreme psychopathology and the psychologist concluded that the woman had major weaknesses in areas crucial to parenting and was in need of long - term , intensive , analytically - oriented therapy , and therefore the father should have custody .
Millon Clinical MultiaxIal Inventory ( MCMI and MCMI - Il ) Practically any computerized Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory interpretation can serve as a horrible example when the interpretation is used as part of a forensic ( as opposed to a clinical ) evaluation and the test is not interpreted accordingly .
Very often , what we see is the computerized interpretation of the MCMI - II lifted verbatim and without qualification from the computerized printout which accompanies the test scoring .
This is a violation of the ethical standards for psychologists who use computerized test interpretations .
This practice is a particular problem with the MCMI - II , which is normed on and intended to be used for a clinical population .
When used for other assessment purposes , the MCMI - II must be interpreted extremely cautiously because of its tendency to overpathologize .
The result of using these computerized interpretations therefore greatly exaggerates psychopathology .
problem is not in the test , but in its misuse .
The test is normed entirely on clinical samples and is only intended for persons who have psychological symptoms and are being assessed for treatment and evaluation .
The manual ( 4 ) clearly states that this test is " not a general personality instrument to be used for ' normal ' populations or for purposes other than diagnostic screening or clinical assessments . "
Millon has repeatedly warned against using the inventory with people who are not psychiatric patients because the test norms may not be valid if the subject does not fit the standardizing ( psychiatric ) group ( 5 ) .
We do use this test as part of our overall assessment but interpret it cautiously and conservatively with the above in mind .
When used in this way , it can provide useful information .
Choca , et al. ( 5 ) state that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using the MCMI to test " normal " people as long as the evaluator is aware that the test was designed for and standardized with a psychiatric population .
The user will have to make the appropriate adjustments and alter the narratives .
The computerized narrative must never be lifted verbatim into the report since it will find serious psychopathology and personality disorders in just about everyone .
RORSCHACH
Few evaluators using the Rorschach acknowledge its limitations .
If the Rorschach is used , its limitations should be clearly noted unless the Exner system is used .
And then , it is necessary to say what is being scored by the Exner system .
But often , idiosyncratic interpretation techniques are used to form conclusions and make recommendations which affect the lives of people .
There is no empirical support for the validity of the Rorschach , except when the Exner system is used .
Reviews in the Buros Mental Measurement Yearbook for every year in which this test has been reviewed state that there is no research demonstrating its validity .
For example , in the Eighth Mental Measurements Yearbook ( 6 ) Peterson concluded : " The general lack of predicted validity for the Rorschach raises serious questions about its continued use in clinical practice . "
commenting upon the use of the Rorschach , Dawes ( 7 ) writes :
Now that I am no longer a member of the American Psychological Association Ethics Committee , I can express my personal opinion that the use of Rorschach interpretations in establishing an individual 's legal status and child custody is the single most unethical practice of my colleagues .
It is done , widely .
Losing legal rights as a result of responding to what is presented as a " test of imagination , " often in the context of " helping " violates what I believe to be a basic ethical principle in this society - that people are judged on the basis of what they do , not on the basis of what they feel , think , or might have a propensity to do .
And being judged on an invalid assessment of such thoughts , feelings , and propensities amounts to losing one 's civil rights on an essentially random basis .
Example 8
The psychologist in this example interpreted the Rorschach as reflecting :
[ a ] ... highly defensive stance which is accompanied with blocking , censoring , and inhibition of his underlying affect ... an undercurrent of anxiety , unrequited love , and cloaked sexuality ... difficulty with relating appropriately to others ... latent polymorphous perverse orientation to the environment ... fantasies ( that may include ) homosexual , bisexual , and exhibitionist feelings ... hostility toward women ...
Examination of the man 's actual responses to the Rorschach yields no evidence for interpreting his Rorschach as pathological .
Although there is indication of scoring , apparently using the Klopfer or Beck scoring approaches , there is no report of any of the ratios and no attempt to base any of the interpretations upon either a scoring summary or specific responses .
Within the Rorschach literature the actual responses of the client do not warrant these interpretations .
They are personal , subjective , and idiosyncratic interpretations .
The interpretations assert the reality of inferred unconscious processes going on inside the client .
There are no scientific data to support postulation of these intervening variables .
The phrase , " latent polymorphous perverse orientation to the environment , " is meaningless jargon with no referent in reality .
MMPI
Ziskin ( 8 ) notes that the MMPI better fits the forensic requirements for evidence to be believable and understandable than do other assessment methods .
The MMPI has years of validation research and the data obtained from it are objective and quantifiable .
The MMPI - 2 was developed so that the research on the original MMPI is still relevant and usable .
In fact , the MMPI - 1 profile can be drawn using the table in the back of the MMPI - 2 manual .
, MMPIs are often overinterpreted and misinterpreted .
Such erroneous interpretations are not simply a matter of a difference of opinion ; the horrible examples we have seen result from idiosyncratic interpretations without a basis in the empirical literature .
In addition , as with the MCMI - II , sometimes computerized interpretations are used without qualification .
Not all computerized MMPI interpretative programs are equally good ( 9 ) .
Scale 5 : Example 9
This profile , in which scale 5 was at 82 and scales 3 and 9 at 70 , was seen as " very consistent " with someone who sexually abuses a child .
The scale 5 elevation was seen as particularly significant and as reflecting sexual conflict and sexual dissatisfaction .
The psychologist testified that this elevation indicates somebody who is in trouble because of their sexual behavior .
He denied , under cross-examination , that a high scale 5 can reflect a college education or high degree of education .
He asserted the MMPI indicated that the client had a tendency to act out sexually with a child .
is mistake to interpret an elevation on scale 5 as reflecting sexual conflicts or as meaning it is likely that the individual is homosexual or a child molester since there are many factors behind such an elevation .
Such an elevation generally reflects an intelligent , imaginative , sensitive , and passive individual with a wide range of interests which do not fit the masculine stereotype .
Lachar ( 10 ) reports that the college educated frequently obtain elevations in this range .
Fowler ( 11 ) points out that scale 5 is a nonpathological scale .
Graham ( 12 ) notes that scores on scale 5 are related to intelligence , education , and socioeconomic level and that a T - score of 80 is only a moderate elevation for an educated middle - class person .
Duckworth ( 13 ) states that an elevation on scale 5 suggests a passive person with aesthetic interests and notes that elevations are typical of males with college education .
Other MMPI experts report similar characteristics associated with scale 5 elevations .
There is no indication in the MMPI literature that child molesters or other sex offenders are more likely to score high on scale 5 .
( It is of note that the MMPI - 2 norms result in much lower scale 5 elevations in males . )
Overinterpretation of the K Scale In Court or Custody Settings
overinterpretation of a high K scale in a court or custody setting is a common error .
Any conclusions about defensiveness on the MMPI must be qualified in terms of the testing situation .
Elevations on the K scale in persons taking the MMPI in custody and court situations are common and must not be interpreted as signifying defensiveness as a personality characteristic .
It is a normal and adaptive response to the situation and must not be overinterpreted .
Reports in which there is a K elevation should include the information that persons taking the MMPI as part of a custody or court evaluation commonly have elevations on scale K. Graham ( 14 ) notes that if he does n't see an elevation on K in a custody evaluation , he wonders what is the matter - does n't the person want the child ?
Example 10
This was a divorce and custody evaluation which was complicated by allegations of sexual abuse against the father .
The scale K elevation was at 70 in an otherwise within normal limits MMPI and this was interpreted by the psychologist as " clinically significant . "
He claimed this meant that the client was defensive and was trying to " present himself in the best light psychologically and emotionally . "
He said that " he was trying to answer the questions in the direction of looking good , " and asserted , " Sexually , this kind of thing ( an elevation on the K scale ) is expected . "
There were no qualifications in terms of the setting in which the MMPI was taken .
In addition , this was a professionally and occupationally successful man with college education .
Such persons routinely have higher K elevations , which indicates good ego strength and competence .
Failure to Recognize the Situational Factor .
In a Scale 6 Elevation : Example 11
This man , who had been accused of sexual abuse which he denied , had a scale 6 elevation which was interpreted as indicating high defensiveness , anger , distrust , sexual conflict , poor behavioral controls , and tendencies toward acting out conflicts and impulses .
It was labeled " seriously abnormal , " a " very pathological profile , " " scary " and very unusual and abnormal .
However , an elevation in scale 6 is a common response in persons who have been accused of sexual abuse and who deny the allegations .
This is due to the affirmation of such items as : I know who is responsible for most of my troubles , Someone has it in for me , I believe I am being plotted against , I am sure I am being talked about .
Rather than reflecting anger , hostility , suspiciously , and paranoia as pathological personality traits , the endorsement of these persecutory items reflects the individual 's current reality and is a normal response to the situation .
We have done research on this ( 15 , 16 ) .
Ziskin ( 8 ) also discusses such situational effects on scales 6 and recommends caution in interpreting scale 6 elevations in such circumstances .
Failure to Use Adolescent Norms for an Adolescent : Example 12
A 15 - year - old boy was given an MMPI as part of an evaluation regarding a claim by his sister that he had sexually abused her .
Both were adopted minority children who came from troubled backgrounds .
The boy stoutly denied the allegations , which arose after he , while babysitting , had put his sister to bed early as punishment for misbehavior .
The boy did not complete the MMPI items , so the psychologist called him and read the items to him over the telephone .
The MMPI was then computer scored using the adult norms .
The interpretation given by the evaluator was that the MMPI indicated the boy had significant problems with anger management , interpersonal relations , impulsivity , unpredictability , and hostile and sexual acting out .
She concluded that he had , in fact , sexually abused his sister and recommended that he be placed in an adolescent perpetrator program .
However , when the adolescent norms for the boy 's MMPI are used , the only elevation is on scale 3 .
Scales 4 , 8 , and 9 are well within normal limits .
The literature on the MMPI indicates that it is standard procedure to use the adolescent norms in order to draw conclusions about pathology in a given adolescence and it is standard practice to plot both profiles .
Although adult norms may be used in research since we need to see the contrast between adolescents and adults , the adult norms must not be used forensically .
The meaning " disturbed " or " abnormal " can only be established against adolescent norms .
This should no longer be a problem now that the MMPI - A (
17 ) is available .
This MMPI revision is intended for adolescents age 14 to 18 and should be used for this group rather than the MMPI - 2 .
Departing from Standard Administration Procedures : Example 13
In this custody evaluation , the psychologist sent the MMPIs home to be finished , even after the husband had told him about an earlier MMPI taken by his wife in which she talked to him about what answer to put down on some of the items .
Whereas psychologists may sometimes do this with therapy clients , it is never acceptable for a forensic evaluation where the results of the evaluation are to be presented in the justice system and are to be used in making decisions about people 's lives .
Ziskin ( 8 ) warns against this practice :
The " take home " MMPI should be avoided in the forensic situation ...
This practice can lead to questions as to whether the individual took the test in the standard way and whether all of the responses are purely his own , as highlighted by Graham 's amusing anecdote about the mental hospital patient who had his ward colleagues assist him by voting on the appropriate answers .
Overinterpretation of the MMPI Supplementary Scales
The supplementary scales must be interpreted cautiously when the basic clinical scales are within normal limits and the interpretations must be on the basis of rules that are based on research .
Example 14
In this custody evaluation , the clinical scales for the father were all well within normal limits but the dominance scale was elevated above 70 .
The MMPI was therefore interpreted as indicating that the individual had a " highly assertive and domineering style , " whose leadership is " characterized by determination , inflexibility , and an almost autocratic control . "
In his trial testimony , the psychologist said that the client is " a very willful man " who has " not played the game right " and added that " All the time , I suspect what I saw in my tests undercuts that quite a bit , because assertiveness , being aggressive , dominance , can become autocratlcness , and I think that 's what has happened . "
is a misinterpretation of a dominance scale elevation in an otherwise within normal limits profile .
Caldwell ( 18 ) says the following about the appropriate interpretation of the Do ( Dominance ) supplementary scale :
Although based on peer nominations of subjects as strong , confident , influential , unintimidated in face - to - face situations , and showing initiative and leadership ... the title " dominance " may be partially misleading .
That is , the scale reflects taking charge of one 's own life - or not taking charge - considerably more than bossiness or being overbearing ...
Do should be interpreted as taking charge of one 's life ... e.g. as self - organizing , making workable plans , and meeting deadlines .
This description , was , in fact , quite accurate for this man .
MULTIPHASIC SEX INVENTORY
The Multiphasic Sex Inventory ( MSI ) ( 19 ) is a self - report questionnaire which consists of statements about sexual activities , problems and experiences .
It has scales which assess the level of openness about the deviant sexual behaviors .
It has been reported to be useful in assessing sex offenders in order to develop treatment plans .
It may also be used during treatment to assess progress .
However , it is now sometimes being used to assess an individual who denies sexual abuse to determine whether the individual actually is an abuser .
This test is not intended for this purpose .
The manual accompanying the MSI states " [ i] t is important to remember that the MSI is not appropriate for use in the legal pursuit of guilt or innocence .
The alleged offender must acknowledge culpability in order for the inventory to be used " ( 19 ) .
It must never be used on an individual who denies being a sex offender or as part of an assessment to determine whether someone who denies an alleged sex offense is likely to have actually done it ( 20 ) .
Example 15
The sexual abuse allegations arose when the child was supposed to be returned from a visitation with the mother ( the father had custody ) .
The MSI , which was part of the court - ordered evaluation , was interpreted in terms of a " fake good " response ( which means that the respondent either is lying about his sexually deviant interests or does not in fact possess these interests ) and it was concluded that the client had an " elevated level of denial " and was not telling the truth .
PENILE PLETHYSMOGRAPH
plethysmograph is a useful technique in developing individualized treatment program for sexual offenders .
However , it is an error to use it with someone who denies committing a sexual offense in order to determine the veracity of the denial ( 21 ) .
William R. Farrall , the major manufacturer and provider of plethysmographs and trainer of the use of penile plethysmographs , says that the plethysmograph must never be used in this way because it produces too many false positives - that is , deviant elevations in persons who are not sex offenders ( 22 ) .
The consensus of the experts in the field is that plethysmography is useful in treatment , has limited use in predicting future behavior of known sex offenders , but is of no use in screening a normal population .
It can not be used to determine whether a person who has been accused of sex molestation and is denying it is telling the truth .
Research indicates that normal heterosexual males with no indication of any sexual interest in children frequently respond with some evidence of penile engorgement to the presentation of the stimuli used to present aberrant sexuality , including children .
The data also show that responses to the plethysmograph can be manipulated and faked in any direction the subject chooses ( 23 - 26 ) .
Example 16
A client was given the penile plethysmograph and it was found that his highest level of arousal was to adult females followed by four - year - old females and 12 - year - old females .
This was used to support the conclusion that the client was a possible pedophile who therefore had been untruthful in his denial of child sexual abuse .
OTHER " TESTS "
has been much criticism of the use of the anatomical dolls in assessments of children suspected of sexual abuse .
The anatomical dolls sometimes are used as a type of test and the behavior of the child in interacting with the dolls is used to draw conclusions about abuse .
Two American Psychological Association committees ( the Committee of Children , Youth , and Families and the Committee on Psychological Testing and Assessment ) ( 27 ) determined in a March , 1988 meeting that the dolls " are considered to be a psychological test and are subject to the standards when used to assess individuals and make inferences about their behavior " ( 28 ) .
have frequently criticized the use of the dolls and the way interactions with the dolls are often interpreted ( 15 , 29 - 31 ) .
To date , there are no standardized or normative data for the dolls , a fact acknowledged by the APA Council of Representatives in 1991 ( 32 ) .
Nevertheless , a whole paper could be written on horrible examples using the dolls .
We have addressed this elsewhere and will not discuss this further here .
, many other techniques are used by psychologists and other evaluators , such as games , puppets , story telling , play observations , projective cards , and play dough (
Example 17
In an evaluation session , a three - year - old girl poked a toy cat with a tinkertoy .
Her parents also reported that she tried to poke the cat at home .
( The parents gave great attention to this behavior , which , not surprisingly , continued and escalated . )
This was interpreted by the evaluator in terms of reenactment and repetition and was seen as supporting the belief that the child had had a tinkertoy stuck up her genitals by a four - year - old boy at the day care center ( this supposedly happened in the lunch room with a teacher present ) .
The poking of the toy cat with the tinkertoy was seen as symbolic for the boy poking her .
The evaluator claimed that the child was working through her trauma by repeating her own victimization .
The play was interpreted as supporting the reality of the alleged abuse ( which was unsubstantiated by child protection ) .
Example 18
The therapist claimed that she was able to tell whether the alleged events ( ritualistic , satanic abuse ) actually happened or did n't happen by observing such things as a " white face " or " dark eyes " when the child was talking about the events .
Example 19
The child was described as having the " hardened , drawn , demeanor of an abused child . "
This was used as evidence that the child had , in fact been abused .
( Photographs of the child taken during this period show a normal appearing , attractive child . )
Example 20
A baby was returned to the foster mother following a visit with the parents and was described as having the " smell of sex . "
An emergency hearing was held in which social services attempted to cut off visits because this " smell of sex " triggered the suspicion that the parents were having sex with their baby .
A psychologist agreed that the sex smell was significant and indicated probable abuse on the part of the parents .
Fortunately , the parents had been at a church potluck dinner during the entire visit so they were able to disprove , the accusations .
RELEVANT ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
ethical principles for psychologists are relevant to these examples .
These are found in both the applicable principles from the Ethical Principles of Psychologists ( 34 ) and the revised Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct ( 35 ) which will take effect on December 1 , 1992 .
These principles stress the fact that psychologists bear a heavy social responsibility since their recommendations and actions may alter the lives of others .
They therefore must maintain high standards of competence and only provide services for which they are qualified by training and experience .
When using psychological testing , they must maintain knowledge of the relevant literature and understand validation problems and test research .
When reporting the results of their assessments , they must indicate any reservations they have regarding test validity or reliability because of the circumstances of the assessment or the inappropriateness of the norms for the person tested .
They guard against the misuse of assessment results by others .
The American Psychological Association's ( 36 ) Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing stresses the necessity for following the standardized procedures for test administration and scoring specified by the test publisher .
If any changes in these procedures are made , this should be described in the report , along with appropriate cautions about the possible effects on the validity of the results .
Psychologists must not imply that their test interpretations are based upon a empirical evidence of validity unless such evidence exists .
The American Psychological Association 's Guidelines for Computer - Based Tests and Interpretations ( 27 ) states that computer - generated interpretive reports should be used only in conjunction with professional judgment .
The psychologist must determine for each individual the validity of the computerized test report based on the test taker 's characteristics along with the context of the testing situation .
CONCLUSIONS
Forensic psychologists have a duty to do a careful assessment and to report their conclusions in a responsible manner since their conclusions can affect the lives of others .
The psychologist should only present conclusions which are based on empirical research and which can be adequately defended .
If decisions and recommendations by the psychologist are not based on adequate data , the psychologist is acting both incompetently and unethically .

A forensic evaluation is different from a clinical evaluation .
When an evaluation is done in the clinical setting , the conclusions are used to develop a treatment plan .
These conclusions form working hypotheses which can be confirmed or rejected during treatment .
However , in the forensic setting , a one - time decision is made about the individual - a decision which can markedly affect the person 's life .
If tests are misinterpreted in the clinical setting , the treatment plan developed from the evaluation may not be the most effective for the client .
However , since treatment plans are generally modified and revised throughout the course of treatment , the mistaken conclusions can be corrected .
But , an erroneous decision in the forensic setting can result in immediate and severe consequences , such as losing custody of a child or being jailed .
If decisions and recommendations by the psychologist are not based on adequate data , the psychologist is acting both incompetently and unethically .
In addition , conclusions drawn by the psychologist are subject to cross-examination in the adversarial setting .
If the conclusions are not based upon adequate data , the psychologist 's testimony will be discredited or impeached by a skillful opposing attorney .
Therefore , the psychologist should only present conclusions in reports and testimony which can be defended when challenged in cross-examination .
In the course of examining hundreds of reports , we have seen many examples of tests that are misadministered , misinterpreted , overinterpreted , or should never have been given in the particular setting .
We are presenting a sample of these to illustrate what should be avoided by any psychologist who does forensic evaluations .
Tests such as the House - Tree - Person ( HTP ) and Kinetic Family Drawings are often overinterpreted and misinterpreted .
There is a lack of validity and reliability in the use of drawings as projective assessment devices .
In a review of the Draw - A - Person test in the , Harrisnotes that there is very little evidence for the use of " signs " as valid indicators of personality characteristics .
With children 's drawings there is so much variability from drawing to drawing that particular features of any one drawing are too unreliable to say anything about them .
The , in reviews by Cundick and Weinberg ( p.422-425 ) continues the consistent finding since the first edition , 1938 , that interpretations of drawings ( as are often done in forensic evaluations ) are unsupported by empirical evidence .
Both reviewers note that there are no normative data establishing reliability and validity of the Kinetic Drawing System .
Projective tests generally , and the symbolic interpretation of drawings specifically , should be used only with great caution and with full acknowledgment of their lack of demonstrated validity and reliability .
If used , drawings should be interpreted conservatively as a means of generating hypotheses to be explored .
If unusual elements are present in the drawings , the client should be asked about them .
The father , in a divorce and custody dispute , was accused of tying up his three - year - old son with a bicycle chain and then sexually abusing him .
Both parents were evaluated by a psychologist .
The father was tested and interviewed by the psychologist who left the office , leaving him to finish the drawings .
He took them home , finished them with the use of drafting instruments , and brought them to her office the next day .
The psychologist stated that the response style to the projective drawings suggested " obsessive - compulsive tendencies , high defensiveness and an intense need to control ... ( and ) his rigidly defensive posture does not adequately bind the underlying anxiety and trepidation of doing poorly . "
However , his Bender is completely normal .
His House - Tree - Person ( HTP ) drawings are careful and detailed .
He clearly had attempted to do as good as job as possible .
Given that his understanding was that these drawings would be interpreted to indicate whether or not he was an abuser , his choice to carefully complete them at home demonstrates an understandable effort to comply with the instructions and do the best job he could .
None of this was noted in the report .
There are no scientific data to support the interpretive comment quoted above .
It is meaningless jargon with no connection to an empirical base .
A four - year - old girl was asked to draw a picture of herself and the family doing something .
She instead , according to the school psychologist who was evaluating her , " seemed to be preoccupied with drawing circles within circles which she called ' caves . '
Her second representation bore a significant resemblance to male genitalia ( when asked what it represented , she reported that it was a ball rolling into a lion 's cave ) . "
This was interpreted as being suggestive of sexual abuse and the fact that the child has been subjected to some type of traumatic experience .
When we saw the child , now age five , we tested her and found borderline to low - average intelligence and no ability to draw anything other than scribbled circles .
The child clearly had difficulties with visual motor perception and indeed , could not draw , a fact which was ignored by the other evaluator .
This example , therefore , illustrates the importance of recognizing the child 's developmental level .
In a similar example with an older child , a 15 - year - old boy 's drawings of a person were interpreted as " rather primitive for an adolescent of his age and ... suggests that ( the boy ) has the psychological characteristics of a person who acts out their anger in sexualized ways . "
But when we tested this boy , we discovered that he was blind in one eye , performed below what was expected for his age on the Porteus and the Bender , and had a performance IQ on the WISC -R of 67 .
This is why his drawings were " primitive . "
None of this had been assessed or discussed as a possibility .
A seven - year - old girl was asked to draw a picture of her family doing something .
She drew a picture of herself and her sister with their hands up in the air with the father standing next to them and smiling .
The child told the psychologist that she and her sister were " cheering at a show .
"
The psychologist disregarded what the child told her about the drawing and claimed that this really signified a " helpless posture . "
She saw it as significant that there were no fingers drawn on the hands and that the hands were large on the father .
She asserted that abused children put large hands on the drawings of their perpetrators .
She also claimed that the thick lines in the crotch in the picture of the father meant an emphasis on genitals , was probably a penis , and showed anxiety about the father .
She therefore concluded that the girl , who denied the allegations of sexual abuse by the father , had most likely been sexually abused by him and should " be protected from further abuse by him . "
The behavior of the psychologist in her interpretation is particularly bad because she ignored what the child herself said about the drawing .
A four - year - old girl 's drawing of a tree in the HTP was considered significant because the child , when asked to draw a tree , also drew a cactus .
This was interpreted in terms of " unconscious expression of danger and fearfulness . "
However , the child was not asked if she had a cactus in her yard ( this was in Texas ) .
The child also brought a drawing of a clown 's face to the therapist which she had ostensibly drawn while in the waiting room with her parents .
The clown was interpreted as being significant because " there is an element of sadness in the clown 's eyes . "
This clown is of much greater sophistication and detail than the child 's other drawings .
When pressed about this in his deposition , the psychologist acknowledged that the parents probably drew it and she colored it .
This example illustrates both problems in administration and in interpretation .
This was a day care case with allegations of ritualistic satanic abuse complete with costumes , masks , dead animals , sacrificed babies , blood , feces , skeletons , and monsters .
These bizarre allegations surfaced during therapy .
The therapist who saw two of the children depended heavily upon the children 's drawings in forming conclusions about ritualistic , satanic abuse .
The case file included a large stack of drawings over a two - year period - probably over 500 from the two girls .
These drawings are typical of the types of scribbles and rudimentary figures drawn by three - and four - year - olds .
These had been saved because they were considered significant .
In her deposition the psychologist was asked about the drawings in detail .
What she believed was significant included :
There is no empirical evidence to support any of these theories .
Also , these were not House - Tree - Person drawings or Kinetic Family Drawings but were simply drawings done in therapy sessions or at home and brought to the therapist by the parent .
There was no effort to standardize the administration .
This example shows a gross overinterpretation of a Bender given to an adult .
Whereas the Bender is a useful screening test for possible organic dysfunction and is an efficient measure of perceptual - motor development in young children , its use as a projective technique for emotional psychopathology is questionable .
When used as a personality instrument or projective technique , great caution should be used and it should never be used as the main measure of psychopathology
In this custody evaluation , the psychologist gave three personality tests , Bender Gestalt , HTP , and TAT , all which were interpreted in the direction of finding extreme psychopathology .
MMPIs or other objective testing were not used .
The Bender interpretation for the woman is : The HTP and TAT were similarly interpreted as indicating extreme psychopathology and the psychologist concluded that the woman had major weaknesses in areas crucial to parenting and was in need of long - term , intensive , analytically - oriented therapy , and therefore the father should have custody .
Practically any computerized Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory interpretation can serve as a horrible example when the interpretation is used as part of a forensic ( as opposed to a clinical ) evaluation and the test is not interpreted accordingly .
Very often , what we see is the computerized interpretation of the MCMI - II lifted verbatim and without qualification from the computerized printout which accompanies the test scoring .
This is a violation of the ethical standards for psychologists who use computerized test interpretations .
This practice is a particular problem with the MCMI - II , which is normed on and intended to be used for a clinical population .
When used for other assessment purposes , the MCMI - II must be interpreted extremely cautiously because of its tendency to overpathologize .
The result of using these computerized interpretations therefore greatly exaggerates psychopathology .
The problem is not in the test , but in its misuse .
The test is normed entirely on clinical samples and is only intended for persons who have psychological symptoms and are being assessed for treatment and evaluation .
The manualclearly states that this test is " not a general personality instrument to be used for ' normal ' populations or for purposes other than diagnostic screening or clinical assessments . "
Millon has repeatedly warned against using the inventory with people who are not psychiatric patients because the test norms may not be valid if the subject does not fit the standardizing ( psychiatric ) groupWe do use this test as part of our overall assessment but interpret it cautiously and conservatively with the above in mind .
When used in this way , it can provide useful information .
Choca , et al.state that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using the MCMI to test " normal " people as long as the evaluator is aware that the test was designed for and standardized with a psychiatric population .
The user will have to make the appropriate adjustments and alter the narratives .
The computerized narrative must never be lifted verbatim into the report since it will find serious psychopathology and personality disorders in just about everyone .
Few evaluators using the Rorschach acknowledge its limitations .
If the Rorschach is used , its limitations should be clearly noted unless the Exner system is used .
And then , it is necessary to say what is being scored by the Exner system .
But often , idiosyncratic interpretation techniques are used to form conclusions and make recommendations which affect the lives of people .
There is no empirical support for the validity of the Rorschach , except when the Exner system is used .
Reviews in thefor every year in which this test has been reviewed state that there is no research demonstrating its validity .
For example , in the ) Peterson concluded : " The general lack of predicted validity for the Rorschach raises serious questions about its continued use in clinical practice . "
In commenting upon the use of the Rorschach , Daweswrites :
The psychologist in this example interpreted the Rorschach as reflecting : Examination of the man 's actual responses to the Rorschach yields no evidence for interpreting his Rorschach as pathological .
Although there is indication of scoring , apparently using the Klopfer or Beck scoring approaches , there is no report of any of the ratios and no attempt to base any of the interpretations upon either a scoring summary or specific responses .
Within the Rorschach literature the actual responses of the client do not warrant these interpretations .
They are personal , subjective , and idiosyncratic interpretations .
The interpretations assert the reality of inferred unconscious processes going on inside the client .
There are no scientific data to support postulation of these intervening variables .
The phrase , " latent polymorphous perverse orientation to the environment , " is meaningless jargon with no referent in reality .
notes that the MMPI better fits the forensic requirements for evidence to be believable and understandable than do other assessment methods .
The MMPI has years of validation research and the data obtained from it are objective and quantifiable .
The MMPI - 2 was developed so that the research on the original MMPI is still relevant and usable .
In fact , the MMPI - 1 profile can be drawn using the table in the back of the MMPI - 2 manual .
Nevertheless , MMPIs are often overinterpreted and misinterpreted .
Such erroneous interpretations are not simply a matter of a difference of opinion ; the horrible examples we have seen result from idiosyncratic interpretations without a basis in the empirical literature .
In addition , as with the MCMI - II , sometimes computerized interpretations are used without qualification .
Not all computerized MMPI interpretative programs are equally good ( ) .
This profile , in which scale 5 was at 82 and scales 3 and 9 at 70 , was seen as " very consistent " with someone who sexually abuses a child .
The scale 5 elevation was seen as particularly significant and as reflecting sexual conflict and sexual dissatisfaction .
The psychologist testified that this elevation indicates somebody who is in trouble because of their sexual behavior .
He denied , under cross-examination , that a high scale 5 can reflect a college education or high degree of education .
He asserted the MMPI indicated that the client had a tendency to act out sexually with a child .
It is mistake to interpret an elevation on scale 5 as reflecting sexual conflicts or as meaning it is likely that the individual is homosexual or a child molester since there are many factors behind such an elevation .
Such an elevation generally reflects an intelligent , imaginative , sensitive , and passive individual with a wide range of interests which do not fit the masculine stereotype .
Lacharreports that the college educated frequently obtain elevations in this range .
Fowlerpoints out that scale 5 is a nonpathological scale .
Grahamnotes that scores on scale 5 are related to intelligence , education , and socioeconomic level and that a T - score of 80 is only a moderate elevation for an educated middle - class person .
Duckworthstates that an elevation on scale 5 suggests a passive person with aesthetic interests and notes that elevations are typical of males with college education .
Other MMPI experts report similar characteristics associated with scale 5 elevations .
There is no indication in the MMPI literature that child molesters or other sex offenders are more likely to score high on scale 5 .
( It is of note that the MMPI - 2 norms result in much lower scale 5 elevations in males . )
An overinterpretation of a high K scale in a court or custody setting is a common error .
Any conclusions about defensiveness on the MMPI must be qualified in terms of the testing situation .
Elevations on the K scale in persons taking the MMPI in custody and court situations are common and must not be interpreted as signifying defensiveness as a personality characteristic .
It is a normal and adaptive response to the situation and must not be overinterpreted .
Reports in which there is a K elevation should include the information that persons taking the MMPI as part of a custody or court evaluation commonly have elevations on scale K. Grahamnotes that if he does n't see an elevation on K in a custody evaluation , he wonders what is the matter - does n't the person want the child ?
This was a divorce and custody evaluation which was complicated by allegations of sexual abuse against the father .
The scale K elevation was at 70 in an otherwise within normal limits MMPI and this was interpreted by the psychologist as " clinically significant . "
He claimed this meant that the client was defensive and was trying to " present himself in the best light psychologically and emotionally . "
He said that " he was trying to answer the questions in the direction of looking good , " and asserted , " Sexually , this kind of thing ( an elevation on the K scale ) is expected . "
There were no qualifications in terms of the setting in which the MMPI was taken .
In addition , this was a professionally and occupationally successful man with college education .
Such persons routinely have higher K elevations , which indicates good ego strength and competence .
This man , who had been accused of sexual abuse which he denied , had a scale 6 elevation which was interpreted as indicating high defensiveness , anger , distrust , sexual conflict , poor behavioral controls , and tendencies toward acting out conflicts and impulses .
It was labeled " seriously abnormal , " a " very pathological profile , " " scary " and very unusual and abnormal .
However , an elevation in scale 6 is a common response in persons who have been accused of sexual abuse and who deny the allegations .
This is due to the affirmation of such items as : Rather than reflecting anger , hostility , suspiciously , and paranoia as pathological personality traits , the endorsement of these persecutory items reflects the individual 's current reality and is a normal response to the situation .
We have done research on this .
Ziskinalso discusses such situational effects on scales 6 and recommends caution in interpreting scale 6 elevations in such circumstances .
A 15 - year - old boy was given an MMPI as part of an evaluation regarding a claim by his sister that he had sexually abused her .
Both were adopted minority children who came from troubled backgrounds .
The boy stoutly denied the allegations , which arose after he , while babysitting , had put his sister to bed early as punishment for misbehavior .
The boy did not complete the MMPI items , so the psychologist called him and read the items to him over the telephone .
The MMPI was then computer scored using the adult norms .
The interpretation given by the evaluator was that the MMPI indicated the boy had significant problems with anger management , interpersonal relations , impulsivity , unpredictability , and hostile and sexual acting out .
She concluded that he had , in fact , sexually abused his sister and recommended that he be placed in an adolescent perpetrator program .
However , when the adolescent norms for the boy 's MMPI are used , the only elevation is on scale 3 .
Scales 4 , 8 , and 9 are well within normal limits .
The literature on the MMPI indicates that it is standard procedure to use the adolescent norms in order to draw conclusions about pathology in a given adolescence and it is standard practice to plot both profiles .
Although adult norms may be used in research since we need to see the contrast between adolescents and adults , the adult norms must not be used forensically .
The meaning " disturbed " or " abnormal " can only be established against adolescent norms .
This should no longer be a problem now that the MMPI - Ais available .
This MMPI revision is intended for adolescents age 14 to 18 and should be used for this group rather than the MMPI - 2.
In this custody evaluation , the psychologist sent the MMPIs home to be finished , even after the husband had told him about an earlier MMPI taken by his wife in which she talked to him about what answer to put down on some of the items .
Whereas psychologists may sometimes do this with therapy clients , it is never acceptable for a forensic evaluation where the results of the evaluation are to be presented in the justice system and are to be used in making decisions about people 's lives .
Ziskinwarns against this practice :
The supplementary scales must be interpreted cautiously when the basic clinical scales are within normal limits and the interpretations must be on the basis of rules that are based on research .
In this custody evaluation , the clinical scales for the father were all well within normal limits but the dominance scale was elevated above 70 .
The MMPI was therefore interpreted as indicating that the individual had a " highly assertive and domineering style , " whose leadership is " characterized by determination , inflexibility , and an almost autocratic control . "
In his trial testimony , the psychologist said that the client is " a very willful man " who has " not played the game right " and added that " All the time , I suspect what I saw in my tests undercuts that quite a bit , because assertiveness , being aggressive , dominance , can become autocratlcness , and I think that 's what has happened . "
This is a misinterpretation of a dominance scale elevation in an otherwise within normal limits profile .
Caldwellsays the following about the appropriate interpretation of the Do ( Dominance ) supplementary scale : The Multiphasic Sex Inventory ( MSI ) is a self - report questionnaire which consists of statements about sexual activities , problems and experiences .
It has scales which assess the level of openness about the deviant sexual behaviors .
It has been reported to be useful in assessing sex offenders in order to develop treatment plans .
It may also be used during treatment to assess progress .
However , it is now sometimes being used to assess an individual who denies sexual abuse to determine whether the individual actually is an abuser .
This test is not intended for this purpose .
The manual accompanying the MSI states " [ i] t is important to remember that the MSI is not appropriate for use in the legal pursuit of guilt or innocence .
The alleged offender must acknowledge culpability in order for the inventory to be used " .
It must never be used on an individual who denies being a sex offender or as part of an assessment to determine whether someone who denies an alleged sex offense is likely to have actually done it The sexual abuse allegations arose when the child was supposed to be returned from a visitation with the mother ( the father had custody ) .
The MSI , which was part of the court - ordered evaluation , was interpreted in terms of a " fake good " response ( which means that the respondent either is lying about his sexually deviant interests or does not in fact possess these interests ) and it was concluded that the client had an " elevated level of denial " and was not telling the truth .
The plethysmograph is a useful technique in developing individualized treatment program for sexual offenders .
However , it is an error to use it with someone who denies committing a sexual offense in order to determine the veracity of the denial .
William R. Farrall , the major manufacturer and provider of plethysmographs and trainer of the use of penile plethysmographs , says that the plethysmograph must never be used in this way because it produces too many false positives - that is , deviant elevations in persons who are not sex offenders .
The consensus of the experts in the field is that plethysmography is useful in treatment , has limited use in predicting future behavior of known sex offenders , but is of no use in screening a normal population .
It can not be used to determine whether a person who has been accused of sex molestation and is denying it is telling the truth .
Research indicates that normal heterosexual males with no indication of any sexual interest in children frequently respond with some evidence of penile engorgement to the presentation of the stimuli used to present aberrant sexuality , including children .
The data also show that responses to the plethysmograph can be manipulated and faked in any direction the subject choosesA client was given the penile plethysmograph and it was found that his highest level of arousal was to adult females followed by four - year - old females and 12 - year - old females .
This was used to support the conclusion that the client was a possible pedophile who therefore had been untruthful in his denial of child sexual abuse .
There has been much criticism of the use of the anatomical dolls in assessments of children suspected of sexual abuse .
The anatomical dolls sometimes are used as a type of test and the behavior of the child in interacting with the dolls is used to draw conclusions about abuse .
Two American Psychological Association committees ( the Committee of Children , Youth , and Families and the Committee on Psychological Testing and Assessment ) determined in a March , 1988 meeting that the dolls " are considered to be a psychological test and are subject to the standards when used to assess individuals and make inferences about their behavior "
We have frequently criticized the use of the dolls and the way interactions with the dolls are often interpreted ( ) .
To date , there are no standardized or normative data for the dolls , a fact acknowledged by the APA Council of Representatives in 1991 ( ) .
Nevertheless , a whole paper could be written on horrible examples using the dolls .
We have addressed this elsewhere and will not discuss this further here .
However , many other techniques are used by psychologists and other evaluators , such as games , puppets , story telling , play observations , projective cards , and play dough ( 33 ) .
When the psychologist goes beyond these techniques as a way of encouraging the child to talk and uses them as indications or evidence of abuse , they are subject to the same criticisms leveled against the dolls and the drawings .
In an evaluation session , a three - year - old girl poked a toy cat with a tinkertoy .
Her parents also reported that she tried to poke the cat at home .
( The parents gave great attention to this behavior , which , not surprisingly , continued and escalated . ) This was interpreted by the evaluator in terms of reenactment and repetition and was seen as supporting the belief that the child had had a tinkertoy stuck up her genitals by a four - year - old boy at the day care center ( this supposedly happened in the lunch room with a teacher present ) .
The poking of the toy cat with the tinkertoy was seen as symbolic for the boy poking her .
The evaluator claimed that the child was working through her trauma by repeating her own victimization .
The play was interpreted as supporting the reality of the alleged abuse ( which was unsubstantiated by child protection ) .
The therapist claimed that she was able to tell whether the alleged events ( ritualistic , satanic abuse ) actually happened or did n't happen by observing such things as a " white face " or " dark eyes " when the child was talking about the events .
The child was described as having the " hardened , drawn , demeanor of an abused child . "
This was used as evidence that the child had , in fact been abused .
( Photographs of the child taken during this period show a normal appearing , attractive child . ) A baby was returned to the foster mother following a visit with the parents and was described as having the " smell of sex . "
An emergency hearing was held in which social services attempted to cut off visits because this " smell of sex " triggered the suspicion that the parents were having sex with their baby .
A psychologist agreed that the sex smell was significant and indicated probable abuse on the part of the parents .
Fortunately , the parents had been at a church potluck dinner during the entire visit so they were able to disprove , the accusations .
Several ethical principles for psychologists are relevant to these examples .
These are found in both the applicable principles from the Ethical Principles of Psychologistsand the revised Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conductwhich will take effect on December 1 , 1992 .
These principles stress the fact that psychologists bear a heavy social responsibility since their recommendations and actions may alter the lives of others .
They therefore must maintain high standards of competence and only provide services for which they are qualified by training and experience .
When using psychological testing , they must maintain knowledge of the relevant literature and understand validation problems and test research .
When reporting the results of their assessments , they must indicate any reservations they have regarding test validity or reliability because of the circumstances of the assessment or the inappropriateness of the norms for the person tested .
They guard against the misuse of assessment results by others .
The American Psychological Association 'sStandards for Educational and Psychological Testing stresses the necessity for following the standardized procedures for test administration and scoring specified by the test publisher .
If any changes in these procedures are made , this should be described in the report , along with appropriate cautions about the possible effects on the validity of the results .
Psychologists must not imply that their test interpretations are based upon a empirical evidence of validity unless such evidence exists .
The American Psychological Association 's Guidelines for Computer - Based Tests and Interpretationsstates that computer - generated interpretive reports should be used only in conjunction with professional judgment .
The psychologist must determine for each individual the validity of the computerized test report based on the test taker 's characteristics along with the context of the testing situation .
Forensic psychologists have a duty to do a careful assessment and to report their conclusions in a responsible manner since their conclusions can affect the lives of others .
The psychologist should only present conclusions which are based on empirical research and which can be adequately defended .
If decisions and recommendations by the psychologist are not based on adequate data , the psychologist is acting both incompetently and unethically .

BT says air fresheners are routinely installed in some phone boxes
A suspicious package which led to an RAF parade being cancelled in Lincolnshire , has turned out to be a phone box air freshener .
A bomb disposal team exploded the black BT device , which was spotted in the red telephone box in Market Place , Boston , by a worried member of the public .
A BT spokesman said air fresheners had been installed in enclosed phone boxes for years without problems .
Boston Borough Council is working with the RAF to rearrange the parade .
The BT spokesman said : " We do put air fresheners in some phone boxes - we like to make the environment as pleasant as possible for people using a payphone to make a call .
" Some people have been known to use phone boxes for reasons other than wanting to phone someone .
" We site the air fresheners discreetly so they do n't get vandalised . "
A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said : " We had no idea what it was , it was something we 'd never encountered before . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Fresh out of bankruptcy , the new General Motors hopes to soon start selling its whole line of cars on eBay through a pilot program .
While the marketing effort would initially be limited to California , it could go national if it proves to be successful , said GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson at a news conference Friday .
A tie - up with eBay would n't be entirely new for GM .
The automaker has been placing all of its " GM Certified " used cars on eBay for over a year .
Toyota and Chrysler have similar programs for their certified used cars , as well .
However , there is no definitive agreement in place and discussions are still ongoing , said both GM and eBay .
" At this time , no plans have been finalized with General Motors , " said Rob Chesney , vice president for eBay Motors in a prepared statement .
" We hope to support GM 's new company and vision going forward . "
Automakers are prevented by state laws from selling cars , new or used , directly to consumers .
Only licensed auto dealers can do that .
Under GM 's plan , California GM dealers could put their new vehicle inventories on the auction site and eBay users would bid on them .
Each vehicle would also have a " Buy it now " price for shoppers who do n't want to risk losing out in a bidding process .
Winning bidders , or " Buy it now " buyers , would complete the purchase at the dealership , said Susan Docherty , general manager for GM's Buick , Pontiac and GMC brands .
She said GM decided to try selling cars on eBay because 80 % to 90 % of GM shoppers already spend a lot of time researching their purchase online .
Shoppers can check vehicle inventories online now by looking at dealers ' own individual Web sites , but the eBay pilot project would allow users to search multiple dealerships at once and more easily compare products , features and prices .
" The power of the eBay brand mated up with the four core brands from GM could be a really good thing , " Docherty said .
" It takes the shopping process online up about 4 notches because you 've got a lot more information at your fingertips . "
Shoppers will also be able to complete the negotiation process online once they 've found the vehicle they want .
Docherty has been working on the plan along with her counterparts from GM's Chevrolet and Cadillac brands .
The carmaker expects to have more details of the pilot project worked out within the next week or so , she said .
A lot of that work will take place in meetings with dealers , she said .
Among the things dealers will have to work out will be how to respond to those who could be shopping for cars and even buying them in the middle of the night .
" What we 've got to talk to them about is if someone goes in there at two o'clock in the morning , " Docherty said , " They 're going to need to respond to that consumer in ways they have n't had to in the past . "
Whether GM's eBay listings prove to be beneficial will depend on how much freedom GM gives dealers to set their own " Buy it Now " prices , said Scott Painter , chief executive of the auto pricing Web site TrueCar.com .
" The proof in the pudding for GM will be if the " Buy it now " price is set above the market price , " he said .
The market price is what most people are actually paying for the car in the real world .
If dealers are genuinely competing for buyers on eBay , " Buy it Now " prices should reflect that , he said .
If the eBay program ultimately really works , shoppers will begin using eBay as a research tool -- to see what people are paying for cars -- even if they do n't intend to buy through eBay , he said .
That information alone will be valuable for consumers , said Painter .

Like a lingering odor , the failure of Hillarycare in 1993 is hanging over this perilous moment in Obama ’s presidency .
It ’s true that Clinton ’s health care plan never got this far legislatively .
By presenting a complicated plan to Congress and trying to bully it through , the Clinton administration made a huge tactical blunder .
But it is clear that both sides sense that this is the moment when health care reform could be derailed .
While the Democrats and Obama have long been planning on pushing through health care , what is going on now is pure political blood sport .
This is a zero sum game .
This is a Democratic attempt to prove that they can accomplish something that is popular and helps the middle class and which they have been trying for sixty years with only moderate success to enact .
This is the Republican attempt to protect the status quo and to slingshot their way back to power as they did in 1994 .
Bill Kristol has said that this is the week to stop health care reform – to not worry about being obstructionist or trying to appear constructive :
There will be a tendency to want to let the Democrats ’ plans sink of their own weight , to emphasize that the critics have been pushing sound reform ideas all along and suggest it ’s not too late for a bipartisan compromise over the next couple of weeks or months .
My advice , for what it ’s worth : Resist the temptation .
This is no time to pull punches .
Go for the kill .
Beneath the veneer of policy disagreement that Kristol is using , it ’s clear he is advocating pure obstructionism .
He senses opportunity .
Which is why he and many other Republicans are now all repeating the same talking points :
Obama ’s health care reform is an “ experiment ” with your health ; it will ration health care ; you will lose the insurance you have now ; the government will impose itself between you and your doctor ; socialism !
These rather familiar refrains are being thrown about for one purpose – and it has little to do with health care .
As Senator Jim DeMint rather infamously declared in a secret call to anti-reform advocates :
If we ’re able to stop Obama on this it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him .
Newt Gingrich echoed this point :
This could be the bill that drags his whole presidency down and they look back on it and suddenly the whole thing is unraveled .
And the Democrats seem to agree – as the former Organizing for America sent out DeMint ’s statements to rally supporters – and Mark Kleiman , a Democratic blogger said , “ This bill is make or break for the Democratic Party . ”
The Republicans are trying to break the Obama presidency – as they did Clinton ’s .
Clinton came back , but he never had the same political support .
Meanwhile , moderates play an interesting role in this political blood sport .
They decry both sides for being mean – and suggest everyone get along .
They talk about bipartisanship , suggest the Democrats move slowly , and they feel queasy at the prospect that the Democrats – by actually governing and doing what they promised they would do – might be overreaching .
Matt Yglesias ably responded to this point :
It ’s not as if what happened in 1994 was the congress passed Bill Clinton ’s big health reform package , then the public did n’t like it , then in revulsion they turned against Democrats .
Nor did congress pass the proposed BTU tax , then the public did n’t like it , and then in revulsion they turned against Democrats .
The noteworthy thing about the first two years of the Clinton administration was the lack of ambitious progressive programs put in place .
And you could say the same about Jimmy Carter .
Whatever it is people reacted against in 1978 , 1980 , and 1994 it was n’t actually existing left - wing governance .
Ezra Klein – on the same theme – explained the lesson one of the key architect ’s of Obama ’s strategy learned from 1993 :
Emanuel has carried that lesson with him into the Obama White House .
“ The only thing that ’s not negotiable is success , ” he likes to say .
The worst outcome for the party — in part because it ’s the worst outcome for its marginal members – is defeat .
Voters punish defeat .
If the Democrats succeed – as Bill Kristol explained in 1993 :
It will revive the reputation of the party that spends and regulates , the Democrats , as the generous protector of middle - class interests .
And it will at the same time strike a punishing blow against Republican claims to defend the middle - class by restraining the growth of government .
Despite this moment of peril , Obama ’s strategy to get health care through is still intact .
His administration has learned the lessons of 1993 - 1994 well – perhaps too well .
But make no mistake as you see the charges thrown about by both sides in these next few weeks .
This battle is no longer about policy for either the White House or the Republican Party .
( Though the right policies will be essential to its long - term success . )
Right now this is political blood sport – it is about whether or not the Obama administration will be broken by obstructionist elements .
The short - term success of the administration will be determined by whether or not they succeed in the next few weeks to pass something substantial ; their long - term success will depend on the policies they are able to include .

The Congressional Budget Office says the net annual economy - wide cost of the cap - and - trade program in the House Energy & Commerce Committee ’s climate - change bill in 2020 would be $ 22 billion — or about $ 175 per household .
The figure includes the cost of restructuring the production and use of energy and of payments made to foreign entities under the program , but it does n’t include the economic benefits and other benefits of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the associated slowing of climate change .
Of the total cost , CBO could not determine the incidence of certain pieces ( including both costs and benefits ) that represent , on net , about 8 % of the total .
For the remaining portion of the net cost , households in the lowest income quintile would see an average net * benefit* of about $ 40 in 2020 , while households in the highest income quintile would see a net * cost * of $ 245 .
Added costs for households in the second lowest quintile would be about $ 40 that year ; in the middle quintile , about $ 235 ; and in the fourth quintile , about $ 340 .
Overall net costs would average 0.2 % of households ’ after - tax income .
“ Reducing emissions to the level required by the cap would be accomplished mainly by stemming demand for carbon - based energy by increasing its price , ” CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf says in a post on his blog Saturday .
“ Those higher prices would , in turn , reduce households ’ purchasing power .
At the same time , the distribution of emission allowances would improve households ’ financial situation .
The net financial impact of the program on households in different income brackets would depend in large part on how many allowances were sold ( versus given away ) , how the free allowances were allocated , and how any proceeds from selling allowances were used .
That net impact would reflect both the added costs that households experienced because of higher prices and the share of the allowance value that they received in the form of benefit payments , rebates , tax decreases or credits , wages , and returns on their investments . ”
The CBO analysis focuses on 2020 because at that point the cap on carbon emissions would have been in effect for eight years ( giving the economy time to adjust ) and at which the allocation of allowances would be representative of the situation prior to the phase - down of free allowances .
Microsoft ’s new search engine Bing excels at finding a good restaurant .
Unlike Google , which generally returns links to mere web sites , Bing crawls listings at review services like Yelp.com and CitySearch .
It then summarizes the results and displays a scorecard for each , rating things like service , drinks , food , wait time , lunch offerings , and so on , all laid out in a neat comparative table .
Bing is also great at finding travel information .
Activating the travel tab puts you in a full - service reservation system .
From there you can book tickets and even get tips about when to buy to get the best price .
Wired.com was invited to test - drive the new search engine last week during its beta phase , under the old moniker , Kumo , and we discovered lots of little gems like these .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer unveiled Bing.com to the public on Thursday , as expected , at the All Things D conference in San Diego .
It will go live worldwide by June 3 .
But if Microsoft has come up with a clear improvement over Live.com — the also - ran search portal that Bing replaces — it does n’t quite go far enough to make us feel that it ’s time to dump Google .
On the positive side , we discovered Bing does much more than search for relevant links .
It retrieves and processes data , and renders it smartly .
That makes finding a great restaurant or an airline ticket , a snap .
But the service is far from perfect .
Beautiful data mash - ups coexist side - by - side with perplexing interface choices that make it hard to find the best features .
Meanwhile , actual search results were inaccurate in some cases , and disappointing overall in the local search category , one of the areas Microsoft hopes to make its biggest splash .
Notable improvements in general searches include the addition of related searches based on semantic technology from PowerSet , a search company Microsoft purchased in 2008 .
Microsoft 's main search box now features suggestions as you type , which is especially useful when typing a word whose spelling is unclear to you .
Bing also keeps track of your search history and displays it prominently .
It 's easy to turn off , and since it 's always visible it ’s easy to remember it ’s on , unlike Google 's less obvious approach .
These are nice upgrades , but they are mostly small tweaks and tricks .
The real magic is in the company 's new Local , Shopping and Travel pages .
Here Bing packs some real innovation , especially as it comes to synthesizing information and summarizing it .
Unfortunately , Microsoft chose a confusing interface , and cluttered it with paid listings , and as a result , many people will have to search around just to discover they can search for this information at all .
For local search , typing something intuitive such as " sushi san francisco " returns a plain vanilla list of links and a map , which is not very interesting .
You can drill a lot deeper by clicking tiny “ Local ” and “ More Listings ” links .
The latter takes you to a page where you can reorder results by rating , price , atmosphere , parking and whether a place accepts credit cards .
That 's cool .
Unfortunately , the interface is confusing and you could easily miss this feature if you did n’t know to look for it .
Worse , the results for local searches were sometimes inaccurate and incomplete .
Local search could n't find a number of popular dry cleaners in North Beach , San Francisco , nor could it correctly locate the city ’s one and only In ’N ’ Out Burger .
If local search is something of a letdown , Bing 's travel search is a clear winner that sets it far ahead of Yahoo and Google .
In fact , it 's a full - on reservation search engine whose interface seems uncomfortably close to Kayak.com's .
Once you are there , you 'll find a powerful multi-airline search engine , whose best feature is its price predictor which tells you whether you should wait to buy a ticket or purchase it immediately .
That 's technology it bought when it snapped up FareCast.com .
Unfortunately , once again , it is not obvious how to access this feature .
The search engine 's main box does n't guess that a query such as " SFO Heathrow " is likely an attempt to find a flight , so you 'll have to know to look for the travel link .
Bing ’s shopping search is also a big step forward .
At first glance it looks like any other shopping engine , returning results pages featuring price comparisons , with an emphasis on Microsoft 's CashBack service , where registered users get rebates .
But click on over to user review tab , and voila !
Here you will find awesome and automatic computations of the features that users highlight or hate most in their reviews – a visual representation of research that would take users many minutes to figure out themselves .
How much time could this save a compulsive , review - reading shopper ?
Hours .
With Bing , Microsoft has shown that it understands that different kinds of searches require different kinds of answers and interfaces .
They 've shown too they understand that a search is often only the beginning of a decision such as what Indian restaurant to try or what kind type and model of water filter is best .
Unfortunately , those realizations are too hidden and not well enough developed to make one want to switch over immediately .
There 's a glimmer of something better than a search engine here – call it an information portal .
Bing 's not there yet , but it is pointing the way .

George Voinovich is retiring from Congress next year , and I guess that means he can feel free to let a few things slip out .
In this clip from CNBC , he admits what we 've known all along - that opposition to the President is driving opposition to health care reform .
Republicans know that if a Democratic President expands access to health care more than any time since Medicare , and lowers individual costs for most people , he will reap rewards .
So their strategy , as revealed previously by internal memos and Jim " Waterloo " DeMint , is to obstruct reform to deny the President a " win " , thusly turning the uninsured and the poor into pawns in a political game .
Most of Voinovich 's remarks are of the fiscal scold variety , claiming that we cannot afford the cost of government ( something I forget hearing from Voinovich when he voted to authorize a war in Iraq that cost three trillion dollars ) , but here 's the key moment at around 4:25 :
QUESTIONER : ... on health care , how much of this disagreement with the Administration is about the policy of health care and how to fix it , and how much of it is Republicans ' obvious and understandable desire to declaw the President politically ?
How much of that does fit into the equation .
VOINOVICH : I think it 's about 50 / 50 , but I will tell you this ...
He then claims that some Republicans want to work " on a bipartisan basis " on health care , but that 's pretty much the death knell right there .
Democrats are right to jump all over this and expose the GOP as obstructionists .
We 've known this for some time with the record number of filibusters , but have n't gotten it out to the public .
On a high - profile issue like health care , it should be radioactive to obstruct for political reasons and deny millions of people the right to have quality , affordable care .
No More Manned Fighter Jets ?
James Joyner · · 38 comments
Robert Farley cites testimony by SECDEF Bob Gates and JCS Chair Mike Mullen wherein they do n’t dismiss entirely the idea that the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter might be the last manned fighter the U.S. military ever builds .
He thinks this a logical evolution :
[ T ] here are currently jobs that manned warplanes can do that drones can’t perform ( human pilots are more visually capable than even the best drones , for example ) , but a ) drones are getting better , b ) drones are so much cheaper , and c) taking the pilot out means that you can do a lot of funky , interesting things with an advanced airframe .
This is n’t to say that the F - 35 ( or even the F - 22 ) have no role ; they ’ll continue to be useful frames for the jobs they ’re intended to do for a substantial period of time .
But I do n’t think there ’s a next “ next generation ” of fighter aircraft .
And in any case , it appears that the A - 10 will remain the platform of choice for fighting the giant robots that undoubtedly will afflict us in the future …
David
Axe notes that the aircraft companies and the Russians might have something to say about that and several of Matt Yglesias ‘ commenters point out that the cultural affinity of the military , particularly the Air Force , for manned fighters will be hard to overcome .
One , Campesino , observes that the Navy is already working on an unmanned carrier bomber .
I do n’t claim much expertise on weapons technology but unmanned fighters are scientifically inevitable .
We ’re already pushing the envelope on what human pilots can sustain .
Designing planes around human beings means making them larger , more expensive , and less capable of doing their job than they could already be now .
Human physiology is unlikely to evolve as fast as aerospace technology .
( As an aside , we ’ll continue to need human piloted transport planes , I think , because the need for human judgment is more critical and the need for speed and maneuver is diminished . )
I do , however , have some expertise on the impact of military culture on force planning , having written my dissertation on the subject .
The late Carl Builder outlined the basics twenty years ago in his masterwork The Masks Of War : American Military Styles In Strategy And Analysis .
The essence of the book is that each of the military services has a core vision of itself that remains constant even as technology and the operational environment change .
While the Navy has had fighter planes just as long as the Air Force ( indeed , longer than we ’ve had an independent Air Force ) , it merely sees airplanes as one tool in maintaining American dominance of the seas .
The Air Force , by contrast , exists only because of its “ toys ” and its pilots think of themselves first and foremost as drivers of a particular aircraft .
The combination of the pilot mafia , lobbyists for aircraft manufacturers , and powerful sympathizers in the halls of Congress will make it very difficult to make the technologically logical move here .

- " Lo sapevo che saremmo arrivati a questo , l'avevo anche detto " .
Il sindaco di Massa , Roberto Pucci , ex Pd , oggi a capo di una lista civica , non si dà pace a due giorni dagli scontri tra simpatizzanti di destra e il corteo delle " contro ronde rosse " organizzato dai Carc ( Comitati di appoggio alla resistenza per il comunismo ) e dall ' Asp ( Associazione di solidarietà proletaria ) .
Ha chiesto al prefetto di convocare subito un tavolo sulla sicurezza - oggi alle 18 - e ha chiaro cosa andrà a dire : " Vieterò le ronde organizzate dalla destra .
Massa non ne ha bisogno : dai dati del Viminale siamo la sesta città più sicura in Italia , chiederò a polizia e carabinieri di intervenire perché non si ripetano fatti come quelli di sabato .
E poi le ronde Sss , Soccorso sociale e sicurezza , fin dal nome sono tese a provocare , non hanno alcun seguito , chiedete in giro chi le ha viste ...
Ve lo dico io , nessuno .
Si mettono la pettorina in tre o quattro e chiamano le televisioni , sono state finora tollerate perché considerate quasi un momento di folklore " .
Dopo gli scontri di sabato , il clima in città è cambiato .
Ieri il tribunale è stato presidiato dalle forze dell ' ordine e fuori da una trentina di manifestanti " comunisti " .
I due arrestati , Samuele Bertoneri , 19 anni dell ' Asp e Alessandro Della Malva , 35 , segretario toscano dei Carc , sorpreso con un'asta di metallo vicino al bar da dove erano partiti i saluti romani ( fra i denunciati un carabiniere libero dal servizio ) , avranno l'obbligo di firma in questura , ma sono tornati a casa .
Il processo è rinviato al 9 ottobre .
La polizia sta anche visionando foto e filmati sui primi scontri nel quartiere Partaccia ipotizzando per i simpatizzanti della destra il reato di apologia di fascismo .
Intanto l'ideatore della ronde di Massa , un consigliere comunale de La Destra , Stefano Benedetti , difende il suo " piano - sicurezza " : " Abbiamo una dozzina di adesioni per le ronde .
In due fanno servizio antiborseggio al mercato , un altro pattuglia di notte la Partaccia , zona degradata della città , con pettorina gialla , torcia , telefonino e la scritta Soccorso sociale e sicurezza .
Non c'è nessuna sigla Sss , se l'è inventata la sinistra " .
Benedetti non retrocede : " Non possono vietarci di passeggiare e controllare il territorio avvisando le forze dell ' ordine se ci sono cittadini aggrediti o borseggiati " .
Poi aggiunge : " Attenzione , in questo clima potrebbe anche scapparci il morto , c'è troppa tolleranza del Comune sui comportamenti dei gruppi di sinistra , potrebbero fare un salto di qualità " .
Parole pesanti che arrivano al sindaco : " Mi preoccupano queste dichiarazioni .
Interverremo dichiarando illegittime le ronde , del resto la normativa dice che devono essere organizzate in accordo con sindaco e prefetto .
Il sindaco sono io e non ci sto .
Se le vuole , il ministro Maroni le faccia pure a casa sua " .
Attacca il decreto il presidente della Regione Claudio Martini : " Ciò che è accaduto a Massa è anche il frutto negativo e prevedibile delle scelte fatte dal governo sulla sicurezza .
Si dovevano trovare più mezzi e risorse per le forze dell ' ordine , invece si è preferito puntare su risposte emotive come le ronde e l'introduzione del reato di ingresso clandestino " .
Most photography studio strobe lights are what they call " slaved , " or light - triggered by means of internal sensors ; when one of them fires , all of them will fire simultaneously , so you do n't have to plug a wire from your camera into all of them during multiple - light set -ups .
NYU Interactive Telecommunication Program student Adam Harvey has harnessed this simple technology to devise a brilliant anti-paparazzi device that goes well beyond Ashton Kutcher 's Tweets : A purse with a flash sensor and flash .
His clutch purse contains a sensor that is triggered by a flash going off , and it instantaneously fires its own flash , completely ruining paparazzi shots .
Harvey is currently working on the patent and hopes to have the bag ready for sale by Spring 2010 .

The Deproliferator
Those advocating nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels have been dealt some serious blows .
A recent report disclosed that :
Each 1000 MW [ megawatts ] of nuclear power that is forced into the supply mix would cost between $ 16 billion to $ 41 billion more than a mix of efficiency and renewables .
If the 100 aging nuclear reactors currently on line in the U.S. are replaced with these high cost nuclear reactors , the excess costs could be well in in the range of $ 1.6 trillion to $ 4.1 trillion .
Also , citing economic woes , the nation ’s largest electric and gas utility , Exelon , indefinitely postponed plans to build two nuclear reactors .
Then , the province of Ontario suspended competitive bidding to replace two nuclear reactors .
Meanwhile , Moody ’s investor rating service is considering downgrading utilities seeking to build nuclear reactors for failing to deal with exorbitant costs .
A number of progressives had been coming around to nuclear energy as a clean fuel and a solution to dwindling energy reserves .
If they had known the industry would be dead in the water , they could have spared themselves the embarrassment of appearing to be in denial about safety and nuclear waste issues .
But , because it ’s a source of nationalist pride , costs are not a concern for the nuclear power development program of another state — Iran , of course .
Not only that , it enjoys considerably more support from American progressives than nuclear power in the United States does .
For them , setting aside reservations about Iranian nuclear power serves another purpose besides energy concerns .
It ’s an attempt to undermine any impulse that American and Israeli hawks might harbor toward bombing Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Not only progressives , but a variety of players on the political spectrum , contend that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons guarantees Iran the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes .
Hawks , however , are unable to distinguish between LEU ( low - enriched uranium ) and HEU ( highly enriched ) .
To them all uranium is created equal and those who advocate nuclear power knowledge and technology for Iran are just the latest in a long line of liberals rolling over for the enemy .
Arguably the opinions of hawks count for less when we have an administration that does n’t believe negotiations are a reward for , but an incentive to , peaceable relations .
But advocating anything nuclear for Iran leaves progressives wide open to charges that it ’s aiding and abetting the enemy .
( Even easier pickings for hawks are those progressives willing to concede Iran the bomb .
Nukes , goes the argument , have a way of turning erratic states into rational actors . )
In fact , a germ of truth can be found in the hawks ’ position .
The assertion that Article IV of the NPT guarantees all signers the “ inalienable right ” to nuclear energy is a vast oversimplification , according to Christopher Ford in a recent paper .
( As Cold War nuclear theorist Albert Wohlstetter facetiously wrote , since when did inalienable rights include , “ Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Plutonium ” ? )
But what else would you expect from a member of the Hudson Insitite like Dr. Ford , who was the Bush administration ’s Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation ?
Actually , now that he ’s free of the imperative to promote the Bush administration ’s ticky - tack nuclear agenda , which used petty , legalistic ploys to to help the United States evade responsibility for disarmament leadership , Dr. Ford ’s work is proving valuable .
But he ’s still what could be called a “ small stater ” :
He favors preventing small states from arming before we disarm .
President Obama seems intent on using the opposite , traditional approach to disarmament — demonstrating leadership in arms reductions partly in hopes of convincing small states that the need for nuclear weapons no longer exists ( if it ever did ) .
As he recently said at Moscow :
The notion that prestige comes from holding these weapons , or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons , is an illusion .
Dr. Ford might reserve for the larger states such as the United States the right to “ pick and choose ” which smaller states are the beneficiaries of nuclear knowledge and technology for peaceful purposes .
His position can be summed up in this passage from his paper Nuclear Technology Rights and Wrongs :
The NPT , Article IV , and Nonproliferation :
The bottom line , however , was that the United Nations recommended that proliferation impact — and the closely related criterion of safeguardability — be made the keys to determining what technology can and should be permitted to national governments .
In fact , there ’s merit to his concern that the inalienable - rights contingent “ would turn Article IV into a mechanism for undermining the rest of the Treaty by facilitating the spread of the ( fissile material production ) technologies that are critical to making nuclear weapons . ”
Plus , Dr. Ford has nuclear history on his side .
He writes of Wohlstetter , who warned . . .
. . . of the dangers of a situation in which , “ in return for their .
. . promise not to make or accept nuclear explosives , ” non-weapons states would .
. . acquire “ civilian technologies that would [ lead them down ] the road to nuclear explosives . ”
Wohlstetter characterized the NPT as . … “ a highly ambiguous and uncertain set of compromises , reflecting but not resolving [ among other things ] the problem of encouraging civilian nuclear energy while discouraging military nuclear energy . ”
After all , as the first report of the U.N. Atomic Energy Commission pointed out , as quoted by Dr. Ford , the manufacturing processes of nuclear power and weapons are “ identical and inseparable up to a very advanced state of manufacture . ”
Just like , domestically , progressives view nuclear power as the lesser of two evils between it and coal , they view nuclear energy in Iran as the lesser of two evils between it and war .
But the lesser evil in the second case can be halved — by enticing Iran to set aside its nuclear enrichment and avail itself of an international fuel bank .
In the long run , however , it may be impossible to wean a state like Iran off its own nuclear enrichment program unless the large states , beginning with the United States , take dramatic steps toward disarmament .
These include following through on the preliminary agreement with Russia to slash nuclear arsenals and draft a new START treaty .
We also need to renew our commitment to the NPT at its review conference next year and , as well , ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
Maybe then small states will no longer feel a perceived need for nuclear weapons .
They can stop thinking ( if indeed they are ) of nuclear energy as a precursor to nuclear weapons and save themselves a lot of grief as well as money by thinking instead in terms of fuel banks .
… once more , against immigrants , refugees and anti-racists .
Neo-nazis and junta - nostalgic ultra-nationalists were to have a demo in down - town Athens yesterday , bargaining on the mood cultivated by mass media sentiment of economic insecurity , to promote their anti-immigration absurdities .
The gathering spot for this demo was at Omonoia square and about 100 braindeads were there .
The gist of the days ’ events is that the Police has an excellent cooperation with the para- statal neo -Nazis ( of Golden Dawn ) and uses them to help keep up the anti-migrant terror .
At the same time , in surrounding streets and squares , antiracist organizations of all shades called for counter - demos .
Most of the anarchists gathered at Kaniggos square but they were attacked by riot police and repulsed towards Exarcheia and the Polytechnic .
There were conflicts and barricades for some time there .
From Kotzia square migrant , student and leftist associations moved towards Stadiou avenue to prevent the neo - nazis from taking it to this central avenue .
At the same time , other antiracist organizations of the left gathered in front of the Court of Appeals building .
The neo -nazis when obstructed from doing the demo started beating randomly immigrants with iron bars in Menandrou street .
The police all the time looked but not intervened .
Their collaboration got even tighter when the neo -nazis moved towards their headquarters , which is located near the Court of Appeals building at Socratous Street .
Under the protection of the riot police , from their hq ’s roof and then from the street , the neo -nazis attacked the building where immigrants find refuge with stones and flash and sound grenades .
The neo - nazis were all wearing helmets , this at a time when in Greece the state attempts to illegalise hoods in protests .
They tried to invade the building but the immigrants defended it with stones .
Four protestors and many immigrants were injured .

Readers have been asking for awhile that I run some more " hot topics " threads , like the earlier ones on ethics and epistemology .
I apologize for not running these more frequently , and will plan on running more of these in 2009 .
So what are some of the hot topics in " metaphysics " ?
The specialty as a whole seems to be thriving ( much to the distress of Quineans and retrograde positivists ! ) .
All the classic topics ( time , persistence , identity et al. ) seem to have received significant recent discussion , and the metaphysics of causation also seems to have returned to center stage in the last ten years .
Post your comments , below , and the more detail the better .
Also feel free to post links to on - line resources ( papers , blog discussions , etc. ) .
Post only once ; comments may take awhile to appear .
What some call art , others , like the authorities in North Carolina , call larceny .
As a person who got their start in the creative arts I can very much appreciate this ‘ sculpture . ’
But also as a driver , I find the Barrel Monster is much more effective at directing traffic and providing driving warnings .
Maybe when Joseph Carnevale ( the NC State student who has been arrested and charged with this ‘ crime ’ ) gets free he should go into business mass producing these things .
Carnevale is a self - described “ Urban Explorer , ” thrill seeker and adventurist who goes by the handle U Live and You Burn .
He spends his spare time doing graffiti , making cool barrel art and trespassing into places that look inviting like abandoned buildings , sewer systems and construction sites .
He also hops rides on freight trains and has climbed the Brooklyn Bridge .
Carnevale does all of these things while taking some really amazing photographs which appear on his blog at nopromiseofsafety .com .
Also , you may want to check out an interview with him that the Technician conducted prior to his arrest .
Hopefully Carnevale has a quality lawyer to assist with his case .
While no one was injured , a personal injury case should be handled by an experienced law firm .
A personal injury lawyer San Diego can handle all types of injury cases .

I 'm listening to the New Yorker 's political podcast , with Ryan Lizza and James Surowiecki discussing health care reform and one of them ( Lizza ? ) makes the perfectly obvious point that if we 're going to dramatically change the way we pay for health care , we 'll likely have to dramatically change the way we pay the people providing us the care : that is , doctors .
Obama has said as much , calling on law makers to " change the warped incentives " that reward doctors for the number of operations they do .
But how exactly do we create incentives for doctors to earn less ?
First , let 's consider how much American doctors are paid .
The answer is : a lot , by international standards .
Here 's one look , via an old Ezra Klein post :
As of 1996 , the annual average income of American physicians was twice Canada's , thrice France , and almost four times the UK .
And , as nobody needs to be reminded , the Canadians and French and Brits all live longer than Americans .
But how exactly do you change the " warped incentives " in a way that doctors find acceptable ?
Changing incentives is something of an expertise -- or at least , fixation -- of the Obama administration .
His style is n't to mandate changes from on high but to tweak and nudge incentives to make individual actors find selfish reasons to choose to follow his agenda .
Here was my Jennifer Aniston Theory of Obamaism :
Obama 's agenda lays out it goals clearly , but it also gives us space , because it wants us to choose its agenda .
It wants private investors to choose to buy the toxic assets .
It wants private insurers to choose prevenative care .
Obama does n't want to do the dishes .
He wants us to want to do the dishes .
How do you get doctors to want to want to make less money ?
Confession : I have no idea .
As Ezra suggests , Obama could propose to subsidize medical education in exchange for lowered pay to keep doctors from sinking into debt after graduation ( seems a bit heavy handed ) , or he could allow more nurse practitioners .
We could offer a public option that paid doctors by patients , closer to what they do in the UK , instead of by procedure to discourage over - treatment and then find a way to shelter them from law suits to encourage docs to take the pay cut .
That latter part could be a bit dangerous .
Or we could work incrementally away from overprescription by emulating the Mayo Clinic , which pays doctors a fixed salary to encourage doctors not to maximize their patient load or overprescribe .
I could try to go on , but I won't , because other people certainly have better ideas for limiting doctor pay and because limiting doctor pay is going to be like pulling teeth from a jungle cat .
Ultimately , like so many other aspects of our health care crisis , high doctor salaries is just another impacted tooth : easy to put your finger on , awfully sensitive , and damn near impossible to extract without a lot of yelling .
Venezuela and Spain have signed a multi-million euro energy deal , which will provide Madrid with oil , and Venezuela with a new power plant .
It creates a new joint venture to produce 24,000 barrels of oil and 700,000 cubic metres of natural gas a day .
The wide - ranging deal also sees Venezuela taking over Spanish - owned electricity and gas plants .
“ We have reached an agreement to work together to build peace and stability in Latin America , to anchor the strategic relationship between Latin America , the Caribbean and European Union when Spain assumes the presidency of the EU in January , ” said Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos .
Venezuela is the fifth - largest oil producing country in the world .
Exports have funded President Hugo Chavez ’s social revolution , although income has fallen during the recession .
The contract also allows Spain ’s Repsol energy company to look for oil in the Orinoco River basin where there are thought to be huge reserves .
Environmentalists have condemned plans to drill in the jungle .

Tutorial
A step - by - step tutorial for learning ActionScript and Flare .
Getting Started
The first step is to get your development tools set up .
Setup a working flash development environment .
There are two approaches .
We recommend the first for simplicity , but more advanced users are welcome to use the second approach .
Option 1 ( simpler ) : Install Adobe Flex Builder .
This is a full development environment for ActionScript / Flex applications .
It is available for all the major platforms ( Windows , Mac , Unix ) .
Users who already use the Eclipse IDE can also install Flex Builder as an Eclipse plug - in .
The caveat to using Flex Builder is that it is commercial software and will only work for a limited trial period .
However , Adobe provides free Flex Builder licenses to university students , faculty , and staff .
Option 2 ( more complicated ) : Install the free Flex SDK
This will install the basic ActionScript / Flex compilers : mxmlc and compc .
You can then setup your own build environment , for example , using the make or ant build systems .
Flare is packaged with a build.xml file for use with the Apache Ant build system .
Once ant is installed , just open the build.xml file in a text editor , change the first couple lines to point to your Flex SDK installation , and then use ant to compile the libraries .
We make use of Adobe Labs ’ ant tasks for Flex development .
The advantage of this approach is that all the software is free , and will not expire on you .
However , you lose out on features like automatic compilation , project management , and auto - complete provided by Flex Builder .
Download the prefuse flare libraries .
The download is a zip file containing a set of ActionScript library projects .
Unzip the files into your primary workspace directory if you are using Flex Builder .
During the tutorial we will import them into Flex Builder and use them to build visualizations !
The software is currently an alpha version , and so some bugs and limitations are to be expected .
We will fix problems as soon as we can , and the link above will always point to the most recent version .
Introduction to Flash and ActionScript 3
Flash is a great environment for interactive graphics and with the recent addition of the ActionScript 3 programming language , it just became a lot more powerful and efficient .
While a complete introduction to AS3 is beyond the scope of this tutorial , here are some resources you will find useful :
Adobe provides an Overview of AS3 , with links to additional resources .
Essential ActionScript 3 by Colin Moock from O’Reilly publishing is a great book to help you get started .
You can access it online here ( some institutions , such as universities , provide access for free ) .
The Adobe Flex API Reference is invaluable for understanding the different classes and methods available .
We will be focused only on the classes in the flash .* packages .
This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with ActionScript syntax and types , as well as concepts of object - oriented programming .
Part 1 : DisplayObjects
Introduction
Flash models a 2D visual scene using a scenegraph .
Visual objects are organized in a hierarchy , with child objects defined in the coordinate space of the parent .
You ’ll often see this scenegraph referred to as the display list in both Adobe ’s documentation and in books on Flash programming .
The node at the top of the display list is always the Stage object .
The stage always has one and only one child .
This is called the root , and all visual items are underneath the root .
Typically , the root is your actual Flash application .
We ’ll come back to this soon .
All visual items that can be added to the display list are instances of the DisplayObject class .
Subclasses of DisplayObject include Bitmap ( for images ) , TextField ( for interactive text areas ) , and Video ( think YouTube ) .
The most common instances , however , are the Sprite and Shape classes .
For reference most of these classes can be found in the flash .
display package ( though eventually you ’ll likely find the flash .
text package of use , too ) .
The Sprite class is the most useful , general visual object used by the Flash Player .
Sprites are visual objects that contain both drawing content and can serve as a container for sub-nodes in the display list ( the Sprite class subclasses the flash.display.DisplayObjectContainer class ) .
In contrast , the Shape class can contain drawing content , but can not hold sub -nodes .
As a result , Shapes use up less memory , but are much less flexible .
For simplicity , we ’ll focus on Sprites in this tutorial .
Create A New Application
First , let ’s create a new Flash application .
To do this , open Flex Builder and make sure you are in the “ Flex Development ” perspective ( often reached by clicking the black and white “ Fx ” icon in the upper right ) .
In the “ Navigator ” pane on the left , right click the display and select “ New > ActionScript Project ” .
In the resulting dialog , type “ Tutorial ” as the project name , then click “ Finish ” .
This will create a new project for you .
You should now see a “ Tutorial ” folder in the “ Navigator ” pane .
Within this folder , you should see a file named “ Tutorial.as ” .
This is your main application file .
Open it , if it is not open already .
Inside the file , you ’ll see the basic scaffolding for this class :
package { import flash .display .
Sprite ; public class Tutorial extends Sprite { public function Tutorial ( ) { } } }
Notice that this class extends the Sprite class .
Because this is our main application class , when we run the application an instance of the Tutorial class will automatically be added to the display list as its root ( the one and only child of the Stage ) .
Notice also that a constructor has been automatically created .
This constructor will be called when the application launches .
For those familiar with programming languages such as C , C++ , or Java , the constructor for the application class acts much like a main function in those other languages .
With this new application scaffolding in place , we can start playing with visual objects .
However , there is one thing we want to do first .
Add a new line directly above the class declaration ( ” public class Tutorial … ” ) line that says :
[ SWF ( width = " 800 " , height = " 600 " , backgroundColor= " # ffffff " , frameRate = " 30 " ) ]
This line defines default settings for your application ( which is compiled and saved as a . swf file in your project ’s “ bin ” directory ) .
Above , we set the size , background color , and target frame rate ( in frames per second ) for our application .
Sprites
Like all DisplayObjects , Sprite supports a number of visual properties right out of the box .
This includes the x , y , scaleX , scaleY , rotation , and alpha properties .
These respectively change the position , size , orientation , and transparency of a sprite ( and all its children !
Remember , we ’re using a scenegraph here ) .
However , these values do n’t mean much yet , as sprites do n’t contain anything by default .
We ’ll start by drawing our own content .
Every Sprite also has a graphics property .
We can use this to draw graphics for the Sprite .
The graphics property is an instance of the flash .
display .
Graphics class , which provides a number of vector drawing commands .
In the example below , we do a number of things .
First , we create a new Sprite .
.
Second , we use the sprite ’s graphics to draw a circle with gray fill and black outline .
beginFill sets the current fill color and style .
The first argument is the color , in hex notation , and the second argument is the alpha value , which ranges from 0 for fully transparent to 1 for fully opaque .
lineStyle sets the current stroke color and style .
The first argument is the line width , the second argument is the color .
drawCircle draws a circle of radius 10 at the point 0,0 in the coordinate space of our sprite .
to draw a circle with gray fill and black outline .
Third , we add the sprite as a child of our main application ( a Tutorial sprite ) .
sprite ) .
Fourth , we set the x and y position of our sprite .
and position of our sprite .
Fifth , we add some debugging output .
trace prints a string to the console .
This output only shows up when running the app in “ debug ” mode .
Here ’s the code :
package { import flash .display .
Sprite ; [ SWF ( width= " 800 " , height = " 600 " , backgroundColor= " # ffffff " , frameRate = " 30 " ) ] public class Tutorial extends Sprite { public function Tutorial ( ) { var sprite : Sprite = new Sprite ( ) ; sprite.graphics.beginFill(0xcccccc , 0.5 ) ; sprite.graphics.lineStyle(1 , 0x000000 ) ; sprite.graphics.drawCircle(0 , 0 , 10 ) ; this.addChild ( sprite ) ; sprite.x = 50 ; sprite.y = 50 ; trace ( " our sprite is at : " + sprite .x + " , " + sprite.y ) ; } } }
Run the application ( right click “ Tutorial.as ” and select “ Run As > Flex Application ” ) .
You should see a gray circle with black outline in the upper left corner , centered on the point 50 , 50 .
If you run the application in debug mode ( select “ Debug As > Flex Application ” ) , you should also see the string “ our sprite is at : 50 , 50 ” in the output console .
Nested Sprites
Now let ’s make our scene a bit more interesting .
Let ’s start by moving our Sprite generation code to a new method .
We ’ll add this method to our class :
private function createCircle( x : Number , y: Number ) : Sprite { var sprite : Sprite = new Sprite ( ) ; sprite.graphics.beginFill(0xcccccc , 0.5 ) ; sprite.graphics.lineStyle(1 , 0x000000 ) ; sprite.graphics.drawCircle(0 , 0 , 10 ) ; sprite .x = x ; sprite.y = y ; return sprite ; }
Next , we replace the code in our constructor .
First , we create a new sprite called container which we ’ll use to hold a collection of circles .
We place it in the center of our stage .
Second , we use a loop to create a bunch of circles .
Here , we line up the circles symmetrically around the 0,0 point of the parent container .
Our new constructor now looks like this :
public function Tutorial ( ) { var container : Sprite = new Sprite ( ) ; container .x = 400 ; container.y = 300 ; this .addChild ( container ) ; for ( var i:int=0 ; i< 10 ; ++i ) { var x: Number = ( i/5<1 ? 1 : - 1 ) * ( 13 + 26 * ( i%5 ) ) ; container.addChild( createCircle(x , 0 ) ) ; } }
Run the new version of the application .
You should see a line of ten circles in the middle of the application .
We can now modify the container to update all the circles within it .
Try playing with setting different visual variables on the container sprite .
For example , modify the x , y , scaleX , scaleY , rotation , and alpha properties .
Other Topics
There ’s a lot more you can do with the basic options Flash provides .
Unfortunately , they are a bit beyond what we have time for here .
Some things to explore include image filters ( see the flash .
filters package ) , which allow you to add visual effects to display objects using their filters property , and the different options available in the flash .
display .
Graphics class , including fill and line styles , and many more 2D drawing routines .
Part 2 : Animations
Now that we can create visual objects , it ’s time to start giving them some life .
Flare includes the flare. animate package to help make this easy .
First , we need to import the flare libraries for use in Flex Builder .
Importing Libraries
Before proceeding , make sure you have the flare libraries loaded as projects within Flex Builder .
You should have already unzipped the flare files into your main Flex Builder workspace directory .
The next step is to import them into the Flex Builder environment :
Make sure you are in the “ Flex Development ” perspective .
Right click the navigator pane on the left .
Select “ Import … ” in the popup menu .
In the dialog , select “ General > Existing Projects into Workspace ” and click the “ Next ” button .
Use the “ Select root directory ” widgets to navigate to your Flex Builder workspace directory
You should now see the flare projects listed in the “ Projects : ” panel .
Select the “ flare ” and “ flare.demos ” projects and then click the “ Finish ” button .
You should now see the flare projects in the Navigator pane .
You can now browse the source code for each both the library and the demos .
Overview of the flare library
Here is a quick overview of the flare toolkit .
Inside the flare project , look inside the “ src/ flare ” folder .
You ’ll find a number of packages providing different features :
analytics : operators for computing statistics and analyzing data
: operators for computing statistics and analyzing data animate : tools for creating animations
: tools for creating animations data : methods for reading and writing data sets
: methods for reading and writing data sets display : DisplayObject types that extend those provided by flash .
display
: types that extend those provided by flex : a wrapper for embedding Flare visualizations in Flex applications
: a wrapper for embedding Flare visualizations in Flex applications physics : a physics engine for physical effects or force - directed layout
: a physics engine for physical effects or force - directed layout query : a query processor for ActionScript objects
: a query processor for ActionScript objects scale : classes for handling data scales , such as linear , log , and time scales
: classes for handling data scales , such as linear , log , and time scales util : a set of utility classes providing commonly needed functions
: a set of utility classes providing commonly needed functions vis : the flare visualization components and operators
There is also the flare .
demos project , which provides a number of examples of how to create Flare components .
Importing a library within another project
To make use of flare in your own projects , you will need to update your project settings .
Here ’s how to do that :
In the Navigator pane , right click the top folder of the “ Tutorial ” project Click “ Properties ” in the context menu
In the resulting dialog , click “ ActionScript Build Path ” in the left panel ( it should be the 3rd item from the top ) Click the “ Library path ” tab in the right panel Click the “ Add Project ” button
You should now see a list of projects , including flare .
Select “ flare ” and then click “ OK ”
You ’ve now added the flare libraries to your project , and can use any of the classes it provides .
One thing to note about the Flex compiler – by default , it only includes the classes that you actually you use in your application .
So even if you import a very large library , the size of your final . swf file can still be quite small .
However , beware that this can cause issues if you use reflection to perform dynamic class loading in your application ( a more advanced feature not covered in this tutorial ) .
Basic Animation : Tween , Sequence , and Parallel
Ok , now let ’s animate !
The flare.animate .
Transition class is the base class for all animations .
Important subclasses of Transition are the Tween , Sequence , and Parallel transitions .
Tweens are used to animate properties of a single object .
Sequences are used to run a series of animations in order .
Parallel transitions run a collection of transitions simultaneously .
Let ’s start with Tween .
Tweening Object Properties
The basics of the Tween class are simple : we take an object , give a set of property values we would like to change over time , and specify the time duration for that change .
Using the Tutorial application from Part 1 , let ’s rotate the container object .
Add the following line to the end of the Tutorial class constructor :
var tween : Tween = new Tween ( container , 3 , {rotation :360} ) ; tween.play ( ) ;
Also , make sure that you have a new import statement at the top of your class , so the compiler knows what you ’re talking about .
Add this to the list of imports :
import flare.animate .
Tween ;
( NOTE : sometimes Flex Builder will automatically add an import statement for you as you type a new class name .
If not , another technique is to put the text cursor at the end of the new class name and type “ Ctrl - Space ” – this should create a new import for you for the class . )
Now run your application –the points should rotate in a circle over a 3 second period .
Here ’s what the Tween constructor is doing :
The first argument is the object whose values should be tweened
The second argument is the length of the animation , in seconds
The third argument is an Object instance listing the properties to animate and their target values .
The property names must exactly match the properties of the input object .
Nested properties are allowed , but must be enclosed in quotes .
For example , { “ data .
profit” :50} is a legal input if the input object has a property named data which in turn has a property named profit .
The play method then runs the animation .
The play method can also be called with a single Boolean parameter indicating whether or not to run the animation in reverse .
You may have noticed that the rotation animation exhibits some acceleration .
This is because the default setting for Tween instances is to use “ slow - in slow - out ” animation .
You can control these behaviors using Easing functions .
These functions take as input the current animation progress as a fraction between 0 and 1 .
They then return a manipulated progress fraction to change the pace of the animation , often in a non-linear fashion .
To remove easing ( i.e. , use a linear easing function ) you can write : tween .easing = Easing.none .
Just make sure you import the flare.animate .
Easing class at the top of the file .
Feel free to experiment with other easing functions .
For example , easing functions may involve easing in ( manipulate the start of the animation only ) , easing out ( manipulate the end of the animation only ) , or both .
For example , try this : tween .
easing = Easing.easeOutBounce .
This should make the rotation bounce at the end .
Before moving on , try animating other properties of the container , such as position , scale or alpha values .
Composite Animations
The Sequence and Parallel classes allow you to group animations together .
Sequence runs a set of animations one after the other .
For example , try this :
var t1 : Tween = new Tween ( container , 1 , { y :100} ) ; var t2 : Tween = new Tween ( container , 1 , { scaleX:2} ) ; var t3 : Tween = new Tween ( container , 1 , { y :300} ) ; var t4 : Tween = new Tween ( container , 1 , { scaleX:1} ) ; var seq : Sequence = new Sequence ( new Parallel ( t1 , t2 ) , new Parallel ( t3 , t4 ) ) ; seq.play ( ) ;
You ’ll also need to add some new import statements at the top of the file :
import flare.animate .
Parallel ; import flare.animate .
Sequence ;
This creates four tweens : t1 , t2 , t3 , and t4 .
It then creates two parallel transitions that run t1 and t2 together and run t3 and t4 together .
The parallel transitions are then run one after the other in a sequence .
In this way , it is easy to build more complicated animations .
For more advanced composite animations , take a look at the FlareLogo and flare .
demos .
Animation classes in the flare .
demos project .
Batch Animation with Transitioners
Using the Tween , Parallel , and Sequence classes , you can make any number of animated transitions .
However , when dealing with large collections of objects ( common in visualization ) it can be a pain to manually handle a similarly large set of tweens .
Furthermore , it should be easy to run separate routines for encoding visual properties like layout , color , size , shape and not have to worry about handling animation .
Perhaps you want to animate changes or perhaps you want a static update .
Either way , you should be able to reuse the same code for assigning values .
To address these concerns , Flare provides the Transitioner class .
Transitioners simplify the process of creating animations for collections of objects .
You simply take an object and set the desired properties one - by - one .
Behind the scenes , the transitioner will automatically generate and reuse the necessary tweens to model the full animation .
Furthermore , if animation is not desired , the transitioner can be configured to instead set the property values immediately .
In short , the transitioner provides a layer of indirection for updating object properties – these updates can be collected and then animated , or applied immediately .
Here ’s a simple example of using a transitioner in our tutorial app .
var t: Transitioner = new Transitioner ( 2 ) ; for ( var j:int=0 ; j<container.numChildren ; ++j ) { var s:Sprite = container.getChildAt(j ) as Sprite ; t.$(s ) .y = 200 * ( Math.random ( ) - 0.5 ) ; t.$(s ) .scaleY = 1 + 2*Math.random ( ) ; } t.play ( ) ;
This example animates all the sprites in container to a new random y position and random vertical scale factor .
We first create a new Transitioner that should create a 2 - second animation .
We then loop through each child sprite and use the transitioner to set the properties to Tween .
The Transitioner ’s $ operator indicates that we want to set a target value for the input object .
By default , either a new Tween is created , or an existing Tween is found for the current item .
The $ operator then returns an object upon which to set the tween ’s target property .
Furthermore , transitioners can be used to create static ( non-animated ) transitions .
If a transitioner ’s immediate property is set to true , it will not create new Tweens .
Instead , the $ operator will simply return the input value .
This means you can create methods that update values using a transitioner , and then later control whether or not you want those values updated .
The standard “ immediate - mode ” Transitioner is retrieved using the static Transitioner .
DEFAULT property .
That way you do n’t need to allocate a new Transitioner when performing immediate updates .
Transitioners are used extensively throughout the flare .vis package , allowing visualization designers to control which updates should be animated and how .
Part 3 : Visualizations
Loading Data
The basic data representation for Flare simply uses the built - in Flash data types : Object and Array .
For example , a table of data can just be represented as an array of objects , which each object containing the names and values of each data field .
While more efficient representations are possible , this approach provides the most flexibility while also taking advantage of existing Flash development conventions .
To load data into the Flash player , there are a number of approaches .
A simple approach is to embed your data into the application itself .
That way , the data gets downloaded along with the application , which is fine for static data sets .
For example , you can use ActionScript ’s object notation to define the data set directly as a variable :
var data : Array = [ {id : " Q1 " , sales : 10000 , profit:2400} , {id : " Q2 " , sales : 12000 , profit:2900} , {id : " Q3 " , sales : 15000 , profit:3800} , {id : " Q4 " , sales : 15500 , profit:3900} ] ;
However , in many cases you will want to load your data dynamically , either from within a web page ( you can use JavaScript in the browser to pass values into Flash ) , or from a server on the internet .
There are many approaches to doing this and you should pick whatever works best for your particular application .
For example , ActionScript provides additional data types and syntax for working with XML data using the ECMAScript for XML ( E4X ) standard .
Flare also provides some utilities for loading external data sets .
It supports loading data from any server on the internet and converting that data into internal ActionScript objects .
The currently supported file formats are tab - delimited text ( “ tab ” , a standard file format for exporting data from tools such as Excel ) , JavaScript Object Notation ( “ json ” , a common data format for web applications ) , and GraphML ( “ graphml ” , an XML format for representing networks with nodes and edges ) .
Remote data is loaded by flare using the flare.data .
DataSource class .
Here ’s an example of using it to load a tab - delimited data file :
var ds : DataSource = new DataSource ( " http://flare.prefuse.org/data/test.tab.txt " , " tab " ) ; var loader : URLLoader = ds.load ( ) ; loader.addEventListener( Event.COMPLETE , function ( evt : Event ) : void { // function to handle data once loading is complete var ds : DataSet = loader.data as DataSet ; // now do something with the data ... } ) ;
The DataSource constructor has two required arguments : the url of the data set , and a string indicating the file format .
Right now the supported formats are “ tab ” ( tab - delimited ) , “ json ” ( JavaScript Object Notation ) , and “ graphml ” ( GraphML ) .
For data sets whose schema ( the names and data types of the fields ) may be unclear , there is also a third , optional constructor argument which takes a DataSchema type .
See the flare.data.DataSchema and flare.data.DataField classes for more .
The schema can be helpful for ensuring that data values are properly named ( e.g. , for a tab delimited file missing a header row ) and converted into the proper data types ( e.g. , for JSON data in which numeric values were wrapped in quotes ) .
To actually load the data , the DataSource load method is called , returning a flash .
net .
URLLoader instance .
The loader can be used to track the progress of the download ( e.g. , if you wanted to provide a progress bar ) and provides a notification event when the download is completed .
In the example above , we add an event listener to be notified when the download completes .
The DataSource will automatically parse the input data , map it into ActionScript objects , and store the results in a flare.data .
DataSet object .
The DataSet class can represent both table and network ( node / edge ) data .
Creating and Managing Visual Objects
Now we would like to visualize a data set .
To do this , we map individual data records into visual items .
Flare provides a set of visual objects to represent the data .
Here ’s an overview of the basic classes provided by the flare.vis.data package .
DataSprite : Base class for sprites that visually represent data .
DataSprite is a subclass of the Flash Player ’s Sprite class .
DataSprite includes a data property where the data tuple ( an ActionScript Object ) is stored and also provides additional visual variables beyond those supported by basic sprites , including color , shape , and size fields , and support for setting positions in polar coordinates .

NodeSprite : DataSprite instance representing a node .
This is the default type used for visualizing data .
NodeSprite instances can be connected within network or tree structures by EdgeSprite instances .
: instance representing a node .
This is the default type used for visualizing data .
instances can be connected within network or tree structures by instances .
EdgeSprite : DataSprite instance representing an edge .
An EdgeSprite connects two NodeSprites .
The nodes are accessible through the source and target properties .
EdgeSprites are used to create graphs and trees , as well as to represent lines , such as in time - series graphs .
Typically , NodeSprites and EdgeSprites are created and stored in the flare.vis.data .Data class , which manages all the visual items for a single visualization .
The Data class provides methods for creating new visual objects for data tuples and for representing a graph structure .
The Data class also provides methods for traversing and updating the contained data items .
The nodes and edges properties return lists of the nodes and edges contained within the data .
Each of these lists includes a visit method that allows you to pass in a function that will then be called with each node or edge .
Also , the setProperty and setProperties methods allow you to set property values for all nodes or edges at once .
These methods optionally take a Transitioner as an argument , so you can animate the property update .
For example , the following code results in a one second animation in which the line color for all nodes is set to blue .
( Note that the hex notation for DataSprite color values include the alpha as well as red , green , blue channels ) .
data.nodes.setProperty (" lineColor " , 0xff0000bb , new Transitioner ( 1 ) ) .play ( ) ;
Node and edge lists also support default property values , using the setDefault , setDefaults , removeDefault , and clearDefaults methods .
Default values will be set on a node or edge newly created using the Data class ’ addNode or addEdgeFor methods .
The Tree class is a subclass of Data , specialized to represent a tree rather than a general graph .
The Data class supports the automatic creation of a Tree instance by computing spanning trees of a general graph .
A number of spanning tree creation methods –including breadth - first , depth - first , and minimum spanning tree algorithms–can be passed in as a parameter .
These calculations are performed using the flare.analytics.graph.SpanningTree class .
To actually create node and edges objects , we use the addNode and addEdgeFor methods .
addNode takes an input data tuple ( an Object ) and creates a new NodeSprite for visualizing that data .
takes an input data tuple ( an ) and creates a new for visualizing that data .
addEdgeFor takes two existing NodeSprites and adds an EdgeSprite connecting them .
The method also optionally excepts a data tuple ( again , an Object representing any data fields ) for the edge .
Here is a simple example for creating NodeSprites for a tabular data set , assuming we have an array of data objects :
var list : Array ; // an array of data objects we have already loaded var data : Data = new Data( ) ; // a new data container for each ( var o: Object in list ) { data.addNode(o ) ; }
The result is a Data object populated with visual DataSprite ( nodes or edges ) instances .
In practice , you do n’t always need to populate the visualized data manually .
To create a Data object for visualizing a loaded data set , you can often use a convenience method instead .
The Data.fromArray ( ) function creates a Data instance for tabular data stored as an array of ActionScript objects , while the Data. fromDataSet ( ) method similarly creates a Data instance from a loaded DataSet object .
Constructing a Visualization
Now let ’s put this all together to start making visualizations .
The Visualization class represents a single visualization , including visual marks ( stored in a Data instance ) and axes .
To create a visualization , we load a data set , add the data to a visualization , and set up operators that determine how to visualize the data .
Here is an example .
Look over the code first , then read on to understand what each part is doing .
package { import flare.data.DataSet ; import flare.data.DataSource ; import flare.scale.ScaleType ; import flare.vis.Visualization ; import flare.vis.data.Data ; import flare.vis.operator.encoder.ColorEncoder ; import flare.vis.operator.encoder.ShapeEncoder ; import flare.vis.operator.layout.AxisLayout ; import flash .display .Sprite ; import flash.events .
Event ; import flash.geom .
Rectangle ; import flash.net .
URLLoader ; [ SWF ( width= " 800 " , height = " 600 " , backgroundColor= " # ffffff " , frameRate = " 30 " ) ] public class Tutorial extends Sprite { private var vis: Visualization ; public function Tutorial ( ) { loadData ( ) ; } private function loadData ( ) : void { var ds : DataSource = new DataSource ( " http://flare.prefuse.org/data/homicides.tab.txt " , " tab " ) ; var loader : URLLoader = ds.load ( ) ; loader.addEventListener( Event.COMPLETE , function ( evt : Event ) : void { var ds : DataSet = loader.data as DataSet ; visualize ( Data.fromDataSet(ds ) ) ; } ) ; } private function visualize ( data : Data ) : void { vis = new Visualization ( data ) ; vis.bounds = new Rectangle ( 0 , 0 , 600 , 500 ) ; vis.x = 100 ; vis.y = 50 ; add Child ( vis ) ; vis.operators.add( new AxisLayout ( " data.date " , " data.age " ) ) ; vis.operators.add(new ColorEncoder ( " data.cause " , Data .
NODES , " lineColor " , ScaleType.CATEGORIES ) ) ; vis.operators.add( new ShapeEncoder ( " data.race " ) ) ; vis.data.nodes.setProperties({fillColor:0 , lineWidth : 2} ) ; vis.update ( ) ; } } }
Let ’s look at each method .
The constructor is simple : it just calls the loadData method .
The loadData method creates a new data source and loads it using the methods described earlier .
In this case , the data set is reported homicides in Los Angeles county in 2007 , stored in tab - delimited format .
When the load is complete , the loaded data tuples are added to a Data instance using the fromDataSet convenience method .
Under the hood , this results in the creation of NodeSprites for visualizing each data item .
Finally , the visualize method is called .
The visualize method sets up the visualization .
Here ’s what is happening in each step :
Part 1 : Initialization
A new visualization is created for the data
We set the bounds for the visualization .
This determines the layout area .
We set the x and y position of our visualization and the add the visualization to the display list .
Part 2 : Specifying Visual Encodings
We use an axis layout , placing “ date ” on the x-axis and “ age ” on the y - axis .
The AxisLayout operator also automatically configures the axes for the visualization .
We use the syntax “ data.date ” to denote the data variables , as they are located within the NodeSprite ‘s data property .
We add a color encoding , so that a node ’s line color represents the “ cause ” ( cause of death ) variable .
We also tell the color encoder that the values of the “ cause ” variable represent categories ( ScaleType. CATEGORIES
) .
The color encoder will use this information to automatically pick an appropriate color palette .
As we will see shortly , you can also provide your own color palette .
We add a shape encoding , so that an object ’s shape represents the “ race ” of a victim .
We set default properties – we set nodes ’ fill color to full transparent , and set the line width to 2 pixels .
Finally , we call the update method .
This runs all the operators in order .
Updating a Visualization
Once a visualization has been created , we may want to update it .
For example , maybe we would like to change the color encoding to instead visualize people ’s gender .
First , let ’s add a new method to the class :
private function colorByGender ( ) : void { var color: ColorEncoder = ColorEncoder(vis.operators [ 1 ] ) ; color.source = " data.sex " ; color.
palette = new ColorPalette ( [ 0xffff5555 , 0xff8888ff ] ) ; vis.update ( new Transitioner ( 2 ) ) .play ( ) ; }
This method :
Retrieves the second operator ( the operator at index 1 ) and casts it to a ColorEncoder Changes the source property for the color encoder to use the “ data.sex ” variable Sets a new color palette ( in this case , red for females , blue for males – the color order matches the alphabetical order of the labels )
Animates the change by calling update with a Transitioner set for a two second animation .
The vis.update method returns the Transitioner , so we can call play on the return value of the update .
( Note : you can also omit the Transitioner and just pass the number 2 as an argument to update .
A new Transitioner will be created automatically and returned . )
Now we need to wire up the application so we can interactively trigger the update .
To do so , add the following code to the constructor :
// add a clickable label var button : TextSprite = new TextSprite ( " Color by Gender " ) ; addChild ( button ) ; button .x = 710 ; button.y = 50 ; button.buttonMode = true ; button.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK , function ( evt: MouseEvent ) : void { colorByGender ( ) ; } ) ;
This code :
Creates a new text label ( TextSprite is a helper class from the flare .
display package )
Adds the label to the application and sets its position Sets buttonMode to true ( this makes a hand cursor appear when you mouse over the label )
Adds an event listener that is triggered when the label is clicked .
We add a callback function that calls the colorByGender method .
For the above code to work , we ’ll need to include these additional import statements at the top of the file :
import flash.events.MouseEvent ; import flare.animate .
Transitioner ; import flare.display .TextSprite ; import flare.util.palette.ColorPalette ;
Now you should be able to compile and run the application .
Clicking the “ Color by Gender ” label should animate the change in color encoding .
Next Steps
The above examples show the basics of Flash and the Flare library , but there are many more features that have yet to be covered .
Going forward , we recommend ( a ) inspecting both the Flash and Flare API documentation to get a sense of all the available classes , and ( b ) digging through the Flare demos to see how the same principles shown here can be used to construct a number of other visualizations .
Or , better yet , dig through the Flare source code to learn what ’s going on under the hood .
To aid in this process , here is a general overview of the sub - packages in flare.vis :
flare.vis.axis : provides axes , labels and gridlines
: provides axes , labels and gridlines flare.vis.controls : interaction handlers for selection , zooming , and more
: interaction handlers for selection , zooming , and more flare.vis.data : visual objects that represent data elements
: visual objects that represent data elements flare.vis.data.render : pluggable renderers that draw DataSprites
: pluggable renderers that draw flare.vis.events : event types used in the flare framework

: building blocks for defining visualizations flare.vis.
palette : palettes for color , shape , and size values
: palettes for color , shape , and size values flare.vis.util : general utility classes
You should now know enough to make sense of the demos in the flare .
demos package .
Feel free to play with , modify , copy , paste , and build upon the demos to gain a better understanding of how Flash and Flare work .

Thanks , Björn .
First , the good news .
Arab countries have the lowest levels of malnutrition and hunger in the developing world , have made " striking progress " in extending the lives of their citizens , abject poverty is comparatively low and , surprisingly ( for me at least ) , levels of income inequality are moderate across most of the region .
These are some of the few silver linings contained in the latest disillusioning and disturbing Arab Human Development Report ( AHDR ) .
Despite the bad international press the conflicts in the region draw , the Arab world is , based on its level of violent crime , just about the safest place in the world .
The real threat to people 's safety comes not from outlaws but from those above the law , an altogether different gang of criminals : Arab leaders and foreign occupiers .
The AHDR concludes that the Arab state is often " a threat to human security , instead of its chief support " .
This edition of the report has shifted its perspective from collective security and development to the emerging perspective of individual " human security " .
It describes human security as " the rearguard of human development " which " focuses on enabling peoples to contain or avert threats to their lives , livelihoods and human dignity " .
The report identifies seven categories of threats which can be divided into two broad groups : internal and external .
One of the greatest of these threats , as hinted above , is the state 's role as defender of a ruling elite rather than champion of all the people .
This is achieved through repressive security measures and a bloated security apparatus , built - in institutional weakness , and the co-opting of nationalism to serve the survival of the regime .
In the absence of impartial law and order and as a side effect of political and economic powerlessness , women are particularly vulnerable to abuse .
" Arab women , like many of their peers in other regions , sustain both direct and indirect violence , " the AHDR observes .
In this , as with so many other issues , taking a regional perspective masks the massive differences between individual countries .
In fact , there is a mind - boggling diversity of societies : from multi-ethnic Sudan to largely homogenous Egypt , from dirt - poor Yemen to the super - rich princedoms in the Gulf , from the largely secular Lebanon and Tunisia to the autocratic theocracy of Saudi Arabia .
For example , the proportion of women who get married before they are 18 ranges from a massive 45 % in Somalia to 2 % in Algeria .
In my view , the Arab state 's failure to serve its citizens is intimately connected – both as a cause and effect – with the region 's lacklustre economic performance , as is the region 's instability .
Shockingly , the AHDR quotes World Bank figures that show the region 's economies to have grown collectively by a mere 6.4 % in real terms in the quarter of a century between 1980 and 2004 .
This is partly due to the Arab world 's addiction – both direct and indirect – to oil - fuelled growth , and the dismantling of the industrial infrastructure in the more industrialised states that occurred as part of the so - called " reforms " pushed by the World Bank and IMF .
In fact , today , Arab countries are less industrialised than they were in 1970 .
Modest economic growth or even stagnation in itself is not a problem if the fruits are distributed equitably and the population is stable .
But Arab elites are increasingly hogging big slices of the economic pie , while the " youth bulge " has led to mass unemployment in most countries , especially among young people .
To add pain to indignity , the " structural reforms " many countries had to undergo mean that subsidies and other benefits are becoming almost non-existent .
And the region 's ecological carrying capacity is being strained by its continued population growth and global environmental pressures .
Ironically , although the Arab world is a minor contributor to greenhouse gas emission , it is set to become one of the main victims of climate change , as the region 's water sources dry up and desertification spreads on the back of rising temperatures .
Another more controversial external threat is foreign military occupation and intervention .
" Many of the threats to human security discussed in the report coalesce in situations of occupation , conflict and military intervention , " the authors note , drawing on the evidence of three case studies covering Iraq , the occupied Palestinian territories and Somalia .
" They spark both resistance and a cycle of violence and counter - violence that engulfs occupied and occupier alike [ and ] undercut human security in other Arab and neighbouring countries . "
In an apparent pre-emptive bid at damage control with the US and Israel , the UNDP , according to the report 's lead consultant , moved the chapter on foreign occupation to the end of what is billed as an " independent " report .
" [ This ] undermines the impact of Israeli occupation in Palestine and American occupation in Iraq to human security , " Mustapha Kamel al - Sayed , who disowned the report , told al - Masry al - Youm .
This has sparked some heated debate among Arab intellectuals , with some going so far as to suggest that the AHDR is little more than intellectual cover for western expansionism in the region .
Some have even linked the report 's absence for the last four years with ill intent .
" Suddenly , out of nowhere , it appears again this year to lecture us about security , while foreign military occupations and interferences , and their catastrophic consequences on the region are at the bottom of its concerns , " wrote one journalist .
But such an attitude risks throwing out the baby with the bathwater since , to my mind , it lets off Arab leaders too lightly .
Foreign occupation is definitely a major threat – and outright disaster for the societies directly affected – and deserves far more than footnote status .
But we most not overlook that , almost without exception , Arab regimes , whether they are western clients or not , are a major cause of insecurity for their peoples – in fact , the ruling elite often behaves as though they were a foreign occupier .
In addition , the AHDR has taken the consistent and anti-interventionist stance that : " sustainable change can only come from within " .
It even argues that the region 's increasingly dynamic and outspoken civil society offer the best hope for the future .
The UNDP may have toned things down somewhat to deflect some of the heat it might get from the United States , but this does not make it an instrument of " western imperialism " .
After all , it also seemed to be appeasing Arabs by dropping a chapter on the " ticking bomb " of identity conflicts .
" The casualties of the situation in South Sudan , civil war in Lebanon and other such conflicts are very high and yet this chapter was reduced to two pages integrated into another chapter , " al - Sayed pointed out .
Arabs and those interested in assisting the region to develop would do well to pay close attention to the seven " building blocks " of human security outlined in the AHDR , which range from empowering women and economic diversification to guaranteeing the rule of law and protecting the environment .
Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
Beware of leaders who come to power in troubled times , and then use foreign threats and economic crises to bolster their own power .
It was common on the left to intimate that George W. Bush was like Hitler , a remark that would drive the National Review crowd through the roof but which I did n't find entirely outrageous .
Bush 's main method of governance was to stir up fear of foreign enemies and instigate a kind of nationalist hysteria about the need for waging war and giving up liberty through security .
Hitler is the most famous parallel here , but he is hardly the only one .
Many statesmen in world history have used the same tactics , dating back to ancient times .
Machiavelli wrote in his Art of War advice to the ruler : " To know how to recognize an opportunity in war , and take it , benefits you more than anything else . "
But what 's the point of studying Hitler 's rise to power unless it is to learn from that history and apply the lessons ?
One lesson is to beware of leaders who come to power in troubled times , and then use foreign threats and economic crises to bolster their own power .
Unless we can draw out lessons for our own times , history becomes nothing but a series of dry data points with no broader relevance .
Certainly Bush used 9 - 11 to consolidate his power and the neoconservative intellectuals who surrounded him adopted a deep cynicism concerning the manipulation of public opinion .
Their governing style concerned the utility of public myth , which they found essential to wise rule .
The main myth they promoted was that Bush was the Christian philosopher - king heading a new crusade against Islamic extremism .
The very stupid among us believed it , and this served as a kind of ideological infrastructure of his tenure as president .
Then it collapsed when the economy went south and he was unable to sustain the absurd idea that he was protecting us from anyone .
The result was disgrace , and the empowering of the political left and its socialistic ethos .
The talk of Hitler in the White House ended forthwith , as if the analogy extended only when nationalist ideology is ruling the day .
What people do n't remember is that Hitlerism was about more than just militarism , nationalism , and consolidation of identity politics .
It also involved a substantial shift in German domestic politics away from free enterprise , or what remained of it under Weimar , toward collectivist economic planning .
Nazism was not only nationalism run amok .
It was also socialism of a particular variety .
Let 's turn to The Vampire Economy by Guenter Reimann ( 1939 ) .
He begins the story with the 1933 decree that all property must be subject to the collective will .
It began with random audits and massive new bookkeeping regulations :
Manufacturers in Germany were panic - stricken when they heard of the experiences of some industrialists who were more or less expropriated by the State .
These industrialists were visited by State auditors who had strict orders to " examine " the balance sheets and all bookkeeping entries of the company ( or individual businessman ) for the preceding two , three , or more years until some error or false entry was found .
The slightest formal mistake was punished with tremendous penalties .
A fine of millions of marks was imposed for a single bookkeeping error .
Obviously , the examination of the books was simply a pretext for partial expropriation of the private capitalist with a view to complete expropriation and seizure of the desired property later .
The owner of the property was helpless , since under fascism there is no longer an independent judiciary that protects the property rights of private citizens against the State .
The authoritarian State has made it a principle that private property is no longer sacred .
The rules begin to change slowly so that enterprise could no longer make decisions in the interest of profitability .
The banks were nationalized .
The heads of major companies were changed .
Hiring and firing became heavily politicized .
The courts ruled not on justice but on political priorities .
It was no longer enough merely to obey the laws .
The national will must trump economic concerns :
The capitalist under fascism has to be not merely a law - abiding citizen , he must be servile to the representatives of the State .
He must not insist on " rights " and must not behave as if his private property rights were still sacred .
He should be grateful to the Fuehrer that he still has private property .
This state of affairs must lead to the final collapse of business morale , and sound the death knell of the self - respect and self - reliance which marked the independent businessman under liberal capitalism .
Price controls were next , enforced intermittently and with them grew up a large gray economy , with businesspeople spending more time getting around the rules than producing wealth .
" To increase his prices a dealer must have a special permit from the Price Commissar .
A request for a price increase must first be certified to by the group leader ; it must be accompanied by a detailed statement of necessity and other pertinent data , such as production and distribution costs . "
State production mandates were next .
Goods were to be produced according to political goals .
" Backed by the General Staff of the army , Nazi bureaucrats have been able to embark upon schemes which compel the most powerful leaders of business and finance to undertake projects which they consider both risky and unprofitable . "
Bankers were required to act as state actors .
" Under fascism , big bankers , formerly independent – except , of course , ‘ non-Aryans ’ – have become State officials in everything but name .
They are often in high and influential positions , but they are all members of the compact , centralized State machine .
Their independence , their individual initiative , their free competitive position , all the principles for which they once fought fervently , are gone . "
If you think that the parallels stopped after Bush left power , consider this passage from Reimann :
" The totalitarian State reverses the former relationship between the State and the banks .
Previously , their political influence increased when the State needed financial help .
Now the opposite holds true .
The more urgent the financial demands of the State become , the stricter measures are taken by the State in order to compel these institutions to invest their funds as the State may wish . "
Once the banks were forced wholly under the control of the government , they became the means by which all property became subject to the state : " The totalitarian State will not have an empty treasury so long as private companies or individuals still have ample cash or liquid assets .
For the State has the power to solve its financial difficulties at their expense .
The private banks themselves , the financial institutions which previously dictated the terms on which they were willing to lend money , have built up the system of siphoning off liquid funds .
This financial system is now utilized by the totalitarian State for its own purposes . "
So it was for the stock market , which was regarded as a national asset .
Speculation was forbidden .
Public companies were entirely subject to bureaucratic rule .
Order replaced the old spontaneity , while speculation of the old sort became an entirely underground activity .
The largest companies did n't entirely mind the course of events .
" The disappearance of small corporations gives rise to a tendency among small investors not to risk their capital in new competitive enterprises .
The larger the big corporations grow and the closer they become connected with the State bureaucracy , the fewer chances there are for the rise of new competitors . "
So too for insurance companies , which were compelled to buy government paper .
The tendency toward ever more economic regulation resulted not in socialism as such but fascist planning .
" The fascist State does not merely grant the private entrepreneur the right to produce for the market , but insists on production as a duty which must be fulfilled even though there be no profit .
The businessman cannot close down his factory or shop because he finds it unprofitable .
To do this requires a special permit issued by the authorities . "
The national demand for " stimulus " replaced private decision making entirely , as businessmen were required to produce and avoid any economic downturns that might embarrass the state .
" The Nazi government has expressly threatened the private entrepreneur with increased State coercion and reduction of personal rights and liberties unless he fulfills adequately the ' duty to produce ' according to the State 's demands . "
But stimulus could not and would not work , no matter how hard the party officials tried , because the very institutions of private property and competition and all market forces had been overwritten .
" The totalitarian regime has annihilated the most important conservative force of capitalism , the belief that private property ought to be a sacred right of every citizen and that the private property of every citizen ought to be protected .
Respect for private property has penetrated the spirit of the people in all capitalist countries .
It is the strongest bulwark of capitalism .
Fascism has succeeded in destroying this conservative force ...
People still have to work for money and have to live on money incomes .
Possession of capital still provides income .
But this income is largely at the mercy of State bureaucrats and Party officials . "
Reimann sums up : " In Nazi Germany there is no field of business activity in which the State does not interfere .
In more or less detailed form it prescribes how the businessman may use capital which is still presumably his private property .
And because of this , the German businessman has become a fatalist ; he does not believe that the new rules will work out well , yet he knows that he cannot alter the course of events .
He has been made the tool of a gigantic machine which he cannot direct . "
The regime also dramatically increased social and medical legislation , providing lifetime pensions to friends and conscripting doctors in the service of its dietary and medical goals .
Now , if any of this sounds familiar , it is because the principles of intervention are universal .
The Nazi regime represented not a unique evil in history but rather a now - conventional combination of two dangerous ideological trends : nationalism and socialism .
We know both all too well .
Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr. [ lewrockwell@mac.com ] is founder and chairman of the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn , Alabama , editor of LewRockwell.com , and author , most recently , of The Left , The Right , and The State .
It is always wise to study the past .
The People 's Voice would however suggest that it be studied with a measure of caution .
- Mr. Rockwell referred to Reiman :
" The totalitarian State reverses the former relationship between the State and the banks .
Previously , their political influence increased when the State needed financial help .
Now the opposite holds true .
The more urgent the financial demands of the State become , the stricter measures are taken by the State in order to compel these institutions to invest their funds as the State may wish . "
We 've seen the Bush ( 2008 ) and Obama ( 2009 ) bailout scams , where the banks ( with the complicity of the Congress ) have looted the Treasury in an ongoing heist of gargantuan proportions .
It therefore seems to us that the opposite of what Reiman said does not hold true in the US , where the situation is rather more like this :
The more urgent the financial demands of the banks become , the more brazen & unrestrained measures are taken by them in order to compel the State to surrender its funds to the banks .
So what we 're left with is this : Wealth for the banks ; poverty for the State .
As regards ' socialism ' and ' nationalism ' , correspondingly : Socialism for the banks ; nationalism for the State .
As our readers will have noted , ordinary people do n't even enter into this equation - they always come last .

There 's been some chatter in the market this week about whether a bank may be in trouble .
The source of the concern is an anomaly in the federal - funds rate , that 's the rate banks charge each other to borrow money overnight .
Banks , however , have some discretion based on the borrowing bank 's collateral and the supply and demand in the marketplace .
So , it 's not unusual to see the actual rate on overnight loans vary slightly .
For instance , on June 23 , the rate was between 0.1 % and 0.375 % .
On June 24 it was between 0.1 % and 0.5 % .
...
Today , TLC filed our public comment opposing the Trump administration ’s attempt to eliminate trans protections in federally funded homeless shelters .
This latest attack on our communities is nothing more than a transparent attempt to cause harm by assuring more and more trans people are sleeping on the streets , and cruelly denied access to the safety and shelter that all people deserve .
This is not a signature characteristic of supersymmetry or any of the other known heavily - studied classes of models .
If real , as far as I 'm aware it 's something genuinely unexpected .
Perhaps phenomenology experts can point to some less well - known models with this kind of signature .
The only such thing I 'm aware of is a very recent paper from three weeks ago by Arkani - Hamed and Weiner , entitled LHC Signals for a SuperUnified Theory of Dark Matter .
They discuss a theory of dark matter involving a new hidden gauge symmetry , broken near the GeV scale , saying that this is " motivated directly by striking Data from the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations " .
In these models there can be Gev-scale Higgs and gauge particles decaying to an anomalously large number of leptons .
They discuss the question of whether the parameters of such models can be adjusted to give large decay lengths , and predict the observation of events that " contain at least two lepton jets " : collections of n > 2 leptons , with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses , pretty much just what CDF sees .
Since the CDF paper undoubtedly has been the topic of intense discussion among the 450 or so physicists in the collaboration for many months now , the most likely explanation for the appearance of a new theory paper a few weeks ago discussing exactly the signatures in question is that news of what 's in the paper got out to some theorists early .
I can tell you officially we had no word on this .
This blog is , in fact , the first I 'd heard of it .
( But have now looked at the paper . )
What we predicted was just what was needed to explain PAMELA we thought .
That is pretty hard to digest .
Lepton jets with lifetimes .
Come on .
I think you owe it to the physics community to let us know where the leak came from .
Your statements about me and my collaborators in connection with the recent CDF anomaly quite clearly crossed a line , and I feel compelled to respond .
In doing so I am adopting an attitude Howard Georgi once described when dealing with non-perturbative QCD effects in heavy quark effective theory : once I am finished dealing with the brown muck , I will wash my hands .
If I insulted you or your colleagues with my remark , then please accept my apology , and forward these to them .
I am a sceptic not only with respect to SUSY ( which may be excused , since I am in good company ) , but also with respect of the CDF result itself .
And I found it really a remarkable coincidence , to avoid putting new words out which may be found aggressive , that no more than three weeks before the CDF result is aired , you come up with lepton jets , with long lifetime , and with small invariant mass .
Of course , that is not a copyrighted signature , so I am the one at fault - I am speculating .
But indeed , I was not the only one who found this coincidence fishy .
Many of my colleagues in CDF did , and so did others outside .
Hi Tommaso ,
Given that everyone has no hard feelings , there 's not a great reason to dwell on the past , except to convey the humorous events of the day when the CDF result appeared .
Indeed , I would think that anyone who had seen us that day would never have thought we knew about the result in advance .
I received an email forward from Nima ( who had been forwarded the link from a postdoc ) pointing me to the blog post noting the multi-muon result .
I immediately wrote back " wow ! they discovered lepton jets ? " and responded to the blog comment that we must have known something in advance with my brief remark that we had known nothing , thinking that this would help settle
speculation .
Not a good move , perhaps , but I was very , very tired when I read the post .
The next morning , a number of us gathered in an experimental colleague 's office , hiding from anyone who might distract us .
I was about to leave for China for a month ( to attend a workshop at the KITPC ) , and so it was necessary to avoid anyone who might want to talk about anything other than the new result .
We spent the whole morning going over the details of the paper , and calling our experimental friends asking for their opinion and insight .
( We were occasionally distracted by an ongoing discussion in the blogosphere . )
I was so excited about the CDF result that I asked our fantastic admin at the CCPP to look into changing my flight plans to China ( ! ) , as if this was real and consistent with our predictions , it was certainly the most important thing around , and I was ready to change all of my plans to focus on it !
It was only when the large cross section was pointed out that we realized that this was certainly _not_ the signal we had
predicted , and , although we continued to speculate on how it might be related , a great deal of wind was taken from our sails .
I told our admin that I was still going to China .
So , truly , we were caught as off guard as anyone , and if only you could have seen us that Friday , I think it would have been comically obvious to anyone how ignorant we were !
But , still , a fun morning .
You do n't get a lot of days that are that exciting , even if fleetingly so .
As for the whole discussion , I happily accept your retractatio !
These things should never be taken too seriously .
Neal Weiner
If you have followed this blog for long enough , dear readers , the words " multi-muons " , " anomalous muons " , or even " lepton jets " are not foreign to you .
They all refer to a paper appeared on the ArXiv on the evening of Halloween last year .
In the paper the CDF collaboration published the results of a detailed analysis which described how a component of collider data containing two or more muons could not be explained by known Standard Model processes .
Described as above , " a component not explained " is less than exciting ; however , the peculiarities of the sample of events unearthed by CDF did lend itself to speculate that the Standard Model would soon crumble under its own weight , yielding in a way that was unexpected - that is , in the modeling of the lifetime of observed muons in hadron collisions .
A detailed explanation in four parts of the results of the CDF study is available at the following links : part I Having followed closely the internal review process of the surprising new CDF analysis , and having observed with some amusement the brutally failed attempts of the experiment at keeping the highest level of secrecy on an analysis it had ever attempted to install since the years of the first top quark evidence ( 1993 - 94 ) , I knew that the whole story had leaked outside the collaboration .
I had even been shown by a friend how some of my collaborators had placed copies of the draft , and even slides of internal meetings where the analysis was being reviewed , in their own public web areas , maybe to make space in other disks , or maybe - just maybe- to distribute the reserved information to outside observers .
Friends , fellow theorists , or - God forbid- competitors .
Two weeks before the publication , I had thus not been too surprised to see a paper discussing signatures of dark matter appearing in the Arxiv , where some discussion was made of " lepton jets " , with leptons coming from long - lifetime particle decays , and having a small combined invariant mass .
The authors foresaw the occurrence of that phenomenon at hadron colliders as a possible signal of new physics , a signal of a hidden sector of particles extraneous to the Standard Model ones .
To me , the matter was clear : the authors had heard news of the forthcoming CDF analysis , and they had worked hard to put together in a timely fashion a model that could predict exactly the signature seen by CDF .
In my mind , they had certainly played a tricky hand , but in earnest I could not blame them for their attempt at a quick Nobel Prize , which would have then been easy to claim , had the CDF signal been proven a true emergence of physics beyond the Standard Model .
However , I could not really understand how they would be going to handle the obvious objection : the burden of proving that they had had no news of the CDF results ) was , in my mind , entirely theirs .
When the news of the surprising CDF preprint finally hit the blogosphere , the matter indeed caused some ripples .
The high - traffic site of Peter Woit was the first to report on the matter , and here is what Peter wrote on that occasion :
Peter 's post received immediate attention in the blogosphere .
The fourth note in the comments thread of Peter 's post was by Prof.
Neal Weiner ( right ) , one of the authors of the paper mentioned in the blog post .
Just a few hours after the posting , here is what Neal wrote : I read Neal 's comment shortly after he issued it .
I honestly did not believe it , and replied rather rudely in the thread :
The matter , of course , was not settled by a firearms duel , but neither it died out too quickly .
Indeed , I had probably gone a bit too far , accusing openly the authors of the phenomenological paper - all distinguished theorists - of little short of scientific plagiarism .
I must acknowledge Neal Weiner 's good dose of fair play , since he reacted politely to my accusation , and after an e-mail exchange we settled the matter at the " agree to disagree " level .
Meanwhile , another author of the paper in question , Professor Nima Arkani - Hamed ( left ) , also commented on my own blog on the matter .
Here is his incipit : Nima 's comment is very long and if you want more details you should read it directly at the source , or in another post where it is further discussed .
In the thread , I just answered like this :
The bubble inflated further - it even popped up on the Russian edition of Newsweek , which rather than on the surprising new CDF result , decided to write two full pages on the controversy between Nima , Neal , and I - and then , as happens with bubbles , blew up .
I could meet Nima at the CERN cafeteria a couple of months later , and I found him totally at ease and not bearing a grudge .
We chatted amiably about the matter , and I mentioned to him that I was still unsure of what to think , but I admitted I should not have reacted so openly in my blog and in Peter Woit's .
Time passed , and I got to meet other people who had an informed view of the issue - the main author of the CDF analysis , other theorists , other experimentalists .
I also took the time to study in some more detail than I had so far the theory of a " Hidden Valley " , of which the CDF signal might appear to be a signature .
And my opinion slowly changed .
However , I felt I had not really insulted anybody with my outing on October 31st , 2008 , so I let the story die out .
One month ago , however , I had the pleasure of meeting in person , and then having dinner with - at a table in the wonderful setting of the Palazzo della Ragione - none other than Neal Weiner .
Neal had come to Padova to give a talk at the Planck 2009 conference : a quite interesting talk , by the way .
Of course , Neal and I discussed face to face the incident of last October , and I came clean with him , apologizing and explaining that I had , in fact , changed my mind on the issue .
It was an amusing conversation , which confirmed my view that intelligent people are hard to offend : Neal had not felt offended by my open disbelief of their " no prior knowledge " .
He also explained to me his side of the story : he was caught by surprise by the CDF paper just before leaving on a trip to China .
I asked Neal to tell that story for you , dear readers , and for the record .
Here it is , in his own words :
So this settles the matter : the present posting represents a formal Retractatio of my previous accusation .
I now believe that Neal Weiner , Nima Arkani-Hamed , and their collaborators had indeed no prior knowledge of the CDF result when they published their preprint .
I am also happy to take this occasion to say that I sometimes do change my mind : it is a very healthy habit , which aging minds should exercise at least once a week .
As some wise man once said , only the fool never changes his mind .
As for the CDF anomaly , the issue is still open .
True , DZERO did publish a conference proceedings where they claim to not see any excess of muons with large impact parameter in a dataset similar to the one where CDF sees a large one .
However , there are a few things that make me doubt that the DZERO analysis is a conclusive rebuttal of the CDF signal , primum inter pares the fact that DZERO has a tracking efficiency that dies out quickly for tracks not pointing toward the primary vertex .
But that is another story , which I am sure you will only like to hear on another day .
Politico :
“ If the Republicans ca n’t break out of being the right wing party of big government , then I think you would see a third party movement in 2012 , ” Gingrich said Wednesday during a speech at the College of the Ozarks in Missouri , the local television station KY3 reported ….
“ Remember , everything Obama ’s doing , Bush started last year , ” Gingrich said .
“ If you ’re going to talk about big spending , the mistakes of the Bush administration last year are fully as bad as the mistakes of Obama ’s first two , three months . ”
Mind you , Obama ’s “ mistake ” was passing a stimulus package intended to save the country from an impending depression .
Gingrich is as bad , if not worse , than the rest of the Republicans .
He is so mired in his own ideological view of the world that facts do n’t phase him .
He probably agrees with the rest of his party , with his ideological leader Rush Limbaugh , with Limbaugh ’s acolyte Eric Cantor , with John McCain ’s economic adviser Phil Gramm , that anyone concerned about the economy is just overreacting .
They simply have no new ideas .
The reason they talk about Ronald Reagan so much is that the Republican party never moved beyond the 1980s .
They have no notion of what it is to be an American in 2009 .
Nor , seemingly , do they care .

I ’d be pissed if I got herpes from sucking some slut - baby :
City health officials are investigating the death of a baby boy who was one of three infants to contract herpes after a rabbi circumcised them .
Ten days after Rabbi Yitzhok Fischer performed religious circumcisions on twins last October , one died of herpes and the other tested positive for the virus , according to a complaint filed by the health department in Manhattan Supreme Court .
Under Jewish law , a mohel — someone who performs circumcisions — draws blood from the circumcision wound .
Most mohels do it by hand with a suction device , but Fischer uses a practice rare outside strict Orthodox groups where he uses his mouth to draw blood after cutting the foreskin .
Israeli Army Radio reported Thursday that the Israeli Housing Ministry started new plans to build more settler homes in Givat Zeev , north west of occupied Jerusalem .
The plans calls for constructing 800 new units for Jewish settlers ; its main aim is creating a geographic link between the new settlement and Jerusalem so that the government can claim it as part of Jerusalem , and not as a settlement .
The Housing Ministry said that the budget was prepared for the new constructions , and that all plans are ready to go .
The plan is connected to Israeli Defense Minister , Ehud Barak , and his office , while Israeli Housing Minister , Ariel Atias , promised to grant the green light for the project .
Israeli sources reported that the government of Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , is avoiding any official declaration of new settlement projects in order to avoid international pressure .
Although the government is not announcing new plans , planning and financing of potential construction projects are ongoing in order to ensure fast implementation once the green light is granted .
Atias in one of many Israeli ministers and legislators who carry fundamentalist views that call for removing the Palestinians from the country in order to ensure a Jewish majority .
In Mid-2009 , Atias of the Shas movement made an official speech calling for stopping “ the spread of Arab population in different parts of Israel ” .
He said that this issue is a national responsibility , and that Israel must act fast to ensure a constant Jewish majority .
His statements came as he addressed attendees of a 2009 conference held by the Israeli Bar Association , focusing on reforming the so - called “ Israel ’s Land Administration ” .
Officials like Atias and Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman of the fundamentalist Israel Our Home party , consider the Arabs and Palestinians in the country as a strategic threat .
Lieberman repeatedly called for expelling the Arabs and Palestinians to nearby Arab countries in order to ensure that “ Israel remains a Jewish State ” .
The sweeping new bill which just passed the House last Friday , the Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 , is ostensibly about climate change , but it is in fact a bill of staggering economic ramifications that is going to accelerate the takeover of the economy by the well - placed financiers who have already plundered the Treasury and the Fed of $ 12 + trillion and counting .
It was rushed through the House in the tradition of such nightmarish legislation as the Patriot Act and the banker bailout of last October : hundreds of pages were added to it at the last minute and it was humanly impossible for anyone to have read it before they voted on it .
This , of course , is exactly what Obama promised his administration would never allow to happen , and for good reason ; bills passed in this manner are always the result of fear and panic and inevitably results in legislation that would never be passed upon sober second thought .
In this case , the rush to pass this new bill was an attempt to stop any scrutiny of a plan that is going to utterly transform the American economy , further centralize control of citizens ' lives in the hands of unaccountable federal bureaucrats and complete the transfer of the American economy from Main Street to Wall Street .
And all of this in the name of fighting a threat which itself is a demonstrable fraud .
In short , the banksters and bureaucrats are sharpening their knives , preparing to butcher what 's left of the carcass of the United States , and a good portion of the public are not only willing to allow it but are actually clamoring for it .
The first thing that needs to be understood about the brand new trillion dollar carbon - trading commodities market that will be brought into existence if this bill passes the Senate is that it is a ripoff designed by and for the very corporate interests the environmentalists claim to be fighting .
For an historical precedent of what is being proposed under this cap - and - trade scam one can look to Enron , which immediately found ways to plunder billions of dollars from new energy market legislation passed by the Clinton Administration in 2000 .
They gave schemes for manipulating billions of dollars out of Californians funny little names like Death Star and even went so far as to rig up a completely fake trading floor in their offices in order to bamboozle investors who were interested in the company 's remarkable success .
They got away with it because they were The Smartest Guys in the Room , much brighter than the government bureaucrats who were supposed to stop them from committing such blatant fraud ( assuming the regulators were n't simply paid to look the other way ) .
And now supporters of this new bill are putting their blind faith in these same bureaucrats to regulate a scheme to create a vastly more complex market with hundreds of times as much money at stake .
Is it any wonder Enron was a booster for cap - and - trade ?
That the new carbon trading market can and will be manipulated by the very same financial oligarchs and government bureaucrats who have brought the world to the brink of economic Armageddon is laid bare in a must - read article by Matt Taibi in the latest issue of Rolling Stone .
In " The Great Bubble Machine " Taibi meticulously documents how the amazingly well - connected Goldman Sachs has managed to manipulate and profit from every financial bubble since the Roaring Twenties and how they 're getting set to do it all over again with the creation of a carbon trading bubble :
" The bank owns a 10 percent stake in the Chicago Climate Exchange , where the carbon credits will be traded .
Moreover , Goldman owns a minority stake in Blue Source LLC , a Utah - based firm that sells carbon credits of the type that will be in great demand if the bill passes .
Nobel Prize winner Al Gore , who is intimately involved with the planning of cap - and - trade , started up a company called Generation Investment Management with three former bigwigs from Goldman Sachs Asset Management , David Blood , Mark Ferguson and Peter Harris .
Their business ?
Investing in carbon offsets .
There 's also a $ 500 million Green Growth Fund set up by a Goldmanite to invest in green - tech ... the list goes on and on .
Goldman is ahead of the headlines again , just waiting for someone to make it rain in the right spot . "
In effect , this bill creates an entirely new commodity that is guaranteed to generate ever - increasing profit for those who have already spent millions preparing to get in on the ground floor .
Here 's a hint : that does not include your average mom and pop investor or your dual - income family struggling to make ends meet in a crashing economy .
Here 's another hint : it does include financial juggernauts like Goldman Sachs who have been investing in solar , wind , and biofuels for years and now just happen to find themselves in the perfect position to start reaping vast profits from their headstart in the new carbon credit economy ( and you thought Paulson was into going green for any other reason than making green ? ) .
It also includes Obama , who was instrumental in helping set up the Chicago Climate Exchange for his political cronies like Al Gore , who already has a company which he uses to buy carbon credits from himself and who had made multi-million dollar investments in companies developing carbon tracking software that will be essential to the new carbon - swindle economy .
There are still those out there , however , who believe that this time it 's going to be different .
This time the government is going to set up a new trillion dollar industry overnight , make sure it is regulated by angels of unquestionable integrity and goodwill , prevent it from being manipulated by big business , and create scores of new " green " jobs in the renewable energy industry ( presumably to replace the hundreds of thousands of jobs that the economy is already hemorrhaging or the hundreds of thousands more that will be shed when these carbon taxes and penalties really ratchet up in the next decade ) .
Well , let 's assume for a moment that we have crossed into just such a fantasy world .
It still does not change the fact that the bill itself only offers phony solutions to a problem that does n't exist .
The phony solution is the " Clean Energy " part of the Clean Energy and Security Act .
What feelgood platitudes about pumping billions of dollars into solar , wind and alternative energy projects obscure is that throwing money hand over fist at inherently flawed technologies will not actually make them work , nor will it make the money - hungry charlatans who promote them any more honest .
Just ask Albert Lanier .
He 's a freelance journalist who has been writing a series of articles about First Wind , a Massachusetts - based wind developer that is currently being investigated by the New York Attorney General 's office .
In a recent interview with The Corbett Report he revealed how the Mafia has been linked to the Italian wind farm industry , which might say more about the industry than it does about the mob .
Of course , the entire idea of " cleaning " the atmosphere of carbon dioxide seems a bit ridiculous when you realize that by historical levels we are living in a CO2 - starved environment , that global surface temperatures are dropping , that global ocean temperatures are dropping , that key proponents of the manmade global warming theory have been caught faking data to support their arguments , that Arctic sea ice is expanding , and that sea levels are not rising .
But why let actual science get in the way of a good scare story , especially when that scare story can be used to create a new trillion dollar industry for the banksters ?
For those who cannot be convinced to consider an issue until it affects them personally , rest assured this draconian new legislation will reach into every American citizen 's living room ... literally .
As Congressman Steve Scalise has already pointed out , this " climate bill " contains within it a new national building code that supersedes all existing state codes .
If enacted , this legislation will create an entirely new class of federally - funded green brigades with the mandate to perform house - to - house inspections to look for violations of this new " green " building code .
They would even be able to impose civil penalties for code violations ( like having the wrong windows or lightbulbs ) .
Watch Congressman Scalise 's comments in the player below :
This bill is not only unnecessary , it is dangerous .
It is not only economically reckless , it is economically suicidal .
It 's passage will be a particularly dark day in American legislative history , something almost unthinkable given the constitution - destroying atrocities passed during the Bush years .
There is only one thing left for Americans to do : call their senators and let them know that it 's time to make a decision : vote against the Clean Energy & Security Act of 2009 or join the unemployment line come next election .

Muslim woman to be flogged for drinking beer in nightclub
Consuming alcohol is a religious offence for Muslims in Malaysia , who make up nearly two - thirds of the population ( file pic )
An Islamic court in Malaysia has sentenced a Muslim woman to be flogged for having a beer in a nightclub , a court official said today .
It is rare for a woman in Malaysia to be sentenced to caning - a punishment usually reserved for men .
Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno was sentenced yesterday to six lashes and a fine of 5,000 ringgit ( $ 1,400 ) for consuming alcohol , said a Shariah High Court official who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to make public statements .
Shukarno , a 32 - year - old model , pleaded guilty in the court in eastern Pahang state to a charge of drinking beer when Islamic authorities raided a hotel nightclub in August 2008 .
Consuming alcohol is a religious offence in Malaysia but only for Muslims , who make up nearly two - thirds of the population .
Offenders are prosecuted in Shariah courts , which handle cases mainly related to family and moral issues .
Most offenders are fined , but the law also provides for a three - year prison term and caning .
Shukarno was the only Muslim caught in the raid at the Pahang nightclub .
Malaysian clubs and lounges typically serve alcohol but are not legally required to check if customers are Muslim before serving them .
The hotel nightclub operators were not charged with any offence .
Shukarno plans to appeal the sentence , the New Straits Times daily reported .
The punishment 'is aimed at making the accused repent and serves as a lesson to Muslims ' , the newspaper quoted Judge Abdul Rahman Yunus as saying .
The judge did not elaborate on why he imposed a relatively severe sentence , but local media noted that he had a history of being tough on alcohol offenders .
Rattan canes used in the punishment are made from palm plants common in tropical parts of Asia .
They have been used for decades for corporal punishments in countries such as Malaysia , Singapore and Brunei .
The caning sentence is generally carried out by specially trained officials at prisons .

Take my love , take my land
Take me where I cannot stand
I do n't care , I 'm still free
You can't take the sky from me
Take me out to the black
Tell them I ain't comin ' back
Burn the land and boil the sea
You can't take the sky from me
There 's no place I can be
Since I found Serenity
But you can't take the sky from me ...
Or , you can listen to the themesong here .
I love my Toyota Tacoma pickup truck .
It is the perfect vehicle for me .
I do a lot of traveling in it .
I also go to a lot of estate sales and auctions in it .
There 's lots of cargo room in the back for the stuff I buy , and with the topper in the bed , I can even camp in the truck .
I usually carry a laptop computer with me when I travel to keep in touch , and to check what things are worth before buying them at estate sales , yard sales or bidding in auctions .
I have a broadband access card for the laptop , so I can get online from anywhere .
I 've always wanted a built - in laptop / notebook computer tray for my truck .
The addition of one of these trays is a great way to bring even old cars into a new era .
The commercially made units are pricey though .
Several models I have looked at cost close to $ 300 .
Ouch !
I suppose I could make one like the commercially made units , but they are made of metal , and I 'm not much of a metal - worker .
The commercially made units also bolt to the floor and take time and tools to install and remove .
I always thought there had to be a better way .
One day I had a brainstorm .
I figured out a quick and easy way to build a laptop tray for my Tacoma that cost a little over $ 30 !
That 's 1/10 of what the commercially made units cost !
And it only took me an afternoon to build it .
And before you all start writing me and saying how unsafe it is to use the computer while driving , do n't panic .
I do n't use it while driving .
I use it while stopped , usually at sales .
It 's a lot more convenient than trying to balance it on my lap or the armrest .
I drew up my idea .
It looked good , but I needed to know what size PVC pipe to use .
I measured the inside diameter of the cup - holder and found that it is almost exactly the same size as the outside diameter of a 2 inch PVC pipe coupler .
So the tray would be made of 2 inch PVC pipe and fittings .
A trip to the local mega homecenter store was necessary to pick up the parts I 'd need to build the tray .
I needed two 90 degree elbows , a coupler , some sort of flange , a short length of 2 inch pipe to cut up to make connecting pieces , nuts and bolts .
I also bought some fresh PVC pipe glue .
I already had some scrap plywood on hand to build the tray .
I could n't find a flange .
All the flanges were for 3 inch and larger pipe .
But I did find a drain fitting that would work just as well .
I just had to remove the metal grate on top of it and drill some holes around the edge of it for the bolts that would hold the tray top on .
Total cost for all these parts was less than $ 15 so far .
Not bad .
The 2 inch PVC coupler is an almost exact fit into the top of the cup - holder .
However , the cup - holder must have a slight taper to it , because the coupler would jam part - way down .
So I got out my sander and sanded down the outside of the coupler until it would slip all the way down to the bottom of the cup - holder .
I left it a snug fit though .
I did n't want it too loose .
Next I cut up the length of PVC pipe to make the short pieces I 'd need to connect the parts together .
I cut 2 pieces at 2 inches long , and one piece at 3 inches long to go in the middle of the arm ( see drawing above ) .
These measurements are pretty arbitrary , but I did n't want to cantilever the laptop out any further than I had to .
I just wanted it to clear the shift lever and armrest .
Once I had all the pieces of the arm cut , I dry - fitted the parts together to see how it looked .
I also removed the metal grate from the top of the drain fitting .
Next I test - fitted the arm in the cup - holder .
It fit great , and it looked like I had just the right clearance .
I needed to measure up the dimensions of my laptop to know how large to make the plywood tray .
My laptop is 11 inches deep by 13 inches wide .
I also wanted to measure the position of the cooling fan , so I could cut a hole in the tray for air flow .
I cut a piece of 1/4 inch thick plywood to 11 by 13 .
I rounded off all the corners .
I also drilled and countersunk mounting holes , and drilled out a hole where the laptop cooling fan will be for improved air - flow .
I forgot that I had the laptop upside - down when I measured the position of the cooling fan intake .
I almost drilled the air hole on the wrong side of the board ( as can be seen by the circle drawn on the upper left ) .
It would n't have mattered much , since I could have always flipped the board over , but I wanted the best looking side up .
I drilled holes in the PVC drain fitting to match the the holes in the plywood .
Once the plywood tray top was bolted onto the PVC drain fitting , I could test assemble the whole unit and try it out in the truck .
This photo ( click for a bigger version ) shows the tray being tested in the truck .
It works well and looks great .
The PVC pieces are n't glued together yet at this point .
I wanted to make sure the arm was just right with a full scale test first .
Even just fit together dry , the friction of the PVC pieces held the weight of the laptop just fine .
I was very happy with the position of the laptop .
So I glued the PVC pieces together .
I like the way the tray will just pull right out when not needed or if I have a passenger .
No tools needed .
Due to the snug fit of the coupler in the cup - holder , the weight of the laptop locks the tray in place .
But if I lift up on the tray a little , I can swivel it around to different positions .
It locks again when I let go of it .
An unexpected bonus .
This photo ( click for a bigger version ) shows the painted laptop tray installed in the truck .
It 's hard to tell from the photos , but the paint job is a good match for the interior color .
The pipe still looks white in the photos .
Probably over - exposed by the camera flash .
You can also see in this photo the two strips of adhesive - backed Velcro I put down on the top of the tray .
A couple of matching strips were stuck to the bottom of my laptop .
The Velcro holds the laptop in place with an iron grip .
However , I can remove the laptop fairly easily by prying up on one corner of it .

It is a real thing of beauty , if I do say so myself .

So how much did it cost to build ( including tax ) ?
PVC Pipe & Fittings - $ 14.89
Nuts , Bolts & Washers - $ 0.90
Spray Paint - $ 4.80
Velcro - $ 10.69
Scrap Plywood - Free
Total - $ 31.28
Not bad !
Pros &
Cons of the laptop tray :
Pros :
It works great , it looks good , and it was cheap to build .
Cons : I 'm not sure it is legal to use a laptop computer while driving , so be careful if you build one of these .
I do n't use it while driving , only while stopped , and I close the screen while moving , both to prevent attracting attention to the computer from other drivers , and to reduce my own temptation to diddle with it while driving .
Also , I am a little worried about the stress I am putting on the plastic center console .
On bumpy roads the laptop can really bounce around .
I can see a scenario where repeated stress , or one big pothole could cause the plastic to crack .
Since the tray is so easy to remove by just pulling it out of the cup - holder , I generally leave it on the passenger side floor when I am moving , and only pop it in place when I am parked and need to use it to research an item .
I was going to need an inverter to run the laptop for any extended period of time in the truck .
I only get about 2 hrs of battery life , under ideal conditions .
I picked up this 300 Watt inverter at a yard sale for only $ 3 .
Its a little beat up , but it works great .
My Tacoma actually has a built - in power inverter .
However the outlet is in the bed of the truck .
I did n't want to run an extension cord all the way from the back and in through the rear window .
So I bought this bargain inverter .
Here I have mounted adhesive - backed Velcro on the bottom of the inverter .
I used only the hook side of the Velcro .
I discovered that the hook Velcro stuck quite tightly to the carpet in my truck .
Here I have mounted the inverter by sticking it to the carpeted side of the center console .
The Velcro sticks to the carpet as strongly , or maybe even more strongly than to the loop Velcro .
It pulls right off if I do n't need it , or if I have a passenger .
After using this setup for a few weeks now , I have to say I am very happy with it .
The tray ( even with the mass of the laptop on it ) does n't move at all when I brake or corner .
I made it a really snug fit in the cup - holder just for that reason .
Also , the off - center weight of the laptop locks the pipe in the cup - holder even more tightly .
I am less concerned about breaking the plastic center console than I was .
I tend to leave the laptop in place more as I have grown more confident in the design .
I am only ever concerned about it now on excessively rough roads and when going over speed - bumps .
In those circumstances I drive more slowly than I would without the laptop , and I 'll grab the laptop and steady it during the worst of the bumps .
The tray has already paid for itself several times over by allowing me to more easily research items at sales .
UPDATE 10/04/19
Since I now own an F - 150 pickup truck , as well as the Toyota Tacoma , I decided to see if the laptop tray fits in it too .
It does !
It 's been a few years since I built this tray .
I have to admit that I do n't use it as much as I used to .
Technology has improved a lot .
Smart phones and tablets can now do a lot that only a laptop could do back when I first built this tray .
Still , it is occasionally nice to have a full - size laptop for some jobs .
It 's nice to know it is going to fit in the F - 150 too .
I may need to put a little tape around the base to make it a tighter fit in the cup holder , otherwise it works well .
The color even matches my F - 150 interior .
Nice .
One of the things we 've been waiting all day to see in the aftermath of the shooting today at the Holocaust Museum was how the conservatives would spin the incident .
Now , thanks to Glenn Beck and Debbie Schlussel , we know .
First off ,
Beck went on his show tonight and performed perhaps the most stunning feat of pulling one out of the old anus in the history of stunning pulling one out of the ole anus feats .
Beck , with a straight face mind you , looked into the camera and said that America as it stands today is a " boiling pot " fueled by extremists groups like Al Qaeda and 9/11 truthers who are sowing the seeds of extremism and hatred in this country .
Then , still with a straight face , Beck also warned his viewers that more violence is likely to come in the future , that " more nutjobs are going to coming out of the woodwork now , " that all of this is part of the " perfect storm " he 's been trying to warn everyone about , a " perfect storm " which will result in a " witchhunt " that will focus on two groups of people .
Can you guess who they might be ?
Jews and —Conservatives !
Beck , like the true reptilian coward he is , does n't make mention , much less offer an apology for , the lunacy he 's been promoting over the radio and television airwaves over the years , lunacy that directly feeds the derangement of people like James von Brunn , inflammatory rhetoric he 's been spewing about America turning into a totalitarian communist regime under Obama , the New World Order , Mexicans pouring over our borders to take our jobs and rape our children , FEMA concentration camps , ACORN rigging an American Presidential election for Obama , that dark , powerful , unseen forces are controlling the American economy , how liberals might to assassinate him —
We could go on and on and on .
There 's truly no end with this clown .
We wonder how the executives at Fox are sleeping tonight in the aftermath of the Holocaust Museum shooting .
Certainly there 's got to be at least one person in power working there in possession of a active conscience and a brain with enough of a capacity for abstract thought as to be able to connect the dots between the types of things Glenn Beck says on the air and the violent domestic extremism we 've seen on the rise lately .
There just has to be .
And we would hope that such a person would have the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say that this sort of madness needs to stop , that it destroys what little credibility the Fox News brand holds as a news organization to have this sort of maniacal charlatan identified as one of the network 's stars .
Then again , maybe we 're a bit too hopelessly idealistic to believe such a person exists over there .
Anyway , here 's Beck 's utterly nauseating act from today .
It opens with part of his " The One Thing " address about the Holocaust Museum shooting and ends with his asking a former CIA agent to confirm that the 9/11 truthers are the ones who inspired James von Brunn .
Finally , there 's Ann Coulter wannabe Debbie Schlussel , last heard from making Sonia Sotomayor / JLo jokes .
Here 's what she said about what happened at the Holocaust Museum :
It is because of Muslims — who are the biggest contributor to the worldwide rise in anti-Semitism to Holocaust - eve levels — that neo -Nazis feel comfortable — far more comfortable !— manifesting their views about Jews .
Until 9/11 and our resulting new tolerance for Islam , the neo - Nazi types were marginalized and howling at the wind .
We know who has been targeting Jewish museums and centers affiliated with Jews in recent years .
And it has n't been , in general , 89 - year - old White guys .
Mr. Von Brunn has been on this planet for 89 years , and he did n't feel comfortable shooting up a Holocaust museum until now — this new era of " tolerance , " in which we must tolerate the most extremist Muslim behaviors and sentiments .
It 's , in general , not 89 - year - old White guys telling people at churches worldwide and in religious schools that the Jews are the devil incarnate , a filthy tribe , the sons of pigs and monkeys , subhuman , etc .
No , it 's guys with names like Mohammed and Ahmed on our own American streets who make Mr. Von Brunn far more at ease in 2009 than he was even in 1999 to attack places associated with the Jews .
They created the comfort zone for James W. Brunn to engage in today 's shooting .
Moreover , not only do White supremacists and neo -Nazis work with Muslims in many , many documented cases and investigations .
But they are basically one and the same .
The only difference is that one guy is named James and the other guy is named Ahmed .
And the former only has a few thousand discredited , marginalized compatriots .
Whereas the latter has over a billion followers and a U.S. President kissing their collective ass .
So there you go .
It 's the new era of tolerance that inspired a neo - nazi to murder a black guy in the course of trying to shoot up a Jewish museum .
You try to figure this one out , because we sure as hell can't .
How does this happen ?
A paper in the June , 2009 issue of Psychological Science by Michael Sayette , Erik Reichle , and Jonathan Schooler suggests one contributing factor .
They looked at how alcohol affects and also people 's ability to detect that their mind is wandering .
Mind wandering happens when you are engaged in some task , and suddenly you find yourself thinking about something unrelated to the task .
For example , you might be reading a riveting blog about drunk driving and then you may start thinking about romaine lettuce or an errand you have to run later in the day .
Sometimes , when your mind is wandering , you realize that it is wandering .
That is , you catch yourself drifting .
In those cases , you can reorient yourself back to what you are trying to achieve .
Other times , it may take you some time to realize that your mind has started to wander .
Sayette and colleagues had people read a section of the novel War and Peace .
As they were reading , people were asked to press a button every time they noticed that their mind was wandering .
This is a measure of how often people think their mind is wandering .
In addition , every few minutes there was a signal ( a beep ) , and people were asked if their mind was wandering at that time .
This procedure allows the researchers to estimate how often people 's minds were actually wandering .
Half of the people in this study participated after drinking enough alcohol to get their blood alcohol level above .05 % .
The other half drank a that tasted a bit like alcohol , but did not actually have any alcohol in it .
What does this mean ?
If you just asked the people in this study how often their minds wandered during the study , the answers would be the same regardless of whether they drank alcohol .
However , in actuality , mind wandering was twice as likely for those who drank alcohol than for those who did n't .
So , the people who drank alcohol were not recognizing most of the times when their minds wandered .
What has this got to do with drunk driving ?
When you have had a bit to drink and you think about driving home , you have to make a decision about whether it is safe for you to drive home .
One thing you might do is to think about whether you are experiencing any obvious signs of impairment .
For example , you might ask yourself whether you are having any trouble concentrating .
But this study suggests that you are likely to think that you are concentrating just about as well when you have had a fair amount to drink as when you have n't had anything to drink at all , even though you are actually much worse at maintaining your concentration .
So , your own beliefs about your ability to think while drunk are flawed .
That means that you should not rely on your own judgment about the effects of alcohol on your ability to think .
Instead , if you plan to go out and have a few drinks , then set up a specific rule .
If you have three or more drinks , do n't drive home .
Get a ride or take a cab .
Avoid the risk that you 'll end up in the newspaper .

Take a look at this – ain’t it cool , with the Black & White Clock ?
It comprises of a quartet of independent 3D OLED digits , where each digit will boast its own power source and control .
The clock comes equipped with a light sensor as well , capable of switching automatically between two modes .
During the day , the figures will be shown in black , while when dusk falls and night takes over , you tell the time via white figures .
Neat !

Either the Thunderbird or the Beetle had to go .
With a baby on the way and two vintage cars in our garage , one a red 1963 VW Ragtop Mike 's owned since age 15 and the other a champagne 1963 Ford T - bird , a tough decision had to be made .
One of them had to be replaced ...
The year was 2006 , and , believe it or not , these old - timers were pretty much the only cars we 'd ever owned .
With our purchase of a new car that winter , we made a 43 year leap in automotive technology overnight .
Today 's car industry is brainwashed by its own car culture , with its obsession for speed , styling and fantasy .
The car business has become one of repackaging , steering people 's focus towards style and a narrow definition of performance , not on our true needs .
We quickly realized , however , that despite 43 years of automotive progress , with its advances in safety , efficiency , and manufacturing , the driving experience remains basically the same as it was in 1963 .
After experiencing this somewhat disappointing time warp , we wondered how we could contribute a new point of view and perhaps spark more significant progress for the next 40 years .
The current climate gave us the final push -- with the car industry lost , an urgent focus on global warming , awareness of oil dependency , and the economic down turn , the stars had aligned .
It is time to sow seeds , to experiment .
Armed with a small design studio , we set out to design a concept car in search of an optimistic new future .
And it quickly became clear to us :
A shift must take place from styling cars to redefining them .
This year at the Detroit Auto Show , we expected the industry to shed some light on a confident path ahead .
Instead , we were shown their usual speed demons , nostalgic muscle , and a few seemingly very last minute answers to the electric future .
It dawned on us : today 's car industry is brainwashed by its own car culture , with its obsession for speed , styling and fantasy .
The car business has become one of repackaging , steering people 's focus towards style and a narrow definition of performance , not on our true needs .
Speed and " performance " have been the driving factors for car design , styling , and engineering for a century .
Most cars on the road today can go 120 mph .
Why ?
The reality is that cars are mostly used at moderate speeds and for sitting in traffic .
It 's time to look at performance in a new way .
During our first brainstorming session , an honest discussion revealed an intriguing and consistent desire : the desire not to drive .
Sure , everyone wanted to get from A to B , but they 'd just rather be doing something else while en route : talking to friends , sleeping , or , as our French intern Laure suggested : " I want to enjoy the view with a nice wine , some cheese and a baguette . "
It became obvious to us : Driving is like putting your life on hold .
None of us liked the daily monotonous act of driving .
After years of incessant advertising , we have subscribed to a false sense of freedom , the freedom to waste countless hours strapped behind the wheel .
Research revealed that self - driving cars , once a fantasy requiring an entirely new infrastructure , are now technologically possible , even inevitable .
Savvy robotics are here and real .
Advances in GPS , sophisticated sensors , and navigation databases will allow driverless vehicles to operate on the same roads we have today .
Each day we are required to maneuver a heavy object through complex traffic and pedestrians , all the while trying to obey hundreds of obscure traffic laws in constant fear of sudden brake lights ahead , of making a wrong turn , of unpredictable drivers and police .
And did we mention the countless distractions along the way ?
Inevitably , in these complex and stressful situations , humans will make mistakes .
We were moved by the numbers : over 6 million car accidents and 43,000 highway fatalities in the US each year , 13,000 of them alcohol related .
Our conclusion ?
Humans are not meant to drive , nor should they have to .
As with many robotic developments , the future of self - driving cars is being determined mostly by engineers and the military .
Positive design visions are desperately needed if this technology ( and other robotic technology ) is to have a positive impact on society .
We decided driverless technology would be the perfect starting point for our design exploration .
Covering the wheels communicated " electric " , lowering the panels generated " train " , tall windows are " bus " .
These experiments helped us decode the formula that makes a car a car in order to arrive at something new .
Not only will this technology save people millions of hours each year , it has the potential to virtually eliminate car accidents .
Dismissing the need for extreme speed and acceleration as irrelevant , performance can be measured by time savings and safety instead .
Inspired by this new outlook , it was to time to imagine what the driverless car for 2040 would look like ...
We started with a series of experiments -- collaging , dissecting , montaging -- to help us see the object and the experience in a new light .
By taking photos of existing cars and manipulating them , we created objects that are not driver - oriented but passenger - oriented .
Altering the proportions of these vehicles helped us create new archetypes .

Collage : driverless rover
Summoned by phone , your ATNMBL arrives .
You enter from the curb side through an electric glass sliding door into a standing - height entryway .
Upon entering , you are presented with a simple question : " Where can I take you ? "
There is no steering wheel , brake pedal or drivers seat .
But that still was n't enough .
We also needed to redefine the experience .
Through a series of montages , we visualized our dreams of the ultimate riding experience : a beautiful view with the addition of basic elements for riding comfortably : seat , floor , table , roof .
Montage : idealized ride through the country
Montage : the ideal commute
Thinking about what we really want to do in our cars
Thinking about cars as architectural spaces
Sketch : a space for living
After reviews , collages , sketches and full scale volume studies , we arrived at a direction : the vehicle would be designed from the inside out with elements influenced by architecture .
It should offer living comfort , views , conversations , and social connectedness .
Unencumbered by driving , the new vehicle should be a space for living .
We labeled the concept the ATNMBL .
If the interior feels familiar to you , it should .
The wrap around seating arrangement is a direct reference to the typical living - room setting : a couch , side chair and low table .
Up to seven riders are oriented towards each other and to the view outside through the large floor - to - ceiling panoramic windows on both sides .
Centrally oriented is a large flat display that features live trip information , maps , and entertainment .
The display can slide up to reveal a bar behind .
Yes , a bar .
In a driverless vehicle , you can't drink and drive ... but you can drink .
ATNMBL interior
ANTMBL from above
A new and comprehensive sense of control is introduced through voice recognition and a touch screen remote ( or one 's personal phone ) , offering riders a wide range of trip planning , ride sharing and performance settings that can be very detailed for those who want elaborate control or extremely simple for those who would rather just relax and enjoy the ride .
From the outside , ATNMBL looks like micro-architecture .
Large windows , a pitched roof and asymmetrical from every view , the concept is designed without any reference to automobiles of the past .
Absent are the myriad of design details and tricks that car designers have perfected over the years : large wheels , fluid forms , aggressive stance , character lines and shiny trim .
Transition from one architectural space to another
In contrast to today 's automobiles , where much of the car 's space is reserved for the engine and drive train , the ATNMBL 's mechanical components are densely packed and simplified , providing dramatically more interior space in a vehicle that is shorter than most cars on the road today .
Electric motors in each wheel provide all - wheel drive .
Power is stored underneath the seating and floor with additional power provided by solar panels on the roof .
Within a gridded pattern front and rear is an array of headlights , tail lights and sensors .
At last , we 're ready to leave speed , styling and fantasy behind for a moment so we can enjoy the much more compelling benefits in store for us :
accessibility for the young , the elderly and the disabled ( no drivers licenses )
saving hours each day by reclaiming our commute time
no searching for parking ( it will drop us off and park itself )
cars that work for us ( think autonomous grocery pickups , deliveries and car maintenance )
cars that make money for us
less congestion with increased carpooling and carsharing
did we mention the bar ?
and most importantly , there will be far fewer fatalities and there will always be a designated driver .
We admit it , we miss our old T - bird .
With its swing - away steering wheel , elegant stance and velvety ride , it was hard to part with it .
But with 11 miles per gallon , the constant smell of gasoline in our house , and frequent trips to the mechanic , it was time to let go of the past to make room for a new future .
The need for efficient , affordable , zero - pollution cars is vital for the future of humanity and the planet but is obviously not the only problem to be solved .
Think about it , 40 years from now , many of us will no longer be able to drive .
But with a little bit of optimism and a newly inspired car industry , we may still have the freedom to enjoy the ride .

The Flying Spaghetti Monster Hat
The Pope has a special hat .
Rabbis have special hats .
Rastafarians have special hats .
Why not Pastafarians ?
This hat is crocheted ( I assume you could knit something similar ) .
Unfortunately , I do n't how to write patterns -- my grandma taught me how to crochet in a rather freeform manner ( she also made the best spaghetti and meatballs , EVER - coincidence ? ) .
So here 's a very rough guide :
INGREDIENTS
Body of hat : 2 balls Lion Brand Wool - Ease in Fisherman 99
Spaghetti tendrils & trim : 1 ball of fluffy Lion Brand Chenille in Antique White
Eyeballs : a little bit of any old white yarn
Meatballs : 1 ball Caron " Jewel Box " in Rubellite 0028 .
This is the most meatballistic yarn I could find .
2 small black buttons for pupils
