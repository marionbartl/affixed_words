Build a Plane and Fly to Sicily
Since Mondays are typically low energy days , I ’d like to share this story with , to reassure you :
If you have a strong vision — no one can stop you .
Giorgio ’s atelier .
Or is it a hangar ?
Can you see the wing of that airplane in the lower left corner ?
Never Underestimate an Artist
This summer I made a trip to Italy with my Japanese family , so they could meet and bond with the Italian side .
Part of the idea was to introduce everyone to everyone .
My grandfather in Italy took that literally and made me drive all around northern Italy to introduce my new family to all of his friends .
After a hot and tiring day , all we could think of was beer and pizza , yet my grandfather wanted to visit “ just one more friend .
He makes sculptures .
Italian art .
That ’s interesting for the Japanese , come on ! ” I knew the guy .
He made these plaster copies : David , Venus , baroque and antique kitsch .
I made the rather - not face .
Grandfather : “ COME ON ! ”
Me : “ Okay then , let ’s do that as well . ”
Who would have guessed what happened next .
My Grandfather ’s friend , we might as well call him Giorgio , seemed a little bit annoyed at first .
Grandpa : “ Hey , I thought you might wanna show your stuff . ”
Giorgio : “ That ’s not a good time .
I ’m building this plane for my wife , she wants to fly down to Sicily and … ”
Me : “ You are building what ? ”
Italian is my second language and yes , it ’s become a little rusty here in Japan , but I really felt like I did n’t understand .
My Japanese family was getting all nervous because they thought , I ’m picking a fight with him shouting like that .
So I had to translate .
They seemed even more scared after I translated what the guy was up to .
Giorgio : “ Yeah , I ’m building a plane .
What ’s wrong with that ? ”
Me : “ Why are you building a plane and how can you do that ? ”
Giorgio : “ Wana fly down to Sicily with my wife in autumn .
It ’s not my first plane , of course . ”
Me : “ Can we see this plane ? ”
He still seemed kind of annoyed , but as I can read my Italian fellows I know that inside this is exactly what he wanted .
You have to see it to believe it :
Giorgio : “ No joke , no toy , my friend .
This baby is going to fly smooth like a jet plane .
So far I built four very different planes .
My second one was the best .
Once I flew over the Alps to Geneva and I could see the Matterhorn from above like a bird .
Of course , the current one here is going to be the best . ”
And here is his inspiration .
What ’s he really planning there ?
This is what he does for a living .
Giorgio : “ Being around Italian art all day long is inspiring .
It makes you wana fly …
How can I look at Michelangelo ’s work all day long and then go home and watch that junk on TV ?
So this is what I do in my free time .
It keeps me busy . ”
From left to right :
My mother in law , Giorgio and me .
Giorgio : “ This little one here only gets you to Florence .
Not very exciting .
I ’m selling it .
Do you fly ? ”

Date Event Nov
1793 Philibert Aspairt , considered by some the first cataphile , becomes lost while exploring the Parisian catacombs by candlelight .
His body is found 11 years later .
1861 Writing in the Brooklyn Standard , poet Walt Whitman describes his visit to Brooklyn's recently abandoned Atlantic Avenue Tunnel , which in 1844 had been built as the first subway tunnel in the world .
1904
One week after the opening of the subway system , New Yorker Leidschmudel Dreispul is killed by an oncoming train while exploring the new tunnels .
The Interborough Rapid Transit company responds by erecting " no trespassing " signs throughout the system .
1916 Harry H. Gardiner , " The Human Fly " , climbs 12 floors and 211 feet up the side of Detroit 's Majestic Building , thereby becoming the first builderer in recorded history .
1921
In perhaps the first organized group expedition to an abandoned building , Dadaists including Andre Breton , Paul Eluard , Francis Picabia and Tristan Tzara organize a trip to the deserted and little - known church of St. Julien le Pauvre in Paris .
In promoting the event , the Dadaists promise to remedy " the incompetence of suspect guides and cicerones " , offering instead a series of visits to selected sites , " particularly those which really have no reason for existing " .
1955 Guy Debord publishes his Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography , and develops a practice called dérive , which consists of travelling through urban environments and noting psychogeographical variations .

Have you ever had your taskbar filled with 10 applications all
doing something that involved waiting for a task to finish ?
Document Printing Progress , a K3 b CD burning dialogue , Audio Encoding
via KAudioCreator , File Transfers in Konqueror , Kopete , KTorrent ,
checking email in KMail ...
The new Jobs support in KDE 4 will unify
the display of progress for these tasks , making it easy to see and manage what is happening on your system .
Read on for details .
Picture it as a cross between the Firefox download manager and
the KDE printer queue , except that there is no real restriction on
what type of jobs can be monitored .
The way it works is that each
KDE 4 app that has a progress dialog adds a flag for
something called an Observer .
Then , a separate application can observe any running Jobs , displaying progress and even adding
certain actions ( like " Cancel Download " ) which can be submitted back
to the application that actually has the progress dialog .
So the
applications like K3b , which already have very good progress
reporting , will not lose their existing dialogs , but rather additionally permit this new applet to observe its progress so that all the progress bars can be pulled into a convenient place .
What started as a
mocked up KDE 4 Improvement via KDE - Look.org has turned into a
full - fledged KDE 4 integration project , thanks to Rafael Fernandez Lopez .
And there 's been a lot of progress to the point where applications
are already being adapted to the new infrastructure .
Last
Tuesday 's " Binary Incompatible Changes " day saw much of the changes
officially committed to the KDE 4 repository .
Below is the original mock up , done by KDE user and KDE - look.org
contributor
kiras , used with permission .
Click to see the full - sized
mockup .
Please keep in mind that the above is a mockup , and does not
necessarily reflect the ultimate look - and - feel goals of KDE 4 ,
Plasma or Konqueror .
Currently , it is being prototyped as a standard system tray applet
( similar to the printer queue in KDE 3.5.5 ) which would allow
interoperability with GNOME 's tray implementation as well .
However , at this point only KDE applications can be observed , so monitoring download
progress from Firefox for instance , is not currently supported .
That is not to
say it can not be made to happen in the future since progress is observed using the standard D - Bus interprocess communication architecture .
There are intentions to collaborate with the GNOME project 's Mathusalem team , a
project of similar scope as this one .
Here is a screenshot of the current appearance of the monitoring
application as it would appear when clicking on the tray applet .
As
you can see , it 's already looking very useful .
As you can see , the Kopete buttons are mostly just placeholders
at the moment , and only exist for testing purposes .
However , when
you click on one of those buttons , it actually sends a signal back to Kopete ,
and Kopete itself pops up that smaller dialog you see .
The Konqueror download progress bars you see being monitored represent
an actual file download in progress .
They continue even after Konqueror
is closed .
Useful action buttons like " Abort Download " are in the
works .
If you 'd like to get involved in KDE 4 development , adding
support for the new KJobs progress monitoring is a fairly easy entry
point to KDE programming .
It takes only a few lines of code to
adapt an application to display progress , and a few more lines to
make the action buttons useful .
This new progress monitoring technology will be able to be
integrated into Konqueror ( like in the mockup ) , desktop applets , and
anything else that uses D - Bus .
I can even imagine a small web - app
that lets you monitor progress remotely ...
Rafael 's goal after the initial implementation is completed is to
add persistence , such that when a job is complete , it would
optionally stay listed until closed by the user .
He is also looking
for feedback on this tool and its implementation for future improvements .
Look forward to more feature articles showcasing more great
technologies for KDE 4 .
A quick note on methodology : I make sure to use the KDE defaults for all of my screenshots , even if it 's ugly , since then you can get a better sense of progress as KDE 4 evolves and grows from week to week .
As a rule , all of the
features I 've demonstrated so far are publicly available in SVN , and
anyone can reproduce my results .
In today 's article , I had to
uncomment a single line of code to enable this in - development
feature , which is an exception to my normal rules .
Additionally ,
the Kopete progress support is not yet in the official KDE SVN repository , but Rafael uses it to test features .
Back in the summer , we reported that Nature , perhaps the most prestigious scientific journal on the planet , was experimenting with open peer review ( OPR ) .
Instead of simply assigning manuscripts to a set of anonymous reviewers , Nature offered the authors the opportunity to also have their work posted on a publicly accessible site that provided a mechanism for making comments on the text .
The editors would then combine the peer reviewers ' recommendations with the public comments when making decisions regarding whether to publish the work or to require additional revisions .
Nature ran a trial of this system ( details are available as a FAQ ) from the beginning of June until the end of September , and followed up on it with surveys of authors and editors .
Their resulting analysis makes it clear that , at least as structured , OPR went nowhere .
Out of nearly 1,400 manuscripts chosen for review during that period , only five percent of the authors agreed to have theirs subjected to OPR .
Those 71 manuscripts elicited a grand total of 92 comments ; nearly half received no comments at all , and over half of the comments were directed at eight individual papers .
The editors handling the papers did not find the results all that appealing .
Ideally , OPR would supplement an editor 's knowledge by attracting comments from people with a detailed technical understanding of the field .
Instead , most comments were judged as being either editorial suggestions or devoid of content ( comments such as " nice work " were considered unhelpful ) .
The editorial staff at Nature appear to do a good job of analyzing the results of their experiment .
They suggest that the exceptionally poor response in the biosciences could result in part because of potential patenting issues connected with the research .
The high level of competition in this field would also allow OPR to alert competitors of pending publications , providing the competition with the opportunity to push through a similar publication on short notice .
Glaringly absent from the discussion , however , was any consideration of the fact that Nature 's OPR process stripped a critical element from normal peer reviewing : anonymity .
Anyone posting a comment on a manuscript was required to provide a verifiable name and institution .
Although this was undoubtedly helpful in allowing the editors to screen for potential crackpots , it may have inhibited many from leaving comments .
After all , it 's one thing to anonymously reveal misunderstandings and lack of knowledge to a single editor during peer review .
It 's a different matter entirely to do so in a forum that could be viewed by everyone working in your field .
Having participated in this process a number of times as a peer reviewer , I can say with certainty that providing a decent review requires a significant amount of effort .
Finding the time to make that effort is challenging even when editors contact you directly and set deadlines for your responses .
Changing the scientific culture so that researchers hunt down relevant publications on the web and provide a detailed and technical review without any incentive or deadline is a long - term project , and one that Nature 's brief experiment did not address .

No single raindrop believes it is to blame for the flood - Despair.com
On Monday , in one of his now - weekly appearances on cable news defending the latest Wikipedia scandal , the project 's figurehead Jimmy ' Jimbo ' Wales expressed his desire to find the anonymous internet user who had libeled John Seigenthaler .
Seigenthaler , a former Robert Kennedy aide and newspaper editor wrote about his anguish a fortnight ago , describing how an edit to his Wikipedia biography implicated in him in the Kennedy assassination , and claimed he'd lived in Russia for twelve years .
Both claims were false , and lay uncorrected for months .
For CNN viewers , and for NPR listeners again the following day , Wales repeated his wish to unmask the perp , but could only offer some hand - wringing excuse about the difficulty of finding anonymous users , and the complexity of serving internet service providers with subpoenas .
However , we now learn that the libeler was n't very hard to find , and has now stepped forward to confess to making the edit with an apology .
Brian Chase , a 38 year old employee of Rush Delivery in Seigenthaler 's home town of Nashville , Tennessee , admitted to making the edit and has apologized to Seigenthaler .
The reason he gave to the New York Times was most revealing .
Chase thought Wikipedia was a joke site and he made the edit to amuse a colleague .
From which we conclude that the spoof site Uncyclopedia , which consists entirely of fictional entries , is doing far better than expected , and that Wikipedia has a long way to go to rid itself of the image that it's a massive , multiplayer shoot - em - up game , or MMORPG .
Chase has lost his job , and Seigenthaler joined the pleas to reinstate him .
But the unusual aspect of this - and this is an irony on a par with Sony using ' DVD ' Jon Johansen 's anti-DRM code in its DRM CD software - is what compelled Chase to step forward .
The libeller was outed not by Wikipedia guardians , by a prominent critic of the site who has been earned himself a lifetime Wikipedia ban - researcher Daniel Brandt .
Chase left a fingerprint behind , in the form of an IP address , and Brandt discovered that the machine was active , traced it to Nashville , and discovered it was hosting a web server .
The web server revealed the name of a company : ' Rush Delivery ' .
Brandt fired off a fax to Rush Delivery in Nashville and confirmed the connection .
Perhaps he 'll be unbanned now , although we doubt it .
But Brandt , who recounts his story in detail ( grep for " whodunnit " ) says his discovery was extremely fortunate , and he 's correct in many ways .
Wikipedia has made it more difficult for such detective work to be performed in the future , as the site now requires a 30 second log - in procedure to create an unvalidated user id , behind which libellers can shield their identity .
That Wales could n't fufil his expressed desire to unmask the perpetrator sounds less a case of " too hard to do " than one of " ca n't be bothered , mate " .
So we come to the question of responsibility .
We 've promised to deal with the ethics of Wikipedia before , and it's no longer possible to ignore the elephant in the room , so we must .

In a free market , science originates in the minds of individual scientists , who have studied and thought about problems that interest them and who from time to time arrive at new insights , which they develop further and verify .
In the course of their work and in the dissemination of its results , they often need more funds than they can personally provide .
In such cases , inspired by the value they see in their work , they attempt to obtain the necessary funds from those other individuals whom they can persuade to share their understanding of their work and its value .
In a free market , the main source of funds would be wealthy businessmen and wealthy heirs .
In a free market , there would be no income or inheritance taxes , both of which are a violation of the freedom of the individual to spend his own wealth as he chooses .
And because there would be no income or inheritance taxes , there would be no need for the establishment of foundations and trusts as means of avoiding these taxes , nor for the appointment of trustees or anyone else with power to determine the use of one 's funds .
There would thus simply be wealthy businessmen and heirs in full control of their own funds .
And a businessman would not have to worry about running afoul of any regulatory agency that might use its power to harm his business in retaliation for his supporting research that was unpopular .
The possession of substantial wealth by single individuals , with full power to determine its use , is of vital importance .
This is because not only do new ideas originate in the minds just of single individuals , who necessarily must set out completely alone in any quest to change the understanding of the rest of mankind , but the change in other people 's understanding , which must subsequently be brought about , also proceeds just one mind at a time .
For an individual to understand something that is new and significant is not an easy or automatic task even in the best of circumstances .
For the original discoverer it must be somewhat daunting to think that there is a significant truth that as yet , in the entire world and in the entire history of the world , he alone understands .
Such an individual needs to have considerable confidence in the power and reliability of his mind .
Galileo , Newton , Pasteur , Edison — all the great innovators in science and invention have necessarily been in this position .
The first people to be persuaded of the truth and significance of a new discovery , after the discoverer himself , must also have considerable confidence in the power and reliability of their minds as well .
Their situation is that as yet only they and the discoverer understand this truth and its value .
They must be prepared to proceed on the basis of no foundation but that of their own , independent judgment that the discovery is in fact true and valuable .
In this connection , it should be realized that even the utmost obviousness of a truth is never a guarantee of its acceptance by an individual .
There are many people so doubtful of their own capacity to judge the truth , so fearful of the possible need to defend it in a conflict with others , who they expect will disagree , that their response even to an extremely obvious but not yet generally recognized truth is , in effect , that it need not be true because if it were , it would already be generally recognized and accepted .
For such people , the ability to recognize the truth melts away without the assurance that practically everyone else is prepared to confirm the truth as true .
Only then can acceptance of a truth be sufficiently separated from the possibility of conflict with others that it can take place without being blocked by fear .
Consider , for example , how the great mass of people could once go on believing , century after century , that the world was flat .
Certainly that was how the world appeared to them any time they looked out at a broad expanse of land in front of them .
But some people in this period knew that the world was round and that its appearance of flatness could easily be reconciled with the fact of its roundness .
The conclusion that the world was round was an obvious inference to be drawn from such facts as the tops of the masts of sailing vessels appearing on the horizon first , followed by more and more of the masts , and then by the body of the vessels , as they came closer .
It was an obvious inference to be drawn from the knowledge that while one could see only so far when one looked out at the land in front of one , the limit of one 's field of vision was not the limit of the extent of the earth , which went further .
Curvature of the earth was the obvious explanation in both cases .
While some people undoubtedly did understood this much at the time , most people could not be persuaded of it for many centuries .
They were essentially immune to this knowledge .
Whether is was simply out of fear of conflict with others to whom they might have to explain it in the face of resistance and possible derision , or simply a matter of intellectual laziness on their part , or both , the essential fact is that here was a very simple truth that the great majority of mankind could not be gotten to accept for a very long time .
And even today , when virtually everyone finally does acknowledge that the earth is round , it is probably the case that a large proportion of the people who now do so , have no better reason for doing so than that this is what they know the great majority of people believe and is thus what they are expected to believe .
Intellectually inert and fearful people continue to be extremely numerous .
They are to be found at all levels of educational attainment .
Those with higher levels of education simply know more about what most people supposedly believe and that they are thus expected to believe .
They hold their knowledge virtually as a collection of public opinion polls .
Very little if any of their ostensible knowledge is solidly grounded .
They have little or no basis for forming an independent judgment of the truth or falsity of new knowledge .
Such people are so numerous that even in relatively small groups one or more of them can be expected to be found .
This is what makes it so important that the power to make decisions rests in the hands of single individuals , not groups , committees , or boards of any kind .
To the extent that it is groups , committees , or boards that decide , the likely presence of such people and their mutual reinforcement of each other constitutes a major obstacle in the way of a valuable new idea going forward .
The advancement of science depends on a free market , because the free market and its vesting of decision - making power in the hands of single individuals rather than groups is able to shunt aside those who lack the power of independent judgment .
They are relegated to the sidelines , where they can enjoy all the benefits of scientific and economic progress but not get in its way .
Now let us turn to science under the tutelage of the state .
State control of science is the attempt to combine opposites .
In essence , science is mind ; the state is physical force .
Science makes its way by means of the voluntary assent of the individual human mind to its recognition of truth .
In contrast , the state and what the state sponsors makes its way by means of the use of physical force and the threat of physical force .
There is no law , regulation , ruling , edict , or decree made by the state that is not backed by the threat of physical force to compel obedience to it .
The state does not say to the individual do or do not do this because of its reasonableness or lack of reasonableness , and take as long as you like before coming around to our position .
No .
It says , do this or do not do this if you want to stay out of jail and avoid being injured or killed in resisting .
Any financial support the state may provide to science is by means of taxes collected at the point of a gun , from people who know that they will be imprisoned if they do not pay the taxes and injured or killed if they resist being imprisoned .
This is a remarkable foundation for the progress of science , much like a purported construction of a laboratory by gorillas .
Thus , the starting point of state - sponsored science is the exact opposite of the starting point of actual science : it is physical force not the voluntary assent of the individual mind .
There is another important difference in starting point .
Science begins in the mind of the individual scientist seeking important truth not previously identified .
State - sponsored science in contrast typically begins with an already established consensus concerning the subject to be pursued .
This is because the existence of a consensus increases the likelihood of being able to obtain political support for the project .
Of course , not all state - sponsored science requires an existing consensus .
Stalin did not need a consensus when he decided to promote the career of the biologist Lysenko , because of the latter 's support for the theory of acquired characteristics .
The example of Stalin and Lysenko sheds light on the kind of scientific quest that any politician or government official will initiate if he can .
Because the primary concern of such a person is always the maintenance and enhancement of his power , the projects he initiates will be projects designed to increase his power and prestige .
Any connection with scientific truth is likely to be merely coincidental .
Thus in the case of Stalin and Lysenko , the objective was not the promotion of the science of biology , but support , wrung at the expense of the science of biology , for the Marxist doctrine that life under Communist rule could change human nature by virtue of a succession of generations acquiring characteristics that would then be genetically transmitted to later generations .
Whether state - sponsored science rests on an existing consensus or on the initiative of an individual politician , it differs radically from genuine science in yet another respect .
This concerns the relationship between science and money .
In a free market , it is the truth and importance of the science that drives the raising of money .
Money is raised in order to facilitate the development and dissemination of the science .
Money is the means ; science is the end .
With state - sponsored science , this relationship is largely reversed .
The state , in effect , offers pots of money in the form of " grants " for the study of matters selected by politicians and their appointees , and then scientists must choose areas of investigation that are most likely to secure them some of that money .
The " scientists " gather around the pots of money , like bees around pots of honey , eagerly seeking as best they can to slurp up some of the money by means of writing whatever kind of grant proposals they think will promote the agenda of whichever officials have the power to determine the award of the grants .
The meaning of this state of affairs is that the initiative for science passes from scientists to the state , i.e. , to politicians and their appointees .
And instead of money serving science , science now serves money , and , it must be stressed , not ordinary money , but money collected at the point of a gun , and made available on conditions determined by politicians and the appointees of politicians .
In a free market , of course , applied science serves money .
There are companies that want to develop specific products and they employ scientists to help develop them .
But the funds are raised voluntarily and the applied science must be true , or the products will not work .
There are also companies and wealthy individuals in a free market who may be interested in the exploration of various fields of basic science and who offer monetary incentives to scientists to pursue such research .
Again , at the very least , the relationship is strictly voluntary .
What is crucial is that in a free market , there is room for independent scientists , scientists who themselves take the initiative in their work and who , thanks largely to the existence of a substantial number of wealthy businessmen and heirs , have a real chance of obtaining the funds they need in order to pursue their work and disseminate its results .
Indeed , in a free market , without income taxes , there might well be significant financial support for independent science extending deep into the ranks of the middle class .
State - sponsored science comes into existence on a large scale in an environment in which the foundations of genuine basic science are already largely undercut by the existence of progressive income and inheritance taxes and an accompanying collectivization even of private decision making : i.e. the replacement of individual decision making with decision making by groups of various kinds , notably boards and committees .
Once state support of science comes into existence , there is little prospect of major advances in science gaining any support from it .
A major advance in science represents the radically new and different .
However true it may be , its truth as yet lacks adherents .
And precisely for this reason , it is almost certain to be rejected by those whose standard of truth is acceptance by others .
It does not yet and cannot yet have this acceptance because of its very newness .
If it is to be accepted , it must be accepted on the basis of independent judgment and nothing else .
But the exercise of independent judgment virtually cries out for the foundation of the ownership of independent wealth .
Independent , i.e. , privately owned , wealth , can be used in support of the radically new and different .
In that case if the judgment is wrong , the loss is that of the person who made it .
But when the wealth being used is publicly owned , then whoever makes the judgment concerning its use , must above all be sure that he can prove that he did absolutely nothing out of the ordinary with it .
Only in that way , can he avoid blame for any loss .
State - funded science is necessarily a swamp of mediocrity .
It is the domain of peer - reviewed journal articles and of statistical studies .
In peer - reviewed journals , nothing is considered worthy of publication unless deemed to be so by " peers . "
What this means is that in order for a radical new idea to be accepted for publication , it must immediately gain the support of those who hold the opposing , now outmoded ideas that it shows to be in error , or else it can not be published .
Such an arrangement is tantamount to requiring that before Galileo can publish , his ideas must have the endorsement of astronomers who up to the moment of reading him have adhered to the Ptolemaic system of astronomy .
It is tantamount to requiring that before Louis Pasteur can publish on the subject of the germ theory of disease , he must have the assent of those who deny the very existence of germs .
State - funded science is very much at home with statistical studies .
This is because they can all be made to fit easily specified criteria with respect to such matters as sample size , confidence intervals , and confidence levels .
They are thus a very good way for large numbers of " scientists " to be kept employed attempting to establish or deny the likelihood of a relationship existing between practically any two things in the universe .
Provided the " scientist " can verify that he has followed the rules of such a study , he can rely on keeping his government grant check and go on to the next " study " and the next government grant .
Perhaps some may find the most telling criticism of state - funded science the simple visualization of the faces of various politicians and government officials , coupled with the realization that it is they who are now in charge of science .
Even though our President , his Cabinet officers , and our legislators do not personally award government grant money , they might as well do so .
This is because it is still their judgment , such as it is , that determines the appointment of those who do award the grants , or the appointment of those who whose further job it is to make such appointments .
And in the same way , with whatever intervening layers of appointees that there may be , it is their judgment that ultimately underlies the choice of all members of the government 's panels of science advisors .
There is first of all the very great problem of the ability of our politicians and officials to make any kind of sound appointments .
Who are they , after all ?
What is it that they actually know about science , or about anything for that matter ?
What qualifies them to determine the qualifications of an appointee ?
And then there is the further problem of who is it that seeks out such jobs as determining the award of government grant money ?
Who is it who seeks appointment to the government 's advisory panels of scientists ?
Serious scientists are concerned with the pursuit of science , not the politics of science .
It is not likely that they will be interested in obtaining such positions .
Such positions are sought precisely by the opposite kind of " scientists , " namely , those for whom it is the politics of science that counts , and not the actual substance of science .
These are the kind of people who actually enjoy being members of committees .
And it is these people , several rungs down in the bureaucratic hierarchy , who are now the masters of science on a day - to - day basis .
State - sponsored science is the destroyer of science .
If science is to live , government funding of science must end .

Mr Ellison urged an immediate pullout of US troops from Iraq
Blog : US ' healing power
He overcame personal attacks emphasising his past association with Louis Farrakhan , leader of the radical Nation of Islam group .
The 43 - year - old lawyer sought to play down the issue of his religion and ran on a populist platform .
He has called for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
On the campaign trail , he also urged a greater reliance on renewable fuels and the establishment of a government - funded universal healthcare system .
" Tonight , we made history , " Mr Ellison said in a victory speech to supporters .
" We won a key election , but we did much more than that .
" We showed that a candidate can run a 100 % positive campaign and prevail , even against tough opposition . "
' Not a bigot '
Mr Ellison served two terms as a legislator in the Minnesota House of Representatives and also sat on the Minneapolis City Council .
He converted to Islam while as a student , but talked little about his religious background during the campaign .
Although he follows Islamic law in his personal life , he stresses that he is not the " Muslim candidate " for Congress .
I 've never been involved in any kind of a bigotry .
I 've always been a consistent advocate for the human rights of all people
Keith Ellison
" I 'm not running as a Muslim , I 'm running as an American , as a person that 's trying to help our country be better , " he told Voice of America in an interview earlier this year .
" But I do hope that if we win , inshallah [ God Willing ] , in November , that it will signal to Muslims that we should engage in the American political system .
It will signal to people who are not Muslims that Muslims have a lot to offer to the United States and the improvement of our country . "
He later told the BBC : " I 've never been involved in any kind of a bigotry .
I 've always been a consistent advocate for the human rights of all people .
That 's my entire adult life .
In all the smears that they 've thrown at me they 've never accused me of saying anything that was bigoted .
They 've only tried to make guilt by association . "
He says his involvement with Louis Farrakhan was limited to a period of a few months , helping to organise the 1995 Million Man March in Washington .
During the campaign , Mr Ellison was supported by the National Jewish Democratic Council as well as a prominent Minneapolis Jewish newspaper , which endorsed him over his Republican rival Alan Fine , who is Jewish .
The Reverend Jesse Jackson , a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , also campaigned for him .
' Symbolic ' election
Mr Ellison says his main concern is the middle class .
" The middle class is in a very difficult situation and we need some real change for them , " he told Voice of America .
" As we see the middle - class incomes stagnate or go down , we 're seeing increasing tuition , and increasing students ' debts , and a college education is becoming beyond the reach of the average middle class family .
" We also need for middle - class families to have a real alternative in terms of oil dependency .
We need to be able to get around and travel without being dependent upon oil that fluctuates so wildly and unexpectedly . "
He has also broken from more conservative Muslims by favouring gay rights and abortion rights , the Associated Press news agency reports .
His election has " huge symbolism " , says Larry Jacobs , a professor of political science at the University of Minnesota .
" It 's very interesting that Minnesota would be the first state to send a Muslim to Congress , " he told Voice of America .
" I think many Americans think of Minnesota as a state that 's overwhelmingly dominated by whites , but Minnesota has changed in rapid and dramatic ways .
It 's seen a large influx of Somalis and immigrants from Asia , particularly Cambodia ...
" The other key factor is that Minnesota has a long tradition , stretching back to Hubert Humphrey and Water Mondale , in supporting civil rights and the inclusion of African - Americans and others of colour in the political process . "
One of Mr Ellison 's Muslim supporters - one of five million Muslims living in the US - also believe his election will make a difference .
" You do n't know how much this will be a turnover for the Muslim community that live in the United States in their involvement in the political life , " he told the BBC .
" I do n't want to be very much optimistic , but at least I can see that my son one day might be the president of the United States . "

M any years ago a friend of mine wrote a book , The Wonder that IS India .
Both of us have lived more for than 30 years in the Land of the Bharatiyas and share a love for this nation .
When he showed me the manuscript of his book , I had pointed out that his representation of India was too rosy and suggested one more chapter -- ' The Horror that is India ' .
I think he did .
I have the same feelings for India today : 95 per cent is good , but there are some aspects that I am still not able to swallow , even after all these years .
I have listed ten of them .
Even if it does not change anything , at least some of my frustrations will be released while penning them down .
Before I begin , I must first say that during a recent visit to France , it was a pleasant surprise to see that India 's image is fast changing in the West .
When I left France in the early 1970s to settle in India , my family and friends considered it a shocking decision .
To leave France , a ' developed ' country and emigrate to the end of the world to a ' land of misery ' populated ' by elephants and cobras ' was unimaginable !
I was told that for a student in France today , it was of great added - value on his CV , if he had undergone training or internship in India .
This ' Indian ' wave has been reinforced since Mittal Steel tried to purchase Arcelor , the jewel of the French steel industry .
Though the nation has grown and matured over the last few decades , unfortunately not all domains have followed the same evolution .
Here is my list of the 10 things I still can't ' digest ' about India :
1. Power cuts :
While typing this article , the electricity board cut off the power supply .
The reason -- a storm last night which lasted for 15 to 20 minutes .
' As a precautionary measure ' the officials very compassionately disconnected vast areas from the network in the night and the following morning .
Being in rural Tamil Nadu , these officials want to protect us from broken wires due to fallen trees ( it could electrocute passersby , they say ) .
While I appreciate their reasoning , I was surprised to see that during the cyclonic rains in New Orleans last year , though thousands perished , electricity was not switched off .
Indian officials will tell you that the US is a rich and developed country , not comparable to India .
Where is the connection ?
2. Indian babus :
One could write volumes on the famous babus of India .
They run one of the largest bureaucracies in the world , but have not been able to change their mindset .
A particularly bothersome aspect is that their laws often come from antiquated rules and regulations that nobody knows of .
The consequence is what we call red-tapism , though for them it is ' implementing the letter , the law of the land ' .
But what about its spirit ?
In any case , the law has always to ' follow its own course ' .
A few years ago , a diligent minister found hundreds such laws and regulations dating back to the British .
In the era of modern technology and communications , this is preposterous .
Another aspect that irritates me about the bureaucracy is that babus never respond to letters .
Probably they consider themselves to be the government 's servants , not ' civil ' servants and therefore find no need to reply to ordinary citizens .
3 . No access to historical documents :
Though a better understanding of the history of the subcontinent could be one of the keys to disentangle difficult problems such as the Kashmir issue , today nobody can access primary sources .
They are locked away in the vaults of the Nehru Memorial Library or the almirahs of South Block .
All those who have tried to access historical documents since India 's independence will tell you that till the end of babudom , one bureaucrat or another will ensure that you do not access the dusty files .
Without fail , you will be courteously informed that India 's security and integrity will be endangered if these precious documents are opened to the public .
It is sad that Indians are not entitled to study their past ( though they can always visit archives in the West to know more about India ! )
4. Discrimination against the white tourist : Something particularly irritating for a ' white man ' is that wherever he goes in India , he has to pay a special rate .
Whether he visits the Taj Mahal where the ' white ' tourist has to cough up Rs 750 to see the mausoleum , or a national museum , or even hotels or airlines , there is a true racial discrimination .
Rates are often ten times higher for those who have a ' white ' or ' yellow ' ( Japanese ) skin .
Those who have made these rules do not understand that this policy harms India 's image .
The desire to make a quick buck from the so - called rich tourists leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of the visitors who in any case would have spent their budget during the stay in India .
To my knowledge , India must be the only nation in the world implementing these separate rates .
5. Paranoia about maps :
Another strange thing in India is the paranoia about maps .
Several years ago I visited the Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh .
One day I was invited to the office of a local tahsildar .
To my astonishment , the poor babu did not have a map of the area under his jurisdiction .
He only had a vague sketch of the district .
When I expressed surprise , he explained that maps were ' classified ' and only the army was authorised to use them .
Is it not foolish to believe that the Chinese do not possess detailed maps of Arunachal ?
And what about Google Earth which is now available the world over ?
One can only be surprised by this ' official ' paranoia about maps .
India is today a great power ; technological advancements have occurred in the world during the past decades and will undoubtedly continue to occur and India has no choice but to accept them and make the best use of them .
A year ago , the Union Cabinet approved a new National Map Policy , but unfortunately , the mindset of the implementers remains the same .
6 . And photographs :
The paranoia is not about maps alone , it extends to photos , particularly of the sites under the Archeological Survey of India .
A friend told me of her nightmarish experience while doing research in Chennai and the number of forms she had to fill to take some photos in a museum .
Though one pays in hard currency , one has still to justify why one needs a particular photo .
The poor researcher is looked upon as someone trying to ' steal ' the national patrimony .
In contrast , a few weeks earlier , I visited the Louvre museum in Paris which receives tens of thousands of visitors every day .
All of them were happily clicking away at statues , paintings , art artefacts ( it is only prohibited to photograph the Mona Lisa for security reasons ) and amongst them , a great number of Indians , perhaps the most frenetic clickers .
This is understandable , as they have to compensate for their frustration at home !
A French television crew told me about their adventure while trying to shoot in a fort once occupied by Rajaji ( C Rajagopalachari ) .
Before leaving Paris , they had planned a short sequence at the fort .
They dutifully applied to the Indian embassy for permission .
After paying a hefty Rs 5,000 they were given a stamped and signed permission .
When they arrived on the spot , the local official told them : " No way , as your permission does specifically mention it , you are not authorised to shoot with a stand .
You have to go to Chennai ( 150 km away ) and get the permission duly modified .
No problem , it will take you a day only ! "
They left disgusted , the fort will not appear in their film .
7. Politicians :
The topic of politicians is an easy one .
Everything appalling and more can be said of them and one will still remain below the truth .
In their defense , they are part of a system which is uniquely based on votes .
To win votes , one needs money and all compromises are permissible to get the required funds ' to serve the people ' .
It is true the world over , but here like in many other domains India excels .
8. Neglect for the environment :
Another frustrating aspect for me is the lack of care for the environment ( though it has been recently improving ) .
While Indians are the most conscious people as far as personal hygiene goes , there is very little civic awareness or concern for the environment .
Education could help ( for example for disposal of garbage or plastic bags ) , but it is often government policies such as free electricity for farmers , incentives for asbestos sheets ( one of the most carcinogenic material ) or chemical pesticides which harm the environment the most .
9 . Traffic : I hate the Indian traffic ( with its absence of rules ) .
Each time I return from a visit abroad , it is a terrible shock .
It is difficult to comprehend how there are not more casualties on the road .
A friend explained to me that the multitude of gods in India probably protect their flock .
The fact is that there are no law enforcement authorities ( most of the police force is busy with VIP duty ) .
In France and elsewhere if the cops were not around , very few would follow the traffic rules .
Extremely severe punishment for breaking traffic rules has a strong dissuasive effect .
Here in India , you can always get away with a few rupees .
10 . Corruption :
It is better to not comment .
Please allow me to add a last point : the number of ' holidays ' taken for a myriad of family ' problems ' , ( marriages , engagements , funerals , etc. ) , cultural , local or religious festivals ( of all faiths : India is secular ) , then you have bandhs , hartals , riots , strikes ( India is the only place in the world where the government sometimes calls for a strike ) , etc ...
The worst are ' French leaves ' , absolutely unknown in France .
Apart from the above , India is an incredible place and I have never regretted , even for one day , to have settled here .
Take - Your - Child - To - Work
Day never made much sense to me .
Unless you 're someone cool like Tony Hawk or Batman , showing kids the reality of the workplace just seems outright cruel .
Cubicles , meetings , TPS reports -- I mean really , while you 're at it , why not just crush all of their hopes and dreams and tell them that Santa Claus died in a mid-air collision with the Tooth Fairy , the Easter Bunny was run over while trying to save the world 's last candy factory , and that there would never be any birthday parties ever again .
It 's practically the same thing .
Apparently , not everyone shares my point of view .
At least one day each year , I notice kids all over the place , from standing behind the counter at the jeweler 's to playing in a corner of the executive 's office .
Some organizations , such as Robert R's , even formalize the whole thing , giving presentations about what mommy 's employer does and taking the sons and daughters on a guided tour of the workplace .
Thinking about the workplace from a child 's perspective , the only places that might actually be fun to visit would be the elevators , the vending machines , and possibly the data center .
Robert 's employer must have agreed , as they made sure to include all of those places and many more in their annual children 's tour of the facility .
Imagine how exciting a modern data center like the one at Robert 's organization would be for a child .
Bright lights , multiple backup UPS systems , redundant AC units , and a very powerful generator out back to ensure there can never be an outage .
Several giant systems housing multi- terabyte storage arrays , four huge IBM P695's , and a few hundred other servers .
Super high tech security to restrict physical access to the datacenter and a round - the - clock staff of fourteen administrators to lord over it all .
I 'm sure quite a few of you were getting excited just thinking about all that .
Really , could there be a more awesome place to take the kiddies to see what millions of dollars of computer equipment looks like ?
The CIO , a big fan of Take - Your - Child - To - Work Day , would give a fun presentation on how much computing power the organization required and then lead the kids on a tour of the data center .
They loved it , and there were never any real problems .
Well , until that one year when one little tyke could n't resist the temptation of The Big Red Button .
Yes , I realize how cliché The Big Red Button is , but that 's IBM 's doing .
When building the P695 , they must not have considered how tempting it would be press a Big Red Button on the front of the case , even if the button was an instant kill - switch to shut off the server .
Needless to say , the twenty - five virtual partitions on the machine , including the critical accounting system , all oracle databases , and the payroll system , all went down very hard and very fast .
Normally , that would n't usually be such a critical problem , but at the time , they were in the process of reconfiguring their high availability system , which meant that there was no fail over .
In total , it took three milliseconds for the kid to run over and push the Big Red Button , and over seventy - two hours for the system administrators to fully restore the virtual systems to their previous states from backup .
There have been a few changes since that fateful day .
Although the CIO still gives his presentation on the computing power , the data center is no longer open for tours .
And The Big Red Button -- it 's still there , encased in plexiglass should anyone else have the temptation to press it again .
Important Note : According to the Ubuntu Help :
Please note – this method is much less reliable .
If you use this method , you MUST be prepared to fix problems manually , such as packages being unexpectedly removed .
Using Update Manager is likely to be much less problematic .
Before you read this HowTo , you may want to consider installing using the GUI with Update Manager , which is probably a simpler method for regular users .
If you are a power user , then let ’s move on .
First , we ’ll need to install ubuntu - desktop if it ’s not already installed because otherwise there will be a dependencies problem .
sudo apt - get install ubuntu- desktop
Now we ’ll need to run a command that will change all the occurrences of dapper to edgy in our sources .
list file .
If you are n’t familiar , sources .
list is the file that points to your list of possible upgrades and packages .
For windows users , you can think of it as the file that points to Windows Update .
Of course , if you are a windows user , you should really install with the Update Manager utility linked above .
sudo sed -e ‘s / \sdapper / edgy / g’ - i /etc/apt/sources.list
Now we ’ll perform the actual upgrades :
sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get dist - upgrade
The && part of the command means that the second command will run after the first as long as the first command completes successfully .
Now we ’ll finish up the upgrade with a few more commands :
sudo apt - get -f install sudo dpkg –configure -a
Note that the –configure is actually two dashes .
For some reason WordPress makes it look like a single dash .
Reboot , and you are all done !
Note : I ’ve seen some notes that this upgrade does n’t work very well for people running Ubuntu as a Guest in VMWare with VMWare tools installed .
I tested it out and came to the same conclusion , no fix as of yet .
Update :
If upgrading gives you the error message “ failed to load module GLcore ” , you will want to run these commands .

Every Sunday morning when I was 12 , I would listen to Casey Kasem on KQEO and write down a list of any new or upcoming songs .
Then I would take my weekly allowance of $ 5 straight to the record store and spend it on 45s .
They were a dollar each .
Eventually I had a pretty good collection of , um , maybe 100 records , which my mother is now begging me to throw out .
What I never imagined is that when I grew up , I ’d be able to expand my record collection to about 2,500,000 songs for just under $ 10 a month .
I ’ve been subscribing to Rhapsody ( formerly Listen.com , now owned by Real ) for the last four years or so , and it ’s a great way to listen to music at the computer .
But laptops have lousy speakers , and I had been looking for a way to pump the music from the computer into other rooms of the house , so last January I finally got a Sonos system , which is probably the coolest piece of technology I ’ve ever bought .
Ever .
It ’s kind of a confusing system–a combination between a stereo and a computer and a wifi network–so let me explain a bit how it works .
First , you get some ZonePlayers : one for each room where you want music .
There are two kinds of ZonePlayers .
The big one has its own amplifier .
You just plug speakers into it .
The little one does n’t have an amplifier .
You plug it in as an aux input on an existing stereo system .
You can get up to 32 of these .
I bought three : one in the living room , one in the kitchen , and one in a bathroom .
Usually , you put one of the ZonePlayers near your computer and connect it with an ethernet connection to your network ; all the other ZonePlayers magically find each other using WiFi , so you do n’t have to connect anything .
It really is magical .
The ease of configuration and setup is astonishing .
It ’s about ten times easier than installing a printer .
It ’s fifty times easier than getting Bluetooth to work .
The Sonos developers obviously put a huge amount of work into making setup and configuration completely painless .
Next , you get one ( or more ) handheld controllers .
These also use WiFi , and they also find the rest of the system pretty much automatically .
They have a terrific user interface , an iPod - like thumbwheel , a big bright LCD color screen , and all kinds of brilliant UI touches .
For example , to save batteries , the screen dims when you put it down , but if you pick it up again , a motion detector lights up the screen .
Finally , you can install the controller software on any home computers you have : Windows or Mac .
This is a desktop application that more or less behaves exactly like the handheld controllers .
Now you pick up any of the controllers anywhere in the house , tell it what rooms you want to control , and browse through your music collection .
You can play any music files stored on any attached computer : MP3s , WMAs , AACs , OGGs , etc .
You can play internet radio stations –I use this to listen to Seattle ’s NPR station to hear All Things Considered three hours later than I can get it in New York .
If you want to play music from an iPod , an old vinyl turntable , or an eight track tape player , just plug it into the back of any ZonePlayer .
And , in the ultimate coolness , if you get a subscription to Rhapsody Unlimited , you can browse and play any of Rhapsody ’s 2,500,000 songs anywhere in your house .
So now if one of my guests is complaining about the music , I hand them the controller , and they browse around for something they like and play that instead .
The one thing I ca n’t stop talking about is what a nice job Sonos has done with the user interface .
This really is a zero- configuration system .
Everything is easy .
A long time ago I wrote : “ Every time you provide an option , you ’re asking the user to make a decision .
That means they will have to think about something and decide about it . ”
Users do n’t want to decide if the WiFi network should use WEP or WPA .
They do want to decide whether to listen to the Big Mountain version of Baby , I Love Your Way or the Peter Frampton version .
Or one of the ten other versions Rhapsody has online ( check out Mig Ayesa ’s ) .
No extra charge .
Geek Stuff
I asked Nick Millington , the Director of Software Engineering at Sonos , to tell me a little bit about the software development environment .
It turns out the controller and the ZonePlayers are running Linux .
“ We started with a standard Linux kernel , ” he told me , “ then added some of our own device drivers for audio , our buttons , scroll wheel , and other controls , and networking ( the latter employing strict Office Hungarian in its source code I might add , in possibly a ‘ first ’ for Linux kernel modules ) . ”
More from Nick : “ All of our applications use a shared code layer written in C++ for their basic network communications protocol stack .
The controller applications share a ‘ household ’ data model that manages knowledge of the set of ZonePlayers that you own , how they are linked together , what music is playing , and so forth .
Finally , there is a platform specific UI layer for each controller : a custom - built UI layer on the CR100 , a Win32 UI based on WTL ( Windows Template Library ) on Windows , and a Cocoa / Objective C UI layer on the Macintosh .
WTL and Cocoa have both worked out well for us .
WTL succeeds in taking away a lot of the drudgery of programming directly against the metal without hiding how Windows actually works to the point of being dangerous because developers forget how to fly without the autopilot .
Cocoa has been nice as well –I ’m sure everyone in the Mac world knows about this , but coming from Windows I found its approach to memory management ( where each pump of the message loop gets you effectively a fresh ‘ heap ’ that is automatically cleared when returning to the message loop ) pretty cool .
It allows you to actually write code that returns something like a string , without putting in place the overhead of a garbage collection scheme .
“ We use the de facto ‘ native ’ compilers for the platform we are building on ( gcc for Linux , MSVC for Windows , and the gcc that comes with Xcode on the Mac ) .
It has been relatively easy to keep our code portable across these 3 compilers , which we enforce by doing daily builds on all the platforms .
The build is all wrapped up into one nightly cron job that checks everything out of source control , kicks off the Linux builds , contacts the Windows and Mac build machines to do their part of the work , and waits for everything to finish up .
Then end product is an ‘ online update ’ package that gets posted directly to our intranet upgrade server and allows testers to install our daily builds on all the hardware in their test systems . ”
Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) , or roadside bombs , are the insurgents ' preferred method of attacking coalition troops .
Senior US General John Abizaid says they are the " single greatest source of our casualties and remain the enemy 's most effective weapon " .
According to sources quoted by the New York Times , the number of roadside bombs rose in July to the highest monthly total of the war .
' DAISY CHAIN ' IED AMBUSH SCENARIO IEDs are used in a range of scenarios by insurgents .
This graphic shows one method employed against coalition forces .

IEDs killed 427 American soldiers in Iraq in 2005 , and 227 this year , according to the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count website .
Research analyst Francois Boo , of GlobalSecurity.org , says insurgents are skilled at developing more sophisticated and more powerful devices as US troops improve their tactics to deal with them .
They are the perfect asymmetric weapon - cheap , effective , and anonymous
US General John Abizaid
Many are made from leftover munitions and explosive materials .
New technology and tactics are available to bomb - makers on the internet .
The US says sophisticated bomb - making material from Iran has been found in IEDs in Iraq .
Infrared devices - set off as a vehicle breaks the beam , like a burglar alarm - are believed to have been a response to US troops using equipment to jam devices triggered by mobile phones and other types of transmitters .
' No silver bullet '
Other tactics range from burying IEDs in roadside verges to disguising them in plaster of Paris , rubbish or dead animals .
Bridges and underpasses on Iraq 's roads provide places to plant devices .
Without an end to the insurgency and a political solution on the ground the IED threat is going to remain
Francois Boo
GlobalSecurity.org
In some circumstances , a moving bus or lorry has been used to slow military convoys alongside a series of planted devices , maximising the damage on detonation .
Patrols also face the threat of vehicles - everything from cars and lorries to donkey carts and ambulances - loaded with explosives and being used in attacks .
Two years ago , many attacks on coalition troops started with a roadside bomb - followed by insurgents opening fire on the crippled vehicle or convoy .
Subsequently , the bombs have often been used as the main element of the attack .
The US military is investing millions of dollars in combating IEDs .
Efforts have included improving armoured protection for vehicles and troops and better communication about new insurgent methods .
The US says it is producing results , with nearly half of IEDs found and disabled before they can be detonated .
In the six months before March 2006 , coalition forces found and cleared nearly 4,000 IEDs , uncovered more than 1,800 weapons caches and bomb - making plants , and killed or detained hundreds of insurgent fighters and bomb - makers .
Iraqi civilians , who already have to live with the threat of suicide bombers , are now becoming victims of IEDs .
Mr Boo says this is partly a result of the coalition troops ' increased vigilance and partly due to a change in strategy by the insurgents .
Ten civilians died and 69 were wounded when two roadside bombs detonated in a busy market in the al - Shurja district of Baghdad on 8 August .
A few days earlier , a bus carrying at least 23 Iraqi soldiers was destroyed by a roadside bomb on the road between Tikrit and Baiji .
There is no technical " silver bullet " to end the threat , says Mr Boo .
" Without an end to the insurgency and a political solution on the ground the IED threat is going to remain .
It can only be mitigated . "
Less than three years after emerging from nowhere , the hot social networking website MySpace is on pace to be worth a whopping $ 15 billion in just three more years .
Or is it ?
Is the much smaller Facebook , run by a 22 - year - old , really worth the $ 900 million or more Yahoo is reported to have offered for it ?
Maybe .
Or maybe this is Dot -Com Bubble , Part II , with MySpace , Facebook , YouTube and the other new Internet phenoms destined for oblivion when the fad fades .
“ What makes this hard is that these companies seem to be so many years away from the kind of earnings that the valuation numbers are forecasting for them , ” says Andrew Metrick , finance professor at Wharton .
The $ 15 billion MySpace figure “ would imply that a lot more people will be on MySpace than are currently on it . ”
While the social networking sites vary considerably , each relies heavily on content provided by users who can post personal profiles and build networks among friends and others with shared interests .
For the most part , these users have free access and the sites are funded with advertising revenue .
To lure advertisers , young sites typically offer deep discounts that make profitability elusive , and it is unclear when they will be able to push ad rates higher , if ever .
The problem , as Wharton accounting professor Robert W. Holthausen sees it , is a dearth of information to plug into the standard valuation models .
“ You have little data on what kind of revenues they can generate and what their cost structure is . ”
Valuing advertising - driven sites is particularly hard because the same numbers — such as the number of users or page views — can mean different things depending on how the advertisers are billed , Holthausen adds .
“ How often do they get paid for that advertising ?
Is it just when the advertisement appears ?
Or does there have to be a click through ? ”
Similarly , not every user has the same value .
That depends on how much the typical user is likely to spend and what he or she is likely to buy .
Finally , Holthausen notes , a site will be more valuable if it uses a proprietary technology than if it simply offers services competitors can easily duplicate .
The $ 15 billion MySpace prediction was issued late in September by RBC Capital analyst Jordan Rohan , fresh from a meeting with Fox Interactive , the News Corp. unit that acquired MySpace ’s parent company , Intermix Media , about a year ago for a then - astounding $ 580 million .
Rohan cited MySpace ’s phenomenal growth .
It now has more than 90 million active users , twice as many as a year earlier , making it a magnet for advertisers .
It recently signed a deal with Google to display search results and sponsored advertising links in exchange for $ 900 million over three years .
In setting the $ 15 billion forecast , Rohan pointed to Google , which also relies on ad revenue , and which has a market capitalization of $ 120 billion .
But is Google a good benchmark ?
Google is without question the premier Internet search service , while MySpace is one of a number of competitors scrambling for market share in a new industry .
Google has a proven track record of profitability , while MySpace does not .
Moreover , even Google ’s $ 120 billion market cap may reflect some irrational exuberance , making it a misleading model .
Its shares sell for about 55 times annual earnings , roughly triple the price - to - earnings ratio of the average Standard & Poor ’s 500 company .
Using the same 55 - times - earnings figure , MySpace would need about $ 270 million in annual profit to justify a $ 15 billion value .
Can it do that in three years , given it is expected to generate only about $ 200 million in revenue this year ?
It looks like a reach .
Consider some of the figures bandied about for Facebook .
Last January , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , now 22 , reportedly turned down a $ 750 million offer from Viacom , holding out for $ 2 billion , according to news accounts .
This fall he is said to be mulling over a $ 900 million offer from Yahoo .
Those are big numbers considering that the business , started early in 2004 , has a modest nine million users and is believed to have annual revenue of around $ 50 million , though some experts expect that to double soon .
If Facebook were valued at 55 times earnings , it would need a $ 16 million profit to justify a $ 900 million price .
“ Discounted Cash Flow ”
Still , there are sure to be some winners in social networking , and sites that are already pulling in significant revenue must certainly have an edge over the dozens of lesser - known competitors .
“ That ’s a lot of revenue , ” Metrick says , noting that this distinguishes Facebook from the dot - com bubble firms .
“ There were a lot of Internet companies in 1999 that had no revenue … .
That kind of [ $ 900 million valuation ] does n’t seem so crazy if you believe there is a lot of growth built in . ”
But , he adds , “ There are a whole lot of examples of firms like Netscape which grew — and then eventually lost . ”
The market - capitalization method of valuation is typically used with a public company — a free standing entity that sells stock to the public .
And it ’s best for stating a current value rather than a future one .
Analysts also like to factor in a company ’s future prospects , using any number of calculations to derive a figure for “ discounted cash flow . ”
Essentially , they look at expected revenues over a given number of years and subtract expenses to arrive at a figure for “ free cash flow . ”
Then , using various assumptions about interest rates , they determine what money received in the future is worth in today ’s terms .
Analysts can never be sure about any company ’s future revenues and expenses , but the problem is even worse when dealing with a young company in a fledgling industry .
The assumptions used in any valuation model are ideally based on experience of at least six or seven competitors , Metrick says .
But there is no good peer data in the new social networking business .
With older industries , analysts often value a company on some ratio , such as a multiple of revenues .
“ But the problem is you are assuming the valuations put on these are rational , ” says Holthausen , arguing that expectations for new industries are often not rational .
During the dot - com bubble , some companies that did have substantial revenues were valued far beyond what any standard analysis would say they were worth , he adds .
“ You totally had to suspend belief . ”
After the bubble burst , valuing the survivors did become more sensible , and some are assessed fairly easily with standard approaches , according to Wharton marketing professor Peter Fader .
That ’s especially true of publicly traded companies involved in ordinary commerce , such as bookseller Amazon.com and auction site eBay .
Their stocks trade at 45 and 39 times earnings , respectively .
“ You ’re not going to see an Amazon being overvalued like [ Internet stocks ] used to be , ” he says , “ but these social network sites are the Wild West .
This is an area where it has been notoriously fickle .
It ’s not like search engines , where you can really compare them on objective criteria , ” he suggests , referring to established players like Google and Yahoo .
Among the unknowns :
How well can social networking sites hold on to their users ?
One player , Friendster , burst onto the scene a few years ago , then largely deflated .
On the other hand , users go to considerable trouble to upload information and images to these sites , and to establish elaborate networks of friends for electronic sharing .
They are not likely to abandon all that effort as casually as they would switch from one online bookseller to another .
“ It does seem to me there is some stickiness to the model , ” Holthausen says .
Networks Based around Products
Metrick believes social networking sites will not be a passing fad .
But there ’s no guarantee that MySpace , Facebook or any of the other current players will be the big winners in the end .
Fader , too , believes social networking is here to stay , but he thinks it may work best not as a freestanding function but as an additional feature on sites that draw users for other reasons .
Hence , the winners may turn out to be other sites that adopt social networking features .
Or they may be new players , or current networking sites that broaden their offerings .
Many sites may ultimately be acquired in the way MySpace was bought by publicly traded News Corp. , the enormous multi-national media company run by Rupert Murdoch .
Part of the News Corp. strategy is to let advertisers link users into networks based around products , such as movies or music groups .
More than a million bands have profiles on MySpace , for example .
If MySpace becomes the model , social networking sites will be quite different from the classic dot - com bubble companies which tried to cash in big by going public while staying independent .
The risks are not the same when an iffy venture is part of something bigger , says John R. Percival , adjunct professor of finance at Wharton .
“ This is kind of like the oil and gas business .
The risk might not be as great as you think , and a high valuation might be justified . ”
A small , independent oil driller faces a huge risk in drilling a new hole , which may be dry , he says .
Compared to that , risks from changing oil prices and demand are relatively small .
But the situation is reversed when the driller is part of a bigger enterprise that drills many wells .
A dry hole here and there does n’t matter , but changes in oil prices and demand do .
Social networking sites may be risky for their founders and the venture capital firms that fund them in the early years , but they do n’t appear to be pumping huge amounts of risk to the marketplace the way tech firms did in the late 1990s .
“ If you have a little bit of money invested in this and you ’re already invested in other things , ” says Percival , “ frankly the risk is not as big as you think . ”
Recalling the first dot - com bubble six years ago , Fader notes , “ We all look back and laugh and say we will not go through that exercise again , but this could easily be a case of history repeating itself . ”
The business side of research and development in regenerative medicine is in growth mode these days , with young companies starting up and expanding even in more highly regulated areas of the world - which should tell you just how great the potential benefits ( and therefore financial rewards ) are .
A couple of articles on British companies caught my eye today :
Stem cell firm on growth fast - track :
Stem cell specialist NovaThera is pursuing a strategy of ‘ organic growth , ’ with plans to double its Cambridge workforce , build a new manufacturing plant and raise a sizable venture capital round ...
The field of tissue engineering brings together the scientific disciplines of biology , materials science and biomedical engineering directed towards the long term repair and replacement of failing human tissues and organs .
Most obviously the ability to repair or replace tissue that has degenerated addresses directly a wide range of ailments and diseases associated with the aging process from hair loss to renewed joint replacements and even damage to the lungs , an area in which NovThera specialises .
ReNeuron seeks to begin stem cell stroke trials :
ReNeuron Group PLC unveiled narrower interim losses and confirmed it has asked for permission to begin clinical trials of its experimental treatment for chronic disability caused by stroke , the first time the therapy will be studied in humans .
The filing , with US regulators the Food and Drug Administration , is a key step for the AIM - listed company , and will be the first therapy developed by ReNeuron to reach the clinic .
The British company believes the trials will be the world 's first application of a neural stem cell treatment for a major neurological disorder .
This is just the tip of the iceberg , and what fell out of the search engines today .
Tens of thousands of scientists and medical engineers are working away at the medicine of the 2010s as you are reading this , developing ways to manipulate your body into replacing tissues damaged by aging , disease and accident .

Robert Recorde invents the equals sign
I mentioned recently that the integral sign is actually a letter " S " , chosen by Leibnitz because it was the first letter of the word " sum " .
Seth David Schoen suggested that Leibnitz probably wrote in Latin , so that it is actually the first letter of the word " summa " , which means " sum " in Latin .
I do not know , but I will see if I can track down the original paper .
I once gave a conference talk about how it was a good idea to go dig up original materials , and why .
Someday I may write a blog article about this .
One of the best reasons is that these materials are the original materials because they are the ones that are so brilliant and penetrating and incisive that they inspired other people to follow them .
So I thought it might be fun to read Leibnitz 's original papers and see what I might find out that I did not already know .
Also , there is an element of touristry in it : I would like to gaze upon the world 's first use of the integral sign with my own eyes , in the same way that I would like to gaze on the Grand Canyon with my own eyes .
The trip to the library is a lot more convenient , this month .
Anyway , this sparked a discussion with M. Schoen about original mathematic manuscripts , and he mentioned to me that he had seen the page of Robert Recorde 's The Whetstone of Witte that contains the world 's first use , in 1557 , of the equals sign .
He had a scan of this handy ; I have extracted the relevant portion of the page , and here it is :
Here is a transcription , in case you find the font difficult to decipher : Howbeit , for easie alteration of equations .
I will propounde a fewe exanples , bicause the extraction of their rootes , maie the more aptly bee wroughte .
And to avoide the tediouse repetition of these woordes : is equalle to : I will sette as I doe often in woorke use , a pair of paralleles , or Gemowe lines of one lengthe , thus : ===== , bicause noe .2 . thynges , can be moare equalle .
If you are still having trouble reading this , try reading it aloud .
The only tricky things are the spelling and the word " Gemowe " .
Reading aloud will solve the spelling problem .
" Gemowe " means " twin " , like in the astrological sign of Gemini .
( I had to look this up in the big dictionary . )
Reading 16th - century books takes a little time to get used to , but once you know the tricks , it is surprisingly easy , given how uncouth they appear at first look .
I must say , compared with the writing of the Baroque period , which just goes on and on and on , this is extremely concise and to the point .
It does not read all that differently from modern technical material .
One reason I like to visit original documents is that I never know what I am going to find .
If you visit someone else 's account of the documents , you can only learn a subset of whatever that person happened to notice and think was important .
This time I learned something surprising .
I knew that the German " umlaut " symbol was originally a small letter " e " .
A word like schön ( " beautiful " ) was originally spelled schoen , and then was written as schon with a tiny " e " over the " o " , and eventually the tiny " e " dwindled away to nothing but two dots .
I have a German book printed around 1800 in which the little " e"s are quite distinct .
And I had recently learned that the twiddle in the Spanish ñ character was similarly a letter " n " .
A word like " año " was originally " anno " ( as it is in Latin ) and the second " n " was later abbreviated to a diacritic over the first " n " .
( This makes a nice counterpoint to the fact that the mathematical logical negation symbol $ $ \sim$ $ was selected because of its resemblance to the letter " N " . )
But I had no idea that anything of the sort was ever done in English .
Recorde 's book shows clearly that it was , at least for a time .
The short passage illustrated above contains two examples .
One is the word " examples " itself , which is written " exãples " , with a tilde over the " a " .
The other is " alteration " , which is written " alteratiõ " , with a tilde over the " o " .
More examples abound : " cõpendiousnesse " , " nõbers " , " denominatiõ " , and , I think , " reme~ber " .
( The print is unclear . )
I had never seen this done before in English .
I will investigate further and see what I can find out .
Would I have learned about this if I had n't returned to the original document ?
Unlikely .
Here 's another interesting fact about this book :
It coined the bizarre word " zenzizenzizenzike " , which , of all the words in the big dictionary , is the one with the most " z " s. Recorde uses the word " zenzike " to refer to the square of a number , or to a term in an expression with a square power .
" Zenzizenzike " is similarly a fourth power , and " zenzizenzizenzike " an eighth power .
I uploaded a scan of the relevant pages to Wikipedia , where you can see them ; the word appears at the very top of the right - hand page .
That page also contains the delightful phrase " zzzz Betokeneth a Square of squares , squaredly squared . "
Squares , squares , squares , squares , squares , squares , squares , baked beans , squares , squares , squares , and squares !

Sweden 's Pirate Party was optimistic about its chances leading up to yesterday 's general election , but the results are in and it does n't look good for the upstart political movement .
Under current election procedures , you need at least 4 percent of the national votes or 12 percent in any one electoral district to qualify for a parliamentary seat , and the Pirate Party came up short with only 0.6 percent of the national vote .
Four districts gave the party more than a 1 percent share , but none of those tallies exceeded 2 percent .
Just days before the election , Pirate Party press releases said that the party was " stronger than ever , " that the party had more members than three of the largest alternative parties combined , and that it should snag at least a 5 percent national share .
As vote counts roll in today , 4,810 votes cast for the party ( links to material in Swedish ) placed it firmly on a benchwarmer 's seat , behind one of the parties it dissed last week , and below the total of 12,577 blank votes cast .
The 822 districts counted at the time of writing was enough for Prime Minister Göran Persson to tender his resignation .
More on that later .
It 's unfortunate to see the party fall short of its goals , and party leaders are placing some of the blame on unfair procedures .
" We have received reports of voters who were told that blank ballots will become invalid if anything is written on them , " says Pirate Party leader Rickard Falkvinge .
" We saw reports of election officials who moved ballots for all non-parliament parties to a spot outside the polling place .
Unfortunately , overall reports point to obvious problems with democratic election procedures . "
Writing in your own candidate or party on a blank ballot does not , in fact , invalidate the vote .
Sour grapes or legitimate complaints ?
I 'm sure there will be formal complaints and official investigations to settle that question .
In the bigger picture , Sweden is in for some changes .
The moderately leftist Social Democratic Party has ruled the country alone or in coalitions continuously since 1994 , and only 9 years since 1930 have seen a right - wing Prime Minister .
The right - wing coalition swept the board this time , and the Social Democrats turned in their weakest election in decades .
Election turnout came in a 80.13 percent , up 0.95 percentage points from four years ago , and leaving the " record - setting " 60.7 percent of the 2004 US general election in the dust .
Continuing an age - old tradition , variations of the Donald Duck Party got 10 votes .
Prosecutor : New Jersey boys ' deaths accidental Bodies of missing boys found late Friday in car trunk YOUR E- MAIL ALERTS Police New Jersey or or Create Your Own CAMDEN , New Jersey ( CNN ) -- Autopsy results show three boys found dead in a car trunk suffocated , and their deaths have been ruled accidental , Camden County Prosecutor Vincent Sarubbi said Saturday .
Sarubbi said there were no signs of foul play in the deaths of 11 - year - old Anibal Cruz , 6 - year - old Daniel Agosto and 5 - year - old Jesstin Pagan , which he called a " horrible , tragic and unexplainable incident . "
At least one of the children , he said , had a history of playing in the car , and investigators believe the three boys climbed into the trunk themselves .
The trunk 's lid closed automatically , Sarubbi said .
Authorities believe the children had been in the trunk since about 5 p.m.
Wednesday night , when they were last seen playing in a side yard of the home where Cruz lived .
Questions were raised about why police officers and others conducting a massive search for the children checked the vehicle but apparently did not open the trunk .
A panel will be appointed to investigate those questions and issue a report within 30 days , Sarubbi said at a news conference .
Also speaking at the Saturday news conference , Camden Police Chief Edwin Figueroa said if investigators had checked the trunk when they were first called in , the children might have survived .
" It 's premature to determine what mistakes were made , if any mistakes were made , " said Figueroa .
" Let me just tell you , I feel very bad , just like the community and other police officers , that three children were found in the trunk of a vehicle , " he said .
" I think that alone is a tragic situation .
We certainly feel for the parents , who are right now grieving for those small children . "
He added , " I can't guess what kind of speculation or what went on in the individual minds of police officers that were out there .
" Elba Cruz , Anibal 's mother , has said she left the three children playing in the yard while she went inside for five to 10 minutes to cook dinner .
When she returned , they were gone .
The car was parked just in a shady area about 30 yards from the back of the Cruz home .
Sarubbi said he could not explain how , if the children tried to call out for help , no one heard them .
Sarubbi said he did not know how long the children could have survived in the trunk , adding that the medical examiner listed the boys ' time of death as unknown .
" We may never know the answer , " he said .
The medical examiner may issue a more extensive report later addressing the issue , he said .
The car , which belonged to Elba Cruz 's mother , Carmen Lopez , was not operational because of a brake problem , Sarubbi said .
It had last been driven about three weeks ago .
The older - model maroon Toyota Camry did not have a mechanism that allowed the trunk lid to stay open independently when raised , Sarubbi said .
" When the children got in the trunk , there was no automatic means to hold the trunk lid open ...
In all likelihood , it locked . "
Investigators examining the car had to use two - by - fours to prop the lid open , he said .
A bag of cement was on one side of the trunk and had broken open , spilling the substance onto the children .
Sarubbi would not say whether there were any signs that the boys had tried to escape .
He said out of concern for the children 's families he did not want to go into detail .
The car 's rear seats did flip down to allow trunk access , but the seats were locked , he said , and there was no indication the boys had tried to get out that way .
The boys ' bodies were found Friday night , when a relative opened the trunk looking for jumper cables to use on his own car battery , Sarubbi said .
The father of one of the children , who was standing behind the car when the relative pulled the latch from inside the car , jumped away screaming and sobbing after the grim discovery .
Asked about a onetime person of interest in the case , Sarubbi would not disclose why police wanted to talk with the man but said that obviously , his involvement had been ruled out .

It 's been the curse of the USS Enterprise and the Klingons ' favoured weapon .
But back on Earth , mathematicians claim to have worked out how to make a cloaking device to render objects invisible .
An outline for the device is described in a scientific paper published today in which the authors reveal how objects placed close to a material called a superlens appear to vanish .
Even in the world of science fiction , the technology is not perfect , and nor is the device proposed by Graeme Milton at Utah University and Nicolae - Alexandru Nicorovici at Sydney University of Technology .
According to their calculations , the device would only work at certain frequencies of light , and only if the object is within close range of the superlens .
The cloaking device relies on recently discovered materials used to make superlenses that make light behave in a highly unusual way .
Instead of having a positive refractive index - the property which makes light bend as it passes through a prism or water - the materials have a negative refractive index , which effectively makes light travel backwards .
It 's light , but not as we know it .
Prof Milton 's team calculated that when certain objects are placed next to superlenses , the light bouncing off them is essentially erased by light reflecting off the superlens , making the object invisible .
The calculations show that while the device could be used to obscure almost any shape of object , it only works over a short range of wavelengths , so if used to hide objects from human vision , they might only partially disappear .
Sir John Pendry , a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London who invented superlenses , said : " Effectively , they are making a piece of space seem to disappear , at least as far as light is concerned . "
The research appears in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society today .
Prof Pendry said the technology has great potential for hiding objects from radar or cloaking electronic instruments so they can be used in strong electromagnetic fields , such as those produced by hospital MRI brain scanners .
" The secret is having the cloak itself be invisible and if you can do that cheaply and efficiently and it does n't need to be metres thick , it would be extremely valuable for stealth .
Even if you could cloak a single frequency , it would be very useful .
The military is extremely interested in this . "
So far the researchers have only worked through the mathematics to prove that the device is plausible .
The practicalities of making one have yet to be solved .
Over the last ten years or so , a new metaphor for saving data has slowly developed in some applications such as iTunes , Apple ’s Address Book , iCal , and Eudora : the automatically saved document .
In this model , the user rarely even sees the document as such .
They simply open the program , enter new data , and close the program .
There is neither an explicit open nor save step .
They do not distinguish between the program and its documents .
Mostly this metaphor appears in programs that are effectively small databases .
That ’s probably not a coincidence .
In databases , it ’s customary to commit data per entry rather than per file .
Another characteristic of most of these programs is that there ’s one default file / database that any given user uses most of the time .
You can switch to a different address book / mailbox / calendar if you like , but in practice we rarely do that .
We almost always work with one master database which is , if necessary , subdivided into categories by tagging individual entries .
The complete version of this interface metaphor does n’t fit all programs .
For instance , a typical user can easily have thousands of different word processor documents and may work on dozens in a single day .
Here the choice of document to edit needs to be upfront and center .
However , perhaps some improvements can be made .
For instance , the program could remember which documents were open when the application last quit , and reopen them automatically .
Even more importantly , saving should be automatic .
Why do we have to save and then close ?
Why not just close the document ?
Why is there a save step at all ?
Some may object that the user might not want to save the document ; they might wish to discard the changes .
OK .
That ’s possible , but it ’s not what they want to do most of the time .
This is , in fact backwards .
Probably 90 % + of the time the user wants to save the changes .
We should make that the default .
The user should have to take a special action to avoid saving changes , since they ’re very rarely going to want to do that .
Probably the action they should take is merely Undo .
Or there could be a “ Rollback ” command somewhere in the menus to revert the state of the document to when it was last opened ; but either way failure to save is not a substitute for undo .
To truly understand how much of an improvement this simple approach is , you have to try using such a program for a couple of days and then switch back to a more classic document based program .
The reverse transition is jarring .
For instance , one program that should work this way and does n’t is the CiphSafe password manager .
Every time it reminds me that I have unsaved changes , I ’m jolted .
Simson Garfinkel ’s SBook address book is even worse .
Not only does it not save the changes unless you tell it to .
It does n’t even remind you that you have unsaved changes when you ’re closing a document .
It just silently throws away all your new entries !
Update : that seems to be a bug in one particular path through the application that I was testing .
It does confirm a close without save on most paths through the application ; but I still maintain that it should simply save everything as soon as an entry is modified or added , and never bother the user at all .
There is no reason users should have to worry about saving files .
Applications should save all data automatically .
When a document is closed , it ’s saved .
When it ’s opened all the changes are still there , just like when it was last closed ; and the user can pick right up where they left off .
It ’s not that hard to do this .
There ’s nothing stopping us from implementing this except habit .
Maybe there used to be a reason for File / Save but if there ever was , there is n’t any more .
Stop annoying users with pointless dialogs and start saving files .
March 2001 / Navigating Linux Source Code
Introduction
Like many programmers , Ive had to maintain and enhance very large software products not of my own creation .
( In my case , each of these products had at least 1.5 million lines of code . )
Frequently , the code was poorly documented and consisted of numerous interrelated programs whose source was distributed throughout a multitude of directories .
As is often the case with large , complex , multi-platform software systems , using an IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) , with its attendant conveniences , is not a realistic option .
Moreover , familiarizing yourself with such code bases is a daunting task in which even finding a function , type , or macro definition can be quite time consuming .
Fortunately , there are several open source tools available , all derivatives of the Unix ctags program , to assist you in understanding and navigating large software systems .
These tools include the original Unix ctags program , the ID Utilities , and the GLOBAL source code browser .
All of the tools are based on the concept of a tag .
A tag is an index entry within a tags file of a programming language identifier .
The tags indicate the locations ( in terms of file / line number pairs ) where the identifier is defined and referenced .
Programming language identifiers include functions , structure and union names , type names , and variable names ( essentially , anything that is entered into a compilers symbol table ) , as well as macros .
As an example of how tags are used , the ctags program ( which also parses source code files and generates a file of tags ) allows these identifiers to be quickly located while you are editing source code within a text editor .
For instance , if you re coding in the vi text editor and you need to see the prototype for a particular C function , the tags mechanism can immediately take you to it with a Ctrl -t keystroke .
While the GLOBAL , ID Utilities , and ctags programs are all built upon a tags core and are all designed to help you rapidly navigate source code , the circumstances under which each tool is best applied differ significantly .
Source code browsers such as GLOBAL , which map your source code to HTML , are most useful for an initial examination of existing code , whereas ctags and the ID Utilities are essential for your day - to - day programming work .
Ill begin by examining the Unix ctags program .
Using Tags
The Unix ctags command creates a tags file , which contains indexes of programming language identifiers .
These indexes specify the file / line number pairs that indicate where the identifiers are defined or referenced .
The tags file is used by the : tags vi editor commands to position the editors cursor on the objects definition within the appropriate file .
The ctags command may be used either at the colon prompt within vi or outside the editor from the shell command line .
( Note that tags may be used within EMACS and a variety of other popular editors for Linux , Unix , and Windows .
I use vi as a convenient and ubiquitous example . )
Creating the Tags File
When executing ctags from a Unix shell ( or MS - DOS ) command line , the current working directory should be a source code directory .
For example , to create a tags file for C source and header files on a Unix system , execute the following command : ctags -t *.c *.h.
Many versions of the ctags command support the -t option , which creates tag file entries for user - defined types .
You should always use this option when it is available .
The ctags command universally supports C files ( and usually Pascal and Fortran as well ) , but , with rare exceptions , C++ support is not available .
Fortunately , there are extended versions of ctags , notably Darren Hieberts Exuberant ctags , that support C++ , not to mention C , Fortran , Java , and even Eiffel .
For more information , please refer to the Exuberant ctags home page : http://home.hiwaay.net/~darren/ctags/.
Using Tags within the vi Editor
From within the vi editor , the command : tags identifier will position the editors cursor on the definition of the identifier , which may be either a function name or a user - defined type .
A more convenient method is to use the Ctrl-t key sequence from within the vi editors command mode .
Position the cursor on the first character of the identifier while in command mode ( not insert mode ) and press Ctrl-t .
Returning to your original location within the editor is just as important as moving to the definition of the identifier .
The : tags command ( or Ctrl -t key ) may transition the editor to an entirely new file , or it may reposition the cursor within the same file .
To return to the original file you were editing , use the :e # command .
To return to your original position within the same file , type :'' ( a colon followed by two single quotes ) .
As with any Unix command , the ctags command may be executed from within vi while in command mode by preceding the command with an exclamation mark , as in : :! ctags *.c .
The exclamation mark tells vi to create a shell and treat the command that follows as a shell command .
( Actually , the colon invokes ex , the editor upon which vi is built ) .
These simple vi commands can save you a great deal of time and trouble traversing your source code .
Fortunately , if you need to maintain legacy code on even the oldest of Unix workstations , ctags will most likely be present ( or you can obtain a version of ctags for that workstation ) .
Ive found it on every Unix platform Ive used .
Considering its ubiquity , utility , and longevity , I m surprised at how few programmers use ctags or are even aware of it .
While ctags is an excellent tool and well worth the brief time needed to learn it , the more recent ID Utilities , which may be thought of as an augmented ctags , offer you even more functionality and convenience .
Using the ID Utilities
The ID utilities ( ID stands for  Identifier ) are a set of text - search programs that query an ID database for tokens  such as C identifiers ( variables , functions , user - defined types ) , strings , and constant literals .
The ID database is a binary file that contains a list of tokens along with a list of files ( and line numbers within those files ) in which the tokens appear .
The ID database is essentially a tags file ; it implements a sparse matrix that associates file / line numbers with tokens .
The ID utilities are invaluable when you re searching your code base for type definitions , string literals , or references to variables and functions , particularly when the source files span many directories .
The search times are remarkably fast as well .
( The sizes of the source code bases Ive dealt with have precluded using the Unix find and grep commands in combination ; this approach is unacceptably slow . )
The ID Commands and Aliases
The ID Utilities include the following commands :
lid  queries the ID database for tokens and then reports matching filenames with matching lines .
fid  lists all tokens recorded in the database for given files or tokens common to two files .
fnid  matches the filenames in the database , rather than the tokens .
The following very useful aliases are also provided :
gid  an alias for ' lid - R grep ' , lists all lines containing the requested pattern .
aid  an alias for ' lid - ils ' , treats the requested pattern as a case - insensitive literal substring .
eid  an alias for ' lid - R edit ' , invokes an editor on all files containing the requested pattern and , if possible , initiates a text search for that pattern .
The three commands Ive found to be indispensable are gid , lid , and fnid .
The gid Alias
The most useful of the ID Utility commands is gid .
Lets say that you re interested in finding all uses of the INXl_pg_typ user - defined type .
Executing the command gid INXl_pg_typ will produce a list of files ( with line numbers ) and the text of the source line where INXl_pg_typ appears .
A sample output line is show below :
/rcs_source/INXl_tabmaint.c:297 : INXl_pg_typ * gp ;
The lid Command
The most versatile of the ID Utility commands is lid .
The lid commands many options ( from which the gid alias is derived ) will be displayed when the -- help argument is used ( note that two dashes are used ) .
( The -- help option may be used with the other ID Utility commands as well . )
An extremely useful option to lid is -l , which interprets a specified pattern as a literal string .
Suppose you want to find all uses of the string " doc " .
The lid -l doc command will produce output similar to the following :
doc/rcs_source/rdb/inc/RDB.h /rcs_source/rdb/inc/retrieve.h
The specified string is followed by several entries indicating the files where it occurs .
Other options to lid allow the use of regular expressions , the matching of decimal or hex numbers , and finding identifiers based on the frequency of their use .
The fnid Command
The fnid command locates the subdirectory where a source file can be found .
For example , the command fnid docimport .c returns / rcs_source / os/ docimport / src/docimport .c indicating that the file docimport.c is located in the os subsystem in its own subdirectory of my source code tree .
This command is extremely fast .
Using the find command and piping it to grep to accomplish this is unacceptably slow for large code bases , but fnid does the job quite handily .
Setting up the ID Utilities
Installing the ID Utilities on Linux and Unix platforms is accomplished by running a configuration script and then executing the command make install , a procedure common to many shareware programs .
The ID database is built by invoking the remarkably fast mkid command .
The mkid command should be scheduled as a cron job to regularly update the ID database during off periods .
( The ID Utilities have been ported to Windows NT , but they are not yet readily available at the time of writing . )
The ID Utilities include scanners for C and C++ and provide support for lex and yacc .
A scanner for assembly language files is also provided .
You may also define your own language scanners .
The rules for mapping scanners to filename extensions are defined in the file id - lang .map , allowing the appropriate scanner to be invoked for files with non-standard extensions .
( All of the legacy systems Ive worked on have used non-standard extensions for header files devoted to specific purposes .
For example , .defs has frequently been used to denote header files containing type and macro definitions . )
The ID Utilities are an indispensable part of my programming toolkit .
The speed and versatility of the ID Utility programs make them ideal for large legacy systems , where they supplement ( and largely supplant ) ctags and outperform the grep and find programs .
Ive found using the ID Utilities ( and ctags ) much more convenient than the pull - down menus of an IDE to access function references or definitions .
The ID Utilities are available from www.gnu.org.
Familiarizing yourself with the source code of a large legacy system can be overwhelming .
Both ctags and the ID Utilities can assist you in doing this , but more suitable tags - based tools are available .
Source code browsers that map your code to HTML using an underlying tags mechanism are ideal for this task .
Source Code Browsers
There are many source code browsers available that convert source code to HTML and use a tags - like system to create hyperlinks between the use and definition of identifiers .
Within the generated HTML , a declaration involving a user - defined type will be linked to its definition in , for example , a header file .
These tools are extremely valuable when you are first familiarizing yourself with a large code base .
They usually display the source code in a manner similar to that of a context sensitive editor , with keywords highlighted in bold , comments and strings displayed in different colors , and so on .
GLOBAL
An excellent example of a tags - based source code browser is GLOBAL .
GLOBAL has been used to generate source code in HTML form ( suitable for standard web browsers ) for both the Linux and FreeBSD operating systems  C sources .
Figure 1 shows the main index page that GLOBAL created for Linux version 2.0.35 , displayed in the Netscape browser .
It indicates the files that contain main functions ( and thus , the files that are top - level files for various executable programs ) .
It provides a complete function index and an index of the files that comprise each subsystem .
Figure 2 shows the source code for the Linux kernels do_fork function .
Note that C keywords are shown in bold , comments in green , and function definitions are hyperlinked to a list of locations ( filename / line number ) from where they are called .
Function calls are hyperlinked to their definitions .
User - defined types are hyperlinked in a similar manner .
A navigation bar is embedded into a C comment at the beginning of each function .
It allows you to go forward or back one function in the file , go to the top or bottom of the file , access the function or file index page , or go to the navigation help page .
The navigation bar is show below .
/* [ < ] [ > ] [ ^ ] [ v ] [ top ] [ bottom ] [ index ] [ help ] */
GLOBAL 3.52 has had difficulty with some of the macros used in my source code , in particular any that expanded to white space , and it has generated a few incorrect function references and hyperlinks .
This is a minor problem and doesnt compromise GLOBALs utility .
Generating an HTML Version of a Source Directory
Once the GLOBAL executables and libraries are built , you re ready to generate an HTML version of the source code .
There are two GLOBAL commands used to generate the HTML : gtags and htags .
gtags is very similar to the ctags command discussed above .
It generates the tag database ( GTAGS , GRTAGS , and GSYMS files ) , which is then used by the htags HTML generator command .
The commands are as follows :
> gtags # make the tag database ( GTAGS , GRTAGS , GSYMS ) > htags # make the hypertext ( HTML / )
htags creates a subdirectory called html in the directory from which it is invoked .
You can then browse the source code by starting at htm/index.html .
Assume that the amount of disk space required for the HTML is about five times that of the original source code .
This being the case , you may want to generate the HTML in another directory .
The -d < tagdir > option may be used to specify the directory where the tag database resides .
If a directory pathname is specified without an argument , it is taken to be the target directory in which the html directory will be placed .
For example :
> cd/rcs_source/is/src > gtags > htags /home/jbonang/INX
In this case , the HTML for the source code in directory / rcs_source / is / src will be generated in directory / home / jbonang / INX .
Note that gtags is an executable ( a file named gtags.exe on Win32 platforms ) and that htags is a Perl script ( a file named htags.pl ) .
Once the HTML is generated , you can begin browsing your source code .
The initial page will display the main programs of your software system .
I usually begin studying a new software system by first getting a quick overview of the executable programs .
After ranking them in order of importance , I use GLOBAL to explore the major functions and data types of each .
Global is available for Linux and most Unix platforms , as well as Win32 .
It requires Perl and , for Win32 systems , the following Unix command line utility programs : sed.exe , sort.exe , and uniq.exe .
For more information on GLOBAL , please refer to the following website : http://www.tamacom.com/Unix/index.html#global.
On the Horizon
GLOBAL is an excellent HTML source - code browser generator and is the precursor of yet more powerful programming environments known as Hypercode environments .
A Hypercode environment will allow you to edit source code represented as HTML within a browser and much more .
You will be able to create links from source code to on - line formal documentation ; to other source code files ; to technical reports that , for instance , describe an algorithm you used ; or even to email , chat transcripts , and videos .
( Microsofts yet to be released C# programming language uses attributes  that allow hyperlinks to external documentation to be specified within source code files .
I anticipate the open source community will introduce similar functionality into established languages and development tools in the near future . )
For more information on Hypercode environments , visit the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab website : http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/transit/rc-demo/demo.html.
Summary
With the ctags command and the ID Utilities , you can find function , macro , typedef , and variable definitions , as well as the location of string literals , quickly and conveniently from within your favorite text editor .
You can also find where particular source files reside within a complex directory structure .
Source code browsers , such as GLOBAL , convert your source code to HTML , allowing you to conveniently peruse it in a standard browser and understand it rapidly .
Taking advantage of these tag - based  tools will ease your software maintenance chores and expedite your new development projects .
You can also look forward to the introduction of Hypercode environments that will make developing and supporting large software products significantly easier .

The Bush administration is objecting to a groundbreaking treaty that set up a nuclear weapon - free zone in Central Asia .
Under the treaty signed Friday , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan committed themselves not to produce , buy , or allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their soil .
But the United States , along with Britain and France , refused to attend the signing ceremony in the Kazakh capital , Almaty , citing a 1992 treaty that Russia signed with four of the five nations that Moscow claims could allow missiles to be deployed in the region .
In a fresh statement issued Monday , the U.S. embassy in Kazakhstan warned that “ other international treaties could take precedence over the provisions of this treaty , and thus obviate the central objective of creating a zone free of nuclear weapons . ”
Arms control groups believe the Bush administration is being disingenuous .
“ The reason that many of us suspect the U.S. is opposed to this is more fundamental , ” the independent Arms Control Association ’s Daryl G. Kimball told OneWorld .
“ This is a very strategic region .
The U.S. is reticent to give up the option of deploying nuclear weapons in this region in the future . ”
In May , the journal Foreign Policy named Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan one of the six most important U.S. military bases in the world .
The base was originally established as a hub for multinational operations following the Sept. 11 attacks five years ago .
“ In addition to its proximity to Afghanistan , ” the Foreign Policy article stated , “ Manas is located near the immense energy reserves of the Caspian Basin , as well as the Russian and Chinese frontiers . ”
According to Jackie Cabasso , who heads up the Western States Legal Foundation in Oakland , Calif. , “ the United States had drawn up a battle plan for the potential use of nuclear weapons in Iraq and the United States has been involved in planning potential nuclear use scenarios for Iran . ”
“ The United States is now involved in a massive program to overhaul its nuclear arsenal , ” she added .
“ In fact , they ’re working to replace every nuclear warhead and all of the existing delivery systems in the arsenal to ensure prompt precision global strike capabilities .
So the United States is openly using the threatened use of nuclear weapons around the world . ”
David Krieger of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation added that members of the Bush administration “ like to talk about expanding the use of nuclear weapons and talk about the ‘ preventive use ’ of nuclear weapons [ but seem ] to be negative toward a group of countries trying to create a ban on nuclear weapons within their territory . ”
By contrast , arms control experts argue , former Soviet republics in Central Asia have every reason to want to rid themselves of their nuclear legacy .
During the Cold War , the Soviet Union used a facility at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan to test new nuclear weapons .
Between 1949 and 1989 almost 500 nuclear explosions were carried out there , equaling the explosive power of 20,000 Hiroshima bombs .
According to the country ’s president , Nursultan Nazarbayev , those explosions caused irreparable damage to the health of more than 1.5 million Kazakh citizens , blighted lives , and rendered vast stretches of land useless for generations .
Western States Legal Foundation ’s Cabasso told OneWorld the central Asian nation has one of the strongest anti-nuclear movements in the world .
She described a visit to Kazakhstan , made in 1990 shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union .
“ It was amazing , ” Cabasso said .
“ When we flew from Moscow to the capital Almaty , there were people on the runway in traditional costumes holding signs like ‘ Let the Generals Build Their Summer Houses on the Nuclear Test Site . ' ”
Cabasso said the movement for a nuclear free Central Asia began with a poet and member of the Soviet Duma named Olzhas Suleimenov .
In 1989 , after discovering that some of the underground nuclear tests had leaked radiation into the atmosphere , he went on television and called for a mass meeting at the writers ’ union hall .
Over 5,000 people showed up the next day .
“ They organized on a massive scale , ” Cabasso said .
“ Ten thousand copper miners went out on strike , there were billboards at the airport .
Imagine if you had anti-nuclear demonstrations going on during half - time at the Super Bowl .
They were calling for a peaceful non-nuclear transition to the 21st century back in 1990 , and now they have completed that transition in a way . ”
The treaty between Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan created the first nuclear - weapons free zone in the Northern Hemisphere .
Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean , the South Pacific , Southeast Asia , and Africa have already pledged to remain nuclear - free .

THE Admiral is one of 11 riverboat casinos on the waterways of Missouri , where riverine gambling was legalised in May 1994 .
The casinos attract more than 25 m visits a year .
But close to 10,000 people are barred for life from gambling on the riverboats .
If they breach this ban , they face arrest for trespassing and the confiscation of their winnings .
These riverboat exiles are not cheats or paupers .
Rather , they suffer from a gambling compulsion — a ruinous addiction to risk .
The state of Missouri is stopping them for their own good .
If gambling , or drunkenness , or incontinence , or idleness , or uncleanliness , are as injurious to happiness ... as many or most of the acts prohibited by law , why ( it may be asked ) should not law ... endeavour to repress these also ?
A good question , which John Stuart Mill , who raised it in 1869 , endeavoured to answer in his essay against paternalism , “ On Liberty ” .
Mill 's answer was that the state should repress a man 's acts only if they harm others .
Harm to himself alone was not a good enough reason for the state to limit his freedom .
Mill would have thrown his book at the state of Missouri , then ?
Perhaps not — because the people it bars from the riverboat casinos freely chose their own exclusion .
Since 1996 Missouri has pioneered a scheme that allows self - confessed gambling addicts to add their own names to a voluntary blacklist .
Once on the list , they can never come off it .
The scheme allows tormented people to enlist the state 's help in their internal battles — to give force of law to the angels of their better nature .
Such policies appeal to a group of scholars — John Beshears and David Laibson of Harvard University , James Choi of Yale and Brigitte Madrian of the Wharton School — who espouse a fashionable branch of the dismal science known as behavioural economics .
The behaviouralists claim to understand people as they are , not as economists hitherto assumed them to be .
Because of ignorance or intemperance , lack of willpower or brainpower , people choose badly .
Predictably so .
The subdiscipline now has a well stocked cabinet of horrors and curiosities , showing how people fail to exercise their choices in their own best interest .
Having documented people 's inadequacies , the behaviouralists now want to save them .
The iconoclasts are becoming paternalists — but of a distinctive kind .
Two of them , Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago , describe their approach as “ libertarian paternalism ” , which , they insist , is not an oxymoron .
Their critics , such as Edward Glaeser , of Harvard University , call it “ soft paternalism ” .
Whatever the label , their approach is cannier and stealthier than the heavy - handed paternalism liberals reject .
Their aim is not the “ nanny state ” , a scold and killjoy forcing its charges to eat their vegetables and take their medicine .
Instead they offer a vision of what you might call the “ avuncular state ” , worldly - wise , offering a nudge in the right direction , perhaps pulling strings on your behalf without your even noticing .
One example of soft paternalism has already attracted the interest of governments and the backing of this newspaper : employees should be signed up for company pension schemes by default .
Such schemes , which typically attract tax breaks from governments and matching contributions from employers , are usually in the best interest of workers .
You might say that joining is a “ no - brainer ” , except that what little brainwork and paperwork is required defeats a surprising number of people .
A soft paternalist would presume that people want to join , leaving them free to opt out if they choose .
In one case study by Ms Madrian and Dennis Shea , changing the default rule in this way raised the enrolment rate from 49 % to 86 % .
This measure exemplifies the soft paternalists ' approach : the error it addresses is glaring , the remedy unobtrusive .
The switch in default rules alters behaviour while preserving freedom of choice .
It spares the ignorant and the dilatory from the consequences of their mistakes , while imposing few costs on those who genuinely prefer not to entrust their pension money to their employer 's custody .
This , say Messrs Sunstein and Thaler , makes it both libertarian and paternalistic .
Lord , give me thrift , but not yet
If inertia explains why people fail to join pension schemes in the first place , improvidence explains why they save so little when they do .
Figures from some American schemes suggest workers are contributing less than 7 % of their incomes on average .
And those automatically enrolled in the pension studied by Ms Madrian and Mr Shea tend to stick with the low , default contribution rate of about 3 % .
Nannyish governments , not all of them very thrifty themselves , are exhorting the public to do better .
“ The American Dream begins with saving money , ” said Dick Cheney , America 's vice - president , at last month 's Saver Summit , “ and that should begin on the very first day of work . ”
The new paternalists beg to differ .
Mr Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi , who is from the University of California , Los Angeles , are urging Americans to “ Save More Tomorrow ” .
That is the name of their canny proposal to tempt workers to commit themselves today to saving later .
Under their scheme , a fraction of workers ' future pay increases is diverted into their pension pot before arriving in their pay packet .
People seem readier to part with tomorrow 's cash than today's ; and as long as they hike their saving rate by less than their pay raise , their extra thriftiness will not feel like a cut in their disposable income .
Messrs Thaler and Benartzi put their scheme to the test at a medium - sized manufacturing company .
After four annual pay rises , the joiners had raised their saving rate from just 3.5 % to fully 13.6 % .
“ We plead guilty to the charge of trying to be paternalistic , ” the authors write .
But since they have not infringed on freedom of choice , they do not think it a crime .
The two authors spelt out their plan in an article from 2004 dedicated to the late Sherwin Rosen , Mr Thaler 's thesis adviser .
“ He would not have liked this paper much , ” the authors write in their acknowledgments , “ but we sure would have enjoyed hearing him complain about it ! ”
What complaints might he have made ?
Some economists feel about the behaviouralists much as Robert Frost felt about writers of free verse : economics without rationality is like tennis without a net .
It is too easy .
If appeals to irrationality are admissible , then anything goes .
But behavioural economics has grown up , and part of its maturation is to show that no , not anything goes .
People depart from rationality , but they do so in ways that can be predicted — and exploited .
Unlike free verse , their behaviour has some rhythm and regularity .
A lack of self - control is one such regularity .
Impatience has always been a part of economics : people do n't like to defer gratification , and they demand compensation — an interest rate — for doing so .
The behaviouralists , however , have shown that people are inconsistent about their impatience .
It takes one rate of interest to make them settle for a reward tomorrow rather than today , quite another to leave them indifferent between a reward 1,000 days from now , and one 1,001 days from now .
For the second kind of choice ( jam later , or later still ) people are quite patient , accepting an annualised interest rate of 4.3 % on average , according to a recent study by Mr Laibson and others .
But for the first kind of decision ( jam now , or later ) people are much more impatient , demanding a rate of interest equivalent to 40 % a year .
This inconsistency applies to chores as well as treats , as Ted O'Donoghue of Cornell University and Matthew Rabin of the University of California , Berkeley , point out .
Suppose you must either do seven hours of gruelling paperwork on May 1st or eight hours on May 15th .
If asked in March , most people would prefer the seven hours .
But if asked on May 1st , most would put off the work for a further two weeks .
Translated into the realm of personal saving , this is precisely the quirk in our nature that Messrs Thaler and Benartzi exploit when they ask people to save more — not today , but tomorrow .
This quirk sets up an “ intimate contest for self - command ” , as Thomas Schelling , a winner of last year 's Nobel prize for economics , puts it .
People act as if two different selves take turns to run the show .
Resolutions founder , because the self who decides to quit drinking or start a diet in the new year is not the self who must act on that resolution when the day arrives .
Mr Schelling 's own intimate contest is with smoking ; he is torn between a self who craves nicotine and a self who wants to be free of it .
His habit has been a tempting target for paternalists , soft and hard .
A new temperance movement of surprising force has banished smokers from offices , restaurants and bars in a lengthening list of countries .
This year , even Spain banned smoking in workplaces .
The anti-smoking leagues stay on the right side of Mill by invoking the dangers of passive smoking .
The true extent of those dangers is a matter of some uncertainty .
But they represent a classic externality — an uncompensated , unpriced harm the smoker inflicts on others — which can justify quite draconian measures even in a liberal 's eyes .
Some of the new paternalists , however , justify smoking restrictions on less orthodox grounds .
Just as one individual can inflict an externality on another , so one side of a person 's nature can inflict an “ internality ” on another .
The self who enjoys a cigarette takes too little account of the damage he inflicts on the lungs of his future self , nor the addition each cigarette makes to the strength of his addiction .
Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Botond Koszegi of the University of California , Berkeley , think these “ internalities ” justify additional “ sin taxes ” on cigarettes and alcohol .
Such taxes are not , they claim , unfair to the poor , who spend a greater share of their income on cigarettes .
Since the poor are more sensitive to prices than the rich , higher tobacco taxes are of greater help to them in their efforts to quit .
Taking this into account , cigarette taxes are probably “ progressive ” , the two economists conclude .
Messrs O'Donoghue and Rabin , on the other hand , suggest sin licences .
Rather than charge a duty of $ 2 a packet , governments could make the sale of cigarettes illegal to anyone who did not buy a smokers ' ID , which might cost $ 5,000 and entitle the holder to 2,500 packets of cigarettes tax - free .
People would no longer be able to slide into a smoking habit one packet at a time .
It would be clear from the outset that they were entering a lifelong marriage to nicotine .
If such a high price is too crude a deterrent , the sin licences could instead carry customised restrictions , argue Mr Beshears and his colleagues .
The licences would be sold for a nominal fee , but holders could specify in advance how many cigarettes they were allowed to buy , and at what times .
Those restrictions could be loosened , but any tinkering would come into effect only after a lag , of say three days .
The licences would be only a minor inconvenience to people who plan to smoke a lot .
But they would be of great help to people who plan not to smoke , but find themselves with a cigarette at their lips in spite of their pledges to give up .
Should liberals object to schemes of this kind ?
Perhaps not .
By helping people to make forward - looking decisions for themselves that they cannot easily renege on later , they enlarge their freedom , making it possible for them to do things they otherwise could not do .
Giving Ulysses the rope with which to lash himself to the mast adds to his choices .
But Glen Whitman , of California State University , has doubts .
In an engaging tract for the Cato Institute , a libertarian think - tank , he wonders why governments should always favour the long - sighted self over its near - sighted alter ego .
The immediate pleasures of gambling , drinking and idleness are real ; so too are the costs of suppressing them .
“ In contrast to the obese and the profligate , whose short - run selves constantly trump their long - run selves , we might point to the misers [ and ] workaholics for whom the reverse appears to be true , ” he writes .
Ignorance is not an option
Public health campaigns are a more traditional weapon against smoking .
In America these began with the surgeon general 's report on smoking and health in 1964 , but they have come a long way since then .
The Canadians , for example , have decorated cigarette packets with repellent images of blackened gums and cancerous lungs .
New York 's Museum of Modern
Art celebrated one of these images in a recent exhibition of designs that “ protect body and mind from dangerous or stressful circumstances ” .
The packet did n't just warn smokers of the risk of impotence , it illustrated the danger with a bent cigarette , hanging limply .
Even the most ardent liberal is happy for governments to provide information or force others to do so .
A doctor should tell his patient about the risks of elective surgery , for example .
To leave the patient in the dark would be criminally negligent .
But how should the doctor frame the patient 's choice ?
Should he tell him that 90 % of those who undergo the procedure survive ?
Or that 10 % die ?
Both statements convey identical information .
But each has markedly different effects on behaviour .
Such dilemmas are not purely hypothetical , as Mr Sunstein and Christine Jolls , of Harvard Law School , point out .
In 2003 America 's Health and Human Services Department commissioned a campaign to promote breastfeeding .
The original version of the adverts warned that , without breastmilk , children ran a heightened risk of leukaemia , diabetes and respiratory diseases .
( They showed pregnant women roller - skating or riding bucking broncos .
You would n't take risks before your baby was born , the adverts intoned .
Why start now ? )
Infant - formula makers objected , arguing that the adverts should stick to the benefits of breastmilk , rather than the dangers of not breastfeeding .
How information is framed matters .
People weigh losses more heavily than gains , as Messrs Thaler and Benartzi explain .
They will typically bet on a coin toss only if their potential winnings are twice as big as the amount they stand to lose .
Likewise , mothers will go to greater lengths to avoid the harm a lack of breastmilk might inflict than to secure the benefits breastfeeding can bring .
It is not for the state to decide how mothers should feed their children , the antipaternalist would argue .
But if the state is to provide any information at all , it will also steer people , whether it wants to or not .
“ It is far too simple , and behaviourally naive , to draw a sharp line between acceptable ‘ provision of information ' and unacceptable ‘ mind control ' , ” argue Ms Jolls and Mr Sunstein .
This acute sensitivity to losses is not the only bias behaviouralists have discovered .
People also have great difficulty understanding risks .
The weight a person gives to a scenario — flood , fire , winning the lottery — should depend on its likelihood .
In fact , it depends on how easily it can be envisaged .
People will pay more for air - travel insurance against “ terrorist acts ” than against death from “ all possible causes ” .
Canny governments can work with the grain of this psychology .
The grisly campaigns against smoking aim to put the dangers firmly in people 's minds ; to turn a statistical risk into a visceral image .
They have been effective , perhaps too effective .
There is some evidence that people now overestimate the risks of smoking .
But such campaigns can also have nasty side effects , Mr Glaeser argues .
The fear , shame and guilt they inculcate acts as a kind of “ psychic tax ” , reducing the demand for smoking .
But unlike a genuine sin tax , which shifts money from taxpayers to the treasury , psychic taxes impose emotional costs without raising revenues .
By portraying a habit as self - destructive and therefore shameful , such campaigns also pave the way for hard paternalism , Mr Glaeser says .
The recent wave of smoking bans rather proves his point .
The callow nephew
There are many ways for a government to queer the pitch in favour of one social result ( more saving , less smoking ) or another .
In fact , as Messrs Thaler and Sunstein argue , governments often cannot remain neutral even if they want to .
Something must serve as the default option , something must come top of the menu , and information , if it is to be provided at all , must be framed in one way or another .
The soft paternalists want the government to use these tools knowingly , in favour of the outcome its citizens themselves would prefer if only they had the necessary discipline and discernment .
For its exponents , this is a paternalism for the times .
People are jealous of their freedoms ; yet they squander them .
They resent outside authorities telling them how to live their lives , but they lack self - command .
They have legions of entrepreneurs dedicated to serving them better , but often they fail even to understand the embarrassment of offerings that is spread before them .
Some gentle guidance would not go amiss .
But if such manipulation is sometimes a necessity , should it be made a virtue ?
Mill , for one , would have disapproved .
He who lets the world choose ... his plan of life for him , has no need of any other faculty than the ape - like one of imitation .
He who chooses his plan for himself must ... use observation to see , reasoning and judgment to foresee , activity to gather materials for decision , discrimination to decide , and when he has decided , firmness and self - control to hold to his deliberate decision .
Reasoning , judgment , discrimination and self - control — all of these the soft paternalists see as burdens the state can and should lighten .
Mill , by contrast , saw them as opportunities for citizens to exercise their humanity .
Soft paternalism may improve people 's choices , rescuing them from their own worst tendencies , but it does nothing to improve those tendencies .
The nephews of the avuncular state have no reason to grow up .

Ubuntu、SUSE、LinspireといったLinuxディストリビューションがデスクトップ市場で躍進しているが、一味違ったものを試したいなら、あまり知られていない代替のオペレーティングシステムを探し出すことができる。これらのOSは、安定性やハードウェアサポートの面で不足があるかもしれないが、それぞれ独特の概念を打ち出している。
1996 年の着手以来、今もまだβ版のSkyOSは、もともとロバート・ゼレニー氏一人の手で開発が進められてきた。この独自仕様OSには、シンメトリックマルチプロセッシング（SMP）、統合されたメディアサブシステム、クラッシュ時にパーティションの回復が可能なジャーナリングされた64ビットファイルシステムなど、数多くの魅力がある。対応アプリケーションが限られているとはいえ、SkyOSにはMozilla FirefoxおよびThunderbird 、AbiWord、Gaim、Nvu、Pixelなどが用意されている。アプリケーション・ソフトウェアのインストールは、SkyOS
Software Storeを使って簡単に行うことができ、マウスを数回クリックするだけで済む。
SkyOSには 、Linux のBeagle やMac OS XのSpotlightによく似た、複数キーワードに対応していてリアルタイムにファイルの中身を検索できる機能もある。参照を容易にするため、ファイルとプログラムはインデキシング（索引付け）が行われている。また、システム全体にわたって使えるマウスジェスチャー機能、Windows Media Video（WMV）やMP3など複数のコーデックに対応しているffmpegを利用したメディアプレーヤー・アプリケーションもサポートされている。
欠点は、サポートされているハードウェアが非常に限られていることである（ただし、VMware上でSkyOSを実行すれば、グラフィックスカード、サウンド、ネットワーク処理に対するネイティブOSのサポートが得られる）。SkyOSで動作するネットワークカードやサウンドカードは少なく、2Dアクセラレーションが機能するグラフィックスカードもごくわずかだ。
サポートされているハードウェアが手元にあれば、30ドルでβプログラムに参加できる。ただし、オペレーティングシステムに安定性を求めるなら、最初の正式版がリリースされるまで待った方がいいだろう
2001 年 にBe Inc.の資産がPalmに買収された後、BeOS愛好家のあるグループがOpenBeOSプロジェクトを立ち上げた。BeOS 5と下位互換の（MITライセンスによる）オープンソース・オペレーティングシステムを開発するプロジェクトだ。現在はHaikuと呼ばれ、創設以来、なかなかの進展を見せている。一部のゲームのほか、Mozilla FirefoxやSeaMonkeyなど、多数のプログラムをHaiku上で実行できる。
ブートやアプリケーションのロードの時間が短くてよいのだが、サポートされているネットワークアダプタは限られている。また、Haikuをインストールするには、BeOSまたはZetaをインストールする必要があり、Haikuのファイルを移行させるために、追加のBeOSパーティションも必要になる。
今は亡 きAtheOSから派生して2002年に開発されたSyllableは、GPLライセンスによるオープンソースのデスクトップOSである。ハードウェア要件はあまり高くなく、ブートにかかる時間はわずかだ。アプリケーションソフトウェアの選択肢は少ないが、各種のWebブラウザ、電子メールプログラム、ゲームのほか、メディアプレーヤーも1種類ある。こうしたソフトウェアの多くをインストールするには、アーカイブからバイナリファイルを取り出すだけでよい。また、Syllableは64ビットファイルシステムであるAtheOS
File System（AFS）に対応している。
ハードウェアサポートが十分とはいえず、インストーラがテキストベースで分かりづらいものなので、Syllableのインストールは、場合によっては危険かもしれない。ただし、ここに挙げる4つのOSのうち、セカンダリーOSとしての利用に最も適しているのが、このSyllable だ。
Visopsys （Visual Operating System）は、1997年から開発が続いている、GPLおよびLGPLのオープンソースOSである。ただし、VisopsysをデスクトップOSとして実行しようと考えているなら、考え直した方がいいかもしれない。もともとはアンディ・マクラフリン氏が開発したホビーOSとしての傾向が強いからだ。Visopsysは、ここに挙げたほかのOSよりも、利用できるアプリケーションやサポートされているハードウェアが少ない。
Visopsysは、最善のデスクトップOSとはいえないかもしれないが、1つ素晴らしい使い方ができる。SymantecのPartition
Magicのようなパーティションマネジャーであり、フリーソフトウェアでオープンソースのPartition
Logicが、 Visopsys上で動作するのだ。事実、このPartition Logic とPartition Magicは同じ作者が開発している 。Partition Logicは 、Partition Magicと同じ動作をするので、同等に素晴らしい機能を備えたフリーソフトウェアという点で値打ちがある。
ここでは、発展途上にある代替オペレーティングシステムを4つ取り上げた。ハードウェアサポートの充実度、インストールと使い方の容易さといった面では不満が残るものの、そのアイデアと構想は、従来のOSとは一線を画している。LinuxやWindows、それにMac OS XがOSの定番になっている世界で、そのほかのOSが存在を主張し、ほかと違った試みをするのは素晴らしいことだ。

The climate is crashing , and global warming is to blame Editor 's note :
The following is a summary of this week 's
Time magazine cover story .
And with sea ice vanishing , polar bears are starting to turn up drowned .
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Global Change or or Create Your Own ( Time.com ) --
No one can say exactly what it looks like when a planet takes ill , but it probably looks a lot like Earth .
Never mind what you 've heard about global warming as a slow - motion emergency that would take decades to play out .
Suddenly and unexpectedly , the crisis is upon us .
From heat waves to storms to floods to fires to massive glacial melts , the global climate seems to be crashing around us .
The problem -- as scientists suspected but few others appreciated -- is that global climate systems are booby - trapped with tipping points and feedback loops , thresholds past which the slow creep of environmental decay gives way to sudden and self - perpetuating collapse .
That 's just what 's happening now .
It 's at the north and south poles -- where ice cover is crumbling to slush -- that the crisis is being felt the most acutely .
Late last year , for example , researchers analyzed data from Canadian and European satellites and found that the Greenland ice sheet is not only melting , but doing so faster and faster , with 53 cubic miles draining away into the sea last year alone , compared to 23 cubic miles in 1996 .
One of the reasons the loss of the planet 's ice cover is accelerating is that as the poles ' bright white surface disappears it changes the relationship of the Earth and the sun .
Polar ice is so reflective that 90 percent of the sunlight that strikes it simply bounces back into space , taking its energy with it .
Ocean water does just the opposite , absorbing 90 percent of the light and heat it receives , meaning that each mile of ice that melts vanishes faster than the mile that preceded it .
This is what scientists call a feedback loop , and a similar one is also melting the frozen land called permafrost , much of which has been frozen -- since the end of last ice age in fact , or at least 8,000 years ago .
Sealed inside that cryonic time capsule are layers of decaying organic matter , thick with carbon , which itself can transform into CO2 .
In places like the southern boundary of Alaska the soil is now melting and softening .
As fast as global warming is changing the oceans and ice caps , it 's having an even more immediate effect on land .
Droughts are increasingly common as higher temperatures also bake moisture out of soil faster , causing dry regions that live at the margins to tip into full - blown crisis .
Wildfires in such sensitive regions as Indonesia , the western U.S. and even inland Alaska have been occurring with increased frequency as timberlands grow more parched .
Those forests that do n't succumb to fire can simply die from thirst .
With habitats crashing , the animals that call them home are succumbing too .
In Alaska , salmon populations are faltering as melting permafrost pours mud into rivers , burying the gravel the fish need for spawning .
Small animals such as bushy tailed rats , chipmunks and pinion mice are being chased upslope by rising temperatures , until they at last have no place to run .
And with sea ice vanishing , polar bears are starting to turn up drowned .
" There will be no polar ice by 2060 , " says Larry Schweiger , president of the National Wildlife Federation .
" Somewhere along that path , the polar bear drops out . "
So much environmental collapse has at last awakened much of the world , particularly the 141 nations that have ratified the Kyoto treaty to reduce emissions .
The Bush administration , however , has shown no willingness to address the warming crisis in a serious way and Congress has not been much more encouraging .
Sens .
John McCain and Joe Lieberman have twice been unable to get even mild measures to limit carbon emissions through a recalcitrant Senate .
A 10 - member House delegation did recently travel to Antarctica , Australia and New Zealand to meet with scientists studying climate change .
" Of the 10 of us , only three were believers to begin with , " says Rep. Sherman Boehlert of New York .
" Every one of the others said this opened their eyes . "
But lawmakers who still applaud themselves for recognizing global warming are hardly the same as lawmakers with the courage to reverse it , and increasingly , state and local governments are stepping forward .
The mayors of more than 200 cities have signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement , pledging , among other things , that they will meet the Kyoto goal of reducing greenhouse emissions in their own cities to 1990 levels by 2012 .
Nine northeastern states have established the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the purpose of developing a program to cap greenhouse gasses .

Uncovering the USS Macon The Underwater Airship
The military zeppelin USS Macon was meant to be a floating American aircraft carrier over the Pacific Ocean -- but it crashed , sank and has been lying on the ocean floor for more than 70 years .
Now scientists have discovered and documented the unique wreck off the coast of California .
Kathleen Parker ’s clear , descriptive , lively writing underscores her common - sense approach to life 's challenges .
Twice weekly , Kathleen Parker assesses the country ’s mental health with a Rorschach uniquely her own – a reporter ’s gimlet eye combined with a sense of humor that Parker attributes to having grown up with five mothers .
" My ambitious goal , " Kathleen Parker says , " is to try to inject a little sanity into a world gone barking mad . "
Now one of America 's most popular opinion columnists , appearing in more than 350 newspapers , Kathleen Parker is at home both inside and outside the Washington Beltway .
But Kathleen Parker came to column - writing the old - fashioned way , working her way up journalism ’s ladder from smaller papers to larger ones .
" I never set out to become a commentator – and do continue to resist the label ' pundit ' – but I found that keeping my opinion out of my writing was impossible , " says Kathleen Parker .
" One can only stand watching from the sidelines for so long without finally having to say , ' Um , excuse me , but you people are nuts . ' "
Praised for " attacking ignorance and stupidity with vividness and originality " by the judges of the prestigious H.L. Mencken Writing Award , which Kathleen Parker won in 1993 , Kathleen Parker gained a rapt and appreciative audience throughout the 1990s .
But it was in the days and months following the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that Kathleen Parker 's attempts to " inject a little sanity " established Kathleen Parker as a premier commentator .
Kathleen Parker 's writings in support of American troops , first - responders and other front - line participants in the war on terror were among the reasons The Week magazine named Kathleen Parker as one of the country 's top five columnists in 2004 and 2005 .
Kathleen Parker started her column in 1987 when Kathleen Parker was a staff writer for The Orlando Sentinel .
Kathleen Parker 's column was nationally syndicated in 1995 and Kathleen Parker joined The Washington Post Writers Group in 2006 .
Along the way , Kathleen Parker has contributed articles to The Weekly Standard , Time , Town & Country , Cosmopolitan and Fortune Small Business , and she serves on USA Today 's Board of Contributors and writes for that newspaper 's op - ed page .
Kathleen Parker is a regular guest on " The Chris Matthews Show " on NBC .
Kathleen Parker 's book " Save the Males : Why Men Matter , Why Women Should Care " was published in 2008 by Random House .
As an undergraduate , Kathleen Parker studied in both the United States and abroad , including the University of Valencia in Spain .
Kathleen Parker holds a master 's degree in Spanish from Florida State University , and is writer in residence at the Buckley School of Public Speaking in Camden , S.C .
Kathleen Parker is married and has three sons .
She divides her time between Camden and Washington , D.C .
You might have noticed over the past few weeks that in some forums and between some e-book writers that there is debate over whether AdSense is everything it ’s cracked up to be .
Some are saying that it ’s dead , others are saying it ’s dead if you use it for Arbitrage and others are saying it ’s the best thing since sliced bread .
I ’ve been emailed to ask what I think numerous times this week and have been pondering how to respond .
Here are a few random thoughts :
Speaking Personally
Let me start on a personal note – I still make a lot of money from AdSense on my personal blogs .
While there have been times where I ’ve had bigger months than the one that is ending now – I ’m still very pleased with my own AdSense earnings .
Yes numbers are down a little but that has more to do with a number of other factors rather than AdSense being ‘ dead ’ .
Some of these factors include :
Coming out of a slow period ( summer in the northern hemisphere is traditionally slow )
Adding other Ad programs ( for example when I added Chitika my AdSense went down a little ( not as much as the extra money that was brought in ) due to AdSense ads having a little less prominence )
Being Hacked ( I lost a full few of days income from my recent hacking )
Having said this – AdSense is still my equal largest earner and is n’t WAY down ( in fact over the first few days of October I ’ve seen a small upswing again ) .
AdWords Changes
A lot of the complaints against AdSense over the last few months have probably got more to do with changes to AdWords than anything .
Arbitrage publishers were rocked a couple of months back when changes were made to AdWords that made it more expensive to send readers to landing pages in the hope of getting them to click AdSense ads that earned more than the AdWords ads that got them there .
It ’s no wonder that people are complaining about AdSense as a way to Monetize Arbitrage with the changes that were made .
However if you ’re not into Arbitrage and are a publisher who develops quality sites that grow a natural readership via SE traffic or loyal readers then I think AdSense is still a great way to go – particularly if you have a blog with some commercial edge to it ( ie AdSense does n’t tend to work well on religious , political or personal sites ) .
AdSense Alternatives
The last 12 months have seen a lot more competition for AdSense .
I have noticed a slight drop off in bloggers raving about AdSense partly because they ’re now raving about other ad systems .
In my chats with bloggers I ’m seeing a number of other income streams mentioned again and again .
Here ’s a few :
1. Text Link Ads ( aff ) – the team at TLA have gradually built a loyal publisher list over the past few months but providing an ad system that may not be as flashy or spectacular as AdSense in some senses but which works .
Interestingly – I ’ve chatted with a number of smaller bloggers over the past few weeks who say that TLA actually is their biggest earner .
This is because it is not reliant upon clicks or traffic at all and is a very passive income for a blog that over time grows as more advertisers buy links .
I spoke to an owner of a lesser known blog network recently and he told me that his network is earning five figures a month with TLA .
2. Amazon Associates – some publishers laugh off Amazon as not being worth the effort because the payouts are so small ( 4 - 6 % in post cases ) but I ’ve chatted with a few publishers this week who are doing very well from Amazon .
The advantage of Amazon over many affiliate programs is that they are a trusted brand .
If you pick the right products to promote you can actually do quite well from them .
I chatted with a publisher this week who is promoting lawn mowers and power tools on Amazon .
Sell a $ 2000 tractor / mower a few times a week and it certainly adds up .
3. Chitika ( aff ) – as unpopular as they became with some publishers in their early days of launching they continue to be a big earner for some bloggers .
They continue to be neck and neck with AdSense for me in the earnings they bring in .
They continue to improve their products and expand what they offer in terms of channels , their recent launch of shoplinc etc and I know of a few product oriented bloggers who make more from them than anything else .
Ca n’t say too much but expect their range of advertising methods to continue to increase in the coming months .
4. YPN – Yahoo ’s contextual advertising system is still in beta ( it has been a longer process than many expected ) and is yet to fully compete with AdSense .
I ’ve given it a go ( via b5 ’s account ) and was n’t too impressed with how it converted here at ProBlogger but do know of some bloggers who continue to find that it does well for them .
I think it ’s a blog by blog proposition but is definitely an ad network to consider if you can get into the beta test .
5. Direct Ad Sales – another emerging trend among bloggers ( and networks of them ) is the increased focus upon direct deals that are being done between bloggers and advertisers ( and their representatives ) .
This month I had a sponsorship with Canon on one of my blogs that has been well worth while and I know at b5 media we are finding more and more advertisers willing to do deals as the word gets out that blogs are online real estate that converts pretty well for them .
It ’s not always easy to negotiate these deals as a single blogger with a relatively small readership but we ’re now seeing networks of bloggers banding together which makes it much easier to negotiate such deals .
6. Product Bloggers – while there are not a lot of examples of this yet I suspect that 2007 will be a year that quite a few bloggers will launch products in their niches .
Bloggers are starting to switch onto the fact that after a year or two of blogging on a topic that they are sitting upon a goldmine of information and expertise that can be reused in other forums .
While this past year saw a number of bloggers release books I know of quite a few who are working up to releasing online information products , membership sites and coaching services in their areas of expertise .
Whether they succeed or not is yet to be seen but it ’s a logical next step for many bloggers .
Of course there are many other AdSense Alternatives out there for publishers also ( with more coming I ’m told ) .
The variety of systems open to publishers surely is having some impact upon AdSense and what people are earning with it .
What do you think ?

Israel fought Hezbollah in Lebanon in July and August
Cabinet minister Jacob Edery confirmed the bombs were dropped " against military targets in open ground " .
Israel had previously said the weapons were used only to mark targets .
Phosphorus weapons cause chemical burns and the Red Cross and human rights groups say they should be treated as chemical weapons .
The Geneva Conventions ban the use of white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon against civilian populations and in air attacks against military forces in civilian areas .
Hospitals
Mr Edery says he confirmed during a parliamentary session last week on behalf of Defence Minister Amir Peretz that the weapons were used in fighting .
" The Israeli army made use of phosphorus shells during the war against Hezbollah in attacks against military targets in open ground , " he said .
No information was given on when , where or how the shells were used .
Lebanon had accused Israel of using the weapons but at the time Israeli officials said they were only for marking .
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said in late July : " According to the Geneva Convention , when they use phosphorus bombs and laser bombs , is that allowed against civilians and children ? "
Doctors in hospitals in southern Lebanon had said they suspected some of the burns they were seeing were being caused by phosphorus bombs .
Israeli forces said the arms used in Lebanon did not contravene international norms .
THE tea bag , a clever enough idea at first , went terribly awry somewhere along the way , at least in the view of people who love to savor their tea .
Now it is in the process of large - scale reinvention , and some of those who currently shun it with almost ostentatious disdain are very likely to be won over .
At age 100 or so , the old bag is increasingly being filled with fine whole leaf tea , the kind connoisseurs brew in their teapots , and the bag itself has been redesigned in shapes that are not only elegant but constructed to allow those flavorful leaves to show what they ’ve got .
With tea sales in the United States now four times what they were a decade ago — about $ 6.2 billion annually , according to the Tea Association of the USA , a trade group — the American tea drinker seems ready for a change for the better .
The change , some say , is overdue .
Look closely at a conventional tea bag in your cupboard or in the paper cup from the local deli .
Chances are that instead of leaves it is filled with indistinguishable bits , the detritus left after tea leaves are sifted and graded .
The tea industry calls it dust , and the beverage it makes is likely to be rusty - looking and often bitterly tannic .
But it no longer has to be , nor is it necessary to brew a whole pot of tea to achieve something better tasting .
Chicago - THERE is no such thing as a " Christian politics . "
If it is a politics , it can not be Christian .
Jesus told Pilate : " My reign is not of this present order .
If my reign were of this present order , my supporters would have fought against my being turned over to the Jews .
But my reign is not here " ( John 18:36 ) .
Jesus brought no political message or program .
This is a truth that needs emphasis at a time when some Democrats , fearing that the Republicans have advanced over them by the use of religion , want to respond with a claim that Jesus is really on their side .
He is not .
He avoided those who would trap him into taking sides for or against the Roman occupation of Judea .
He paid his taxes to the occupying power but said only , " Let Caesar have what belongs to him , and God have what belongs to him " ( Matthew 22:21 ) .
He was the original proponent of a separation of church and state .
Those who want the state to engage in public worship , or even to have prayer in schools , are defying his injunction : " When you pray , be not like the pretenders , who prefer to pray in the synagogues and in the public square , in the sight of others .
In truth I tell you , that is all the profit they will have .
But you , when you pray , go into your inner chamber and , locking the door , pray there in hiding to your Father , and your Father who sees you in hiding will reward you " ( Matthew 6:5 - 6 ) .
He shocked people by his repeated violation of the external holiness code of his time , emphasizing that his religion was an internal matter of the heart .
But does n't Jesus say to care for the poor ?
Repeatedly and insistently , but what he says goes far beyond politics and is of a different order .
He declares that only one test will determine who will come into his reign : whether one has treated the poor , the hungry , the homeless and the imprisoned as one would Jesus himself .
" Whenever you did these things to the lowliest of my brothers , you were doing it to me " ( Matthew 25:40 ) .
No government can propose that as its program .
Theocracy itself never went so far , nor could it .

Recently I have noticed a tendency in the Common Lisp community to criticize Scheme , possibly to make the Scheme community look equally bad in its handling of such viewpoints .
So to head off silly and / or baseless attacks on Scheme I have created a brief list of things that Scheme actually does have problems with .
Maybe someone will even turn them into a SRFI eventually , when we reach some kind of a consensus as to what the best solutions are .
Remember these are problems with the language , not an implementation .
Even if a specific implementation has fixed them it does n’t fix the language itself .
The language needs to address such issues so that the implementations do n’t become too fragmented .
Types
Types can be used to catch stupid programmer errors ( the kind mere mortal make all the time , i.e. “ which order do those parameters go in again ? ” ) at compile time as well as to optimize away unnecessary run-time checks .
Unfortunately the only types that Scheme supports are purely run-time .
A type system also makes overloading functions based on the type of their parameters possible ( efficiently , checking all parameter types on each call is not efficient ) , which can be extremely useful .
Macros
The macro system , although being nice for having hygienic safety and pattern matching , is at times cumbersome .
It should be easy to create Common Lisp style macros when you want them .
The macro system is also poorly documented ( in my opinion ) .
Modules
The module system does n’t support versioning well , nor does it support module “ trees ” ( i.e. modules which have sub- modules declared within them ) .
The fact that you ca n’t set !
variables provided by modules feels arbitrary as well .
Objects
Scheme does n’t have objects integrated into the language itself .
Although I personally have argued that this can be considered a positive feature ( see : here ) , I admit it can be annoying when to work on five different projects you have to learn five different object systems .
Errors
Trapping errors thrown at runtime , such as type errors , can be cumbersome and implementation dependant .
Additionally there is no built - in syntax for providing the try - catch features available in other languages , although you can define your own with continuations .
Threads
Once again threads should be provided by the language , not by implementations .
Multiple Values
The values construct is cumbersome to work with .
It requires special procedures to handle multiple values when it should be as simple as ( f ( p ) ) if f expects two parameters and p returns two values .
Lack of Compiler Hinting
This has partly been addressed under the problems with types , but as a whole Scheme lacks methods of hinting to the compiler what you are trying to do so it can optimize rationally .
For example if defun was made part of the language we might allow the compiler to make the assumption that symbols created with defun could not be set ! , and thus such functions could be inlined safely , ect .
Too Minimalist
Many of these problems resolve to the complaint that Scheme is too minimalist for its own good .
Problems with types , threads , errors , objects , and modules are all symptoms of Scheme ’s desire to be simple .
Minimalism is good of course , because it makes the language easy to learn , implement , and optimize , but it has to be balanced with functionality , so that implementations do n’t diverge to far when they are forced to implement features that the language does n’t support .
Why use Scheme if has all these problems ?
From this long list of faults you may think that I am encouraging you to drop Scheme .
Many of these deficiencies have been resolved by individual implementations , which means that you can work as though they had been resolved , although there is a possibility that eventually you will have to update you code to bring it in line with the official solutions .
Also Scheme still has some cool features that make it shine in comparison with Common Lisp , for example real continuations , guarantees of tail call optimization ( no need for nasty do loops ) , and of course it is a Lisp - 1 .
Additionally there is a formal process for revision , the SRFI , which allows the community to have their input , ensuring that Scheme improvements are really improvements , not fiat from some language deity .
Even though these problems are currently open hopefully Scheme can later implement the best solutions to them , leaving the language as elegant as it is currently , unlike the solutions in Common Lisp , which often feel like hacks ( just my opinion ) .
If anyone does propose a SRFI to address one of these issues I would be grateful if they would let me know .

Less process is generally better .
Process burden need not be a function of team or company size .
Avoid big refactorings / rearchitecture when possible .
Refactor in place instead .

This does not mean “ never use third - party software ” .
Periods inside of quotation marks are dumb .
New features automatically become riskier the more the product / project matures .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
The Antikythera Mechanism , discovered more than 100 years ago in a Roman shipwreck , was used by ancient Greeks to display astronomical cycles .
Using advanced imaging techniques , an Anglo - Greek team probed the remaining fragments of the complex geared device .
The results , published in the journal Nature , show it could have been used to predict solar and lunar eclipses .
The elaborate arrangement of bronze gears may also have displayed planetary information .
" This is as important for technology as the Acropolis is for architecture , " said Professor John Seiradakis of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece , and one of the team .
" It is a unique device . "
However , not all experts agree with the team 's interpretation of the mechanism .
Technical complexity
The remains of the device were first discovered in 1902 when archaeologist Valerios Stais noticed a heavily corroded gear wheel amongst artefacts recovered by sponge divers from a sunken Roman cargo ship .
Simulation :
The front side displayed a calendar and the Greek zodiac
A further 81 fragments have since been found containing a total of 30 hand - cut bronze gears .
The largest fragment has 27 cogs .
Researchers believe these would have been housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors , covered in instructions for its use .
The complete calculator would have been driven by a hand crank .
Although its origins are uncertain , the new studies of the inscriptions suggest it would have been constructed around 100 - 150 BC , long before such devices appear in other parts of the world .
Writing in Nature , the team says that the mechanism was " technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards " .
Although much of it is now lost , particularly from the front , what remains has given a century 's worth of researchers a tantalising glimpse into the world of ancient Greek astronomy .
One of the most comprehensive studies was done by British science historian Derek Solla Price , who advanced the theory that the device was used to calculate and display celestial information .
When you see it your jaw just drops and you think , ' bloody hell that 's clever '
Mike Edmunds
Cardiff University
This would have been important for timing agricultural and religious festivals .
Some researchers now also believe that it could have been used for teaching or navigation .
Although Solla Price 's work did much to push forward the state of knowledge about the device 's functions , his interpretation of the mechanics is now largely dismissed .
A reinterpretation of the fragments by Michael Wright of Imperial College London between 2002 and 2005 , for example , developed an entirely different assembly for the gears .
The new work builds on this legacy .
Eclipse function
Using bespoke non-invasive imaging systems , such as three - dimensional X - ray microfocus computed tomography , the team was able to take detailed pictures of the device and uncover new information .
The major structure they describe , like earlier studies , had a single , centrally placed dial on the front plate that showed the Greek zodiac and an Egyptian calendar on concentric scales .
IMAGING TECHNIQUES 1 . Three dimensional X - ray microfocus computed tomography : Developed by X - Tek Systems and similar to medical CAT scans , it allowed 3D images of the fragments to be reconstructed .
Crucial for reading text hidden by centuries of corrosion .
2 . Digital optical imaging using polynomial texture mapping : Developed by Hewlett Packard , a new method for increasing the photorealism of surface textures in digital pictures .
Revealed faint surface details .
3 . Digitised conventional film photography : High - quality images allowed the fragments to be studied without being handled .
On the back , two further dials displayed information about the timing of lunar cycles and eclipse patterns .
Previously , the idea that the mechanism could predict eclipses had only been a hypothesis .
Other aspects are less certain , such as the exact number of cogs that would have been in the complete device .
The new research suggests 37 gears could have been used .
However , what is left gives an insight into the complexity of the information the mechanism could display .
For example , the Moon sometimes moves slightly faster in the sky than at others because of the satellite 's elliptic orbit .
To overcome this , the designer of the calculator used a " pin-and - slot " mechanism to connect two gear - wheels that introduced the necessary variations .
" When you see it your jaw just drops and you think : ' bloody hell , that 's clever ' .
It 's a brilliant technical design , " said Professor Mike Edmunds .
Planetary display
The team was also able to decipher more of the text on the mechanism , doubling the amount of text that can now be read .
Combined with analysis of the dials , the inscriptions hint at the possibility that the Antikythera Mechanism could have also displayed planetary motions .
A reconstruction of the rear gears reveals their complexity
" Inscriptions mention the word ' Venus ' and the word ' stationary ' which would tend to suggest that it was looking at retrogressions of planets , " said Professor Edmunds .
" In my own view , it probably displayed Venus and Mercury , but some people suggest it may display many other planets . "
One of those people is Michael Wright .
His reconstruction of the device , with 72 gears , suggests it may have been an orrery that displayed the motions of the five known planets of the time .
" There is a feature on the front plate that could have made provision for a bearing with a spindle , that carried motion up to a mechanism used to model the planets of Mars , Jupiter and Saturn as well , " he told the BBC News website .
" That 's how I see it and my reconstruction shows it works well . "
Intriguingly , Mr Wright also believes the device was not a one - off .
" The designer and maker of the device knew what they wanted to achieve and they did it expertly ; they made no mistakes , " he said .
" To do this , it can't have been very far from their everyday stock work . "
The Antikythera Mechanism will be explored in an episode of Unearthing Mysteries on BBC Radio 4 on 12 December

As an experiment the dull gray houses were painted to different colours .
From my point of view it ’s really amazing is n’t it ?
In Russia where is in winter sun is a very rare thing such kind of art might keep the winter depression away .
For instance this fall - winter there were no visible sun in Moscow for more than 30 days .
Due to this it was reported that a lot of people simply refuse to go to work because of an enormous depressive state they were in .
Maybe such urbanistic art would keep the depression away .

We do n't think Richard Gere is going to like this one bit : Google appears to have rather carelessly mislaid the whole of Tibet , the once independent state turned autonomous region of China .
As a quick query on Google Earth confirms , Tibet is conspicuously absent from the search monolith 's database , which comes as something of a surprise since even Beijing decided to call the place the Tibet Autonomous Region ( TAR ) after its military occupation of the country which began in 1949 .
The rest , as we all know , is history .
While the Tibet issue has become one of Hollywood A - listers ' pet causes célèbres and an ongoing source of indignation to lovers of democracy worldwide , the Chinese have got on with the business of dragging the country kicking and screaming into the 21st century ( the Chinese version ) or systematically raping and pillaging a once beautiful land ( according to the pro-Tibet lobby ) .
The key to China 's development of Tibet is its military presence there .
Opponents of the regime reckon there to be anything up to 500,000 People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) personnel in the region .
Beijing says there are just three border guards and a small Yorkshire Terrier called Chairman Mao who acts as regimental mascot .
Well , we decided to go and have a look for ourselves - on Google Earth , naturally .
And before we start our short tour of Tibet , be warned that before trying this at home , bear in mind that the place is bloody vast and background information is scarce and often wildly inaccurate , especially with regard to Chinese military facilities .
Another caveat : we 're assuming for the purposes of our flight over Tibet that the country includes the Qinghai ( Amdo to the Tibetans ) province to its north - east , as claimed by some pro-Tibet forces :

In a community project , opened to various contributors , there are a few thing to take care of in order not to break the code .
I am not talking about code reviewing but about bad code editing that breaks it all .
Most frequent errors are :
< tab > insertions , that get mixed with space - based indentation
, that get mixed with space - based indentation carriage return insertion , before line feeds with some weird windows editors
Instead of tracking the developers that commited such things , and send them an army of white rabbits , an automatic code check is way better .
It is not a good idea though , to clean up incoming code .
The best thing to do is to block unwanted changes and warn the commiters , so they learn about it .
This is really easy with Subversion .
I have grabbed a script on the web , and adapted it a bit for this task .
Here it is :
#!/usr/bin/python2.4 # -*- coding : UTF - 8 -*- # adapted from : # http://blog.wordaligned.org/articles/2006/08/09/a-subversion-pre-commit-hook # by Tarek Ziadé from subprocess import Popen from subprocess import PIPE import re import os re_options = re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE | re.

I ’ve also added a new line at end of file control .
This script has to be called in the pre-commit hook script ( look up in SVN documentation )
The call should look like :
/ chemin/vers/script/svn_check_source.py " $ REPOS " " $ TXN " || exit 1
You can then extend the controls made by this script , by controlling for example the quality of the commited code with tools like pychecker .
But these extra controls should not block commits and should be quite light to perform because the commiter waits for the changeset to be validated .
Sending a mail to the commiter with suggestions when her code does n’t pass some quality checks is a better idea .
Furthermore , for an extensive QA test , it is simpler to hook a script on a system like buildbot and create a nighlty digest over the whole code base .
Pylint is very handy on this kind of controls , and can be fine tuned to generate a useful QA report that buildbot can send to developers .

A 500 - year old mystery surrounding the centerpiece of the alchemists ' lab kit has been solved by UCL ( University College London ) and Cardiff University archaeologists .
Since the Middle Ages , mixing vessels – or crucibles – manufactured in the Hesse region of Germany have been world renowned because of their ability to withstand strong reagents and high temperatures .
Previous work by the team has shown that Hessian crucibles have been found in archaeological sites across the world , including Scandinavia , Central Europe , Spain , Portugal , the UK , and even colonial America .
At the time , many people tried to reproduce them but always failed .
Now , writing in Nature , the researchers reveal using petrographic , chemical and X - ray diffraction analysis that Hessian crucible makers made use of an advanced material only properly identified and named in the 20th century .
Dr Marcos Martinón - Torres , of the UCL Institute of Archaeology , who led the study , explains : " Our analysis of 50 Hessian and non-Hessian crucibles revealed that the secret component in their manufacture is an aluminium silicate known as mullite ( Al 6 Si 2 O 13 ) .
" Today mullite is used in a wide range of modern conventional and advanced ceramics , such as building materials , electronic packaging devices , optical materials and catalytic converters , as well as in ceramic matrix composites such as thermal protection systems and liners for aircraft and stationary gas turbine engines .
" This material was only first described in the 20th century , though Hessian crucible makers were already taking advantage of this peculiar aluminium silicate 400 years earlier : they synthesised mullite by manufacturing their crucibles with kaolinitic clay and then firing them at temperatures above 1100 degrees .
" Mullite is extremely resistant to thermal , chemical and mechanical stresses , and that 's what made the crucibles so fit for their functions .
It is thanks to the availability of Hessian crucibles that the discovery of some elements and their thermochemical behaviour could take place .
" Crucible makers were not aware of mullite , but they mastered a very successful recipe , and that 's why they kept it constant , and secret , for centuries . "
Professor Ian Freestone , Cardiff School of History and Archaeology , said : " Manufacture of the crucibles used in early metallurgy and alchemy challenged the potters as they were required to withstand conditions more extreme than those required of other ceramics .
In this case we find that the properties of a material which we regard as modern and high - tech , in this case mullite , were being exploited centuries ago by craftsmen who had a limited scientific understanding of their products but a great deal of skill and ingenuity . "

Aspartame - The Worlds Best Ant Poison
contributed by Jan Jensen of WELLthy Choices
We live in the woods and carpenter ants are a huge problem .
We have spent thousands of dollars with Orkin and on ant poisons trying to keep them under control but nothing has helped .
So when I read somewhere that aspartame ( Nutrasweet ) was actually developed as an ant poison and only changed to being considered non-poisonous after it was realized that a lot more money could be made on it as a sweetener than as an ant poison , I decided to give it a try .
I opened two packets of aspartame sweetener , and dumped one in a corner of each of our bathrooms .
That was about 2 years ago and I have not seen any carpenter ants for about 9 to 12 months .
It works better than the most deadly poisons I have tried .
Any time they show up again , I simply dump another package of Nutrasweet in a corner , and they will be gone for a year or so again .
Since posting this information I have had many people tell me of their success solving ant problems with this substance , when nothing else worked .
We found later that small black ants would not eat the aspartame .
It was determined that if you mixed it with apple juice , they would quickly take it back to the nest , and all would be dead within 24 hours , usually .
I have found that sometimes it will kill them , and sometimes it does not .
Not sure why , may be slightly different species of ants or something .
Fire Ants :
We got our first fire ant hill about 2 weeks ago .
Poison did not work .
We tried aspartame and the ants ignored it until we got a light rain .
It was just a sprinkle , enough to moisten the Nutrasweet and ground , but not enough to wash it away .
They went crazy , hundreds of them grabbing it and taking it back into the mound .
When I checked the mound 2 days later , there was no sign of the fire ants .
I even dug the mound up some , and still saw none of them .
How does it Work : Aspartame is a neuropoison .
It most likely kills the ants by interfering with their nervous system .
It could be direct , like stopping their heart , or something more subtle like killing their sense of taste so they cant figure out what is eatable , or smell , so they cant follow their trails , or mis-identify their colonies members , so they start fighting each other .
Not sure what causes them to end up dying , just know that for many species of ants it will kill them quickly and effectively .
As with any poison I recommend wearing gloves and washing any skin areas that come in contact with this poison , and avoid getting it in your mouth , despite anything the labeling may indicate .
I suspect it will work for other insects such as yellow jackets as well , but have not tested that yet .
More information on this fantastic poison can be found at : www.dorway.com
New hope for Nick and Jessica ?
Get ready for the strangest Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson rumor yet : they ’re allegedly having an affair .
No , not with Dane Cook and Vanessa Minnillo , but with each other .
Gossip columnist Mike Walker of the National Enquirer claims that Simpson and Lachey have been meeting in San Fernando Valley hotels for trysts .
The pair have chosen “ discreet hotels ” in an attempt to fool the public , but apparently they were n’t discreet enough .
Jessica told a source for Walker , “ We still have our problems , but we 're still very attached to each other .
We still have the need for love and affection . ”

I can , but I won't .
Abstract :
Human free will is a product of evolution and contributes to the success of the human animal .
Useful robots will also require free will of a similar kind , and we will have to design it into them .
Free will is not an all - or - nothing thing .
Some agents have more free will , or free will of different kinds , than others , and we will try to analyze this phenomenon .
Our objectives are primarily technological , i.e. to study what aspects of free will can make robots more useful , and we will not try to console those who find determinism distressing .
We distinguish between having choices and being conscious of these choices ; both are important , even for robots , and consciousness of choices requires more structure in the agent than just having choices and is important for robots .
Consciousness of free will is therefore not just an epiphenomenon of structure serving other purposes .
Free will does not require a very complex system .
Young children and rather simple computer systems can represent internally ` `I can , but I wo n't '' and behave accordingly .
Naturally I hope this detailed design stance [ Dennett 1978 ] will help understand human free will .
It takes the compatibilist philosophical position .
There may be some readers interested in what the paper says about human free will and who are put off by logical formulas .
The formulas are not important for the arguments about human free will ; they are present for people contemplating AI systems using mathematical logic .
They can skip the formulas , but the coherence of what remains is not absolutely guaranteed .

McDonald 's Didn't Make Them Fat
I have a question for federal Judge Robert Sweet :
If your own children blamed McDonald 's for making them fat , would you buy it ?
I do n't think so .
Yet the judge has given the green light to a lawsuit against McDonald 's by two teenaged girls who claim the popular fast - food chain tricked them into eating food that made them fat and sick .
At first it looked as if this lawsuit was going to be pushed down the garbage disposal , but now it 's back .
What 's going on ?
Three years ago , the girls accused McDonald 's of deceptive advertising and selling unhealthy food .
Judge Sweet dismissed the suit because the allegations were too vague .
" Where should the line be drawn between an individual 's own responsibility to take care of herself and society 's responsibility to ensure others shield her ? " he asked .
" The complaint fails to allege the McDonald 's products consumed by the plaintiffs were dangerous in any way other than that which was open and obvious to a reasonable consumer . "
But he invited the plaintiffs to re-file it with more specific information .
Sure enough , they did , and last month , the judge ruled that the girls had identified to his satisfaction " 40 deceptive ads " and " sufficiently described " the harm McDonald 's food allegedly caused them : " obesity , hypertension and elevated levels of LDL cholesterol . "
Who knows what a jury will do when the lawyers play on its sympathy for the overweight girls .
Whether McDonald 's wins after a lengthy legal battle or loses and gets hit with a big damage award , you and I will pay through higher prices .
Our choice of foods could even be limited if fast - food chains decide it 's the only way to avoid future lawsuits .
Au revoir , French fries ?
Are we a nation of responsible adults or children ?
I do n't want government to be my Daddy any more than I want it to be my Big Brother .
Whatever happened to self - responsibility ?
Sure , McDonald 's commercials put the best spin on its products .
All advertisers do that .
Individuals should exercise caution , and parents should teach their kids a little skepticism .
It 's not as if information about nutrition is hard to come by .
Today we 're constantly harangued about cutting calories , reducing fat , and exercising more .
McDonald 's competitors , such as Subway , provide lots of counter - information .
You 'd have to live in a cave not to know about this stuff .
Fast food does n't have to make you fat .
Soso Whaley of New Hampshire once ate only at McDonald 's for a month .
The result ?
Unlike the guy who did the " Super Size Me " documentary , Soso lost 10 pounds , and her cholesterol dropped 40 points .
How ?
She did n't pig out .
Low - carb dieters have lost weight at McDonald 's by eating the burgers without the buns and skipping the fries .
All this goes to show that anyone whose health was harmed by eating at McDonald 's only has himself or herself to blame .
To bloat himself up an individual has to choose to enter the restaurant on a regular basis , overeat an unbalanced diet , and fail to exercise .
Should that person be able to pin his health problems on McDonald's ?
If so , where does it stop ?
You can get fat eating Girl Scout cookies or dining at expensive restaurants .
Should we sue someone whenever we do n't like the results of what we do ?
The consequence will be higher prices and fewer choices for consumers .
If that 's what our system of " justice " gives us , then something is badly wrong .
I want lower prices and more choices .
I 'm not saying people should n't be able to sue a business when they have been harmed .
But we should limit frivolous lawsuits the way the rest of the world does .
The loser should have to pay the legal bills of the winner .
It 's only fair .
It costs a lot of money to defend against a lawsuit , even a frivolous one .
Now mostly about programming and gamedev
Personal bookprinting
As commercial book publishing crashes , personal book publishing is booming .
Personal book making entails printing high - quality books in very small quantities , including quantities of one .
New technologies permit anyone to print one copy of a softcover or hardcover book , including all - color photo books .
These printed - on - demand books are indistinguishable from commercially printed books .
In fact , some of the books you buy on Amazon are manufactured with this same technology .
You just ca n’t tell the difference .
However , being able to print as few as one copy — instead of a minimum of a thousand — shifts the economics of bookmaking toward individuals with more passion than money .
For the past two years I ’ve been producing high - quality books in very small quantities using several different services .
I ’ve shown these finished books around to many people , including those in the New York publishing industry and media , and everyone has agreed the quality is first class .
Several of the photo books I ’ve made look like coffee - table artworks , and cost about the same , yet I can produce them one by one on demand .
I ’ve also made text only books which appear to be store - bought trade paperbacks or hardcover books from the bookstore .
Having tried most of the services available and created dozens of books , I ’m ready to recommend the best services to use .
My advice is slightly complicated , because the success of book making and book publishing pivots around your aims .
To turn a text manuscript into a regular book , either softcover or hard , I recommend Lulu .
Their website has a very thorough step - by - step process which will enable you to make a book with the least amount of money .
A 100 - page trade softcover book in black and white will cost about $ 7 to print .
Lulu will walk you through the edit , design , and production sequence .
They offer templates you can follow .
Once in digital form , you can easily order one book or many .
Lulu will also offer help in getting your book out into the world , but it ca n’t really help you market or sell it .
That will be your job as a self - publisher .
If you are a more sophisticated book maker with your own design skills you can send Lulu a PDF file of your designed book , and simply have them print it , at the same prices .
This is the way I use them .
Finally , Lulu can also print full color books , including smaller full - color paperbacks .
( These could run $ 20 - 30 a piece for 150 pages )
The overall process of getting a book printed is smooth and fairly hassle free .
My recommendation for the best personal color book printer is Blurb .
Blurb produces color books very similar to the iPhoto books you can order from Apple .
Using iPhoto Books is slightly easier than using Blurb ’s software , particularly if all your photos happen to already be in iPhoto , but it works well enough .
The idea is that you can drag images ( photos or illustrations ) into template book pages , add text or captions where you want to , then hit a button and have the finished book mailed to you .
( all these systems work with PCs and Macs )
A few of the books I ’ve made in copies of one .
The results from both Apple and Blurb are marvelous .
In fact , these books are astounding .
That ’s because they both use the same back - room engine , the HP Indigo 5000 ( as do the other color book makers like Snapfish and MyPublisher ) .
The Indigio is essentially a high - speed , high - quality liquid - toner printer that will print your photo book several pages across .
( Lulu on the other hand uses a dry toner process called iGen3 from Xerox )
The final result of a Indigo - printed page is a very richly colored , very finely detailed image .
It looks like a page from a color magazine .
The color - match is pretty close to the image you see on your monitor , with this exception : I ’ve notice that printing on paper is far less forgiving of blurred or out of focus images .
The human eye notices less - than - perfect sharpness on the page more than on the screen , so you have to be far more ruthless in your editing when making a book .
While Apple and Blurb both produce lovely printed books with well - crafted covers ( in quantities of one ) , Blurb does it for a lot less money .
A 100 - page book of photographs will cost $ 100 with Apple iPhoto Books , but only $ 39 with Blurb .
They are currently printed on the same machines .
Blurb also offers more options for working directly from PDFs .
Recently they announced an easy way to make a printed book version of your blog ( or any part of your blog ) which I have not tried yet , but will soon .
Apple actually subcontracts their bookmaking to MyPublisher , so this is not their focus .
Blurb , however , besides having the best prices , is the most dedicated to servicing the widening long - tail of personal book making .
For instance Blurb has noticed that while most people start out by ordering one copy of a personal book , they quickly come back for more .
Ordering 50 or more copies is not uncommon .
Furthermore , once people discover how easy it is to make a book , they make a lot of them .
Maybe several a year .
A book has an authority and weight that is not easily dismissed in this digital world .
For instance , some people have discovered that by mailing out very nice books out of their reports , business plans , or even Powerpoint presentations they got more attention and calls back because “ people wo n’t throw a book out ! ”
I ’ve also played around with different sized books .
MyPublisher offers a truly coffee - table size photobook ( $ 60 ) that is very impressive .
I filled it with snapshots from a trip to Italy we made one year .
At the other end of scale , I ’ve made a number of itsy - bitsy books the size of a deck of cards with Apple iPhoto and MyPublisher books .
I was first handed one of these diminutive works by a photographer who was using this cute booklet as her portfolio .
Cool .
I ’ve made little ones this size devoted to curious themes just to hand out .
There are tons of reasons why people make personal books .
Artists can use a clean trim hardcover book as their portable gallery .
Cookbooks take on a higher class production when you can add photos of your dishes .
I even saw one Blurb - produced book that was a reproduction of a relative ’s old typewritten manuscript of poetry .
It had a lot of soul .
Several friends who were scrapbook enthusiasts decided to switch to classy photobooks ( everything is scanned first ) when they saw the tidy fit - and - finish of the Blurb books .
Photobooks are hot mementos for reunions .
We now make a photobook from all our vacations .
I attended one hi-tech conference recently at which everyone got an instant Indigo - produced color book summarizing the conference , pictures and all .
At some of the foundations I am involved in , we ’ve used hard cover color books of a fun meeting or trip as perfect gifts for potential funders .
And nowadays Blurb books are inexpensive enough that some high school kids are making their own full - color alternative anti-yearbooks .
Most information in the world today is digital and has no need to ever leave the screen .
But the more personal your expression is , and the more personal the audience , the greater the impact you get by making the information tangible .
For making text in black and white , use Lulu .
For making color pages , use Blurb .
Lulu has great online tutorials , and Blurb has released a meta - book , a book which tells you how to make a book .
It ’s quite well done , with solid advice useful no matter where you get it printed .
While you can purchase a Blurb - made hard copy of this book , they also wisely offer a free downloadable PDF version .

Tens of millions of Americans want President George W. Bush to be impeached for the lies and deceit he used to launch an illegal war and for violating his oath of office to uphold the US Constitution .
Millions of other Americans want Bush turned over to the war crimes tribunal at the Hague .
The true fate that awaits Bush is psychiatric incarceration .
The president of the United States is so deep into denial that he is no longer among the sane .
Delusion still rules
Bush three weeks after the American people repudiated him and his catastrophic war in elections that delivered both House and Senate to the Democrats in the hope that control over Congress would give the opposition party the strength to oppose the mad occupant of the White House .
On November 28 Bush insisted that US troops would not be withdrawn from Iraq until he had completed his mission of building a stable Iraqi democracy capable of spreading democratic change in the Middle East .
Bush made this astonishing statement the day after NBC News , a major television network , declared Iraq to be in the midst of a civil war , a judgment with which former Secretary of State Colin Powell concurs .
The same day that Bush reaffirmed his commitment to building a stable Iraqi democracy , a secret US Marine Corps intelligence report was leaked .
According to the Washington Post , the report concludes : " the social and political situation has deteriorated to a point that US and Iraqi troops are no longer capable of militarily defeating the insurgency in al - Anbar province . "
The Marine Corps intelligence report says that al - Qaeda is the " dominant organization of influence " in Anbar province , and is more important than local authorities , the Iraqi government and US troops " in its ability to control the day - to - day life of the average Sunni . "
Bushs astonishing determination to deny Iraq reality was made the same day that the US - installed Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki and US puppet King Abdullah II of Jordan abruptly cancelled a meeting with Bush after Bush was already in route to Jordan on Air Force One .
Bush could not meet with Maliki in Iraq , because violence in Baghdad is out of control .
For security reasons , the US Secret Service would not allow President Bush to go to Iraq , where he is " building a stable democracy . "
Bush made his astonishing statement in the face of news leaks of the Iraq Study Groups call for a withdrawal of all US combat forces from Iraq .
The Iraq Study Group is led by Bush family operative James A. Baker , a former White House chief of staff , former Secretary of the Treasury , and former Secretary of State .
Baker was tasked by father Bush to save the son .
Apparently , son Bush hasnt enough sanity to allow himself to be saved .
Bushs denial of Iraqi reality was made even as one of the most influential Iraqi Shi’ite leaders , Moqtada al - Sadr , is building an anti-US parliamentary alliance to demand the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
Maliki himself appears on the verge of desertion by his American sponsors .
The White House has reportedly " lost confidence " in Malikis " ability to control violence . "
Fox " News " disinformation agency immediately began blaming Maliki for the defeat the US has suffered in Iraq .
NY Governor Pataki told Fox " News " that " Maliki is not doing his job . "
Pataki claimed that US troops were doing " a great job . "
A number of other politicians and talking heads joined in the scapegoating of Maliki .
No one explained how Maliki can be expected to save Iraq when US troops cannot provide enough security for the Iraqi government to go outside the heavily fortified " green zone " that occupies a small area of Baghdad .
If the US Marines cannot control Anbar province , what chance is there for Maliki ?
What can Maliki do if the security provided by US troops is so bad that the president of the US cannot even visit the country ?
The only people in Iraq who are safe belong to al - Qaeda and the Sunni insurgents or are Shi’ite militia leaders such as al - Sadr .
An American group , the Center for Constitutional Rights , has filed war crimes charges in Germany against former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
A number of former US attorneys believe President Bush and Vice President Cheney deserve the same .
Bush has destroyed the entire social , political , and economic fabric of Iraq .
Saddam Hussein sat on the lid of Pandoras Box of sectarian antagonisms , but Bush has opened the lid .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed as " collateral damage " in Bushs war to bring " stable democracy " to Iraq .
Tens of thousands of Iraqi children have been orphaned and maimed .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have fled their country .
The Middle East is aflame with hatred of America , and the ground is shaking under the feet of American puppet governments in the Middle East .
US casualties ( killed and wounded ) number 25,000 .
And Bush has not had enough !
What better proof of Bushs insanity could there be ?
" FOX stupid " is a new label I have for this trash .
Ca n't they just attack his name ?
John Gibson , a resident Bush Cultist , has a segment devoted to Obama smoking ciggies .
Yes , enquiring minds want to know why " nobody sees him smoking . "

「何人も のGoogle社員がフルタイムでFirefoxのコードを書いている」---米Googleのエンジニアで，Firefoxの開発者でもあるDarin Fisher氏は4月30日，イベント 「 Mozilla Party JP 7.0 」 で，GoogleとオープンソースWebブラウザFirefoxの関係についてこう語った（写真1）。また次期版であるFirefox2およびFirefox3の構想についても解説した。
Mozilla Party は，Mozilla関連ソフトウエアのユーザー・コミュニティであるもじら組が主催するイベントである。
Darin Fisher氏 は2000 年に 米Netscape Communicationsに入社し，米IBMを経て一年半前にGoogleに入社。Mozillaソフトウエアの開発を業務で，またコミュニティで行ってきた。現在，Google社員としてFirefoxの開発にあたっている。Googleには，ほかにも何人もの技術者がフルタイムでFirefoxの開発にあたっているという。
ほかにも ，Googleは以下のような形でFirefoxをサポートしている（写真2）。
・ Google はFirefoxのホームページをホストしている。
・ Google はFirefoxを改善するため技術的にダイレクトな貢献を行っており，次期版Firefox2の目玉となる機能に深くかかわっている。
・マーケティングでの支援 （Google Firefox+googleツールバーキャンペーンなど。またGoogleの広告「Adsense」でFirefoxを紹介，Adsenseを見た人がFirefoxをインストールした場合に報酬を支払うキャンペーンも実施）
・ Google Safe Browsing ，Google Web Acceleratorな どFirefoxの拡張機能を開発
・ Googleツールバーなどのブラウザ機能拡張ツールをFirefoxに移植
Google がFirefoxを支援する理由について，Fisher氏は「 Webブラウザが一つの製品だけで占められると競争がなくなり，イノベーションが起きにくくなる。競争があることがイノベーションを促進する」と語る。
また講演に合わせて，元Netscape社員で現在米Googleの技術者である桃井勝彦氏が，Mozilla Foundationを撮影したビデオが放映された。Mozilla Foundation はGoogleのはす向かいと，両者は地理的にきわめて近い場所にあるという。
次期 版Firefox 2はユーザビリティに注力
次期 版Firefox 2 は，開発コー ド「 Bon Echo」という名称で，現在アルファ版が公開されている。正式版は2006年第3四半期にリリースを予定している。「
Firefox 2はユーザビリティの改善にフォーカスしている」（Fisher氏）。
まずRSSフィード機能が改善される。RSSフィードを感知すると，ユーザーが使用するRSSリーダーを尋ねて，そのリーダーに登録するようにする。また検索テキストボックスに，どのサーチエンジンを使用しているか表示し，サーチボックスの大きさを変えられるようにする。
Googleが開発した，フィッシングを警告機能を標準で備えるようになる。Google safe browsingである。Googleのラボで開発された機能で，コンテンツを分析してフィッシングに使用されている可能性を判定する。Googleツールバーに組み込まれているが，Firefox 2.0では本体に取り込まれる。
Firefox 3ではブックマークと履歴を統合
また次次期版であ るFirefox 3の計画についても紹介された。ブックマークと履歴を統合する，Placeと呼ぶ機能が新しく実装される。Cairoと呼ぶ新しいレンダリング・エンジンを搭載。メモリー利用効率とパフォーマンスの改善を行う。
また ，Whatと呼ぶ，ローカルにデータを保存する機能をサポートする。WhatはMozilla，Apple，Operaが参加するWthatワーキング・グループで標準化が行われている仕様。cookieの拡張だが，cookieのようにデータそのものをHTTPリクエストに含めることはない（写真3）。
W3Cで標準化が行われている ，Cross-domain XMLHttpRequestも実装する予定である。
また，ユーザー・インタフェース記述言語であるXUL（ズール）を実行するためのモジュール「XULRunner」の開発も進行している。XULはMozillaが開発している言語で，FirefoxやThunderbirdはXULで記述されている。またiTunesのクローンSongbirdや健康管理ソフトSimoHealthなど，Mozilla
Foundation以外のアプリケーションにもXULで開発されたものが出てきた。XULの実行環境はアプリケーションと一緒に配布されていたが，実行環境を単体で配布することで「ダウンロードサイズの小さい，クロスプラットフォーム・アプリケーション」（Fisher氏）が流通する可能性が出てくる。

The airline is a source of prestige for Morocco
The company says that in the past its workers have abused the privilege of praying , by taking too much time away from their desks and their customers .
But the airline 's workers as well as Islamist politicians say it is part of a crackdown on their religious freedom .
Praying is one of the five pillars of Islam and regarded as a crucial part of a Muslim 's way of life .
The state airline , partly owned by the Moroccan royal family , is a great source of pride and prestige in the country .
HAVE YOUR SAY Royal Air Morocco obviously has absolutely no respect for Islam
Moustapha Aramid
Send us your comments
But this latest move threatens to exacerbate divisions in Morocco .
Workers say that they have been banned from praying at work and that a number of prayer rooms have been closed and that they are forbidden from going to the mosque during work hours .
The company would not give an interview but issued a statement saying that while there is no official ban on praying , they had to do something to stop people taking lengthy breaks away from work .
But critics say the issue of praying , like the veil , is part of a more sinister move to rob the country of its Islamic roots .
Political
" I feel very angry about this decision , " says Moustapha Aramid from the Islamic Party for Justice and Development .
" Moroccans have had their liberty and their religious freedom taken away from them .
It is very damaging .
Royal Air Morocco obviously has absolutely no respect for Islam . "
Analysts say the ban on prayers is really a political move aimed at stamping out radical Islamism .
When an alleged terrorist cell - Ansar el - Mehdi - was broken up earlier this year - two of the suspects charged were the wives of two Royal Air Morocco pilots .
There is a feeling that the company had to do something to respond .
Other complaints from airline staff are that pilots and stewards were not allowed to fast during the month of Ramadan and that female staff are not allowed to wear the veil - although that has been an unwritten rule at many companies for several years .
These issues are becoming a focal point for some very hard questions being asked of this moderate Arabic country - something that is causing serious friction between liberals and traditionalists .

The Israeli military said a civilian vessel was also hit by rockets during the attack but could not confirm its nationality or if there were casualties .
An Israeli spokeswoman said : " During a navy operation off the Lebanese coast a missile ship was hit and we have four crew members missing .

The nuclear watchdog 's work to promote safe nuclear energy was also commended .
Mr ElBaradei said the award recognised that the spread of nuclear weapons was the world 's worst security threat .
Speaking at IAEA headquarters in Vienna , the Egyptian - born diplomat said he had learnt of the decision at home from live TV .
It [ the IAEA ] is not an organisation that has conducted peace activities - it is very disappointing

He began a third term at the IAEA last month after the US withdrew complaints that he was being " soft " on Iran .
Congratulating the prize - winners , the White House said the award underlined the importance of stopping nuclear weapons proliferation .
Ole Danboly Mjopes , head of the prize committee , stressed the award was not intended as a " kick in the shin " of any nation or leader but as a boost to disarmament .
' Policeman and salesman '
IAEA inspectors have had to deal with major crises in Iraq , North Korea and Iran in recent years as well as investigating the nuclear black market led by Pakistani scientist AQ Khan .
That the world has achieved little in this respect makes active opposition to nuclear arms all the more important today

The BBC News website 's Paul Reynolds notes that Mr ElBaradei , 63 , makes his impact with expert analysis while remaining a fair judge .
But critics accuse the IAEA of failing to prove conclusively whether or not Iran 's nuclear ambitions are peaceful , among other things .
And opponents of nuclear civilian energy condemn the agency 's parallel commitment to civilian atomic power .
In the words of Greenpeace International , Mr ElBaradei is both " nuclear policeman and nuclear salesman " .
This year 's contest saw 199 names put forward - a record number .
21ST CENTURY PRIZEWINNERS
2005 : Mohamed ElBaradei and the IAEA 2004 : Wangari Maathai , Kenyan environmental campaigner 2003 : Shirin Ebadi , Iranian human rights lawyer 2002 : Jimmy Carter , former US president 2001 : Kofi Annan , UN secretary general 2000 : Kim Dae-jung , former South Korean president
Hidankyo , a Japanese association representing survivors of the 1945 atomic bomb attacks , said the decision in Oslo was " very disappointing " .
The IAEA , said Hidankyo secretary general Terumi Tanaka , was " not an organisation that has conducted peace activities " .
The annual international peace prize , worth $ 1.29 m ( £ 725,000 ) , has been awarded since 1901 , after its establishment by Swedish industrialist and inventor Alfred Nobel .
In keeping with tradition , it will be awarded in the Norwegian capital while the other Nobel prizes - for excellence in physics , chemistry , medicine and literature - are awarded in Stockholm .
To consider whether U.S. President George W. Bush is winning his “ global war on terror ” ( GWOT ) five years after al - Qaeda ’s devastating 9/11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon , one has only to look at the news of the past few days .
In Afghanistan , where the war began , NATO and U.S. forces are struggling to cope with a resurgent Taliban whose guerrillas have killed some two dozen western troops , including two U.S. soldiers in a suicide bombing in Kabul Friday , since Sep. 1 .
NATO ’s U.S. commander , Gen. James L. Jones , admitted Thursday that the alliance was going through a “ difficult period ” and needs as many as 2,500 more troops , as well as additional aircraft , to bolster ongoing operations in southern Afghanistan , significant parts of which have reportedly fallen under the effective  if not yet permanent  control of the Taliban .
The government of neighboring Pakistan , meanwhile , has agreed to withdraw its troops from northern Waziristan , effectively returning full control of the region  as it did in southern Waziristan last year  to tribal militias dominated by close allies of the Taliban .
The deal , which reportedly includes the government ’s releasing al - Qaeda suspects in exchange for what is regarded here as the militias ’ highly dubious pledge to stop cross - border attacks into Afghanistan , has revived a high - level debate  last engaged immediately after 9/11  over whether President Pervez Musharraf ’s regime is , on balance , a help or a hindrance in Washington ’s anti-terrorist war .
The news out of Iraq , which both Osama bin Laden and Bush agree should be considered the “ central battlefield ” in the war between the west and radical Islamists , is hardly more encouraging .
Hopeful assertions by senior officials earlier this year that as many as 30,000 U.S. troops could go home by this fall if security improves have yielded to the fact , confirmed by the Pentagon late last month , that there are now 140,000 troops in theater  10,000 more than the beginning of the summer  due to growing sectarian violence and ethnic cleansing in Baghdad .
Moreover , Thursday ’s report by the Baghdad morgue that the number of killings last month fell only modestly from the all - time high of nearly 1,855 in July contradicted the Pentagon ’s claim earlier this week that the additional deployment had succeeded in cutting the death toll in half .
And when combined with reports of increased killings in nearby towns and villages , it tended to confirm what senior U.S. military officers have been publicly suggesting for the past month : that Iraq is indeed moving toward civil war which U.S. Forces may be able to slow , but not stop .
Bush himself has seemed in recent appearances to recognize that Iraq is going badly .
After long insisting that the country was making “ progress ” on a variety of fronts , Bush has dropped the word from his Iraq vocabulary and focused instead on the potentially catastrophic consequences for the war on terror if the U.S. withdraws .
Meanwhile , however , the impact of the Iraq war on Muslim “ hearts and minds , ” on which the fate of that war his administration itself has said will depend , has been devastating , according to recent surveys of opinion in Islamic countries stretching from Morocco to Indonesia .
“ As the slaughter [ in Iraq ] continues , ” according to an essay this week by Alon Ben -Meir , an Israeli international relations professor at New York University , “ the Arab and Muslim world are increasingly enraged over the plight of the Iraqi people , with hatred toward the United States reaching new heights . ”
Adding to that fury , of course , was last month ’s war between Israel and Hezbollah , depicted in a speech this week by Bush as a proxy battle between the United States and Iran and an integral part of his “ war on terrorism . ”
It succeeded not only in inflaming anti-U.S. opinion throughout the Islamic world , including , significantly , the Shi’ite majority in Iraq , according to most regional experts here , but also in weakening the Sunni - dominated governments  notably Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Jordan  that , as before 9/11 , remain Washington ’s only allies in the region .
While devastating Lebanon , whose 2005 “ Cedar Revolution ” had been hailed by Bush as a landmark in his efforts to “ transform ” the Middle East , the war effectively elevated Hezbollah to hero status  including , significantly , for the region ’s increasingly popular Sunni Muslim Brotherhood .
It also bolstered the positions of its chief sponsors , Syria and Iran , which , along with Hamas and Hezbollah , Bush recently lumped together with al - Qaeda as “ Islamic fascists . ”
To many critics , Bush ’s expansion of his terrorist target list beyond al - Qaeda , and particularly to Iraq and perceived enemies of Israel , has been one of the great strategic mistakes in the conduct of his war on terror by effectively transforming what was originally a terrorist criminal conspiracy led by al - Qaeda with the tacit support of the Taliban to a “ wide war extending from Lebanon through Afghanistan , ” as Amb .
James Dobbins , Washington ’s top envoy in negotiations during and after the Afghanistan war , recently put it .
“ In a search for moral clarity , the administration has tried to divide the Middle East into good guys and bad guys , ” he told an audience at the New America Foundation ( NAF ) late last month .
“ America tends to treat Middle East diplomacy as a win / lose or zero-sum game in which Syrian , Iranian , Hezbollah or Hamas gains are by definition American losses and vice - versa . ”
“ The result , of course , is the United States always loses , because if you insist that the population of the region choose between Syria , Iran , Hezbollah , and Hamas , on the one hand , or the United States and Israel , on the other , they are going to choose the other side every time , ” said Dobbins , who currently directs international security programs at the RAND Corporation .
In that context , Washington ’s enthusiastic support for Israel in its war against Hezbollah could prove as counter - productive to its war against terrorism as the decision to go to war with Iraq without U.N. approval .
Coming at a time when al - Qaeda had been successfully expelled from Afghanistan , its operational capabilities severely reduced , and its top leaders either captured or forced into hiding , the Iraq invasion , by appearing to demonstrate that the United States was indeed bent on conquest in the heart of the Islamic world , gave the group new life and new recruits and affiliates .
It effectively sowed dragon ’s teeth not only in the region , but among disaffected Muslims in Western Europe , as well .
Washington might still have been able to limit the damage by engaging Syria and Iran , as well as other regional powers , in efforts to stabilize Iraq after the war  as it had with Afghanistan ’s neighbors , including Iran , after the ouster of the Taliban .
But , given its drive for “ moral clarity ” and over - confidence in military power , it rejected the two countries ’ overtures .
“ Five years after 9/11 , the United States is losing the war on terrorism , ” declared Flynt Leverett , who headed the Middle East desk at the National Security Council during Bush ’s first term , at a forum at the libertarian CATO Institute here Friday .
( Inter Press Service )
A study conducted at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center has shown that DNA itself can be a catalyst for cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma .
Normal DNA is said to become problematic when it twists in the opposite direction to its familiar right hand spiral , thereby becoming what researchers have dubbed Z - DNA .
The team working on the study , appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , claim that their pioneering research shows that contorted DNA is responsible for rupturing otherwise healthy DNA in mammals .
“ Our study shows that DNA itself can act as a mutagen , resulting in genetic instability , ” says Karen Vasquez , lead author of the study and assistant professor of carcinogenesis at M. D. Anderson ’s Science Park Research Division .
“ The discovery opens up a new field of inquiry into the role of DNA shape in genomic instability and cancer , ” Vasquez added .
Most people would have come across images of the familiar right - hand DNA spiral , so it ’s easy to visualize the spiral being twisted in the opposite direction .
Unfortunately the DNA spiral is n’t up to that kind of treatment , so the base pairs of the resulting left - hand spiral of the Z - DNA are left jagged , zigzagging and structurally unsound .
The deformed shape of the Z - DNA , says Vasquez , puts so much extra strain on the DNA molecule that it fractures and breaks apart .
Vasquez and her team have managed to locate where the most vulnerable DNA sequences are likely to reside , with mutagen Z - DNA found to correspond with genetic “ hot spots . ”
Genetic hot spots are comprised of DNA pools that are the most susceptible to genetic reorganization linked to cancer .
The team has already shown this to be true in patients with certain types of cancers , with 90 percent of Burkitt ’s lymphoma patients displaying DNA breaks that match regions liable to transform into Z - DNA .
The discovery that DNA can mutate into other shapes is not new to science , but Vasquez ’s latest study actually shows how these mutated shapes occur within the cell .
Previous studies found that the likelihood of Z - DNA forming at all is subject to the shape of the base pairs themselves .
It is said , for example , that a consecutive sequence of CG 14 times over would likely form Z - DNA , while a consecutive sequence of AT would not .
Based on these genomic studies , says Vasquez , the percentage of DNA sequences likely to form Z - DNA is 0.25 percent of the genome .
The discovery that rogue DNA can have a mutagen effect on DNA stability has far reaching implications , as the team ’s experiments demonstrate .
Together with post - doctoral fellow Guliang Wang , Vasquez made pieces of DNA designed to form the Z - DNA shape .
The team then implanted these manufactured Z - DNA segments ( plasmids ) into both bacterial and human cells with the intention of cracking them open at a later date to see what happened to the normal DNA .
While the Z - DNA did cause some minor DNA deletions in the bacteria , it caused widespread cell deletion and DNA molecule rearrangement in the human cell .
“ We discovered that bacterial cells and human cells process the Z - DNA in different ways , ” she said .
“ We are n’t sure why , but we think that the DNA repair machinery may be involved in processing the Z - DNA structure differently in bacteria versus human cells . ”
The next step in this research will be for scientists to understand how to prevent or limit certain types of breakages associated with Z - DNA , and why certain areas in the genome , such as “ hot spots , ” make DNA more prone to transformation while other similar areas do not .
“ If we could understand the players involved in this process , we might be able to prevent the generation of these breaks , ” says Vasquez .
“ For example , if certain types of cell stress lead to breaks , we might be able to find ways to reduce those stresses and prevent breaks . ”

Jerusalem , Israel ( AHN ) - A senior Bush administration official said Wednesday that if asked , the US is likely to grant Israel additional military aid to cover the costs of its recent war against Hezbollah .
The unnamed diplomat told The Jerusalem Post that " a request has not yet come , " but if it does , " we would consider it seriously . "
According to Israeli officials cited by the report , Jerusalem is hoping to fold its aid request into a larger American financial package aimed at helping to rebuild war - torn southern Lebanon .
The US official went on to say that Washington viewed Israel as the military victor in the recent conflict , but noted the Jewish state had lost from political standpoint .
" The people in Lebanon did not understand " Israel 's need to attack certain civilian infrastructures , he said , " and that allowed Hezbollah to say Israel was punishing them , " which " damaged Israel politically . "
He suggested Israel begin to fix its image by initiating peace talks with Lebanon .
Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora , however , announced on Wednesday that his nation would be the last in the Arab world to make peace with the Jewish state .

The Low Point — a View from the Valley — Column 11
The Land of " Nothing for free "
On the map , Laguna Niguel looks like a beautiful Pacific coastal area south of Los Angeles , a little like one of my favorite spots Monterey , south of San Francisco .
But I forgot ; this is Los Angeles , where the brown haze of the air lies like a thick blanket over the insane sprawl of " Generica " .
It 's an endless landscape of McDonalds , strip - malls and gas stations familiar to anyone who has seen the movie " Ghost World " .
Nothing is free here .
You pay for parking ( nothing but valet available ) , driving on toll roads , access to much of the beach ( private ) .
If they could figure out how to charge for the air I 'm sure there 'd be meters every block or so .
It 's a fitting home for the entertainment industry .
I was down there to give a talk on " Open Source Business Models " for a conference .
Also represented were entertainment industry lawyers , " Big Telecom " management , and a smattering of software people .
Microsoft was there of course .
You can't hold a church fete with " Open Source " on the banner these days without Microsoft turning up and requesting representation .
At least we also had Bruce Perens on our side to help make up the balance .
The venue was an unbelievably expensive hotel .
Even though I was on expenses I balked at asking the company to pay for a room there and found something cheaper ( not by much ) a few miles down the road .
Along with the collection of apologists for the " ultimate evils " ( tm ) of Hollywood and Telephone companies there were some very interesting presentations .
A Japanese telecoms researcher made all the software people jealous by describing the idyllic state of broadband in Japan , where providers vie to sell gigabit fiber - optic pipes to the home .
Yes , you read that right , Gigabit .
The obvious question was asked ; " what do people use all that bandwidth for " and the less than obvious answer was that they use it for all the same things people in less bandwidth - friendly countries do , they just do more of it .
I could see a collective shudder pass through the entertainment industry people .
They knew what that meant .
A keynote by Lawrence Lessig made the point even further .
He showed a series of " mash - ups " of copyrighted material which were incredibly creative and funny .
All completely illegal and currently being hunted off the Internet by entertainment industry lawyers .
One of the most amusing asides was from a Walt Disney legal reply to a parent requesting " fair use " rights to use some clips from a Disney movie to put in his home video .
He pleadingly promised them it was meant only for family viewing .
" We currently deny all requests to use our material .... " .
Even if you are impudent enough to ask , the answer is always no .
At least one of the other studios replied that the current commercial rate was $ 700 to use a 30 second clip .
I can see that being popular amongst parents making home movies .
He also covered the current patent quagmire .
A very interesting fact from his talk was that the total unit cost for a Chinese manufacturer to build a DVD player was around $ 26 .
However the total royalty fees they have to pay to western companies for the patent rights to build a player is $ 21 per unit , thus completely eliminating any profit they might make .
No wonder the Chinese are currently creating their own digital video standard , completely incompatible with Western ones .
It 's the only thing that makes economic sense for them .
This is almost certainly behind the Chinese refusal to use the new WiFi standards for wireless devices also .
I ended up making myself unpopular by publicly attacking the Washington - based economist who 'd advised the Clinton Administration on " Intellectual Property " issues .
It 's a very personal issue for me as it affects my everyday life and work , so when he made the statement that " strengthening the patent system leads to more innovation for everyone " I saw red .
He does n't write software of course .
I tried to explain later in private that it would be like people being able to patent economic theories in his line of work .
That began to hit home , but he explained that the problem in Washington is that patents are heavily pushed to the politicians by the Pharmaceutical Industry .
" These guys say they 're going to cure cancer , what are you going to do for us ? " is the request that anti-software patent lobbyists have to learn to counter .
My panel was rather uncontroversial , Microsoft , Bruce Perens and myself being on our best behavior .
The only sparks that flew where when Microsoft made it abundantly clear that they would use their patent portfolio to prevent the spread of GPL software .
Section seven of the GPL ( the implicit patent grant of the license ) now looks like the most prescient writing Richard Stallman has ever done .
If you 're not familiar with it I 'd suggest you read it and understand why using the GPL to protect your Free Software is so important .
Fireworks only exploded in the session on business models in the Internet age for entertainment industry products ( music CD 's mainly ) .
This was even before the horrendous vandalism perpetrated by Sony on Windows users by propagating a rootkit as part of a digital rights management product on Sony CD's .
Let 's be clear , these people hate the Internet .
If they had a single - use time machine they 'd rather use it to go back in time and kill everyone responsible for creating TCP / IP than prevent the Second World War .
The movie industry sees what has happened with CD's , looks at the gigabit bandwidth available in Japan and they know they 're next .
They will do anything to prevent it , pass any law , remove any civil right or fair use provision that gets in their way .
I began to understood this when I had a discussion with a lawyer who was arguing that " we just need stiffer penalties , we need to make an example of people swapping files on the Internet " .
To which I responded , " why do n't we just execute people who break the speed limit ? " .
Does anyone remember the slogan that used to be printed on vinyl records , " Home taping is illegal and is killing music " ?
When enough people decide that an activity is legal , in a democracy such a thing eventually becomes legal .
Look at the way the drug laws have changed in Europe .
It 's a sign of how damaged American democracy has become that the same thing has n't happened here .
The Internet is a massive threat to some people , and if we do n't fight to keep it , we deserve to lose it .
I 'll end with a " fair use " quote from one of my favorite 70's bands , Hawkwind which seems appropriate somehow , and append one line of my own :
Welcome to the oceans in a labeled can ,
Welcome to the dehydrated lands ,
Welcome to the self police parade ,
Welcome to the neo - golden age ,
Welcome to the days you 've made
Welcome to the land of " Nothing for free " .
The smallest form of life known to science just got smaller .
Four million of the newly discovered microbe -- assuming the discovery , reported Friday in the journal Science , is confirmed -- could fit into the period at the end of this sentence .
Scientists found the microbes living in a remarkably inhospitable environment , drainage water as caustic as battery acid from a mine in Northern California .
The microbes , members of an ancient family of organisms known as archaea , formed a pink scum on green pools of hot mine water laden with toxic metals , including arsenic .
" It was amazing , " said Jillian Banfield of UC Berkeley , a member of the discovery team .
" These were totally new . "
In their paper , the scientists call the microbes " smaller than any other known cellular life form . "
Scientists say the discovery could bear on estimates of the pervasiveness of exotic microbial life , which some experts suspect forms a hidden biosphere extending miles underground whose total mass may exceed that of all surface life .
It may also influence the search for microscopic life forms elsewhere in the solar system , a discovery that would prove that life in the universe is not unique to Earth but an inherent property of matter .
The tiny microbes came from an abandoned mine at Iron Mountain in Shasta County that produced gold , silver , iron and copper , closing in 1963 .
Today , rain and surface water run over exposed minerals , producing sulfuric acid .
The mine is one of the largest Superfund cleanup sites .
Starting in 2002 , the scientists obtained drops of the acidic slime and searched for genetic signs of novel microbes .
" We were essentially looking for new stuff , " Brett Baker said in a statement , " and we found it . "
The microbes are about 200 nanometers wide -- the size of large viruses , which scientists consider lifeless because they cannot reproduce on their own .
Bacteria average about five times that size .
The scientists must do further tests to confirm that the organisms are the smallest ever found , and that they can reproduce .
If those analyses hold up , they said in their Science paper , " it may be necessary to reconsider existing paradigms for the minimum requirements for life . "

Bob Dylan Musical Will Lose $ 10 Million , Insiders Say
Monday , October 09 , 2006

Bob Dylan Musical | Penelope Cruz | ' Bobby ' | Annie Lennox Remixed
Bob Dylan Musical Could Lose $ 10 Million
The much - touted musical " The Times They Are A - Changin ' " is a financial and artistic disaster , insiders tell me .
Producers of the troubled show that features the music of Bob Dylan set to dance pieces by the legendary Twyla Tharp now fear a total loss when the show opens on Oct. 26 .
" We 'll lose all $ 10 million , " predicted one insider who knows the score .
" It 's terrible . "
In the last week , it was announced that the lead female actress , Caryn Lynn Manuel , was replaced by Lisa Brescia 10 performances into previews .
Jenn Colella , the actress who preceded Manuel , was smart enough to opt out entirely for " High Fidelity , " also opening soon and an " easier " show .
" This show is a workout , " laughed one participant .
And that 's not all .
According to one source with the show , at least " five or six " of the original 10 actors have recently been replaced as Tharp — who remains obstinate — tries to salvage what 's left of the show .
One big problem , sources said , is that the Dylan songs have been arranged into unrecognizable Broadway versions of themselves .
" You could n't tell what they were , " said an observer .
Tharp is rushing to turn them back into folk songs , but it 's probably too late for that .
" If you read her book , " said an insider , " you 'll [ see ] she says previews are a time for editing . "
Indeed , Tharp wrote of fixing the Billy Joel show in " The Creative Habit " : " I was not a novice at the art of change .
I knew the repertoire of tweak and cut and add and replace and reposition . "
The idea for " Times " sprouted from Tharp 's success with Joel 's music in " Movin ' Out , " another show that was troubled in previews but was a success by opening night .
" The difference is in ' Movin ' Out ' you had a guy who sounded like Billy Joel and played the piano and was on stage , " my source said .
" In this show , there 's no one playing Dylan .
The plot is about a father and son sleeping with the same woman , and it's unsavory . "
Still , one insider is voicing support for " Times . "
" It 's a roller - coaster ride , a dreamy trip , " the source said , citing " Desolation Row " as a standout number .
" I think the show will be a hit . "
Dylan , I 'm told , saw the show only once when it was playing in La Jolla , Calif .
He signed off on it and never returned .
Whether he's there on opening night is as much a mystery as the show itself .
With such backstage scuffling , the odds are he will stay away .
Penelope Determined to Master English
Penelope Cruz tells me she 's getting more comfortable speaking and acting in English , and is determined to make more American movies .
" I 'm going to do it , you 'll see , " she said with great humor at Saturday night 's premiere of " Volver , " the Pedro Almodovar movie that 's winning fans and acclaim everywhere it plays .
Last night at the premiere , Cruz entertained an eclectic group of pals including U2's Bono , Sean " Diddy " Combs , Kathleen Turner , Sony CEO Sir Howard Stringer , " Kramer vs. Kramer " author Avery Corman and Mikhail Baryshnikov .
Immediately following the screening , Penelope had a bite to eat with Combs , who missed most of the movie because he ignored the start time and arrived egregiously late .
Afterward , Cruz held court in a tiny crowded booth at a W. 14th St. nightclub with Bono , Helena Christensen , Gavin Friday and Bono 's endless security team .
At another booth , Almodovar , his brother - producer Augustin and three other wonderful " Volver " actresses accepted kudos .
Almodovar told me his diet is going well , and he 's working on a script for a new movie with a science fiction theme .
" Volver , " I predict , will earn Cruz , Almodovar , the picture itself and supporting actress Carmen Maura Oscar nominations .
With Penelope now in the lead it 's a tough best actress category this year that includes Judi Dench , Renee Zellweger , Kate Winslet , Helen Mirren as well as Annette Bening , Meryl Streep , Sienna Miller and Cate Blanchett who also are possibly in the mix .
With " Volver " — pronounced VOHL - vair , which means " to return " in Spanish — Almodovar may have his biggest yet after a stellar list of beloved films including " Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown , " " All About My Mother " and " Bad Education . "
In many ways , " Volver " is his crowning achievement because it's the most accessible .
Gone are the transvestites and happy - go - lucky freaks that usually dominate his stories .
Instead , by portraying a group of strong , sensual , smart women , Almodovar is tapping the audience head - on .
He is almost — God forbid — mainstream .
Penelope is known to most Americans as an actress who hooked up with Tom Cruise briefly .
Many may confuse her with her friend Salma Hayek , not realizing they are n't even similar and come from different countries .
In her past American films , Cruz has been beautiful but awkward to the point of embarrassing because her command of English has been halting .
With the incomprehensible quarter of " Vanilla Sky , " " All The Pretty Horses , " " Sahara " and " Captain Corelli 's Mandolin , " Cruz fell short of expectations .
But in " Volver , " all that changes .
Unencumbered by the language barrier in her head , she becomes a full - fledged movie star , carrying the film and missing from nary a scene .
She 's relaxed , funny , sexy beyond belief and intelligent .
She totally inhabits Raimunda , the central character , whose story ranges from comedy to drama to thriller .
Cruz lights up the movie like no other female star since Sophia Loren , and that 's quite an accomplishment .
Watch her wrap the Academy Awards right around her finger .
Kennedys Approve of ' Bobby '
Just in case you were wondering , the family of Robert Kennedy all approve of Emilio Estevez 's Oscar - tipped movie , " Bobby , " which will open next month .
( Scoop : The word is that Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige have just recorded a gospel song for the closing credits . )
Estevez 's parents , Martin and Janet Sheen ( married 45 years ) , were just two of the many famous guests on Friday night at Chelsea Piers for the Robert Kennedy Memorial Foundation dinner .
Sheen is in " Bobby " as are Sharon Stone and Christian Slater , who were also guests and performed with Sheen , Matthew Modine , Lorraine Bracco , Sigourney Weaver , Charles Grodin , Giancarlo Esposito , Gloria Reuben and Robin Wright Penn in a reading of Ariel Dorfman 's play " Speak Truth to Power . "
Esposito , a journeyman character actor who never gets enough credit , accepted congrats after the show for his exceptional performance from Richard Belzer , who was carrying a small dog .
Modine , Reuben and Bracco were also standouts .
The play opens next week at the Culture Project on Bleecker Street in New York .
Joshua Jackson , of " Dawson 's Creek " fame , who plays a Ted Sorensen / Richard Goodwin - like character in " Bobby , " was also there along with the film 's producers , Holly Wiersma and Gary Walters .
And even though Ethel Kennedy and her daughters Kerry and Rory all sanction the film , they told me they probably wo n't see it .
You can't blame them .
" Bobby " is full of historic footage of RFK , including a re-enactment of his assassination at the Ambassador Hotel .
It 's hard enough to watch if you 're not related to the late senator and presidential candidate .
But the atmosphere at the memorial dinner was charged on Friday night as Kerry Kennedy introduced a number of honorees who have worked for humanitarian causes around the world .
Bill Clinton introduced the evening with his usual rousing speech , and was followed by Nobel Prize winner and former U.S. Marine Bobby Muller , who almost stole the oratorical spotlight from Clinton when he spoke from his wheelchair .
His spinal cord was severed by a bullet during his tour of duty in Vietnam .
By the time all the honorees were described , we were almost ready to give up the gossip world and head to a Third World country — well , not really .
But you can check the entire remarkable enterprise out at speaktruth.org .
Meantime , it was n't all torture and civil rights that occupied the night .
For one thing , a gaggle of pre-teen girls surrounded Jimmy Fallon and would n't leave him alone .
They were very cute with their autograph books , encouraging Fallon when he broke out in an impromptu a cappella medley of George Benson hits .
He was no competition , however , for pop star Tracy Chapman — a last minute sub for an ailing Elvis Costello — who serenaded the crowd with " Talkin ' Bout a Revolution . "
Dana Delany , off duty from her " Kidnapped " series , turned up with former HBO chief Michael Fuchs and was introduced to Kennedy relative Caroline Radziwill and New York Times writer Jill Brooke , who brought husband Gary Goldstein and gorgeous stepdaughters Jessica and Vanessa .
Delany is enjoying New York so much , by the way , she 's talking about moving here this winter permanently .
" Bobby " is shaping up , I should tell you , as quite the best - picture contender .
Along with the aforementioned " Volver " and Paramount 's " Dreamgirls , " " Bobby " could be one of three locks in that category .
Stone is a cinch for best supporting actress , and both Laurence Fishburne and Freddie Rodriguez are being talked about for best supporting actor .
It 's no surprise to Estevez 's mother , but she 's relieved by the praise .
" You have no idea how hard Emilio worked , " she said .

Hallo !
Julian Togelius posted new videos about his project on evolutionary car racing .
This time he experimented a more complicated design for the track .
The evolved car performed very well and could avoid all walls inside the track .
I only do not know the kind of Evolutionary Algorithm he applied .
Last time he used Evolution Strategies .
It is very interesting Togelius ' work on evolutionary cars !
Até Mais !!
Marcelo
Zakaj in kako ste se odločili za odhod v legijo ?
Ne vem .
Imel sem težko otroštvo .
Očim me je dosti pretepal , poniževal ...
Vedno mi je govoril , da sem niče in da iz mene ne bo nič .
Nato sem bil pri Splošni plovbi .
A imel sem preveč adrenalina .
V Afriki sem prvič videl legionarja .
Vedel sem , da želim postati legionar .
Koliko časa traja urjenje v legiji ?
Prvo urjenje traja štiri mesece .
V tem času ogromno nabornikov opusti vojaško življenje , bodisi zaradi slabe psihofizične pripravljenosti bodisi , ker ne znajo jezika .
Tisti , ki ostanejo , po štirih mesecih že govorijo francosko .
Po navadi najprej bolj po " indijansko " : " Jaz tebe vidla , ti mene vidla ... "
A nekako gre .
Ukaze razumeš .
Toda to še ni legija .
Legija se začne po tistem , ko pridemo v regimente .
Kako ste se odločili , v kateri enoti se boste urili ?
Se lahko nabornik odloči sam ?
Vedno sem hotel biti padalec , torej član padalske enote .
Občudujem orla , kako lebdi nad zemljo .
To se mi je zdelo vedno tako lepo , vse dokler nisem padel .
Ko sem padel , se je vse spremenilo .
Polomil sem si obe nogi .
Od takrat sem bil nesposoben za padalsko enoto .
Nisem imel sreče ali pač .
( Dvigne hlače in v dokaz svojim besedam pokaže še danes vidne poškodbe obeh nog . )
Na padalca v zraku se po mednarodnih vojnih konvencijah ne sme streljati .
Kako je v praksi ?
V praksi je drugače .
Takoj ko smo sami , takoj ko ni zraven nas televizije , novinarjev ... delamo ... hm ...
... kar hočete ?
Tako je , kar hočeš .
Bojim se ga , ko se bo spustil na zemljo .
Vem , da je tudi on , tako kot sem sam , dobro usposobljen za boj .
In zakaj bi on mene ?
Bom raje jaz njega , pa čeprav v zraku .
Ženevska konvencija sicer to prepoveduje , a nobena vojska na tem svetu , od ameriške do jugoslovanske , nikoli ni in ne bo upoštevala te prepovedi .
In potem ?
Potem sem odšel v tankovske enote .
Odločili ste se za vojsko , a ne na primer za takratno JLA , pač pa za legijo .
Med različnimi vojskami ste torej izbrali radikalno opcijo in znotraj nje elitno padalsko enoto , potem pa ste pristali v tanku .
Ko je človek zadet v tanku , nima kake pretirane izbire .
Se vam ne zdi , da ste maksimalno izzivali nesrečo ?
Razmišljal sem tako : če sem pri pehoti ( kar sem pozneje tudi bil ) , bom imel težko smrt .
To pomeni , če bom hudo ranjen in helikopter ne bo mogel priti pome , bom umrl v zelo hudih bolečinah .
Kasneje sem videl umirati fante brez rok , nog ...
To je težka smrt .
Če pa zadenejo tank , v katerem sem , bom predvsem zaradi eksploziva , ki je v njem , mrtev v trenutku .
Popolnoma .
Razneslo me bo na tisoč delov .
Od mene ne bo ostalo nič .
Legija ne pušča svojih ranjenih vojakov ?
Legija nikoli ne pušča za sabo ranjenih in mrtvih .
Ne pušča pušk ... Ničesar !
Za sabo ne puščamo nobenega podatka , da je bila tam legija .
Vedno vse počistimo .
Cena ni pomembna .
Lahko gremo v Irak , Jugoslavijo , Vukovar ... Lahko nas gre tisoč vojakov in tisoč nas bo tudi prišlo nazaj .
Pika .
To je legija .
Legija ne pusti za sabo ničesar .
Koliko časa je trajalo , preden ste sodelovali v prvi bitki ?
Pri meni je šlo vse zelo hitro .
Služil sem v obdobju vojn v Čadu , Somaliji , Libanonu , Iraku , Ugandi ...
To so bile pred približno dvajsetimi leti najhujše bitke .
Afganistan ?
V Afganistanu nisem bil .
Takrat sem opravljal šolo za čin vodnika in naši fantje so tam opravljali predvsem dela na področju razminiranja terena , tako da so bili v Afganistanu zgolj intervencijsko .
Te kvalifikacije pa takrat še nisem imel .
Na kakšen način , kdaj in zaradi česa tujska legija poseže v vojno ?
Odvisno .
Lahko gre za klasičen spopad , za vojno ali pa zgolj za posredovanje .
Pred leti je posegala predvsem tam , kjer so bili interesi Francije .
Danes pa legija pošilja vojake tudi v imenu različnih mednarodnih organizacij .
Legija se pač spreminja .
Kako ?
Predvsem disciplina ni več tako močna .
Ne morem več , na primer , vojaka , ki ne spoštuje ukazov , pretepati ali psihično obračunavati z njim .
Tako so delali z mano kot novincem in sam sem to seveda prenašal naprej .
A ne udarim ga iz sovraštva , temveč zato , da ve , kdo je tu glavni in ...
... da ti veš več kot on , da se on šele uči in da bo preživel samo na tak način ...
Natančno tako .
Danes jih trpinčijo bolj psihično .
Kaj je " lažje " ?
Fizično .
Dobiš dva " cmoka " in pozabiš .
Če pa te nekdo nenehno podcenjuje nekaj mesecev , ponoriš .
Kako so poniževali vas ?
Bil sem komunistična svinja , nesposobnež ...
Koliko zasluži vojak legionar ?
Tisoč dvesto evrov .
Katere vojaške osebnosti najbolj ceniš ?
Josipa Broza Tita , ki je bil odličen strateg .
In generala Rommla , odličen vojak , verjetno najboljši .
Katero pa je najpomembnejše pravilo v legiji ?
Častna smrt za Francijo , spoštovanje nasprotnika in ne pobijati civilnega prebivalstva .
Tu ni pardona .
Če bi vojak to prelomil , potem je hudo .
Sam teh zapovedi nisem nikoli prekršil .
Legija tujcev je podpisala ženevsko konvencijo , da gremo v primeru poboja civilnega prebivalstva na vojaško sodišče v Haag .
In pri takem početju nas legija ne varuje .
Kakšna je glavna razlika med vojskovanjem doma , na primer nekoč v partizanih , v JLA ali v legiji ?
Moji nonoti so bili vsi partizani .
Razlika je predvsem v tem , da je laže biti partizan recimo na Vremščici .
Tam natančno veš , kje si .
Povsem druga zadeva pa je v pragozdu ali puščavi ...
Če tam nisi poslušal , kaj so ti govorili nadrejeni , si bil mrtev .
Mrtev si , ne da bi te zadela krogla .
Vojak bo umrl zaradi kač , vode ... , skratka , zaradi različnih stvari .
To je zanesljivo .
Moraš biti perfekten vojak .
Samo perfektni vojaki preživijo .
Je legija skupek takšnih " perfektnih " vojakov ?
Če ameriški marinci trenirajo pri nas , potem veš , koliko je ura .
Seveda lahko dokažem , da se marinci urijo pri legiji , toda ameriških vojakov ne cenim in ne spoštujem .
Oni so le zato , da žvečijo žvečilni in dvigujejo uteži .
Legijo pa spoštuje in se je boji ves svet .
Ni boljše vojske od legije .
Katera je bila vaša prva fronta ?
Bejrut .
Bejrut , ki se ponavlja .
Je legija danes navzoča v Bejrutu ?
Ne !
Zaradi raznih neumnosti Združenih držav Amerike se legija tam ne bojuje več .
Imamo pametno vodstvo , pametne generale .
Bejrut je bil torej vaš ognjeni krst ?
Vojna .
Prva prava .
V Bejrutu ste ubijali ?
Sem .
Ubijal sem , ker sem se branil .
Bal sem se .
Bil sem v hiši .
Prvi .
Ko je počilo , je razneslo del hiše , strop ... V tistem trenutku nisem več vedel zase .
Takšna kriza me je doletela in nisem mogel drugače .
Vse ukaze , ki sem jih dobil , sem izpolnil .
Lahko pa rečem , da sem se strašno bal .
Strah me je bilo ... in bilo mi je žal .
Jokal sem , se tresel ...
Ampak to je tista kriza , ki ji pravimo ognjeni krst .
Ko to enkrat preneseš , preneseš vse .
Življenje se ti spremeni .
Po takem doživetju življenje ni več isto .
Boriš se , da bi bil normalen , priden dečko .
Ampak to so zelo hude stvari .
Slovenci , ki so bili v legiji - okoli dvajset jih je - , in tisti , ki so bili v vojni in na prsih nosijo vojne križce , vedo , o čem govorim .
Drugi ne !
In nikoli ne bodo .
Vojaka ste torej ubili v spopadu ?
V spopadu , v strahu .
Kateri strani je pripadal ?
Bil je " njihov " .
Njihov ?
Da , njihov pač .
Vojak ... Libanonec ... ne vem !
Ali vojak v legiji ve , za koga se bojuje ?
Ne , ne ve .
Vojak se ne bojuje za kogar koli , saj legija ni napadalna .
A ukaz je ukaz in ti ga moraš izpolniti .
Naredimo , kar je pač naša dolžnost , in se vrnemo .
O interesih , ki so v ozadju , pa ne bova vedela ne vi ne jaz .
Nikoli .
Navsezadnje ste plačanci .
Smo , pa vendar se na nas gleda drugače .
Jacques Chirac je že pred časom izjavil , da imamo tudi mi , legionarji , pravico živeti .
Ne glede na to , kakšna je bila naša mladost , življenje ... Legijo se zdaj spoštuje .
Chirac je zame največji predsednik in velik človek .
Tudi Američanom zna pokazati zobe .
Biti plačanec pa je težka stvar .
Strah je torej tisti element , zaradi katerega streljaš in se boriš za svoje življenje ?
Tako je .
Strah in še enkrat strah .
Bojiš se tako ti na tej strani kot sovražnik na drugi .
Oba se bojita .
Adrenalin takrat izgine .
To je približno tako kot človek , ki je šel na Everest in se spustil z gore .
Ko je prišel na goro , ga je bilo hudičevo strah , vendar se je pač spustil .
Kaj mu je pa drugega preostalo .
No , tako je tudi v vojni .
Tudi mene je bilo strah .
Prekleto strah , tako strah , da nisem več vedel zase .
Zaradi strahu torej streljaš .
Tako je .
V mojem primeru je človek dvignil roko , v tistem trenutku sem se obrnil in ustrelil ... Avtomatsko .
Se je hotel vdati ?
Bil je trenutek , ustrelil sem in ga zadel pod rebra , čisto spodaj .
( Tišina )
Videl sem , da je padel pred mene , in kar naenkrat je bila njegova uniforma in vse okoli njega v krvi .
Jaz sem ga gledal .
Nato se je dvignil nazaj na noge .
Jaz sem ga gledal ... v oči .
Mislil sem , da sanjam .
Z desno roko je šel pod uniformo .
Mislil sem , da bo izvlekel pištolo .
V ozadju slišim : " Streljaj , streljaj , ubij ga ! "
Ustrašil sem se in sprožil , ponovno .
Zadel sem ga deset centimetrov višje .
Spet je bilo vse krvavo in spet je padel na tla .
Dvignil se je še zadnjič .
Imel je krvave oči in nekaj mi je želel povedati .
Iz ust mu je že curljala kri .
Z roko je segel ponovno v notranjost uniforme .
Od strahu sem okamnel .
Nisem in nisem mogel več streljati .
Čeprav bi me lahko ubil .
Iz žepa je potegnil fotografijo .
( Tišina ) Fotografijo štirih punčk , hčerk .
V naslednjem trenutku je padel pred mano .
Mrtev .
Padel sem pred njim na kolena in začel jokati .
( Tišina ) Poročnik R. me je zato pretepel kot psa in rekel : " Tukaj ni prostora zate ! "
Oči so tiste , ki te spremljajo , vedno in povsod .
Od takrat sem vedno pazil , ko sem ubijal .
Samo da nasprotnika nisem gledal v oči .
Nikoli !
Od tistega trenutka nisem bil nikoli več Srečko .
Nikoli nisem bil več isti človek !
Nikoli več !
Tako je bilo prvič .
Človeka ubijanje spremeni .
Kasneje se mi je to začelo vedno vračati : doma , ob točilnem pultu ... Vedno !
Nisem več vedel , zakaj sem , kaj delam , zakaj sploh obstajam .
Človek se spremeni , a človek ima srce .
Vsak !
Če vas prav razumem , se te prvi , ki ga ubiješ , dotakne , te zaznamuje .
Potem je laže ?
Tako je .
Potem vedno paziš , da nimaš stika z nasprotnikom ali vsaj čim manj ...
... da ga vidiš samo kot vojaka ...
Drži .
Da pade dol , da je največ , kar slišiš , le njegova bolečina , krik .
Krik slišiš vedno ?
Vsak človek , ki je zadet in ni takoj mrtev , se vsaj trenutek bori za življenje in ti kriki so grozoviti .
Tu gre vse zelo hitro , a slišiš vsak njegov krik .
Danes , čeprav sem že toliko časa v pokoju , še vedno slišim te krike .
Tega ne moreš več izbrisati iz spomina .
Izbrisal sem svojo poroko , ljubezen v življenju ... A tistega prvega ne .
Ni šans !
Kdor govori drugače , laže !
Veliko se pogovarjam z drugimi legionarji in ti čutijo enako .
Nato je prišel Čad ?
Da , a tam smo opravili hitro , brez težav .
Težavna je bila Uganda .
Tam je bilo veliko vprašanje , kdo bo ustavil to vojno .
Tudi Amerika je vedela , da zadevo lahko reši le legija .
Tam so bili vaši nasprotniki otroci ?
Tako je .
Možje , stari trideset let , so bili tam že generali .
Navadne šahovske figure , s katerimi so se ti generali igrali , so bili otroci .
Stari so bili trinajst , štirinajst , petnajst let .
To so bili otroci , ki so pobijali s kalašnikovko v eni roki in mačeto v drugi .
Po vaseh so vedno pobijali samo z mačeto .
Krvavo , vam rečem !
Tam je šlo za res velik genocid in vsa Evropa je to mirno gledala !
Na kakšen način so bili ti otroci sploh rekrutirani ?
Tam je bila res beda .
Živeli so v popolnem pomanjkanju .
Obljubljali so jim lepše življenje , denar , hrano ... in naenkrat so postali morilci .
Kot v nekdanji Jugoslaviji .
Še včeraj smo peli , da se ljubimo , in poglej danes .
To so državljanske vojne in državljanske vojne so najhujše .
V Ugandi ste jih dosti zajeli in pobili .
Takšen je bil ukaz .
A kaj bi ti otroci ?
Kako bi živeli ?
Bili so morilci , morilci pri petnajstih .
Postali bi še večji problem in kdo naj bi ga rešil ?
Legija ?
Spet ?
Ubijati zajete .
Na tak način je še posebej težko ?
Ti otroci so te gledali v oči in prosili : " Ne , gospod , ne " .
To je težko , resnično težko .
( Tišina ) .
V žep sežeš po škatlo cigaret in jo vržeš nekaj metrov proč .
Otrok steče , da bi jo pobral .
Se za trenutek obrne .
Ga ne vidiš .
Ne vidiš ga v oči .
In ...
Streljaš ?
Da .
Potem naprej ... do naslednjega ?
( Tišina .
Nato pogleda in po licu mu drsijo solze . )
Se spomini na mrtve vračajo ponoči ?
Še vedno ?
Da. Vedno !
Vsak dan .
Veselim se vsakega sončnega vzhoda , a le za nekaj minut , potem je težko .
Katera vojna , ki ste jih dali skozi , je bila najbolj krvava , najbolj ubijalska ?
Jugoslovanska .
Zaradi čustev ?
Tako je .
Predvsem zaradi tega , ker sem se moral spopadati s četniki , ustaši , s tistimi , s katerimi smo prej družno hodili po Jugi in peli Druže Tito .
Kakšna je bila vaša naloga v Jugoslaviji ?
Varovanje civilnega prebivalstva .
Varovanje in nič drugega .
Najtežja in nemogoča naloga , ker nas je bilo premalo .
Koliko ?
Ne smem povedati .
Kaj ste tam počeli vi osebno ?
Obveščevalna služba .
Najprej prisluškovanje .
Razumel sem jezik .
Potem sem bil telesna straža oficirjev .
Videli ste vse ?
Videl sem posilstva in klanja .
Lahko bi rekli vse .
Moji vojaki , ki so bili takrat že izurjeni in so bili že praktično po vsem svetu , so mi rekli : " Vodnik , take morije še nismo videli ! "
Klal je brat brata , otroke so nabijali na kole .
To je bila največja klavnica .
Zanimivo ?
Vsi smo čakali leta , da se nekaj zgodi .
Nato in Evropa sta gledala , čakala .
Koga , sprašujem , koga ?
Vsako vojno je treba takoj preprečiti in ustaviti .
In če mislite , da je Albanka manj vredna kot Slovenka ali Hrvatica , se hudičevo motite .
Prav tako ima srce , ki joče .
Joče , če ji ubijete brata , moža , sina .
Vse to smo gledali , a Slovenci in niti en slovenski politik niso poskušali ustaviti te morije !
( Kletvica )
Nas ni zanimalo .
Nasprotno , Hrvatom smo dajali tanke .
Bili ste tudi na prvih črtah ?
Bil. Nad Sarajevom .
Kasneje , ko je prišla Srebrenica , so se izživljali nad starejšimi ljudmi , nad otroki , a nismo dobili ukaza .
Nismo in pika .
Slovenci so gledali , Kučan je gledal , Francozi prav tako in Amerika tudi .
Posredovalo se je šele kasneje , ko je bilo za tiste ljudi že prepozno .
Že takrat sem slišal , neuradno sicer , a vseeno , da ni nikomur do tega , da bi imeli muslimane v Evropi .
In zato se toliko časa ni nič naredilo .
Cheerleading used to be as central to the Reaganite small - town wet - dream as picket fences .
But a growing maelstrom of sex , substance abuse and violence has rocked the sport to its core , argues Steven Wells
It 's the half - time show at an indoor soccer game in America .
The Frisbee - catching dog having done its stuff , a team of cheerleaders takes the floor .
They bump .
They grind .
They shake their backsides and thrust their pelvises .
The audience - overwhelmingly composed of 7 - 12 - year - olds who 've just finished singing the Spongebob Squarepants song - stare politely , munch hot - dogs and slurp their bucket - sized soft drinks .
Then little girls are pulled out of the crowd by the cheerleaders , lined up and taught a hip - gyrating dance routine that ends with pronounced pelvic thrusts .
My female companion - a British sociologist who specialises in sport and gender - nearly chokes on her salted popcorn .
" Urk !
What is this ? " she yells .
" What the fuck are they doing ? ! "
A mum in a nearby seat looks pointedly in our direction and scowls .
Do n't we know there are children present ?
Cheerleading is a sport in crisis .
Actually , in crises .
There 's a furious debate as to whether it 's actually a sport at all .
There 's a blazing row about just how appropriate it is to have schoolgirls in short skirts perform dirty dancing moves .
And there are those who argue that cheerleading reinforces gender roles that should have been mocked to death back when Rock Hudson was pretending to be aroused by Doris Day .
And then there 's the fact that for the last five years America has been ripped apart by a maelstrom of cheerleader sex , substance abuse and violence .
In Iowa , a 15 - year - old cheerleader was arrested for allegedly writing " Columbine - style " threats to blow up her school .
In Boston members of a high school cheerleading squad produced " a homemade lesbian porno video " .
In Minnesota , a cheerleader paid $ 50 to have a rival beaten up .
In Brooklyn kids at a school " pep rally " heckled , punched , kicked and then battered a cheerleader they considered " mediocre " with a garbage can .
In Pennsylvania a mob of drunken cheerleaders , doped up with malt liquor by their coach , went on a car - trashing rampage .
In Texas , teen cheerleaders were accused of sending a " shit pizza " to their local rivals .
In Colorado two cheerleaders were arrested for dealing morphine .
And - most famously - last year in Florida two Carolina Panthers cheerleaders were arrested after one of them hit a woman who objected to the " Top Cats " having sex with each other in a bar toilet stall .
If you want to know how deeply these stories scar the American psyche - try reading any of the above and substituting " member of the royal family " for " cheerleader " .
Because while cheerleaders for cheerleading will point out that there are grinning teens in flimsy ra-ra skirts and tight tops forming human pyramids everywhere from Dagenham to Da Nang , that 's like boasting that there are folks who play cricket in Connecticut .
Cheerleading is quintessentially American .
More than that , the bright - as - a - button , perma- grinning , pony - tailed cheerleader is the shining icon of idealised American femininity .
And as such she is at the centre of some of the American Culture Wars ' most savagely fought brawls .
In 2005 the Texas legislature became one such battleground .
In scenes that bordered on the surreal , politicians waving pom-poms debated a " cheerleader booty bill " designed to stamp out " overtly sexually suggestive " cheerleading .
" We are telling teenagers not to have sex , but are teaching them how to do it on the football field and applauding them when they do it , " claimed the bill 's sponsor , Democratic representative Al Edwards .
" It 's just too sexually oriented , you know , the way they 're shaking their behinds and going on , breaking it down . "
Edwards , who once suggested that drug dealers should have their fingers snipped off , also claimed that cheerleading leads to teen pregnancies , school dropouts and the spread of STDs .
His bill provoked a ferocious national debate .
" Tiny pleated skirts = good .
Tight cheerleading sweaters = good .
Being considered in pop culture to be fluffbunnies and lacking athletic prowess = good .
Gyrating your hips like Elvis = bad , " mocked one feminist critic .
The cheerleader , says Mary Ellen Hanson , author of Go! Fight !
Win ! : Cheerleading in American Culture , is the poster child for the virgin / whore dichotomy ; simultaneously representing " youthful prestige , wholesome attractiveness , peer leadership , and popularity " as well as " mindless enthusiasm , shallow boosterism , objectified sexuality and promiscuous availability . "
America 's cultural conservatives are severely conflicted about cheerleading .
On one hand the cheerleader is obviously as much a part of the Reaganite small - town wet - dream as soda fountains , white picket fences and letter sweaters .
More than that , she reinforces the 1950s gender stereotypes beloved of the political right .
Men play American football ; girls stand on the sidelines , cheer and look pretty .
That 's the way it used to be .
That 's the way they feel it still should be .
And that 's the way it will be again if conservatives ever manage to repeal Title IX - the 1972 legislation that mandates equal funding for male and female sports in education .
Then they could get girls off the soccer pitch ( hideous foreign , socialist game that it is ) and back on to the sidelines where they belong .
On the other hand , cheerleading is so obviously sexually titillating that there are those on the Christian right who want to police it , Iran style .
But this is no clear - cut conflict - it 's nostalgists v authoritarians v libertarians , with cheerleading exposing the ugly ideological mess at the heart of modern conservatism .
Then there are those who attempt to bridge the gap - like Rose Clevenger , president of the North Carolina - based Christian Cheerleaders of America ( " Building PEOPLE Before Pyramids " ) .
While it 's true that secular cheerleading is polluted with " bare midriffs , very short shirts , bump and grind music with vulgar lyrics , authority abusive lyrics and totally inappropriate moves with sexual implications " , says Rose , her organisation has " biblically based standards of dress , music and moves . "
( The mind boggles ) .
" One of the strange things about cheerleader culture is that it crosses with religious culture , " muses 24 - year - old American cultural critic Marty Beckerman , author of the book Death To All Cheerleaders ( in which he describes cheerleaders as a " race of loose bimbos with the brain capacity of squirrel faeces " ) .
As a 16 - year - old , Beckerman was sacked from his job as a newspaper cub reporter for asking a 13 - year - old cheerleader what it felt like to be " a urine stain on the toilet seat of America " .
" It 's a strange game the parents play , where they want the girls to be sexy but not too sexy , " says Beckerman .
" There 's a definite paedophile element - or at least ephebophile - with these old lechers getting off on young girls , but if they get too sexy , then these same religious parents say it 's obscene and want to ban the sexual element .
Perfect example of how this country is sexually repressed and obsessed at the same time . "
Of course , this debate had to happen in Texas - home of the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders , the troupe generally credited with turning professional cheerleading into the para - pornographic spectacle it is today .
" The audience deserves a little sex with its violence , " chuckled CBS TV producer Chuck Milton , after the 1976 Super Bowl X , when the Cowboys ' cheerleaders first rocked America .
And since then , sneers New York Times columnist Frank Rich , the NFL has been in the " sex business " .
" They took the wholesome All - American good girl and dressed her very provocatively , put her in tight pants and tops that showed a lot of cleavage " says Adams , associate professor at Alabama University and co-author of Cheerleader : An American Icon .
" It 's like one ex-Cowboys cheerleader told us : ' We were the ultimate male fantasy girls that you wanted to take home to Mom - but you wanted to have sex with us on the way ' . "
Meanwhile , out in the hinterland , non-professional cheerleading has evolved and mushroomed .
And so has the controversy .
Natalie Adams , a former cheerleader herself , says cheerleading has split into two camps - the traditional and the competitive .
Competitive cheerleaders do n't cheer ; they just compete with other cheerleaders .
It 's a strange situation perhaps analogous to English soccer hooliganism carrying on in the absence of any soccer .
" Over 20 state athletic associations now classify cheerleading as a sport , " says Adams .
Which has led to some feminist critics arguing that this is a blatant attempt to roll back Title IX , drag girls away from " real sports " and turn them back into rah - rahing female eunuchs .
Alternative America has long despised the cheerleader .
In the 1991 video for Smells Like Teen Spirit , Nirvana used anarchy symbol adorned cheerleaders ( they originally wanted them " overweight and ugly " ) to symbolise sterile conformity .
In his writings , singer Kurt Cobain fantasised about " cheerleaders and ... football jocks " being stripped naked and humiliated at gunpoint .
" They must be petrified to ever think of being the stuck - up , self - righteous , segregating , guilt - spreading , ass kissing , white right - wing republicans of the future . "
A Baltimore punk band called Die Cheerleader released a record titled Down With Pom Poms .
On hip American teen websites , conformist females are denigrated as " chimbos " ( cheerleading bimbos " ) .
And there 's even an Anti-Cheerleading Association operating out of Arkansas , which claims that " cheerleading is kept strong by the forces of Hitler from beyond the grave " .
But so strong is the appeal of the cheerleader that in recent years she has even conquered the hearts of radical America .
The Nirvana - style " punk cheerleader " - such an absurd and subversive oxymoron in 1991 - now makes semi-regular appearances at the Super Bowl pre-game and half - time shows ( surely the acme of cultural co-option ) .
Meanwhile the spiky , transgressive ( and occasionally satanic ) alternative cheerleader has become a counter - cultural cliché .
She 's a regular at roller derby games , anti-war demonstrations , alternative karaoke evenings , psychobilly gigs and wherever hipsters gather to knit , sip Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and bitch about the straights .
Some alternative cheerleaders - like the milky - eyed , tombstone - toothed and prison - tattooed Texas " trailer - trash " cheerleaders " MiLi and TilduH " are clearly parodies of mainstream cheerleading 's sanitised girly - girliness .
But others , says Natalie Adams , refuse to condemn their mainstream sisters .
Even while they take part in demonstrations with chants like : " Lube me up and bind those wrists / to fuck like this is to resist / give a cop a golden shower / come on baby , fight the power ! " these feminist and queer activist cheerleaders claim solidarity with rah- rahing straight girls in smalltown America , whose passions and pastimes - they claim - have always been mocked , trivialised and abused , precisely because they 're seen as female .
Which brings us to the final battlefield in the Cheerleading Wars .
" If a daughter of mine wanted to be a cheerleader I would boil her alive , " claims Marty Beckerman .
" But not 'till I killed her , just until I killed her dreams .
But if it was my son I 'd drag him behind my truck ' till he died . "
When the Sacramento Kings basketball team tried to introduce male cheerleaders , they were , according to one report " booed off the court by scandalised fans whose beer - addled brains were fixated on seeing cheerleaders ' bouncing jugs . "
And when pictures of George W Bush in male cheerleading gear started circulating on the web , at least one right - wing blogger was convinced it was a PhotoShop stitch - up concocted to demean Dubya 's sexuality .
The irony is that , until the second world war , cheerleading was almost exclusively male - and in some places male cheerleading flourished well into the 1960s .
Dwight D. Eisenhower , Franklin D Roosevelt , Jimmy Stewart , Michael Douglas , Samuel L Jackson , Steve Martin and George Bush senior were all teenage cheerleaders .
But nowadays it 's like Billy Elliot never happened .
The mere presence of a man in a cheerleading jersey is enough to start most male American sports fans pounding on the closet door .
Meanwhile , out there in cheerleading land , the few boys who do gain entrance are forbidden to dance .
Their movements are straight - armed , jerky and militaristic .
Their haircuts are short and neat - GI Joe to the girls ' scrunchie - restrained Malibu Barbie .
Stepford gender is alive and well in 21st - century America .
But so is the alternative .
While the cheerleader might give us a fascinating snapshot of the American Culture Wars , Natalie Adams reckons there might only be as few as 1.8 m cheerleaders in the entire country .
This contrasts with probably more than 10 m female soccer players .
Like the soda fountain and the letter sweater , as an icon the cheerleader is well past her sell - by date .
But it might be a while before America wakes up and smells the Ralgex .

■ エディットグラ フ
文書比較（diff）を行う問題は、２つの文書Ａ，Ｂの最長共通部分（ＬＣＳ
Longuest Common Subsequence）、または最小エディット距離（ＳＥＤ
Shotest Edit Distance）を求める問題と等価である。以下のアルゴリズムではこれらの問題をエディットグラフ上の最短距離取得問題に還元し、解を求める。
エディットグラフとは文書Ａ、Ｂの各要素（A1 A2 ... AM , B1 B2 ... BN） をＸ軸Ｙ軸上に並べ、それらの交点を縦横の辺で結合し、Ａのｘ番目の要素とＢのｙ番目の要素が等しい場合のみ ( x - 1 , y - 1 ) から ( x , y ) を結合したものである 。
たとえば 、Ａが“ あいうあうう あ ” 、Ｂが “ ういあいあ う ” の場合エディットグラフは以下の様になる。
あ い う あ い い あ ( 0,0 ) ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬→
Ｙ │ │ │＼│ │ │ │ │ う├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │ │＼│ │ │＼│＼│ │ い├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │＼│ │ │＼│ │ │＼│ あ├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │ │＼│ │ │＼│＼│ │ い├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │＼│ │ │＼│ │ │＼│ あ├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │ │ │＼│ │ │ │ │ う├─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─ ┘ ( 6,7 ) ↓ Ｘ
上記のようなエディットグラフを考える時、ＬＣＳ／ＳＥＤを求める問題は、エディットグラフ上で、(x , y ) から ( x + 1 , y ) または ( x , y + 1 ) への移動（縦、または横方向への移動）が距離１、(x , y ) から ( x + 1 , y + 1 ) への移動（対角線方向への移動）が距離０とする時に、(0 , 0 ) から ( M , N ) までの経路で距離が最小のものを求める問題に還元される。
上記の例では、下図の太字の経路が最小コストを与えるものである。
あ い う あ い い あ ( 0,0 ) ┌━┯━┬─┬─┬─┬─┬─┬→
Ｙ │ │ │＼│ │ │ │ │ う├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │ │ │ ┃ │ │ │ │ い├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │ │ │ │＼│ │ │ │ あ├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │ │ │ │ │＼│ │ │ い├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼━┼─┤ │ │ │ │ │ │ │＼│ あ├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┃ う├─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─┴─ ┘ ( 6,7 ) ↓ Ｘ
■ もっとも原始的なアルゴリズム
エディットグラフでの最小距離を求めるもっとも原始的なアルゴリズムは、すべてのノードを順にスキャンし、コストを求めている方法である。計算量は
O ( M*N ) で、必要なメモリは min( M , N ) である。プログラムは単純なので省略する。
■ O( ND ) アルゴリズ ム
上記以外にも最小距離を求める方法にはバックトラッキングを用いるなどいくつか考えられるが、
O( ND ) アルゴリズムは計算量が文書長（N）と差分（D）の積に比例するので、 原始的なアルゴリズムに比較して計算量がかなり少ないという特徴がある。
文字 列Ａの要素数をＭ、Ｂの要素数をＮとする。ＤはこれらのＳＥＤである。ただし、O( ND ) の Ｎは文字列ＡとＢの要素数の合計（Ｍ＋Ｎ）である。（ちょっと紛らわしい表記であるが、慣習なのでがまんしてください）
次に、エディットグラフで原点から右下方向の対角線を識別するための番号ｋを、ｙ−ｘと定義する。D = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... について、対角線ｋでの最大のｙを V[k , D ] とする。この値 はＤ回の編集操作で到達可能な最遠点を表わすので、Ｄを増やしながら、最初に V[k , D ] == N となる経路を求めればいいことになる。面白いことに
V[k , D ] は V [ k - 1 , D - 1 ] , V [ k+1 , D - 1 ] から求めることができる（証明 は [ 1 ] を参照）ので 、ＬＣＳ を求めるアルゴリズムは以下のようになる。
ond ( ) { int V[ ( M + N ) * 2 + 1 ] ; // 各対角線の最遠点のｙ座標値 int x , y , offset = M + N ; V [ 1 + offset ] = 0 ; for ( int D = 0 ; D <= M + N ; ++D ) { //
各 Ｄについて for ( int k = - D ; k <= D ; k+=2 ) { if ( k == - D || k != D && V[k - 1 + offset ] < V[k + 1 + offset ] ) y = V[k + 1 + offset ] ; else y = V[k - 1 + offset ] + 1 ; x = y - k ; V[k + offset ] = snake( x , y ) ; if ( x >= M && y >= N ) return ; // found !!!
} } } int snake ( int &x , int &y ) // 対角線が存在する場合は、移動する { while ( x < M && y < N && A [ x +1 ] == B[y + 1 ] ) { x += 1 ; y += 1 ; } return y ; }
■ O( NP ) アルゴリズ ム
O ( ND ) アルゴリズムでは、２つの文字列の差違；Ｄに比例した処理時間が必要だが、最遠点方向の探索を優先することで
O( NP ) は遥かに少ない （experimental には約２分の１）手間 でＬＣＳ を求めることができる。
Ｍ≧Ｎの時、Δ＝Ｍ−Ｎとし、Ｐ＝（Ｄ−Δ）／２と定義する。これは差違がＤの時に、原点からもっとも遠い対角線との距離に相当する。（下図参照）
Δ Δ＋Ｐ ( 0 , 0 ) ┌─────────┬→ Ｙ │＼ ＼ ＼ │
− Ｐ│ ＼ ＼ ＼ │ │＼ ＼ ＼ ＼│ │ ＼ ＼ ＼ │ │ ＼ ＼ ＼│ ├─────────┘( M , N ) ↓ Ｘ
O ( ND ) アルゴリズムで はＤを指標にして、対角線ごとの最遠点を求めたが、O( NP ) では上記 のＰを指標にする。最遠点 fp[k , p ] は、以下のように定義される（証明 は [ 2 ] を参照） 。
│ snake( k , max ( fp [ k - 1 , p ] + 1 , fp [ k+1 , p - 1 ] ) ) if - p <= k < Δ fp[k , p ] = │ snake( k , max ( fp [ k - 1 , p ] + 1 , fp [ k+1 , p ] ) ) if k == Δ │ snake( k , max ( fp [ k - 1 , p - 1 ] + 1 , fp [ k+1 , p ] ) ) if Δ > k >=
Δ + p
上記定義より、ＬＣＳを求めるアルゴリズムは以下の様に記述できる。
onp ( ) { int fp [ M + N + 3 ] ; int x , y , k , offset = M + 1 ; int DELTA = M - N ; for ( int p=0 ; ; ++p ) { for(k = - p ; k < DELTA ; ++k ) fp[k + offset ] = snake( k , max ( fp [ k - 1+offset ] + 1 , fp [ k+1+offset ] ) ) ; for(k = DELTA + p ; k > DELTA ; -- k) fp[k + offset ] = snake( k , max ( fp [ k - 1+offset ] + 1 , fp [ k+1+offset ] ) ) ; fp [ DELTA + offset ] = snake( k , max ( fp [ DELTA - 1+offset ] + 1 , fp [ DELTA+1+offset ] ) ) ; if ( fp [ DELTA + offset ] == N ) return ; // found !!! } }
Online music fans will for the first time be able to legally share tracks by big names such as Oasis , Beyonce , David Bowie and Elvis Presley after the artists ' record label signed a ground - breaking deal with a new internet service provider .
In what some see as signalling a dramatic shift in the way consumers buy music , the provider , Playlouder , has licensed acts from SonyBMG , the world 's second largest record label , and is confident that the other two big record labels , Universal and EMI , will follow suit .
Illegal file sharing , which allows users of software such as Kazaa , Grokster and eDonkey to swap pirated tracks over the internet , has been blamed by the record industry for largely contributing to a 25 % slump in global sales since 1999 , worth around £ 1.3 bn a year .
The record industry has pursued a " carrot and stick " approach , taking legal action against the worst offenders while encouraging the use of legal download sites such as Napster and iTunes .
In June , Sylvia Price , 53 , of Cheltenham , Gloucestershire , was forced to pay £ 2,500 compensation for around 1,400 songs downloaded by her daughter , Emily , 14 , on the family 's home computer ; and in March , 23 file sharers agreed to pay £ 2,200 each in compensation for uploading their music libraries on to the internet for others to copy .
Playlouder is offering the first legal alternative with a comparable experience to the " peer to peer " file sharing sites often used to swap pirated tracks .
Subscribers will be charged £ 26 a month for a high speed broadband internet connection , similar to the price charged by BT , with the added attraction of being able to share as much music as they want with other subscribers at no extra cost .
Because there will be no restrictions on the format in which the traded music is encoded , users will be free to transfer songs to any type of digital music player , including the market leading Apple iPod , or burn them to CD .
However , not only will consumers have to pay for music which they currently acquire free , albeit illegally , but they will also have to change their internet provider .
After signing the UK licensing deal with SonyBMG , whose acts also include George Michael , Bruce Springsteen and Dido , Playlouder 's chief executive , Paul Hitchman , is confident that its big rivals will follow suit .
It has already signed deals with dozens of independent labels affiliated to the Association of Independent Music , representing artists such as the White Stripes , Franz Ferdinand and Dizzee Rascal .
AIM 's chief executive , Alison Wenham , said the idea was a " simple but radically different solution to the means of accessing music on the internet " .
Because all Playlouder subscribers will share tracks over its own network Mr Hitchman said that the company could track the files and , through digital fingerprinting technology , make sure that record companies were remunerated accordingly from money set aside from Playlouder 's revenues each month .
He said he believed that the service , to be launched next month , " could well be the most important development in digital distribution since the invention of the MP3 format " .
Some record company executives have been wary of such deals because they fear it could reduce their ability to market big selling acts on a global basis .
But conversely , it could also increase their revenues from back catalogue tracks .
Playlouder claims that if all ISPs adopted its model , the record industry would make an additional £ 300 m a year in the UK alone .
Other companies , including one set up by the former Grokster president Wayne Rosso , have been working on legal versions of peer to peer file sharing .
But Mr Hitchens claimed that while they would allow sharing , if customers wanted a high quality version , they would have to pay extra .
The British Phonographic Industry , which has imposed fines of up to £ 6,500 each on 60 file sharers found to be making thousands of pirated tracks available to others and is taking five more to court , welcomed the development .
" Ensuring record companies are adequately and reliably compensated for the use of their copyrights on the internet is the number one issue for our business , " said the BPI 's chairman , Peter Jamieson .
The first thing I noticed when I installed IE7 on my Windows box was the very inconvenient location of the address bar .
Why the heck is it located above the menu bar ?
( File , edit , view , etc. )
I do n't know what the folks at Microsoft thought when they designed IE7 that way , but this must be one of the most idiotic design decision they 've ever made ( For me at least ) .
For those who think that the address bar should be back at the bottom of IE7's menu section , do not despair !
There is a simple registry tweak that will let you put it back as it was in IE6 .
All you need to do to set thing right again is add a simple key to your XP registry .
Here 's how to do it :
( Warning : Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method .
These problems might require that you reinstall your operating system .
Microsoft or I cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved .
Modify the registry at your own risk . )
If IE is opened , close it before doing anything
Start your registry editor ( Start -> Run , type regedit in the run field and press OK )
Browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER
\ Software \ Microsoft \ InternetExplorer \ Toolbar \ WebBrowser and be sure that the WebBrowser key is selected
Right - click the right part of the registry editor , select New - > DWORD Value , and name it " ITBar7Position "
Double click that new value , and assign it with a decimal value of 1
Restart IE7 , and voilà !
You 're done .

LIKE analogies involving the second world war , the “ new cold war ” is not a phrase to use lightly .
Or maybe at all .
Russia is not now seeking military domination of Europe .
It is not a one - party state .
Nor does it claim to be the embodiment of an ideological success story .
The once - towering edifice of Marxist - Leninist ideology is as ruined as social credit or syndicalism .
An exposition of “ sovereign democracy ” , as the Kremlin now grandly calls its scheme of things , would barely fill a postcard , let alone a textbook .
To compare all this to the Soviet Union of Leonid Brezhnev 's era may look not only insulting , but absurd .
The West 's differences with Russia seem mere nuances when set against the gulf between the modern world and the suicide bomber .
But to argue only that the old cold war is dead and gone is to risk missing the point .
Whatever we end up calling it , a new period of deep - seated rivalry is approaching — and perhaps has already begun .
As in the mid -to - late 1940s , such things take a bit of time to sink in .
Point one : Russia is different .
Whether you think of it as Gazpromistan , or as Kremlin Inc , the Russian state now is as inelegant a creature as ever it was in communist times .
It is an authoritarian bureaucratic - capitalist arrangement in which a squabbling elite , drawn largely from the security services , extracts enormous rents from raw materials , steals some , and uses the rest to vie for power , spouting nationalist and sometimes xenophobic rhetoric to maintain popularity .
In short , it turns wealth into power , and then power back into wealth .
At home — and abroad .
Point two : Russia is a threat .
The Soviet cocktail of communism and imperialism was a hard sell .
Especially towards the end , it meant poverty and dictatorship , plus foreign domination .
Russia 's main weapons now are more subtle and potent : cheap gas , and money for the right people .
The orgy of greed and moral myopia in Moscow in the past 15 years has shown that lawyers , accountants and bankers are willing to forget professional ethics for huge fees .
Russia 's main weapons now are more subtle and potent : cheap gas , and money for the right people
Politicians can lose their bearings , too .
Imagine that Helmut Schmidt , the German chancellor until 1982 , had not only been great chums with Brezhnev , but in his final months of office had pushed through huge government loan - guarantees for a project that would increase his country 's energy dependence on the Soviet Union .
And then , as soon as he was out of office , he had taken a lucrative post running that same project .
Fanciful ?
That is what Gerhard Schröder did with the planned Baltic gas pipeline .
Even if it is never built or used , it shows that Russia can brazenly co-opt a Western politician , and expect only a whimper of protest from others .
The West is all the weaker for its addiction to wishful thinking .
Surely it is better to negotiate and compromise with Russia , than have a messy and costly confrontation ?
Even now , money can't buy everything .
So there 's always murder .
A veteran Kremlin - watcher in Moscow wrote to your correspondent recently : “ Anna Politkovskaya was killed to warn Russians against criticising the Kremlin , especially in Western media .
Alexander Litvinenko's murder was to warn defectors .
The only question now is : ' who is next ? ' ”
Surely the Kremlin is not that brazen or brutal ?
Maybe .
But few have won money in recent years underestimating the brazenness and brutality that lurk beneath those onion domes .
We face a systemic rivalry based on conflicting values and clashing geopolitics .
Not a cold war , perhaps , but it 's getting chilly .
" This is the first time I heard this -- I do n't know how to pronounce -- this meta- meta something , " said Hajira Ahmed , whose husband is in jail pending charges that he sold cold medicine and antifreeze at their convenience store on a winding road near the Tennessee border .
But David Nahmias , the United States attorney for the Northern District of Georgia , said the evidence showed that the clerks knew that the informants posing as customers planned to make drugs .
Federal law makes it illegal to sell products knowing , or with reason to believe , that they will be used to produce drugs .
In these cases , lawyers say , defendants face up to 20 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines .
In one instance , Mr. Nahmias said , a store owner in Whitfield County pulled out a business card from a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent and told the informant that he was supposed to contact the agent if someone requested large amounts of the materials .
When the informant asked if he would call , Mr. Nahmias said , the owner replied , " No , you are my customer . "
" It 's not that they should have known , " Mr. Nahmias said .
" In virtually or maybe all of the cases , they did know . "
Like many prosecutors , Mr. Nahmias describes methamphetamine , a highly potent drug that can be injected , ingested or inhaled , as the biggest drug problem in his district .
While only about a third of the meth here is made in small labs -- the majority of the drug used in this country comes from so - called superlabs in Mexico -- those small labs can be highly explosive , posing a danger to children , the environment and the police departments that are forced to clean them up .
Their sources , he said , are local convenience stores .
" While those people may not think they 're causing any harm , the harm they cause is tremendous , " Mr. Nahmias said .
" We really wanted to send the message that if you get into that line of business , selling products that you know are going to be used to make meth , you 're going to go to prison . "
Operation Meth Merchant started , Mr. Nahmias said , with complaints from local sheriffs that certain stores were catering to the labs .
Prosecutors paid confidential informants -- some former convicts , others offered the promise of lighter punishment for pending charges -- to buy products in stores in six counties beginning in early 2004 , and drop hints that they were making drugs .
I discovered the creative exhilaration of programming at a formative age .
Yet all along I have also felt stifled by primitive , ill - suited languages and tools .
We are still in the Stone Age of programming .
My quest is to better understand the creative act of programming , and to help liberate it .
Reflection upon my own practice of programming has led me to three general observations :
Programming is mentally overwhelming , even for the smartest of us .
The more I program , the harder I realize it is .
Much of this mental effort is laborious maintenance of the many mental models we utilize while programming .
We are constantly translating between different representations in our head , mentally compiling them into code , and reverse - engineering them back out of the code .
This is wasted overhead .
We have no agreement on what the problems of programming are , much less how to fix them .
Our field has little accumulated wisdom , because we do not invest enough in the critical self - examination needed to obtain it : we have a reflective blind - spot .
From these observations I infer three corresponding propositions :
Usability should be the central concern in the design of programming languages and tools .
We need to apply everything we know about human perception and cognition .
It is a matter of “ Cognitive Ergonomics ”  .
Notation matters .
We need to stop wasting our effort juggling unsuitable notations , and instead invent representations that align with the mental models we naturally use .
The benefits of improved programming techniques can not be easily promulgated , since there is no agreement on what the problems are in the first place .
The reward systems in business and academics further discourage non-incremental change .
What is the future of programming ?
I retain a romantic belief in the potential of scientific revolution .
To recite one example , the invention of Calculus provided a revolutionary language for the development of Physics .
I believe that there is a “ Calculus of programming ” waiting to be discovered , which will analogously revolutionize the way we program .
Notation does matter .
Our current choice of notation leaves much to be desired : ASCII strings encoding structure through grammars and names .
We have automated many complex information artifacts , from documents to diagrams , and we have built many complex data models and user interfaces for them .
From this perspective , it is absurd that programs are still just digitized card decks , and programming is done with simulations of keypunch machines .
The move from keypunches to on - screen editing was a huge leap forward , but that was 30 years ago .
We have not yet taken the next logical step , which is to represent programs with the complex information structures made possible by computers .
The guiding goal I propose above is programmer usability .
One way to discover how to make programming more usable is to look for clues in what currently feels the most difficult and unnatural when we program .
Here are some of the clues I am investigating :
We often think of examples to help understand programs .
Programs are abstractions , and abstract thinking is hard .
Across all fields , examples help us learn and work with abstractions .
Example centric programming is my proposal to integrate tool support for examples throughout programming .
Going further , I am trying to reduce the level of abstraction required in the first place with prototype - based semantics and direct - manipulation programming .
We tend to build code by combining and altering existing pieces of code .
Copy & paste is ubiquitous , despite universal condemnation .
In terms of clues , this is a smoking gun .
I propose to decriminalize copy & paste , and to even elevate it into the central mechanism of programming .
The dominant programming languages all adopt the machine model of a program counter and a global memory .
Control flow provides conditional execution , and allows memory accesses ( side - effects ) to be serialized .
The problem is that control flow places a total order on the actions of the program , while both conditionals and side - effects are inherently partially ordered .
One condition arises when a specific combination of other conditions arise .
Likewise we care that a data read occurs only after a specific set of data writes .
Control flow languages force us to do a topological sort in our head to compile these relationships into a linear execution schedule .
What ’s worse , we later have to reverse engineer the tacit relationships back out of the code .
Control flow is a suitable notation only for the back - end of a compiler , and should be considered harmful to humans .
Escaping the linear confines of textual notation is a first step towards directly expressing non-linear relationships .
To better represent side - effect relationships , I am exploring database - like transactional semantics .
Our languages are lobotomized into static and dynamic parts : compile - time and run-time .
This dichotomy exists solely for ease of compilation and optimization of performance .
Modern hardware and compilers have made these concerns unimportant in most situations , yet they live on enshrined in the design of our languages .
There should be no difference between run-time and edit - time .
More generally , we must discipline ourselves to ignore the siren call of performance , keeping the tiller pointed towards usability .
We can roughly categorize many mental models into two types : structural and behavioral .
Some cognitive scientists trace this division to specializations for vision and communication , respectively .
Our programming languages are highly biased about these two representation styles .
Generally , we use structural models for static constructs , and we use behavioral models for dynamic constructs .
This pattern is seen most clearly in pure OO languages like Smalltalk .
We can not afford to program with one hand tied behind our back : we need to integrate the use of structural and behavioral models throughout programming .
To better frame the issue , I am exploring the â€œdualâ€ of OO , in which the encapsulation of behavior is replaced by the publication of reactive structure .
These clues outline a long - term research program , in which I hope to collaborate with others of like mind .
The first steps can be seen at subtext .
Leaping ahead , let us suppose for the moment that we have invented a revolutionary new way to program .
How can we get programmers to use it , academics to research it , and entrepreneurs to invest in it ?
As discussed earlier , there are deeply entrenched obstacles to change , both psychological and institutional .
The endless cycle of hype and disappointment has hardened cynicism .
I am afraid that we have reached the point where talking is useless .
I can think of only one strategy to break this deadlock : lead by example .
We need to get our hands dirty and build real code for real users , and do it better - faster - cheaper .
Nothing succeeds like success .
Thinking even further out , perhaps we could establish something like a teaching hospital : a non-profit organization that combines programming for real clients with a mission of education and research .
In the meantime , the first job is the inventing .

[ Welcome Diggers .
Before you comment on this old post , I suggest you take a look at what I have done in the meantime .
The best summary is in my last OOPSLA paper . ]
Bush and Cheney have less than two years to go in their current role and want to go down in the history books as the heroes of the Pax Americana , as the men who managed to conquer the Middle East and its oil , as the men who took full - spectrum dominance seriously , while in their own country booking successes through exorbitant profits for the military - industrial complex and the realization of radical legislation .
The prelude was long and the path was full of obstacles , but the goal of a third great war - a war with Iran - is increasingly within sight .
Dan Plesch in The Guardian sums it up in one sentence : ' All the signs are that Bush is planning for a neocon - inspired military assault on Iran ' .
' Americans do n't have much time to realize this and to act before it is too late .
Bush 's " surge " speech last Wednesday night makes it completely clear that his real purpose is to start wars with Iran and Syria before failure in Iraq brings an end to the neoconservative / Israeli plan to establish hegemony over the Middle East ' , writes Paul Craig Roberts , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan .
' Commenting about the briefing on MSNBC after Bush 's nationwide address , NBC's Washington bureau chief Tim Russert said " there 's a strong sense in the upper echelons of the White House that Iran is going to surface relatively quickly as a major issue — in the country and the world — in a very acute way " ' , writes Robert Parry .
Given the presence of four American submarines off the coast of Iran , Eduard Baltin , former commander of the Russian fleet , reasons that the U.S. is planning to attack Iran .
Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich , himself a presidential candidate for 2008 , says : '" The President is clearly trying to provoke Iran , " he said , adding that the Bush administration is " treading on the thinnest ice it has ever been on " . '
ING Wholesale Banking warns in their report [ PDF ]
Attacking Iran that the financial markets could be in for ' a heavy shock ' in the event of a preemptive attack on Iran .
The report is practical as well ; under the heading ' Top trades in the event of an attack on Iran ' , advice for buying and selling can be found , such as : ' Buy Oil and Gold , Sell industrial commodities ' .
Meanwhile the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is letting it be known that he disposes over the same devotion as his adversary Bush : '" Today , with the grace of God , we have gone through the arduous passes and we are ready for anything in this path , " state - run television quoted Ahmadinejad as saying Thursday ' .
Speculation over the beginning of the attack on Iran
In reference to the American raid on an Iranian consulate in Irbil , Northern Iraq , in which five Iranians were taken into custody , John Pike of Global Security points to the presence of two aircraft carriers in the Gulf ( other warships are steaming in that direction ) and to the surge - speech by George W. Bush , in which he announced that Patriot missiles would be deployed in member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) , like Kuwait and Saudi - Arabia .
' Iran has denounced the Patriot deployment as part of U.S. plan to turn Arab countries into a front line of protection for Israel ' , writes Associated Press .
Bush : ' We will interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria .
And we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq . '
Pike speaking to CNN : '[ ...]
It 's looks to me like the United States is , at least , raising its capabilities in preparation for possible military confrontation with Iran . " '
Pike considers it a strong possibility that this confronation will take place this year , and has even published a ' Countdown time line ' with potential dates on which an attack is likely .
In Pike 's opinion , February of 2007 is a genuine possibility for a strike on Iran .
February is also the month in which Ahmadinejad will be announcing progress with their nuclear program , and will also mark the end of the sixty - day period given to Iran in UN resolution 1713 [ PDF ] to bring an end to their nuclear program .
On February 21st , the IAEA will deliver a report on Iran , something which Israel and the U.S. will again be able to seize upon when pointing to Iranian negligence .
The editor - in - chief of the Arab Times is expecting an attack before April : ' U.S. might launch a military strike on Iran before April 2007 , Kuwait - based daily Arab Times released on Sunday said in a report .
The report , written by Arab Times ' Editor - in - chief Ahmed al - Jarallah citing a reliable source , said that the attack would be launched from the sea , while Patriot missiles would guard all Arab countries in the Gulf . '
The Arab Times is basing its opinion on only one source .
ING Wholesale Banking writes [ PDF ] in the preface to their report on Iran : ' We outline a scenario in which Israel attacks 5 or 6 of Iran 's nuclear facilities in late February or March 2007 , with strikes that may be completed within hours , days or at most weeks . '
What could also hasten an attack on Iran are two divergent realities , namely that the announced Tor - M1 air defense system is now being delivered to Iran , and that Bush 's comrade - in - arms Tony Blair will be stepping down this year .
In a recent speech Blair prepared his countrymen for a long - term fight against global terrorism : '" The battle will be long .
It has taken a generation for this global movement , for the enemy , to grow .
It will in all probability take a generation to defeat , " he said . '
Blair has also announced that he wants to make more money available for the British army .
Banks putting Iran under pressure
The latest news does n't portend anything good , but those who read between the lines can see that other preparations are also being made .
Comparable to an extent with the No Fly Zone War , which preceded the latest war against Iraq , Iran is being softened up in advance : ' While people are concerned with Iraq and the gathering armada in the Persian Gulf , United States has been quietly carrying out a not so covert economic war against Iran ' , writes Dr. Abbas Bakhtiar .
' The attack on Iranian economy started in earnest in early 2006 .
United States began putting considerable pressure on international banks and financial institutions to cut their ties with Iran .
Countries also were pressured to reduce their economic contact with Iran . [...]
Governments , companies and financial institutions are under intense pressure to terminate all dealings with Iran .
But so far Iran has managed to sustain , albeit with great difficulty , its oil industry and financial institutions functioning . '
Little by little banks are severing their ties with Iran : '" The reason : oil transactions are in dollar assets .
To the extent that any banks have to convert their assets into dollars , they must use U.S. facilities and can be subject to U.S. sanctions " , says Stuart Eizenstat , former American Under Secretary of State for Economic , Business and Agricultural Affairs to Michael Hirsh , who writes : ' Recently the Iranians have countered , threatening to do business in Euros , but one by one , European banks are falling under U.S. pressure as well .
On Wednesday The Wall Street Journal reported that Commerzbank , Germany 's second largest , will stop handling dollar transactions for Iran — making it the last European bank to agree to do so . '
Anti-Iranian propaganda
An argument often used against Iran concerns the aggressive pronouncement by its leader Mahmoud Ahmadinjehad that he would like to wipe Israel off the map .
Jonathan Steel , columnist for The Guardian , has subjected this statement and the translations thereof to further investigation .
He has inquired with the BBC , among others .
Steel : ' As a result of my inquiry and the controversy generated , they [ the BBC ] had gone back to the native Farsi - speakers who had translated the speech from a voice recording made available by Iranian TV on October 29 2005 .
Here is what the spokesman told me about the " off the map " section : " The monitor has checked again .
It 's a difficult expression to translate .
They 're under time pressure to produce a translation quickly and they were searching for the right phrase .
With more time to reflect they would say the translation should be " eliminated from the page of history " . [...]
So there we have it .
Starting with Juan Cole , and going via the New York Times ' experts through MEMRI to the BBC 's monitors , the consensus is that Ahmadinejad did not talk about any maps .
He was , as I insisted in my original piece , offering a vague wish for the future . '
Steel makes it clear that Ahmadinejad expressed a wish for a different government in Israel , not the destruction of Israel ; ' He was not making a military threat ' .
The Jewish community in Iran is n't itching to flee either : only 152 of the 25,000 responded to calls from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society .
Then there is also the statement by Ahmadinejad in which he denies the Holocaust , that the Holocaust would be a myth .
Kein Krieg !
checked into it and it appears that Ahmadinejad is critical of the exploitation of the Holocaust .
So the subject of his feelings on this is not the Holocaust itself , but rather what he sees as the exploitation thereof .
From his statements it would be more proper to infer that he acknowledges the Holocaust - not that he denies it .
This is the complete inverse of his words , which was corrected by Kein Krieg ! , but has already done its propagandistic job in the minds of the public at large .
And speaking of propaganda : ' The American Jewish Committee took out a full page ad [ PDF ] in The New York Times showing Iran in the center of concentric circles , including all the Middle East and beyond , asking : " Can anyone within range of Iran 's missiles feel safe ? " '
Ex -Premier and leader of the Likud party Benjamin Netanyahu : " The year is 1938 and Iran is Germany , " said Netanyahu , reiterating his message from last month in Los Angeles . '
Whereby it was noted : ' Except that 2003 was also 1938 , when Natanyahu said the same thing about Iraq . [...]
And while he 's calling Mahmoud Ahmadinjad Hitler these days , in the past he had bestowed that honor on Saddam Hussein and Yasser Arafat . '
Cheney is operating on the same wavelength as Netanyahu : '" So the threat that Iran represents is growing , " he [ Cheney ] said , in words reminiscent of how he once built a case against Mr. Hussein ' , writes The New York Times with subtlety .
Criticism of the neoconservative plans for Iran
Should it come to war , then the advice of Paul Craig Roberts , the former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Ronald Reagan , could end up being heeded .
He is pleading for the impeachment of Bush as a way to prevent the war .
Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich , a presidential candidate for 2008 , is threatening impeachment if Bush declares war on Iran .
The criticism by Roberts is in line with that of Republican Rep. Ron Paul , who warns that Bush could order a ' Gulf of Tonkin type situation ' , i.e. a false - flag operation , as an excuse to attack Iran .
The Republican Senator Chuck Hagel : ' " I will do everything I can to stop the president 's policy as he outlined it ( last ) Wednesday night " ' , who together with two Democrats and a Republican has introduced a resolution opposing the plans of President Bush .
The White House even dragged Al Qaida into it in order to take the sting out of the criticism .
Bush : ' Asked if Congress could stop him from surging 21,500 troops into Iraq , Bush on 60 Minutes brushed aside Congress as irrelevant .
" I fully understand [ the Congress ] could try to stop me from doing it .
But I 've made my decision .
And we 're going forward . "
Asked if he had sole authority " to put the troops in there no matter what the Congress wants to do , " Bush replied , " In this situation I do , yeah . " '
Republican Rep. Walter Jones is determined to carry through on his resolution H.J. Res 14 : ' Our constitution states that -- while the Commander in Chief has the power to conduct wars -- only Congress has the power to authorize war ' , to which The Nation adds : ' Such a basic expression of the separation of powers should be obvious .
But with the Bush Administration , one never knows . '
The Wall Street Journal sees the seething criticism of Bush 's plans as well and writes : ' Of more concern to U.S. lawmakers is the potential that these U.S. actions against Iran could escalate .
Under one possible scenario , U.S. forces could cross into Iran or Syria in pursuit of suspected insurgents or their allies , or use alleged Iranian activities inside Iraq as a pretext for a wider assault on Iran .
The fear is that any such military activities could ignite a wider conflict . "
The potential for sparking a wider conflict is great , " said Trita Parsi , an Iran analyst and president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington .
" I think that if we 're going for a confrontation with Iran , the pretext will be Iraq . " '
Nicholas Burns sees it from a different perspective : ' Nicholas Burns , undersecretary of state for political affairs , said the administration is seeking to counter Iranian provocations across the region as part of a broader strategy .
" Iran needs to learn to respect us , " he said .
" And Iran certainly needs to respect American power in the Middle East . " '
War against Iran : Bush and Cheney have nothing to lose
The decisions that Bush announced in his speech followed the replacement of the generals who were critical of some of the Bush policies , John Abizaid and George Casey , and John Negroponte , Director of National Intelligence .
This makes it clear that the neoconservative wind , after all the scandals and the dramatic turn of events in the war in Iraq , has n't died down yet .
Mainstream critic Keith Olbermann writes [ video ] : ' Only this president could look out over a vista of 3,008 dead and 22,834 wounded in Iraq , and finally say , " Where mistakes have been made , the responsibility rests with me " - only to follow that by proposing to repeat the identical mistake ... in Iran . '
He compares Bush to the drunk who , beaten to the ground , asks who the next one is that wants a beating .
Bush and Cheney are again determined to defy the criticism in order to carry out an almost endless War against Terrorism : '" This is an existential conflict , " Cheney said .
" It is the kind of conflict that 's going to drive our policy and our government for the next 20 or 30 or 40 years .
We have to prevail and we have to have the stomach for the fight long term ' , says Cheney .
War is not a means but an end in itself .
Insurgents in Iraq are n't the problem , but those who oppose the war certainly are .
But those critics are out of the way now :
The critical generals have been replaced and the voice of the people along with the the opinions of the soldiers in Iraq are being ignored ; discussions with Iran and Syria are being rejected ; Patriot missiles are on their way and could intercept an Iranian counterattack following an Israeli and / or American attack ; the warships in the Gulf could respond to these attacks by bombing Iraq with full force ; the announced troop escalation in Iraq could eliminate Iran 's potential trump card - attacks on Americans in and around the Iraqi Green Zone ; the Bush administration and the government of Prime Minister Olmert ( following the debâcle in Lebanon ) are doing very poorly in the opinion polls , thus a spectacular attack by Israel , followed by America , could likewise render spectacular results for the status of both heads of state .
Bush and Cheney have taken a beating , but they have not been defeated .
Moreover , they have nothing to lose .
In May , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) forecast an above - normal Atlantic hurricane season , with up to 16 named storms and 10 full - blown hurricanes , six of them Category 3 or greater .
But with the August - through - October peak nearly over and only nine named storms to date – five of which reached hurricane status – this year 's season , which ends Nov. 30 , looks pretty low - key .
Many scientists credit the unexpected arrival of an El Niño , a periodic warming of the eastern Pacific that suppresses hurricane formation .
But it may have been something else , too : desert dust .
A new study in Geophysical Research Letters suggests that large amounts of hot , dry , dust - laden air coming off West Africa may have squelched Atlantic hurricanes .
Nascent hurricanes need warm water – at least 80 degrees F. – and relatively calm atmospheric conditions to form .
The warm , moist air rises , billowing into clouds and eventually forming storms .
In summer , these conditions prevail over the ocean off West Africa , where 85 percent of all major hurricanes originate .
Some years , however , powerful winds blow off West Africa , carrying Saharan dust as far west as Central America and the Amazon basin .
Scientists have long suspected that these massive dust storms , often covering an area the size of the lower 48 states , can stymie hurricane formation in the Atlantic .
" It 's almost like moving the Sahara desert over the ocean , " says Amato Evan , lead author of the study and an assistant researcher at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at the University of Wisconsin in Madison .
This stops hurricane formation in several ways .
Saharan dust " absorbs solar energy just like a rock under a tree during the summertime , " says Jason Dunion , field program director at the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA 's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami and a coauthor of the study .
The heated dust further warms the air , which prevents the moist ocean air below from rising , squashing the storm .
Airborne particles can serve as nuclei for water droplets to form , creating precipitation and clouds .
But the sheer number of granules in these storms inhibits this process .
No single particle can accumulate enough water to form a droplet .
Most important , the dryness of the Saharan air – up to 50 percent drier than ocean air – creates a strong wind shear .
" When you have air that 's that dry , it 's almost like getting out of a shower on a cold morning , " says Dunion .
" The moisture gets ripped right off you . "
The powerful wind effectively lops the top off " seedling " storms , stopping them before they get started .
But lots of dust does not always mean fewer hurricanes .
In 2005 , the year of Katrina and Rita and the most active hurricane season on record , more Saharan dust arrived in the Caribbean than at any time during the previous 30 years , says Joseph Prospero , director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami .
" It goes completely contrary to our argument , " Mr. Prospero says , adding that many other factors , like the location of high - pressure systems over the Atlantic and El Niño in the Pacific , affect hurricane formation .
Prospero , who has measured Saharan dust in the Caribbean since the 1960s , saw it increase four - fold in the 1970s .
Saharan dust varies directly with rainfall in the Sahel , a belt of land just below the Sahara Desert running the width of Africa , he says .
Not coincidentally , the Sahel has suffered drought conditions since the 1970s .
The drought " is largely attributable to rising world temperatures and , specifically , increased temperatures in the Arabian Sea and Atlantic Ocean , " he says .
If carbon - dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are responsible for rising global temperatures , " then this increased dust that we 're seeing is anthropogenic . "
In other words , humans may be to blame .
But human activity of another form may also have an impact , says Natalie Mahowald , a scientist who studies mineral aerosols at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo .
Not only does dust coming off West Africa vary with rainfall in the Sahel , she points out , but with farming and pasture use as well .
" The biggest source of dust may be natural , but that does n't mean all the dust is natural , " she says .
As for the future , Ms. Mahowald foresees less dust , not more .
Many climate models – hers included – predict higher global temperatures will lead to a wetter Sahara .
Add to that the fertilization effects of higher levels of CO2 , which may allow vegetation to colonize environments that were too hostile before – like the Sahara – and we might be in for " a less dusty future , " she says .
How Sahara dust helps the Amazon
The world 's largest desert , the Sahara , currently dumps up to 200 million tons of dust into the North Atlantic annually .
Scientists blame this dust , which may land as far west as Central America , for everything from melting glaciers in the Alps to the decline of Caribbean corals .
Because it is fine and reddish in color , residents of the southeastern United States , especially those in south Florida , often confuse Saharan dust with haze and smog .
On bad days , authorities in Puerto Rico issue air - quality alerts because of the dust .
But the dust 's most significant role may be as fertilizer .
Blowing off arid land , the dust is rich in iron and phosphorus – minerals often leached from soil in wetter climes .
Scientists have blamed the fertilizing effects of this dust for toxic algal blooms in the Gulf of Mexico , even as they credit the dust for enriching soil in Bermuda .
But the greatest single beneficiary may be the Amazon rain forest , which scientists estimate receives one - third to one - half – up to 13 million tons – of all the Saharan dust that floats into the Western Hemisphere .
In fact , some scientists think that the Amazon rain forest may grow and shrink in direct proportion to the expansion and contraction of the Sahara Desert .
On different occasions during the Pleistocene era , which ended 10,000 years ago , green savanna dominated the Sahara and grassland – not rain forest – covered parts of the Amazon basin .
Separated by an ocean but connected by dust , the two ecosystems may move as one .

Docking boxes ( dbx ) Version 3.0 — 26th March 2009 Docking boxes ( dbx ) adds animated drag ' n ' drop , snap - to - grid , and show / hide - contents functionality to any group of elements .
And how could I resist re-creating one of the most iconic interfaces of modern times to show it off !
The script can work with rows , columns , or two - dimensional grids of objects , of any size and shape .
And as you 've come to expect from brothercake , all the functionality is fully accessible to the keyboard .
First released in March 2006 , dbx2 was the first implementation of keyboard - accessible drag ' n ' drop ever developed , and remains one of the most robust and elegant solutions on the web .
Version 3 has been more than two years in development , and includes a whole raft of new features , improvements to existing features , and bugfixes from the previous version ( 2.05 ) .
See the Latest update section below for a complete rundown of what 's new .

More demos
Here 's a clutch of demos to highlight the major features , and suggest some ideas for possible applications .
You can also download these demos individually :
The navigation boxes demo is the one that 's included in the default download zipfile .
Get the script
Download the zipfile [ 70 K ] and unzip it into your site directory .
There are two main includes to put in the < head > section of your page — the main dbx script , and the stylesheet :
<!--
Docking boxes ( dbx ) by brothercake - http://www.brothercake.com/ --> < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" dbx.js " ></ script > <!-- dbx stylesheet --> < link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text / css " href = " dbx.css " media= " screen , projection " />
Then if you 're using either the rules engine or the remote controls , you will also need to include the relevant codebase in the < head > section ; it can go anywhere after the main dbx.js script :
<!-- dbx rules engine --> < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" dbx.rules.js " ></ script > <!-- dbx remote controls --> < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" dbx.remotes.js " ></ script >
Finally , there 's a single script include that should go at the very end of the < body > section , which is the dbx configuration script :
<!-- dbx configuration script --> < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" dbx-key.js " ></ script >
The configuration script contains the object constructors that configure and initialize the dbx manager , and each of the dbx groups you 're using .
Putting it at the end of the body is the preferred method , because this avoids the need to use any kind of load wrapper .
This consequently also avoids the possibility of a flash of unsorted content , that might otherwise occur in some browsers ( the momentary appearance of the boxes in their original order , before any cookie state is applied ) .
dbx works in the following or later browser versions : Opera 8 , Firefox 2 , Safari 2 , Chrome , Konqueror 3 , and Internet Explorer 6 .
To put this another way , it works in all browsers that support XMLHttpRequest .
If scripting ( or this script ) is not supported , you 'll get the same HTML and CSS layout , but without dynamic behaviors .
The codebase scripts are all compressed ( stripped of comments and uneccesary whitespace ) so that they load and process faster .
The zipfile also includes fully spaced and commented versions , for your interest and reference , and in case you want to do any hacking .
I would however discourage you from hacking the main scripts , and encourage you to look at the API for any additional or modified behaviors you want .
Editing the core scripts will make future upgrades far more difficult to implement .
dbx manual
The basic setup process is broken down into four steps :
More advanced development is covered in additional documentation :
Latest update
New features in v3.0 :
The script now supports two - dimensional movement , along horizontal , vertical and diagonal axes .
This new orientation can be further broken down into different movement and insertion modes : boxes can be sorted continually ( freeform mode ) or not until the mouse is released [ or the enter key is pressed , for keyboard users ] ( confirm mode ) a box and its target can be swapped over ( swap mode ) , or one inserted before or after another ( insert mode )
, along horizontal , vertical and diagonal axes .
This new orientation can be further broken down into different movement and insertion modes :
A sophisticated , dynamic rules engine that controls what movement is allowed , using a token - based syntax for defining distances and shapes .
This is intended for gaming applications , and allows you to specify things like boxes only moving up or down , or only along a diagonal , or only in a triangular pattern like the movement of a knight in chess .
This is implemented using two new API methods : group.setRule ( ) and group.removeRule ( ) .
And is accompanied by a new API event : manager.onruletest ( which fires whenever a rule is tested )
that controls what movement is allowed , using a token - based syntax for defining distances and shapes .
This is intended for gaming applications , and allows you to specify things like boxes only moving up or down , or only along a diagonal , or only in a triangular pattern like the movement of a knight in chess .
This is implemented using : and .
And is accompanied by : ( which fires whenever a rule is tested )
You can now have dynamic groups , ie .
the number of boxes can vary between and during a session , which means that you can implement groups for which the content is unknown , or where boxes can be added and removed using Ajax .
This is controlled using another new API method : group.refresh ( )
, the number of boxes can vary between and during a session , which means that you can implement groups for which the content is unknown , or where boxes can be added and removed using Ajax .
This is controlled using :
Boxes can now be remotely controlled , using another four new API methods : group.move ( ) ( for moving an object in a specific direction ) , group.swap ( ) ( for swapping two boxes ) , group.insert ( ) ( for inserting one box before or after another ) , and group.toggle ( ) ( for opening or closing a box )
, using : ( for moving an object in a specific direction ) , ( for swapping two boxes ) , ( for inserting one box before or after another ) , and ( for opening or closing a box ) There 's a further three new API events : manager.onanimate ( which fires continually as box animation occurs , so you can tie it into other processes ) , manager .
onafteranimate ( which fires immediately after an animation is complete , for synchronising other things to what is otherwise an asynchronous process ) , and manager .
onbeforestatechange ( which fires just before onstatechange , so you can control it more precisely )
Bugfixes and other improvements :
confirmed support for contemporary browser releases : Opera 9 , IE7 , IE8 , Chrome , Firefox 3 , Safari 3 , Safari 4 , Konqueror 4
, , Chrome , Firefox 3 , Safari 3 , Safari 4 , Konqueror 4 full support for konqueror 3.4 or later ; partial support for konqueror 3.2–3.3 — boxes can be opened and closed , but not moved
no conflict with spatial navigation in Opera ; in fact spatial navigation is now the best way to interact with it , since you can move between targets using Shift +
Arrow and then move them using Arrow
and then move them using a range of new dynamic and / or state - dependent class names : " dbx - box - focus " ( applied to a box when the handle or anchor has the keyboard focus ) " dbx - box - hover " ( applied to a box when the mouse is over its handle or anchor ) " dbx - box - active " ( applied to a box when the mouse or key is down on the handle or anchor ) " dbx - dragclone " ( a clone being dragged with the mouse , in addition to the " dbx- clone " class name ) " dbx- aniclone " ( an animation clone , in addition to the " dbx- clone " class name ) " first - child " and " last - child " ( the boxes which are currently at the beginning and end of their group , respectively )
toggle buttons / anchors can now be < button > elements instead of < a > elements , which means cleaner output ( no junk hrefs ) and potentially better semantics ( hence better usability to assistive devices )
elements instead of elements , which means cleaner output ( no junk hrefs ) and potentially better semantics ( hence better usability to assistive devices ) an expanded range of references available in all API functions
functions improved validation and automatic error - correction in object constructors
refined onboxdrag behaviors , so it only fires from keyboard actions when a target actually exists
behaviors , so it only fires from keyboard actions when a target actually exists full default action suppression in Opera ( as of v9 )
removed support for Opera 7.5 and Safari 1.2 , for the sake of leaner and more efficient code , because these older versions are now little used , if at all
a reduced cookie footprint , by rationalizing the state - string format — it now only stores " - " for closed and otherwise assumes open ; but the cookie parser is still backwardly compatible with the previous format
How it works
The real trick here is that the underlying elements do n't move — what you 're holding when you drag with the mouse , and what you see moving when animation occurs , is just a temporary clone .
The original box is still there , invisible until the drag or animation is complete , at which point the node order is updated for real , the clone destroyed , and the original box made visible once again
This approach worked out significantly cleaner and simpler than restyling the original boxes and creating place - holders in their wake .
But more importantly , it means the script can work off elements with float or relative positioning , and having scaleable or fluid widths .
Some feedback I received on the Prejudice Map shows not everyone knows the meaning of the word " prejudice . "
However , knowledge of this word is crucial in understanding the map .
So to continue to the map , please prove you know how " prejudice " is defined ( for example , here 's a definition ) :
Barbarism seems an obvious enough category .
Ordinarily in our world , the barbarians are them .
They act in ways that seem unimaginably primitive and brutal to us .
For instance , they kidnap or capture someone , American or Iraqi , and cut off his head .
Now , is n’t that the definition of barbaric ?
Who does that anymore ?
The 8th century , or maybe the word “ medieval ”  anyway , some brutal past time  comes to mind immediately , and to the mass mind of our media even faster .
Similarly , to jump a little closer to modernity , they strap grenades , plastic explosives , bombs of various ingenious sorts fashioned in home labs , with nails or other bits of sharp metal added in to create instant shrapnel meant to rend human flesh , to maim and kill .
Then they approach a target  an Israeli bus filled with civilians and perhaps some soldiers , a pizza parlor in Jerusalem , a gathering of Shi’ite or Sunni worshippers at or near a mosque in Iraq or Pakistan , or of unemployed potential police or army recruits in Ramadi or Baghdad , or of shoppers in an Iraqi market somewhere in that country , or perhaps a foreigner on the streets of Kabul and they blow themselves up .
Or they arm backpacks or bags and step onto trains in London , Madrid , Mumbai , and set them off .
Or , to up the technology and modernity a bit , they wire a car to explode , put a jihadist in the driver ’s seat , and drive it into  well , this is now common enough that you can pick your target .
Or perhaps they audaciously hijack four just - fueled jets filled with passengers and run two of them into the World Trade Center , one into the Pentagon , and another into a field in Pennsylvania .
This is , of course , the very definition of barbaric .
Now , let ’s jump a step further into our age of technological destruction , becoming less face - to - face , more impersonal , without , in the end , changing things that much .
They send rockets from southern Lebanon ( or even cruder ones from the Gaza Strip ) against Israeli towns and cities .
These rockets can only vaguely be aimed .
Some can be brought into the general vicinity of an inhabited area ; others , more advanced , into specific urban neighborhoods many tens of miles away  and then they detonate , killing whoever is in the vicinity , which normally means civilians just living their lives , even , in one recent Hezbollah volley aimed at Nazareth , two Israeli Arab children .
In this process , thousands of Israelis have been temporarily driven from their homes .
In the case of rockets by the hundreds lofted into Israel by an armed , organized militia , meant to terrorize and harm civilian populations , these are undoubtedly war crimes .
Above all , they represent a kind of barbarism that  with the possible exception of some of those advanced Hezbollah rockets  feels primitive to us .
Despite the explosives , cars , planes , all so basic to our modern way of life , such acts still seem redolent of ancient , less civilized times when people did especially cruel things to each other face to face .
The Religion of Air Power
That ’s them .
But what about us ?
On our we / they planet , most groups do n’t consider themselves barbarians .
Nonetheless , we have largely achieved non-barbaric status in an interesting way  by removing the most essential aspect of the American ( and , right now , Israeli ) way of war from the category of the barbaric .
I ’m talking , of course , about air power , about raining destruction down on the earth from the skies , and about the belief  so common , so long - lasting , so deep - seated  that bombing others , including civilian populations , is a “ strategic ” thing to do ; that air power can , in relatively swift measure , break the “ will ” not just of the enemy , but of that enemy ’s society ; and that such a way of war is the royal path to victory .
This set of beliefs was common to air - power advocates even before modern air war had been tested , and repeated unsuccessful attempts to put these convictions into practice have never really shaken  not for long anyway  what is essentially a war - making religion .
The result has been the development of the most barbaric style of warfare imaginable , one that has seldom succeeded in breaking any societal will , though it has destroyed innumerable bodies , lives , stretches of countryside , villages , towns , and cities .
Even today , we find Israeli military strategists saying things that could have been put in the mouths of their air - power - loving predecessors endless decades ago .
The New York Times ‘ Steven Erlanger , for instance , recently quoted an unnamed “ senior Israeli commander ” this way : “ He predicted that Israel would stick largely to air power for now .
‘ A ground maneuver wo n’t solve the problem of the long - range missiles , ’ he said .
‘ The problem is the will to launch .
We have to break the will of Hezbollah . ' ”
Do n’t hold your breath is the first lesson history teaches on this particular assessment of the powers of air war ; the second is that , a decade from now , some other “ senior commander ” in some other country will be saying the same thing , word for word .
When it comes to brutality , the fact is that ancient times have gotten a bad rap .
Nothing in history was more brutal than the last century ’s style of war - making  than those two world wars with their air armadas , backed by the most advanced industrial systems on the planet .
Powerful countries then bent every elbow , every brain , to support the destruction of other human beings en masse , not to speak of the Holocaust ( which was assembly - line warfare in another form ) , and the various colonial and Cold War campaigns that went on in the Third World from the 1940s on ; which , in places like Korea and Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia , substituted the devastation of air power locally for a war between the two superpowers which might have employed the mightiest air weaponry of all to scour the Earth .
It may be that the human capacity for brutality , for barbarism , has n’t changed much since the 8hth century , but the industrial revolution  and in particular the rise of the airplane  opened up new landscapes to brutality ; while the view from behind the gun-sight , then the bomb - sight , and finally the missile - sight slowly widened until all of humanity was taken in .
From the lofty , godlike vantage point of the strategic as well as the literal heavens , the military and the civilian began to blur on the ground .
Soldiers and citizens , conscripts and refugees alike , became nothing but tiny , indistinguishable hordes of ants , or nothing at all but the structures that housed them , or even just concepts , indistinguishable one from the other .
One Plane , One Bomb
As far as anyone knows , the first bomb was dropped by hand over the Italian colony of Libya .
According to Sven Lindqvist ’s A History of Bombing , one Lt. Giulio Cavotti “ leaned out of his delicate monoplane and dropped the bomb  a Danish Haasen hand grenade  on the North African oasis Tagiura , near Tripoli .
Several moments later , he attacked the oasis Ain Zara .
Four bombs in total , each weighing two kilos , were dropped during this first air attack . ”
That was 1911 and the damage was minimal .
Only 34 years later , vast armadas of B - 17s and B - 29s were taking off , up to a thousand planes at a time , to bomb Germany and Japan .
In the case of Tokyo  then constructed almost totally out of highly flammable materials  a single raid carrying incendiary bombs and napalm that began just after midnight on March 10 , 1945 , proved capable of incinerating or killing at least 90,000 people , possibly many more , from such a height that the dead could not be seen ( though the stench of burning flesh carried up to the planes ) .
The first American planes to arrive over the city , wrote historian Michael Sherry in his book , The Rise of American Air Power , “ carved out an X of flames across one of the world ’s most densely packed residential districts ; followers fed and broadened it for some three hours thereafter . ”
What descended from the skies , as James Carroll puts it in his new book , House of War , was “ 1,665 tons of pure fire the most efficient and deliberate act of arson in history .
The consequent firestorm obliterated fifteen square miles , which included both residential and industrial areas .
Fires raged for four days . ”
It was the bonfire of bonfires , and not a single American plane was shot down .
On Aug. 6 , 1945 , all the power of that vast air armada was again reduced to a single plane , the Enola Gay , and a single bomb , “ Little Boy , ” dropped near a single bridge in a single city , Hiroshima , which in a single moment of a sort never before experienced on the planet did what it had taken 300 B - 29s and many hours to do to Tokyo .
In those two cities  as well as Dresden and other German and Japanese cities subjected to “ strategic bombing ”  the dead ( perhaps 900,000 in Japan and 600,000 in Germany ) were invariably preponderantly civilian , and far too distant to be seen by plane crews often dropping their bomb loads in the dark of night , giving the scene below the look of Hell on Earth .
So 1911 : one plane , one bomb .
1945 : one plane , one bomb  but this time at least 120,000 dead , possibly many more .
Two bookmarks less than four decades apart on the first chapter of a history of the invention of a new kind of warfare , a new kind of barbarism that , by now , is the way we expect war to be made , a way that no longer strikes us as barbaric at all .
This was n’t always the case .
The Shock of the New
When military air power was in its infancy and silent films still ruled the movie theaters , the first air - war films presented pilots as knights of the heavens , engaging in courageous , chivalric , one - on - one combat in the skies .
As that image reflects , in the wake of the meat - grinder of trench warfare in World War I , the medieval actually seemed far less brutal , a time much preferable to those years in which young men had died by their hundreds of thousands , anonymously , from machine guns , artillery , poison gas , all the lovely inventions of industrial civilization , ground into the mud of no - man ’s - land , often without managing to move their lines or the enemy ’s more than a few hundred yards .
The image of chivalric knights in planes jousting in the skies slowly disappeared from American screens , as after the 1950s would , by and large , air power itself even as the war film went on ( and on and on ) .
It can last be found perhaps in the film Top Gun ; in old Peanuts comics in which Snoopy remains forever the Red Baron ; and , of course , post - Star Wars , in the fantasy realm of outer space where Jedi Knights took up lethal sky - jousting in the late 1970s , X - wing fighter to X - wing fighter , and in zillions of video games to follow .
In the meantime , the one - way air slaughter in South Vietnam would be largely left out of the burst of Vietnam films that would start hitting the screen from the late 1970s on .
In the real , off - screen world , that courtly medieval image of air power disappeared fast indeed .
As World War II came ever closer and it became more apparent what air power was best at  what would now be called “ collateral damage ”  the shock set in .
When civilians were first purposely targeted and bombed in the industrializing world rather than in colonies like Iraq , the act was initially widely condemned as inhuman by a startled world .
People were horrified when , during the Spanish Civil War in 1937 , Hitler ’s Condor Legion and planes from fascist Italy repeatedly bombed the Basque town of Guernica , engulfing most of its buildings in a firestorm that killed hundreds , if not thousands , of civilians .
If you want to get a sense of the power of that act to shock then , view Picasso ’s famous painting of protest done almost immediately in response .
( When Secretary of State Colin Powell went to the UN in February 2003 to deliver his now infamous speech explaining what we supposedly knew about Saddam Hussein ’s weapons of mass destruction , UN officials  possibly at the request of the Bush administration  covered over a tapestry of the painting that happened to be positioned where Powell would have to pass on his way to deliver his speech and where press comments would be offered afterwards . )
Later in 1937 , as the Japanese began their campaign to conquer China , they bombed a number of Chinese cities .
A single shot of a Chinese baby wailing amid the ruins , published in Life magazine , was enough to horrify Americans ( even though the actual photo may have been doctored ) .
Air power was then seen as nothing but a new kind of barbarism .
According to historian Sherry , “ In 1937 and 1938 , [ President Roosevelt ] had the State Department condemn Japanese bombing of civilians in China as ‘ barbarous ’ violations of the ‘ elementary principles ’ of modern morality . ”
Meanwhile , observers checking out what effect the bombing of civilians had on the “ will ” of society offered nothing but bad news to the strategists of air power .
As Sherry writes :
“ In the Saturday Evening Post , an American army officer observed that bombing had proven ‘ disappointing to the theorists of peacetime . ’
When Franco ’s rebels bombed Madrid , ‘ Did the Madrilenos sue for peace ?
No , they shook futile fists at the murderers in the sky and muttered , " Swine . " ’
His conclusion : ‘ Terrorism from the air has been tried and found wanting .
Bombing , far from softening the civil will , hardens it . ' ”
Already similar things are being written about the Lebanese , though , in our media , terms like “ barbarism ” and “ terrorism ” are unlikely to be applied to Israel ’s war from the heavens .
New York Times correspondent Sabrina Tavernise , for instance , reported the following from the site of a destroyed apartment building in the bomb - shocked southern Lebanese port of Tyre :
“ Whatever the target , the result was an emotional outpouring in support of Hezbollah .
Standing near a cluster of dangling electrical wires , a group of men began to chant .
‘ By our blood and our soul , we ’ll fight for you , Nasrallah ! ’ they said , referring to Hezbollah ’s leader , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah .
In a foggy double image , another small group chanted the same thing , as if answering , on the other side of the smoke . ”
World War II began with the German bombing of Warsaw .
On Sept. 9 , 1939 , according to Carroll , President Roosevelt “ beseeched the war leaders on both sides to ‘ under no circumstances undertake the bombardment from the air of civilian populations of unfortified cities . ' ”
Then came , the terror - bombing of Rotterdam and Hitler ’s Blitz against England in which tens of thousands of British civilians died and many more were displaced , each event proving but another systemic shock to what was left of global opinion , another unimaginable act by the planet ’s reigning barbarians .
British civilians , of course , still retain a deserved reputation for the stiff - upper - lip - style bravery with which they comported themselves in the face of a merciless German air offensive against their cities that knew no bounds .
No wills were broken there , nor would they be in Russia ( where , in 1942 , perhaps 40,000 were killed in German air attacks on the city of Stalingrad alone )  any more than they would be in Germany by the far more massive Allied air offensive against the German population .
All of this , of course , came before it was clear that the United States could design and churn out planes faster , in greater numbers , and with more fire power than any country on the planet and then wield air power far more massively and brutally than anyone had previously been capable of doing .
That was before the U.S. and Britain decided to fight fire with fire by blitz - and terror - bombing Germany and Japan .
( The U.S. moved more slowly and awkwardly than the British from “ precision bombing ” against targets like factories producing military equipment or oil - storage depots  campaigns that largely failed  to “ area bombing ” that was simply meant to annihilate vast numbers of civilians and destroy cities .
But move American strategists did . )
That was before Dresden and Hiroshima ; before Pyongyang , along with much of the Korean peninsula , was reduced to rubble from the air in the Korean War ; before the Plaine des Jarres was bombed back to the Stone Age in Laos in the late 1960s and early 1970s , before the B - 52s were sent against the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong in the terror - bombing of Christmas 1972 to wring concessions out of the North Vietnamese at the peace table in Paris ; before the first President Bush ended the first Gulf War with a “ turkey shoot ” on the “ highway of death ” as Saddam Hussein ’s largely conscript military fled Kuwait City in whatever vehicles were at hand ; before we bombed the rubble in Afghanistan into further rubble in 2001 , and before we shock - and - awed Baghdad in 2003 .
Taking the Sting Out of Air War
Somewhere in this process , a new language to describe air war began to develop  after , in the Vietnam era , the first “ smart bombs ” and “ precision - guided weapons ” came on line .
From then on , air attacks would , for instance , be termed “ surgical ” and civilian casualties dismissed as but “ collateral damage . ”
All of this helped removed the sting of barbarity from the form of war we had chosen to make our own ( unless , of course , you happened to be one of those “ collateral ” people under those “ surgical ” strikes ) .
Just consider , for a moment , that , with the advent of the first Gulf War , air power  as it was being applied  essentially became entertainment , a Disney - style , son-et - lumière spectacular over Baghdad to be watched in real time on television by a population of noncombatants from thousands of miles away .
With that same war , the Pentagon started calling press briefings and screening nose - cone photography , essentially little Iraqi snuff films , in which you actually looked through the precision - guided bomb or missile - sights yourself , found your target , and followed that missile or smart bomb right down to its explosive impact .
If you were lucky , the Pentagon even let you check out the after - mission damage assessments .
These films were so nifty , so like the high - tech video - game experience just then coming into being , that they were used by the Pentagon as reputation enhancers .
From then on , Pentagon officials not only described their air weaponry as “ surgical ” in its abilities , but showed you the “ surgery ” ( just as the Israelis have been doing with their footage of “ precision ” attacks in Lebanon ) .
What you did n’t see , of course , was the “ collateral damage ” which , when the Iraqis put it on - screen , was promptly dismissed as so much propaganda .
And yet this new form of air war had managed to move far indeed from the image of the knightly joust , from the sense , in fact , of battle at all .
In those years , except over the far north of Korea during the Korean War or over North Vietnam and some parts of South Vietnam , American pilots , unless in helicopters , went into action ( as Israeli ones do today ) knowing that the dangers to them were usually minimal  or , as over that Iraqi highway of death nonexistent .
War from the air was in the process of becoming a one - way street of destruction .
At an extreme , with the arrival of fleets of Hellfire - missile - armed unmanned Predator drones over Iraq , the “ warrior ” would suddenly find himself seven thousand miles away at Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas , delivering “ precision ” strikes that almost always , somehow , managed to kill collaterally .
In such cases , war and screen war have indeed merged .
This kind of war has the allure , from a military point of view , of ever less casualties on one end in return for ever more on the other .
It must also instill a feeling of bloodless , godlike control over those enemy “ ants ” ( until , of course , things begin to go wrong , as they always do ) as well as a sense that the world can truly be “ remade ” from the air , by remote control , and at a great remove .
This has to be a powerful , even a transporting fantasy for strategists , however regularly it may be denied by history .
Despite the cleansed language of air war , and no matter how good the targeting intelligence or smart the bomb ( neither of which can be counted on ) , civilians who make the mistake of simply being alive and going about their daily business die in profusion whenever war descends from the heavens .
This is the deepest reality of war today .
Afghanistan , Iraq , Lebanon [ Fill in the Blank ]
In fact , the process of removing air power from the ranks of the barbaric , of making it , if not glorious ( as in those visually startling moments when Baghdad was shock - and - awed ) , then completely humdrum , and so of no note whatsoever , has been remarkably successful in our world .
In fact , we have loosed our air power regularly on the countryside of Afghanistan , and especially on rebellious urban areas of Iraq in “ targeted ” and “ precise ” attacks on insurgent concentrations and “ al - Qaeda safe houses ” ( as well as in more wholesale assaults on the old city of Najaf and on the city of Fallujah ) largely without comment or criticism .
In the process , significant parts of two cities in a country we occupied and supposedly “ liberated , ” were reduced to rubble and everywhere , civilians , not to speak of whole wedding parties , were blown away without our media paying much attention at all .
Our various air campaigns  our signature way of war  have hardly been noticed , and almost never focused on , by the large numbers of journalists embedded with U.S. forces or in one way or another on - the - ground in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Remember , we ’re talking here about the dropping of up to 2,000 - pound bombs regularly , over years , often in urban areas .
Just imagine , if you live in a reasonably densely populated area , what it might mean collaterally to have such bombs or missiles hit your block or neighborhood , no matter how “ accurate ” their aim .
Until Seymour Hersh wrote a piece from Washington last November for the New Yorker , entitled “ Up in the Air , ” our reporters had , with rare exceptions , simply refused to look up ; and despite a flurry of attention then , to this day , our continuing air campaigns are largely ignored .
Yet here is an Air Force summary of just a single , nondescript day of operations in Iraq , one of hundreds and hundreds of such days , some far more intense , since we invaded that country : “ In total , coalition aircraft flew 46 close - air support missions for Operation Iraqi Freedom .
These missions included support to coalition troops , infrastructure protection , reconstruction activities , and operations to deter and disrupt terrorist activities . ”
And here ’s the summary of the same day in Afghanistan : “ In total , coalition aircraft flew 32 close - air support missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom .
These missions included support to coalition and Afghan troops , reconstruction activities , and route patrols . ”
Note that , in Afghanistan , as the situation has worsened militarily and politically , the old Vietnam - era B - 52s , the carpet - bombers of that war , have been called back into action , again without significant attention here .
Now , with the fervent backing of the Bush administration , another country is being “ remade ” from the air  in this case , Lebanon .
With the highest - tech American precision - guided and bunker - busting bombs , the Israelis have been launching air strike after strike , thousands of them , in that country .
They have hit an international airport , the nation ’s largest milk factories ; a major food factory ; aid convoys ; Red Cross ambulances ; a UN observer post ; a power plant ; apartment complexes ; villages because they house or support the enemy ; branches of banks because they might facilitate Hezbollah finances ; the telecommunications system because of the messages that might pass along it ; highways because they might transport weapons to the enemy ; bridges because they might be crossed by those transporting weapons ; a lighthouse in Beirut harbor for reasons unknown ; trucks because they might be transporting those weapons ( though they might also be transporting vegetables ) ; families who just happen to be jammed into cars or minivans fleeing at the urging of the attackers who have turned at least 20 percent of all Lebanese ( and probably many more ) into refugees , while creating a “ landscape of death ” ( in the phrase of the superb Washington Post reporter Anthony Shadid ) in the southern part of the country .
In this process , civilian casualties have mounted steadily  assumedly far beyond the figure of just over 400 now regularly being cited in our press , because Lebanon has no way to search the rubble of its bombed buildings for the dead ; nor , right now , the time and ability to do an accurate count of those who died more or less in the open .
And yet , of course , the “ will ” of the enemy is not broken and , among Israel ’s leaders and its citizens , frustration mounts ; so threats of more and worse are made and worse weapons are brought into play ; and wider targeting fields are opened up ; and what might faintly pass for “ precision bombing ” is increasingly abandoned for the equivalent of “ area bombing . ”
And the full support system  which is simply society  for the movement in question becomes the “ will ” that must be broken ; and in this process , what we call “ collateral damage ” is moved , by the essential barbaric logic of air power , front and center , directly into the crosshairs .
Already Israeli Prime Minister Olmert is “ vowing ” to use the “ most severe measures ” to end Hezbollah rocket attacks  and in the context of the present air assault , that is a frightening threat .
All this because , as in Iraq , as elsewhere , air power has once again run up against another kind of power , a fierce people power ( quite capable of its own barbarities ) that , over the decades , the bomb and missile has proved frustratingly incapable of dismantling or wiping out .
Already , as the Guardian ‘s Ian Black points out , “ The original objective of ‘ breaking Hezbollah ’ has been quietly watered down to ‘ weakening Hezbollah . ' ”
In such a war , with such an enemy , the normal statistics of military victory may add up only to defeat , a further frustration that only tends to ratchet the destruction higher over time .
Adam Shatz put this well recently in the Nation when he wrote :
“ [ Hezbollah leader ]
Nasrallah is under no illusions that his small guerrilla movement can defeat the Israeli Army .
But he can lose militarily and still score a political victory , particularly if the Israelis continue visiting suffering on Lebanon , whose government , as they well know , is powerless to control Hezbollah .
Nasrallah , whom the Israelis attempted to assassinate on July 19 with a twenty - three - ton bomb attack on an alleged Hezbollah bunker , is doubtless aware that he may share the fate of his predecessor , Abbas Musawi , who was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship attack in 1992 .
But Hezbollah outlived Musawi and grew exponentially , thanks in part to its followers ’ passion for martyrdom .
To some , Nasrallah ’s raid may look like a death wish .
But it is almost impossible to defeat someone who has no fear of death . ”
As the Israelis are rediscovering  though , by now , you ’d think that military planners with half a brain would n’t have to destroy a country to do so  it is impossible to “ surgically ” separate a movement and its supporters from the air .
When you try , you invariably do the opposite ; fusing them ever more closely , while creating an even larger , ever angrier base for the movement whose essence is , in any case , never literal geography , never simply a set of villages or bunkers or military supplies to be taken and destroyed .
Degrading Behavior
Someday someone will take up the grim study of the cleansing language of air power .
Every air war , it seems , now has its new words meant to take the sting out of its essential barbarism .
In the case of the Israeli air assault on Lebanon , the term  old in the military world but never before so widely adopted in such a commonplace way  is “ degrading , ” not as at Abu Ghraib , but as in “ to impair in physical structure or function . ”
It was once a technical military term ; in this round of air war , however , it is being used to cover a range of sins .
Try Googling the term .
It turns out to be almost literally everywhere .
It can be found in just about any article on Israel ’s air war , used in this fashion : “ CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante reports that around the world the U.S. ’ opposition to a cease - fire is viewed as the U.S. giving Israel a ‘ green - light ’ to degrade the military capability of Hezbollah . ”
Or in a lead in a New York Times piece this way : “ The outlines of an American - Israeli consensus began to emerge Tuesday in which Israel would continue to bombard Lebanon for about another week to degrade Hezbollah ’s capabilities , officials of the two countries said . ”
Or more generally , as in a Washington Post piece , in this fashion : “ In the administration ’s view , the new conflict is not just a crisis to be managed .
It is also an opportunity to seriously degrade a big threat in the region , just as Bush believes he is doing in Iraq . ”
Or as Henry A. Crumpton , the State Department ’s coordinator for counterterrorism , wielded it : “ It ’s not just about the missiles and launchers .
[ I ]t ’s about the roads and transport , the ability to command and control .
All that is being degraded .
But it ’s going to take a long time .
I do n’t believe this is going to be over in the next couple of days . ”
Or as an Israeli general at a Washington think tank told the Washington Times : “ Israel has taken it upon itself to degrade Hezbollah ’s military capabilities . ”
Sometimes degradation of this sort can be quantified : “ A senior Israeli official said Friday that the attacks to date had degraded Hezbollah ’s military strength by roughly half , but that the campaign could go on for two more weeks or longer . ”
More often , it ’s a useful term exactly because it ’s wonderfully vague , quite resistant to quantification , the very opposite of “ precision ” in its ambiguity , and capable of taking some of the sting out of what is actually happening .
It turns the barbarity of air war into something close to a natural process  of , perhaps , erosion , of wearing down over time .
As air wars go , the one in Lebanon may seem strikingly directed against the civilian infrastructure and against society ; in that , however , it is historically anything but unique .
It might even be said that war from the air , since first launched in Europe ’s colonies early in the last century , has always been essentially directed against civilians .
As in World War II , air power  no matter its stated targets  almost invariably turns out to be worst for civilians and , in the end , to be aimed at society itself .
In that way , its damage is anything but “ collateral , ” never truly “ surgical , ” and never in its overall effect “ precise . ”
Even when it does n’t start that way , the frustration of not working as planned , of not breaking the “ will , ” invariably leads , as with the Israelis , to ever wider , ever fiercer versions of the same , which , if allowed to proceed to their logical conclusion , will bring down not society ’s will , but society itself .
For the Lebanese prime minister , what Israel has been doing to his country may be “ barbaric destruction “ ; but , in our world , air power has long been robbed of its barbarism ( suicide air missions excepted ) .
For us , air war involves dumb hits by smart bombs , collateral damage , and surgery that may do in the patient , but it ’s not barbaric .
For that you need to personally cut off a head .

Pink reportedly refuses her husband oral sex and is lazy between the sheets .
The feisty singer , who is married to motorcross champion Carey Hart , has revealed she does n't indulge in certain sexual activities .
When asked about oral sex , she reportedly said : " My God .
That 's disgusting .
I do n't do that " .
The ' Stupid Girls ' singer - who is currently involved in a war of words with hotel heiress Pairs Hilton after she included a spoof portrayal of the blonde 's notorious sex tape in her latest music video - went onto admit that although she is more than happy with her husband 's sexual prowess she does n't do much work in the bedroom .
She added : " I 'm too lazy to go on top .
" Despite Pink 's lack of enthusiasm , she insists she prefers men after an experience with another girl put her off women for good .
She said : " I did kiss a girl it was nice , but she left me for my brother , which is pretty sick , do n't you think .
It was probably her who put me off women .
" I do n't think I have sexual feelings towards woman .
And , anyway , I like Carey 's thing too much , so that pretty much rules out the whole lesbian thing , does n't it ? "
· Poll shows rising anxiety in both US and Europe · Iran now seen as country posing the gravest threat
The Bush administration 's claim that Americans are now safer from terrorism has been undermined by a poll yesterday showing a significant jump in the number of Americans and Europeans concerned about Islamist extremism and other global threats .
The survey , published days before the fifth anniversary of 9/11 , is at odds with a Bush administration document on terrorism on Tuesday that insisted : " America is safer , but we are not yet safe . "
The annual Transatlantic Trends survey , conducted in the US and 12 European countries , records that concern among Americans has risen from 72 % last year to 79 % this year , and among Europeans from 58 % to 66 % .
The biggest jump in concern about Islamist fundamentalism is in the UK , up 22 points .
Concern is expressed in the poll on both sides of the Atlantic , not only about global terrorism and Islamist fundamentalism but the Iraq war , immigration , global warming , the Iraq conflict and confrontation with Iran .
The poll finds a high level of support both in the US and Europe for military intervention to stop Iran securing a nuclear weapon capability should diplomacy fail .
Transatlantic Trends , funded by bodies including the German Marshall Fund of the US , conducted phone interviews with 1,000 people in June in 13 countries : the US , the UK , Germany , France , Italy , Netherlands , Poland , Portugal , Slovakia , Spain , Turkey , Romania and Bulgaria .
The survey records a steep decline in European support over the last five years for US leadership in world affairs .
The more inclusive approach towards Europe taken since last year by Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , has failed to reverse this decline .
In 2002 , 64 % of Europeans took a positive view of the US leadership in world affairs but this has dropped to 37 % .
Only in three European countries is there a still a majority supporting the US : the Netherlands , Romania and the UK ( where opinion is almost evenly divided , 48 % positive to 45 % negative ) .
Europeans polled distinguish between the US and Mr Bush .
When asked about Mr Bush 's leadership in foreign affairs , support drops even further , from 38 % who took a positive view in 2002 to only 18 % this year .
For the first time since 2002 , more Americans ( 58 % ) disapprove of Mr Bush 's handling of international affairs than approve ( 40 % ) , reflecting a steady erosion in support for the Iraq war .
Iran has taken over from Iraq as the country viewed as posing the gravest threat .
With the confrontation with Iran set to intensify over the next fortnight as the US seeks a UN security council resolution to impose sanctions , an overwhelming majority of Americans and Europeans support a continuation of diplomatic activity to prevent it securing a nuclear weapon capability .
Only 15 % of Americans and 5 % of Europeans regard military action as the best option .
But there is a dramatic rise in support for military action in the event of a complete diplomatic breakdown .
In that case , 53 % of Americans would support military action and 45 % of Europeans .
Support for the military action is higher in France , at 54 % , than in the UK , at 46 % .

See , about that " frustration " thing .
I 've spent years working on biochemistry and genetics , looking at it from various angles , studying it in detail from various perspectives ... and all I have encountered has supported evolution as the best explanation for diversity of life .
In all that time , I have yet to find one single person who claims that evolution is impossible , and that actually has a correct argument .
And let me remind you yet again what I mean when I say wrong : their arguments would be wrong even if evolution is wrong .
A lie is a lie is a lie .
In fact , I have met precious few people who actually understand evolution , and who are still denying it .
And those few could n't provide any hard , scientific reasons for their rejection ; they just choose not to believe in it , and trust that someday some fatal flaw will be found .
How frustrating do you think that can get ?
Constantly encountering people who have barely spent any time studying the issue you have studied in great detail , and then telling you that you are completely wrong ?
Not only are you wrong , you are believing something that is so obviously impossible , any fourth grader can see the impossibility !
And then , to top it off , they give you arguments that are incorrect in out of themselves ?
You want me to see the impossibility of evolution ?
I once lost six months of work because a bacterum evolved a new protein , and I did n't catch it immediately .
I use evolution - based bioinformatics programs as a part of my daily job ; they provide correct results , something they could n't do if the theory they are based on was n't sound .
Two weeks ago I attended a seminar on how cancer cells develop resistance to chemoterapy drugs by evolving specific pumps that pump the drug out from the cell .
Yesterday I 've been catching up with new developments in HIV therapies , which is a constant race to outpace the staggeringly swift evolution of the virus .
And this is just a barest scratch on the surface - I could go on for days .
So George , show me the cheddar .
If you have something that will outweigh all of that , and prove the impossibility of evolution I see with my own eyes every day , please , present it here .
I guarantee you that you will be showered with praise and prizes , as you will have made the greatest single breakthrough in science in the last half century ( at least ) .
The catch : it has to actually be true and correct .
Until you do ... well , imagine a man .
This man is standing in the middle of an airport , with hundreds of planes flying overhead .
He is currently talking to a group of aerospace engineers , some of whom have worked on designing actual spacecraft .
And he is telling them , " I get frustrated when you guys cannot see the impossibility of making a flying machine heavier than air " .
Unless you can provide the evidence , George ... you are that man .
> This whole discussion is still a little above my
> pay grade , although I 'm catching up .
Tell me something , then .
It is pretty obvious , and you admit yourself , that you do n't understand biochemistry and genetics too well .
Now , those are both very , very complex subjects , and require a lot of study to understand .
I mean , to understand basic biochemistry , you do need to spend at least a year of concentrated study on it , and this is after taking a year of organic chemistry , and a year of basic chemistry before .
Understanding of general physics and math level where you 're comfortable with calculus are also required .
Finally , the picture wo n't be complete unless you take at least some physical chemistry ( chemical thermodynamics , kinetics of reactions , nonlinear dynamics , stuff like that ) .
This is just for biochemistry , mind you .
A good understanding of genetics takes at least as much .
This is not a matter of intelligence ( unless you are some kind of supergenius , who is able to absorb knowledge by staring at the books for prolonged periods of time ) , there simply are that many facts to keep in mind .
I 'm sure you could do it , if you put in the required time and effort .
But here you are , a person who has only some cursory knowledge of these areas .
You see an argument , based on them , which claims to completely invalidate evolution .
You can understand the argument ( maybe with a bit of trouble , but you can understand it ) , and as far as you can see , it seems to be correct .
Now , did it occur to you to ask yourself : " If I can understand this argument , with my level of knowledge of biochemistry and genetics , how comes that all those people who spent a decade in school to learn those subjects can't comprehend it ?
If it 's so simple and so true , why can't they accept it ? "
And this is where all the stories of scientific conspiracies , evil atheists , and other such crap come in .
Scientists rarely accept things without checking .
Occasionally , someone will manage to pull a hoax off , some distinguished professor will manage to coast for a while on his reputation ( mind you , he generally has to make a reputation first , with genuine stuff ) ... but sooner or later , someone catches up with them .
And the bigger the scam , the more difficult it is to hide .
If evolution was wrong , it would not be accepted by scientists .
Even censorship and peer pressure would n't be able to keep a lid on it very long .
There would be uproar ; there would be groups of scientists organizing themselves ( and getting tons of money from religious organizations ) against the " evolutionist establishment " .
There would be dozens of new antievolution biology journals popping up , publishing papers that show evidence of creation .
In communist countries , if you questioned the official party line , you risked jailtime , being beaten up , or just vanishing into thin air .
Still ( and I speak from personal experience here ) , at least 10 % of the people in power structures opposed the establishment as best as they could .
Even if you accept the most horrible horror stories about evilutionist conspiracies , you do n't have anything even remotely close to this in science ... and yet 99.9 % of the people in the field accept evolution .
How is that possible ?
Would n't at least 10 % resist ?
5 % ? If evolution is so obviously wrong , why are they all supporting it ?
So when you encounter the next piece of evidence that seems to oh so neatly debunk evolution - ask yourself , is it actually correct ?
And instead of approaching a scientist and saying " hey , this proves evolution is impossible " , approach one and say " hey , I found this , is this actually true " ?
You will save yourself a lot of embarassment that way .
Whether you believe it or not , most of us scientists actually know what we are doing .
Or do you really think that we are smart enough to work on things like cancer treatments , while at the same time being so stupid that we can't understand a basic algebraic proof that shows the impossibility of evolution ?
As for your question about duplicated genes , the answer is no .
That is not a problem for evolution , and your understanding of how the process works is n't correct .
I 'm sure that some people will attempt to explain your error to you , and maybe they 'll succeed .
But that wo n't teach you genetics ; it will teach you that this particular argument is n't right , which wo n't prevent you from making some very similar errors in the future .
So , basically , you have a choice between two broad options .
One is to trust us not to lie to you , and that we know what we are talking about .
The other is to check for yourself .
If you choose the second one , however , you must be prepared to put in the work .
I 'll recommend Hartl / Jones ' textbook on genetics , and Voet & Voet 's treatment of biochemistry ; but chances are , you 'll have to go and take classes for a few years .
Well , there is a third option : to believe that you understand it better then we do without having to study it , and therefore reject everything we say out of hand .
But I 'm kinda hoping you are too honest to do something like that .

CAIRO , Egypt —
Lawyers representing a Baha'i couple seeking to have their religious affiliation properly identified on state documents presented arguments yesterday at a full hearing before the Supreme Administrative Court here in a case that has become the focus of a national debate on religious freedom .
The hearing was short , and the court adjourned until 16 December , when it is expected to render a judgment in the case , which is being closely watched by international human rights groups .
The case stems from a lawsuit filed by a married couple , Husam Izzat Musa and Ranya Enayat Rushdy , who had their identification cards and passports confiscated after they applied to have their daughters added to their passports , which listed the Baha'i Faith as their religion .
In Egypt , all citizens must list their religious affiliation on state ID cards and other documents , and current policy requires that they choose from one of the three officially recognized religions -- Islam , Christianity or Judaism .
As such , Baha 'is are being forced to go without ID cards , which are the key to accessing most rights of citizenship , such as education , financial services , and even medical care .
In April , a lower administrative court ruled in favor of the couple , saying the state must issue them ID cards that properly identified their religion .
The ruling said that even if the government did not recognize the Baha'i Faith , adherents should still have their religious status properly stated on official documents .
That ruling provoked an outcry among fundamentalist elements in Egyptian society , who objected to any official mention of a religion other than the three mentioned in the Qur'an , opening a vigorous debate over issues of religious freedom and tolerance here .
Since April , more than 400 articles have appeared in the Egyptian and Arabic news media about the case or its fallout .
The government appealed the lower court 's ruling in May , which brought the case before the Supreme Administrative Court .

Update :
Jane 's got the transcipts done of the audio :
The bellwether of the cautious establishment press , Bob Woodward , has finally unloaded both barrels on the Bush administration ’s Iraq policy , in his new book , State of Denial .
The media hoopla surrounding the book has focused mainly on the administration ’s deceptions surrounding the sorry state of affairs in Iraq and Andrew Card ’s attempts , with the apparent blessing of Laura Bush , to get Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld fired .
Neither of these facts is surprising .
The real surprise in Woodward ’s book has received less attention :
The Bush administration ’s main adviser during the war has been Henry Kissinger .
Kissinger , according to Woodward ’s book , apparently has convinced the Bush White House that any troop withdrawals from Iraq will start a wave of public pressure to pull out all U.S. forces from Iraq .
He is probably right in this analysis .
But Kissinger missed the main lesson of Vietnam and is now missing it in Iraq .
As the U.S. generals in Iraq know , killing more Sunni insurgents and Shi’ite militiamen than the United States loses of its own troops will not win a war that is fundamentally political .
As Lt. Gen. William Odom ( ret. ) , former Director of the National Security Agency and opponent of the war , has noted , the Iraq situation will continue to deteriorate and the United States will eventually be forced to withdraw from Iraq .
So withdrawing sooner , rather than later , according to Odom , will save U.S. lives and money and salvage what international prestige the United States has left .
If Nixon and Kissinger had followed similar advice in Vietnam , the United States , its military , and its international standing would not have been tarnished by four additional years of war .
And even worse than Vietnam , continued U.S. occupation of Iraq is fueling and worsening the Islamic terrorist threat to the United States , according to an estimate from Bush ’s own intelligence agencies .
Most amazingly , Woodward ’s book indicates that Gen. John Abizaid , the current chief of the U.S. military command that supervises the Iraq war , told Rep. John Murtha , a decorated former Marine who advocates rapid U.S. withdrawal from Iraq , that he was very close to agreement with the congressman ’s position .
When the commander in charge of the Iraq war believes that U.S. forces should be rapidly withdrawn from that country , that fact should be big news .
But sadly , it is n’t .
Consulting Kissinger on how to successfully “ win ” a counterinsurgency is like getting advice from Mel Gibson on public relations .
Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger came into office in 1969 vowing to get the United States out of Vietnam , while achieving “ peace with honor . ”
Four years and 22,000 American casualties later , Nixon and Kissinger settled for a face - saving peace settlement that they could have obtained shortly after they took office .
The final agreement merely provided a “ decent interval ” between U.S. troop withdrawal and the fall of the South Vietnamese regime to the communists .
Yet Kissinger ’s version of these events is that by 1972 , the United States had virtually won the Vietnam War , but Congress and the American people wimped out and snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory .
Although the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam in the Linebacker II air offensive of 1972 and threats of using nuclear weapons probably led the North Vietnamese to negotiate more seriously , Kissinger ’s argument that the United States had “ won ” the war is a fantasy .
No one on either side of the ensuing negotiations believed that the North Vietnamese were going to honor the Paris Peace Accord after the United States left .
Even if one believes that the United States had won the war militarily , an effective counterinsurgency campaign also requires winning politically .
Because the North Vietnamese were fighting for their own country and the United States was merely fighting in some faraway jungle , the North Vietnamese were prepared to take horrendous casualties to wait out the Americans .
As late as 1972 , Nixon and Kissinger had a majority of popular support for the heavy Linebacker II offensive , and they , not the public , were the ones who were attempting to pressure the North Vietnamese to give them a “ for show ” peace deal that was a mere fig leaf .
If the United States was winning the war , one should ask why Nixon and Kissinger were so eager to salvage any honor that the United States had left .
In 1972 , even Kissinger himself clearly wanted to end the war .
Even if Congress and the American people were to blame for the loss of the Vietnam War , as Kissinger contends , politicians should take into account that democracies will not allow an indefinite waste of lives and money to win a war that has little to do with national security .
And the Bush administration , after the Vietnam experience , should have known that the public tires quickly of such unneeded military adventures .

Christian beliefs vary greatly :
This essay describes how adults ' beliefs differ among various Christian countries , including the Philippines , United States , European countries and Russia .
Included also is the non-Christian country of Israel as a comparison .
Israel is composed primarily of secularists , although their society is governed largely by very conservative Jewish faith groups .
Two international surveys were conducted during 1991 and 1993 by the International Social Survey Program ( ISSP ) .
This is currently located at the National Opinion Research Center ( NORC ) at the University of Chicago .
A comparison beteeen the ISSP survey and common Gallup polls on religion is instructive .
The ISSP seeks information on the level of strong beliefs in God and other religious topics .
When the Gallup Poll conducts a poll on belief in God , they seem almost to design a question to obscure the results .
They ask for belief in " God or a universal spirit . "
Like the ISSP survey , Gallup does not differentiate between belief in monotheistic God as defined in Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Sikh , and other religions , and the creator God in Deism who has since disappeared , polytheistic pantheons of deities , the Goddess and God of Wicca , etc .
Futher , Gallup does not differentiate between any of these deities and some vague notion of a supernatural entity who is perhaps impersonal .
In 1991 , subjects were asked to agree or disagree with each of the following seven statements :

I 'm currently reading Steve McConnell 's new book , Software Estimation : Demystifying the Black Art .
The section on individual expert judgment provided one simple reason why my estimates are often so horribly wrong :
If you ask a developer to estimate a set of features , the developer will often come back with an estimate that looks like this :
Feature Estimated Days Alpha 1.5 Bravo 1.5 Charlie 2.0 Delta 0.5 Echo 0.5 Foxtrot 0.25 Golf 2.0 Hotel 1.0 India 0.75 Juliet 1.25 Total 11.25
If you then ask the same developer to reestimate each feature 's best case and worst case , the developer will often return with estimates similar to these :
Feature Best Case ( days ) Worst Case ( days ) Alpha 1.25 2.0 Bravo 1.5 2.5 Charlie 2.0 3.0 Delta 0.75 2.0 Echo 0.5 1.25 Foxtrot 0.25 0.5 Golf 1.5 2.5 Hotel 1.0 1.5 India 0.5 1.0 Juliet 1.25 2.0 Total 10.5 18.25
When you compare the original single - point estimates to the Best Case and Worst Case estimates , you see that the 11.25 total of the single - point estimates is much closer to the Best Case estimate of 10.5 days than to the Worst Case total of 18.25 days .
You 'll also notice that both the Best Case and Worst Case estimates are higher than the original single - point estimate .
Thinking through the worst case result can sometimes expose additional work that must be done even in the best case , which can raise the nominal estimate .
In thinking through the worst case , I like to ask developers how long the task would take if everything went wrong .
People 's worst case estimates are often optimistic worst cases rather than true worst cases .

The crisis of unspecified specificity

Having said that , however , Frank van der Salm 's images are not " average in the dull sense of the word " – not at all : " they are just the opposite . "
And if you 're feeling confused while looking at these images , that is because " we see , recognize and understand " what they depict , but we " cannot accept " them .
It even seems " as though we are being alienated by the sheer ' logic ' , by the sheer ' neutrality ' of these banal images while our mind incessantly runs around in circles , wrapping itself up in the ( to it ) irrational equation specific + unspecific = artificial . "

Social media sites such as Digg and Reddit .
Not that they have n't already had problems , but those have been largely generated from within , such as the cases where a small clique of Digg users mutually admiring each others ' submitted links created an echo chamber of approval for particular themes .
Last week Kevin Rose , the founder of Digg , posted on the Digg blog that to prevent people gaming the system , " a key update is coming soon .
This algorithm update will look at the unique digging diversity of the individuals digging the story .
Users that follow a gaming pattern will have less promotion weight . "
But now , those who make money by getting people to come to sites - the " search engine optimisers " ( SEOs ) - have started to work their particular brand of magic on " social " sites such as MySpace and , of course Digg , and its siblings .
" Somewhere on Digg , Newsvine and almost every other user generated content site out there is some policy about " not submitting your own stories , websites or blog postings " , comments " Gray Wolf " ( at wolf - howl.com ) .
" Well I see those kind of things kind of like handicaps in sports , they make the rest of kids think they can run with the big dogs , and just do n't apply to me .
So what if I happen to be mildly schizophrenic , and have lots of imaginary friends who are very net savvy ?
Are you going to discriminate against the people who are reality challenged ? "
In other words , a skilled SEO can create plenty of " people " who will Digg a particular link or story that will lead readers to a site that pays the SEO per advert shown or clicked or , even better , per visitor .
" Web 2.0 opens up a whole new game for those creative enough to use to use it , " notes Gray Wolf .
Back to Rose : " In the end Digg is yours to control , " he wrote .
" No matter which stories are promoted , it 's up to the masses to digg or bury them .
If you see content you disagree with - bury it .
If enough people do the same , the system will automatically remove the story . "
Bear in mind that spam now makes up most of the comments posted on blogs and most of the email that 's sent .
Now , do you want to bet with Rose or Gray Wolf ?

We all lie , all the time .
It causes problems , to say the least .
So why do we do it ?
It boils down to the shifting sands of the self and trying to look good both to ourselves and others , experts say .
" It 's tied in with self - esteem , " says University of Massachusetts psychologist Robert Feldman .
" We find that as soon as people feel that their self - esteem is threatened , they immediately begin to lie at higher levels . "
Not all lies are harmful .
In fact , sometimes lying is the best approach for protecting privacy and ourselves and others from malice , some researchers say .
Some deception , such as boasting and lies in the name of tact and politeness , can be classified as less than serious .
But bald - faced lies ( whether they involve leaving out the truth or putting in something false ) , are harmful , as they corrode trust and intimacy — the glue of society .
Kidding yourself
Many animals engage in deception , or deliberately misleading another , but only humans are wired to deceive both themselves and others , researchers say .
People are so engaged in managing how others perceive them that they are often unable to separate truth from fiction in their own minds , Feldman 's research shows .
For instance ,
In one experiment , Feldman put two strangers in a room together .
They were videotaped while they conversed .
Later , independently , each was asked to view the tape and identify anything they had said that was not entirely accurate .
Rather than defining what counts as a lie and to avoid the moral tone of the word " lie , " Feldman 's experimenters simply asked subjects after the fact to identify anything they had said in the video that was " not entirely accurate . "
Initially , " Each subject said , ' Oh , I was entirely accurate , ' " Feldman told LiveScience .
Upon watching themselves on video , subjects were genuinely surprised to discover they had said something inaccurate .
The lies ranged from pretending to like someone they actually disliked to falsely claiming to be the star of a rock band .
The study , published in the Journal of Basic and Applied Psychology , found that 60 percent of people had lied at least once during the 10 - minute conversation , saying an average of 2.92 inaccurate things .
" People almost lie reflexively , " Feldman says .
" They do n't think about it as part of their normal social discourse . "
But it is , the research showed .
" We 're trying not so much to impress other people but to maintain a view of ourselves that is consistent with the way they would like us to be , " Feldman said .
We want to be agreeable , to make the social situation smoother or easier , and to avoid insulting others through disagreement or discord .
Men lie no more than women , but they tend to lie to make themselves look better , while women are more likely to lie to make the other person feel better .
Extroverts tend to lie more than introverts , Feldman found in similar research involving a job - interview situation .
Workplace lies
Other research has delved into prevarication in the workplace .
Self - esteem and threats to our sense of self are also drivers when it comes to lying to co-workers , rather than strangers , says Jennifer Argo of the University of Alberta .
A recent study she co-authored showed that people are even more willing to lie to coworkers than they are to strangers .
" We want to both look good when we are in the company of others ( especially people we care about ) , and we want to protect our self - worth , " Argo told LiveScience .
The experiment involved reading a scenario to a subject , telling them they had paid more than a coworker for the same new car .
When the coworker , in the scenario , mentioned what they had paid , $ 200 or $ 2,000 more in different versions of the experiment , the subject was asked to report how they would respond .
Argo found that her subjects were more willing to lie when the price difference was small and when they were talking to a coworker rather than to a stranger .
Consumers lie to protect their public and private selves , she wrote in the Journal of Consumer Research with her colleagues from the University of Calgary and University of British Columbia .
Argo said she was surprised that people are so willing to lie to someone they know even over a small price discrepancy .
" I guess closely tied to this is that people appear to be short - term focused when they decide to deceive someone — save my self - image and self - worth now , but later on if the deceived individual finds out it can have long - term consequences , " she said .
Feldman says people should become more aware of the extent to which we tend to lie and that honesty yields more genuine relationships and trust .
" The default ought to be to be honest and accurate ...
We 're better off if honesty is the norm .
It 's like the old saying : honesty is the best policy . "

post # 241 — November 16 , 2006 — a Managing post
After a speech I gave , Francis Sheridan , whose title is Resource Efficiency Manager at 3 CES / CEOEE , sent in this comment :
â€ œAbout ten years ago , while still a manager for Washington State , I took a week ’s class from a person considered , at the time , maybe the most talented and accomplished person in Washington State governement , Dick Thomas .
He ’d been Chief of Staff for the Governor , house majority leader , president of Evergreen State College , etc. , and a very cool guy to boot .
When I took that class , he said two things over and over until I , for one , wanted to kill himâ€ ” - figuratively , of course .
Long after the class ended I finally began to understand the wisdom of these two simple thoughts :
Policy is what happens .
Peoples ’ feelings about the process largely determine their feelings about the outcome of the process.â€ 
If only more managers understood those two lessons !
Policy is n’t goals , visions , missions , values , principles , etc .
It ’s what happens around here .
Manage that !
Do n’t just manage the goals , mange the process .

Pinochet Also Thought He Could " Legalize " Torture
Pinochet Also Thought He Could " Legalize " Torture And Immunize Himself
By Mark G. Levey
On September 11 , 1973 , Gen. Augusto Pinochet headed a military coup that overthrew the democratically - elected government of President Salvador Allende .
Chile at that time was one of the world 's oldest constitutional democracies .
In the months that followed , in a round up of " terrorists " , Chilean military and intelligence officers arrested 30,000 Chileans and some foreign nationals .
Virtually all were tortured , and 3,000 " disappeared " , many dumped alive from military aircraft into the Pacific Ocean .
The Junta 's secret police also sought out its critics abroad , a few weeks later blowing up the former Ambassador , Orlando Letelier , in his car as he drove through downtown Washington , DC .
In the years that followed , " President " Pinochet ruled through emergency " anti-terrorism " decrees , before he retired as a Senator for life .
Before he left the presidential palace , however , the General assured himself that he would never be brought to trial for his crimes .
While the country was still effectively controlled by the military Junta he headed , the runner - stamp legislature passed laws granting amnesty to those officials who had committed torture and murder during the " state of exception " to constitutional rule .
The amnesty laws also granted lifetime " legislative immunity " to members of Parliament , including , of course , Senator Pincochet .
Even though Spain , France and several other countries had issued warrants for Pinochet 's role in commanding the murder of their citizens in Chile following the coup , Pinochet travelled the world in luxury and , he thought , security from arrest .
As former " head of state " , most countries would not touch him .
But , that changed in 1998 , when during a visit to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other Right - wing friends in Britain , he was detained on an extradition request from Spain .
After a long court battle , a three - member Court of the House of Lords , the highest appellate tribunal in the UK , found that Pinochet 's claims to immunity as former head of state and to legislative immunity were invalid in the face of charges of violation of international laws against genocide , torture and crimes against humanity .
The Blair Government ended up sending him back to Chile , where the new democratic government and courts stripped his immunity , and placed Pinochet , now 87 years old , under indefinite house arrest .
There should be a lesson here for Bush and the GOP Congress .
While you might believe today that you can legalize torture and other crimes against humanity , some day they will come for you .
Power does not trump the law forever .
You are naked before the world , and it 's only a matter of time .

One of the newest avenues of research into the mind - body relationship has nothing to do with religious ritual , ethnobotany , or tinkering with brain chemistry .
It 's about altering the way the brain behaves on the most basic level -- the electrical impulses that constantly stream from neuron to neuron .
Psychological researchers call it " transcranial magnetic stimulation " or " TMS " .
The basic premise of TMS is that the brain operates using electric signals , and it 's possible to alter the way the brain works by altering the electrical environment .
Standard equipment consists of something to generate an electromagnetic signal at a specific frequency , and a coil to focus that magnetic field on specific brain regions .
Thus far , it appears that frequencies lower than 1
Hz will inhibit brain activity , while higher frequencies stimulate the brain , although no one is sure why .
The " normal " frequency of the waking human brain is said to be around 12 Hz , " beta " state , while brains deep in meditative trance dip down to around 8
Hz , the " alpha " state .
As early as 1985 , researchers at the University of Sheffield found that magnetic fields could activate brain cells .
At around the same time , electronics researcher David S. Walonick began creating several different TMS devices , and tested a wide range of extra - low frequency ( ELF ) signals on subjects .
His experiments showed that it 's possible to " entrain " brains to certain frequencies -- that is , if you project an 8.6
Hz field onto a waking brain , it will tend to slide into the dreamlike , meditative , " alpha " state .
The closer to the " beta " state you start at -- that is , the higher the initial frequency projected across the brain -- the faster a brain will lock on to the frequency being projected .
He found his ELF generators are useful for relaxation , getting over jet lag , and , in one case , eliminating epileptic seizures in a 190 - pound dog .
Volunteers under Walonick 's ELF fields only felt very subtle physical effects - tightness in the stomach or chest , metallic feeling in the mouth , ringing in the ears , and faint tingling sensations .
Since those early forays , investigators began using repeated TMS bursts ( or rTMS ) to alter brain patterns , and focus the magnetic fields on specific brain areas .
They have found that changes made by rTMS can last for months after a treatment .
And , according to Eric Wasserman of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ( NINDS ) in Bethesda , Maryland , the effects can be highly unusual .
" We can use TMS to prevent people from seeing a visual stimulus or make it hard for them to speak " , he says .
They can also make people move their limbs without any voluntary control .
Some of the first studies showed that applying TMS to the brain 's temporal lobes , the regions just above the eyebrows , altered the mood of volunteers .
When they stimulated the area above the right eyebrow , the volunteer experienced euphoric happiness .
When they targeted the left temporal lobe , the subject lapsed into apathy and sadness .
As a result , TMS is gaining ground as a substitute for ECT ( Electro - Convulsive Therapy aka Electro - Shock Therapy ) , or " shock treatment " .
One of the only remedies which has been proven effective in extreme cases of clinical depression , ECT essentially triggers epileptic - like seizures by passing electricity across the brain .
TMS does something similar , but on a much smaller scale , and with near - surgical precision .
ECT patients often experience memory loss or other strange and unpleasant side effects ; TMS patients do n't .
Within the last five years , researchers have found rTMS useful in treating conditions as varied as depression , epilepsy and stuttering .
As a potential therapy , it is valued for being painless and non-invasive , as well as being effective in cases that do n't respond to drugs .
In 2000 , Yale University School of Medicine researchers found rTMS reduced auditory hallucinations in schizophrenics , a group notoriously difficult to treat with conventional medicine .
But some of the most promising applications of TMS have less to do with treating disease than with unlocking the brain 's potential .
Recently , in early 2002 , researchers at the Centre of the Mind in Sydney , Australia successfully used TMS to increase creativity in a group of 17 volunteers .
The team used brief , low - frequency signals to recreate the same " brain weather " observed in autistic savants ( creative geniuses like Dustin Hoffman 's character in ) .
Within 15 minutes , the subjects were drawing better than they ever could before .
Further experiments could prove that anyone has the potential to become a creative genius with just the flick of a switch .
Pioneering TMS researcher Michael Persinger , a neuropsychologist at Canada 's Laurentian University in Sudbury , Ontario , is doing even more astounding work .
By stimulating specific areas in the right hemisphere of the brain , he is able to induce mystical states of consciousness , giving some subjects the experience of encountering God .
In scientific terminology , he uses a specific , precisely timed , repetitive signal - one dubbed the " Thomas Pulse " - to create a " sensed presence " in the test subject 's brain .
Some volunteers have reported feelings of pleasant detachment , while others have broken into a panic , convinced the test chamber is " hexed " .
And some have had direct experience of the divine .
Persinger is convinced that naturally occurring electromagnetic fluctuations could be responsible for paranormal experiences like ghosts , UFOs and mystical apparitions .
Some have argued , on the basis of Persinger 's work , that religion itself could be electromagnetic in origin - and the transcendent experiences like those recounted by saints and mystics can be recreated with electromagnetic pulses in his laboratory .
Dealing yet another blow to AOL , a leading software watchdog group warned users away from AOL ’s free client software yesterday on the ground that it displayed characteristics consistent with “ badware . ”
The term badware describes a wide array of downloadable applications that try to install extra components on a computer without clearly informing users of what they are or what they will do .
The group , StopBadware.org , posted an “ open inquiry ” into the AOL software yesterday , meaning that a dialogue has been opened with the company and that a full “ badware ” designation is still pending .
The report , however , stated that the AOL client software , which provides subscribers with a suite of services , also installed extra software deceptively , altered the Web browser and other computer components without notifying the user , and did not uninstall completely , among other “ badware behaviors . ”

I hope that those of you that have read this are bawling your eyes out and ca n’t get the pictures out of your head … I do everyday on the way home from work .
I hate my job , I hate that it exists & I hate that it will always be there unless you people make some changes and realize that the lives you are affecting go much farther than the pets you dump at a shelter .
Between 9 and 11 MILLION animals die every year in shelters and only you can stop it .
I do my best to save every life I can but rescues are always full , and there are more animals coming in everyday than there are homes .
My point to all of this …DON ’T BREED OR BUY WHILE SHELTER PETS DIE !
Hate me or flag me if you want to …the truth hurts and reality is what it is … I just hope I maybe changed one persons mind about breeding their dog , taking their loving pet to a shelter , or buying a dog .
I hope that someone will walk into my shelter and say “ I saw this thing on craigslist and it made me want adopt ” … that would make it all worth it .

There is an annual puzzle event that 90 or so people attend .
Each designs a puzzle and manufactures 90 copies of it which are then shared with the other participants .
All 90 then get to go home with 90 puzzles .
Anyway , an ex-coworker attends this event and I had a chance to play with his puzzle .
It was one of those fitting blocks together types puzzles .
It was ingeniously designed but it seemed pretty clear to me that it required a lot of combinatorial searching .
So I decided to write a program in Haskell to solve it using the List monad to enable simple logic programming .
But my code had a slight problem .
It worked through the puzzle and found solutions , but ( 1 ) it did n't log the steps it took to achieve those solutions and ( 2 ) I could n't count how many combinations it searched to find the solutions .
Both of these could be thought of as side - effects , so the obvious thing to do is use a monad to track these things .
But there was a catch - I was already using a monad - the List monad .
When that happens there 's only one thing for it - using a monad transformer to combine monads .
There are two distinct ways to combine a monad with the List monad and I needed both .
Anyway , this is literate Haskell .
I 'll assume you 're vaguely familiar with using the List monad for logic programming .
I also assume you 're familiar with MonadPlus though that 's not something I 've written about here .
And I could n't get this stuff to work in Hugs , so use ghc .
Here 's some code : I 'm not going to describe the original puzzle now .
Instead I 'm going to look at an almost trivial logic problem so that we can concentrate on the monad transforming .
The puzzle is this : find all the possible sums of pairs of integers , one chosen from the set { 1,2} and the other from the set { 2,4} , where the sum is less than 5 .
Here 's a simple implementation .
Run go1 and you should get the result [ 3,4 ] .
But that 's just the sums .
What were the pairs of integers that went into those sums ?
We could simply return ( a , b, a+b ) , but in more complex problems we might want to log a complex sequence of choices and that would entail carrying all of that information around .
What we'd like is to simply have some kind of log running as a side effect .
For this we need the Writer monad .
If you cast your mind back , monad transformers layer up monads a bit like layers of onion skin .
What we want is to wrap a List monad in a Writer monad .
We do this using the WriterT monad transformer .
All we have to do is add a tell line to our code , and use ' lift ' to pull the items in the list monad out from one layer of onion .
Here 's what the code looks like :
To get the final result we need to use runWriterT to peel the onion : Execute go2 and we get a list of pairs of sums and logged messages .
There 's an important point to note here : we have one log per sum , so the logs are ' local ' .
What if we want a ' global ' side effect such as a count of how many combinations were tried , regardless of whether they succeded or failed ?
An obvious choice of monad to count attempts is the State monad , but to make its effects ' global ' we now need to make State the inner monad and make List provide the outer layer of skin .
We 're wrapping the opposite way to in the previous example .
And now there 's a catch .
We use a line liketo exploit the List monad .
But now we no longer have a List monad , instead we have amonad .
This means thatis not an object in this monad .
We ca n't use ' lift ' either because the inner monad is n't List .
We need to translate our lists into themonad .
We can do slightly better , we can translate a list from the List monad into any other instance of MonadPlus .
Remember thatis the same asandis the same as .
For example .
The latter only uses functions from the MonadPlus interface to build the list , and hence it can be used to build the equivalent of a List in any MonadPlus .
To mplus a whole list we use msum leading to the definition :
As a function , mlist is just the identity .
Now we 're ready to go : Run go3 to see the result .
Note we had to lift the modify line because the State monad is the inner one .
And now we have one more problem to solve : bouth logging and counting simultaneously :
That 's it !
We can carry out a cute twist on this .
By swapping the innermost and outermost monads we get : go5 returns a local count of how many combinations were required for each problem , and the Writer monad now records every ' try ' in one long log .
One last thing : you do n't need to explicitly ' lift ' things - the monad transformers have a nice interface that automatically lifts some operations .
( You may need a recent Haskell distribution for this , it fails for older versions . )
It'd be cool to get rid of the mlist too .
Maybe if the Haskell parser was hacked so that [ 1,2 ] did n't mean 1:2 : [ ] but instead meant ( return 1 ) `mplus` ( return 2 ) like the way Gofer interprets list comprehensions in any monad .
( For all I know , Gofer already does exactly what I 'm suggesting . )
One thing I should add - these monad transformers really kill performance .
The puzzle solver I wrote no longer gives me any solutions in the few minutes that it used to ... PS I just made up the mlist thing .
There may be a better way of doing this that I do n't know about .
I was surprised it was n't already in the Control .
Monad library somewhere .
mlist is kind of a homomorphism between MonadPlusses and I think it might make the List MonadPlus an initial object in some category or other - but that 's just speculation right now .
Update : I fixed the non-htmlised this .
My mlist corresponds to their liftList - and now I know I was n't completely off the rails writing mlist .

We have come a long way since the days when banks wrote off entire minority communities , denying loans and mortgages to creditworthy people because of their race or where they lived .
But perhaps not far enough .
A recent Federal Reserve study shows that black Americans are three times as likely as whites to be signed up for high - cost " subprime " mortgages that often force borrowers into default .
Lenders typically argue that critics are confusing risk with race and point out that the scores on which they base mortgage rates are computed automatically , based on standardized consumer credit information .
It is hard to judge these arguments because so much credit information is kept private .
Lenders typically refuse to release data on individual credit scores or disclose their own risk analysis .
But it seems likely at this point that uninformed borrowers are being herded into higher - cost mortgages more frequently than necessary .
That is probably due at least in part to the complexity of the current lending system .
Mortgages are now sold mainly through mortgage brokers , who are virtually unregulated .
This system has spread access to mortgages to communities that were once shut out .
But brokers themselves have no legal responsibility to give borrowers the best rate -- or even a fair rate , for that matter .
Sellers of mortgages often earn their money by marking up mortgage rates and adding fees and penalties , some of which can be onerous .
That poses a particular danger for unsophisticated borrowers .
Even well - educated consumers have difficulty finding out how their individual mortgage rates are calculated and what the various fees are .

US troops are more exposed as they try to tackle sectarian strife
A " helluva mess " is how the former US Secretary of State James Baker is said to have described the state of Iraq - and the search is on for the least - worst option for US policy makers .
President Bush held a tele - conference with his generals in Iraq to see what might be done militarily .
On the immediate agenda is the future of Operation Together Forward , the plan to pacify Baghdad .
That is now an admitted disappointment and if it fails , then mission failure looms .
Benchmarks
It seems that Washington will now try to hold the Iraqi government more accountable -- by drawing up benchmarks and incentives .
The benchmarks would include action against militias , putting more troops onto the streets to reinforce the inadequate police force and agreeing on a political settlement .
The big incentive is continued US support .
Mr Baker 's bipartisan Iraq Study Group appears to be shaping up to recommend something between , as Mr Baker put it , " stay the course " and " cut and run " .
It will report probably in December , certainly after the mid-term elections .
Mr Baker has also said : " There is no magic bullet ... it is very , very difficult . "
Concepts
His group 's main concepts seem to be " stability first " and " redeploy and contain " , as they are called .
Iraq is not salvageable as a unitary state
Peter Galbraith
Former US ambassador
The first would concentrate less on democracy and more on stabilisation , especially in Baghdad , and on trying to bring in nationalist ( ie not al - Qaeda jihadist ) insurgents into political life and even consulting Iran and Syria .
New anti-guerrilla tactics might be devised .
This could tie in with thinking in Washington that there is merit in the idea of a government of " national salvation " in Iraq .
The second would be more radical .
It foresees a possible major , phased withdrawal of US forces , perhaps to bases within Iraq or even to bases in the region from which they could support the Iraqi government if necessary .
Mr Baker and the administration have ruled out partition .
Looser federation
Iraqis themselves have meanwhile been involved in a fierce debate about dividing the country up into a looser federation .
On 11 October , there was a vote in the Iraqi parliament approving measures developing the provision in the constitution for more regional groupings like the semi-autonomous rule that the Kurds enjoy in the north .
Iraqi President Talabani : against partition
The plan was forced through by the main Shia party and strongly opposed by Sunni leaders .
The Sunnis know that , without oil in their region , they would end up the poorest .
They fear the growth of a powerful , oil - rich " Shiastan " in the south .
The whole thing is likely to be put off for 18 months , during which anything could happen , but the manner of its parliamentary passage in an atmosphere of chaos and anger does not augur well for the governance of Iraq .
The minute you say we 're going to make three autonomous regions , you 're likely to kick off a huge civil war
James Baker
Degrees of separation
Varying degrees of separation are suggested .
On 1 May this year , in an article in the New York Times , Democratic Senator Jo Biden and commentator Leslie Gelb suggested decentralisation .
" The idea , as in Bosnia , is to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it , giving each ethno- religious group - Kurd , Sunni Arab and Shia Arab - room to run its own affairs , while leaving the central government in charge of common interests .
Peter Galbraith , a former US ambassador to Croatia , wants Iraq to follow the example of Yugoslavia which was divided into independent states , Croatia among them .
Now an advocate for the Kurds , he wants them to have full independence .
Iraq , he says , can not be put back together again .
" Iraq is not salvageable as a unitary state , " he wrote in the New York Review of Books in May 2004 .
Baker hostile
Mr Baker himself is hostile to partition or anything much like it .
He made this clear in an interview on ABC television on 8 October : " There are no boundaries between Sunni areas and Shia areas in Iraq , how do you draw the boundaries ?
And the minute you say we 're going to do that and make three autonomous regions , you 're likely to kick off a huge civil war . "
And many Iraqis oppose breaking up the country .
The country 's president Jalal Talabani is a Kurd , who fought for years against Saddam Hussein .
In a recent BBC interview he was asked if partition was a possible solution .
He answered : " It 's very dangerous for Iraq , especially the Arab part of Iraq .
" Baghdad , Baqouba , the mixed areas , it is not so easy to implement this policy of ethnic cleansing .
Nor Kirkuk or Mosul .
There is no possibility of accepting such a kind of policy . "

( CNN ) -- Most Americans do not believe the Bush administration has gone too far in restricting civil liberties as part of the war on terror , a new CNN poll released Thursday suggests .
While 39 percent of the 1,013 poll respondents said the Bush administration has gone too far , 34 percent said they believe the administration has been about right on the restrictions , according to the Opinion Research Corp. survey .
Another 25 percent said the administration has not gone far enough .
Asked whether Bush has more power than any other U.S. president , 65 percent of poll respondents said no .
Thirty - three percent said yes .
Of those who said yes , a quarter said that was bad for the country .

Seventy - two percent of poll respondents said they believe the size of the federal government has increased in the past four years .
Twenty percent believe it has decreased , and 8 percent had no opinion .
Fifty - eight percent of poll respondents said they would not want their son or daughter to grow up to be president .
Fifty - six percent , however , said they would want their child to grow up to be a member of Congress .
The last three questions were asked of a half sample , or about 507 people .
The telephone poll was conducted October 20 - 22 .
The sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points for questions asked of the full sample and plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for questions asked of the half sample .
This week we aim to make that old adage that Hollywood is full of big babies true .

This post exists partly to talk about philosophical zombies , which are cool in their own way , and partly to explain today ’s comic ( which recently got a thumbs up in Dutch ) .
The idea of a zombie , in a philosophical context , is the idea of a being that acts intelligently , and is physically the same as us , but has no consciousness .
For example your best friend could be a philosophical zombie and you would never know it , because he , or she would act just as if they were conscious .
Even an examination of their brain would not reveal any differences ; all the physical aspects are the same as with a normal person .
No one really thinks that there are philosophical zombies in the real world , but because the idea seems logically consistent some philosophers have concluded that the mind and body must be separate at some level .
They argue that if the mind and the body were really unified then such an idea would be as inconceivable as the notion of a physical object that does n’t have a spatial extent , and thus we should abandon our materialism or monism for some kind of dualism ( property dualism is a popular choice for example ) .
If we truly wish to defend a materialist or monist position with respect to the mind - body problem we must show that philosophical zombies are in fact nonsense .
There exist basically two ways to do this , the behavior response and the systems response .
The behavior response is to argue that anything that displays intelligent behavior is necessarily conscious .
If we could defend this position then it would indeed show that the idea of a philosophical zombie in nonsense .
Unfortunately it is hard to show that behavior , in principle , guarantees the existence of consciousness , for example see my earlier post concerning the Turing test .
This might be a valid defense against the existence of real philosophical zombies , because we could argue that the only practically feasible way to generate intelligent behavior is as a result of consciousness , but in principle at least we could still be forced to admit the validity of dualism .
The systems response on the other hand is much more secure , and philosophers such as Dennett have in fact used it to refute the possibility of philosophical zombies .
Once again we can divide the system responses into two types .
One kind of a systems response is to argue that consciousness is a product of the activity of the brain .
If this is true than philosophical zombies do n’t make sense because they have the same physical brains as us , which should logically should generate the same kind of consciousness as us .
Unfortunately it is hard to make this kind of response without arguing for some version of epiphenomenalism , the belief that the mind , although produced by the brain does not affect its operation , because if the mind is truly a byproduct of the brain it is hard to see how it could in turn affect our actions ( assuming that the physical universe is casually closed ) .
Thus we may reject this kind of response , and epiphenomenalism , because our ordinary experience indicates that we do indeed control our actions .
A second kind of systems response then is to argue that the operation of the brain is itself consciousness .
Many theories such as functionalism , aspect monism , identity theory , and descriptionism , would make this kind of argument against philosophical zombies .
Once again if you accept this argument concerning consciousness then the concept of a philosophical zombie becomes nonsense , because we have stipulated that they are physically identical to conscious people , and thus their brains would indeed be operating in the same way , a way that guarantees , or is the same thing as , consciousness .
These resolutions to the problem of philosophical zombies may not seem entirely satisfactory , because the concept of a philosophical zombie was designed to discriminate between theories concerning consciousness , but the responses presented here use theories concerning consciousness to determine if the concept of a philosophical zombie is coherent or not .
Such is philosophy .
If you want to read more on Dennett ’s views concerning consciousness I would recommend his book Consciousness Explained ( amazon ) .
These bacteria use radiated water as food
Deep exploration of Earth 's biosphere raises excitement about the potential for life on Mars
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday , Oct. 19 , 2006
BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
Researchers from Indiana University Bloomington and eight collaborating institutions report in this week 's Science a self - sustaining community of bacteria that live in rocks 2.8 kilometers below Earth 's surface .
Think that 's weird ?
The bacteria rely on radioactive uranium to convert water molecules to useable energy .
The discovery is a confirmed expansion of Earth 's biosphere , the three - dimensional shell that encompasses all planetary life .
The research has less Earthly implications , however .
It will likely fuel optimism that life exists in other deep subsurface environments , such as in groundwater beneath the permafrost on Mars .

" We know surprisingly little about the origin , evolution and limits for life on Earth , " said IUB biogeochemist Lisa Pratt , who led IU Bloomington 's contribution to the project .
" Scientists are just beginning to study the diverse organisms living in the deepest parts of the ocean .
The rocky crust on Earth is virtually unexplored at depths more than half a kilometer below the surface .
The organisms we describe in this paper live in a completely different world than the one we know at the surface . "
Bacteria living in groundwater or in other subsurface environments is not news .
Until now , however , it was not known whether subterranean microorganisms were recent arrivals bound for extinction or whether they were permanent fixtures of an unlikely habitat .
Also , many scientists have been skeptical of subsurface bacterial communities being completely disconnected from surface ecologies fed by the sun 's light .
" What really gets my juices flowing is the possibility of life below the surface of Mars , " said Tullis Onstott , a Princeton University geoscientist and leader of the research team .
" These bacteria have been cut off from the surface of the Earth for many millions of years , but have thrived in conditions most organisms would consider to be inhospitable to life .
Could these bacterial communities sustain themselves no matter what happened on the surface ?
If so , it raises the possibility that organisms could survive even on planets whose surfaces have long since become lifeless . "
Pratt , Onstott and former graduate student Li-Hung Lin ( the paper 's lead author , now at National Taiwan University ) and colleagues present evidence the bacterial communities are indeed permanent -- apparently millions of years old -- and depend not on sunlight but on radiation from uranium ores for their existence .
Coauthors of the present paper learned of a new water - filled fracture inside a South African gold mine near the Johannesburg metropolitan area and viewed it as an opportunity to study subsurface rock uncontaminated by human activities .
Lin and others in the research team traveled to the mine and descended the hot , gas - choked shafts to study water slowly seeping from the crack .
The scientists sampled the flowing fracture water many times over 54 days to determine whether the community of microbes , if present , changed in composition and character , and to determine whether contamination had occurred .
The researchers also examined the age of the fracture water and its chemical composition .
This fracture water contained hydrocarbons and hydrogen not likely to have been created through biological processes , but rather from decomposition of water exposed to radiation from uranium - bearing rocks .
High density DNA microarray analysis revealed a vast number of bacterial species present , but the samples were dominated by a single new species related to hydrothermal vent bacteria from the division Firmicutes .
The ancient age of the fracture water and comparative DNA analysis of the bacterial genes suggests subsurface Firmicutes were removed from contact with their surface cousins anywhere from 3 million to 25 million years ago .
The bacteria 's rocky living space is a metamorphosed basalt that is about 2.7 billion years old .
How surface - related Firmicutes and other species managed to colonize an area so deep within Earth 's crust is a mystery .
Some surface Firmicutes species are known to consume sulfate and hydrogen as a way to get energy for growth .
Other bacteria can then use the by - products of the Firmicutes as a source of food .
The scientists found that the fracture Firmicutes are also able to consume sulfate .
Firmicutes do not use radiation directly as a source of energy , however .
Radiation emanating from uranium minerals in or near the fracture allows for the formation of hydrogen gas from decomposition of water and formation of sulfate from decomposition of sulfur minerals .
Hydrogen gas is highly energetic if it reacts with oxygen or other oxidants like sulfate , as the Hindenburg disaster demonstrated .
Firmicutes are able to harvest energy from the reaction of hydrogen and sulfate , allowing other microbes in the fracture community to use the chemical waste from the Firmicutes as food .
In a way , Firmicutes serve the same function as photosynthetic organisms , such as plankton and trees at Earth 's surface , that capture sunlight energy ultimately to the benefit of everything and everyone else .
In the deep subsurface case , Firmicutes species are the producers , capturing the energy of radiation - borne hydrogen gas to support microbial communities .
Pratt is the project director of the continuation of this research , which examines deep " extremophile " subsurface environments in South African and the Canadian Arctic mines .
Pratt is also the director of the Indiana - Princeton - Tennessee Astrobiology Institute ( IPTAI ) , a NASA - funded research center focused on designing instruments and probes for life detection in rocks and deep groundwater on Earth during planning for subsurface exploration of Mars .
IPTAI 's recommendations to NASA will draw on findings discussed in the Science report .

Michel Gondry ’s happy accidents Matt 18 comments Latest by Mike Harris
Five videos by director Michel Gondry :
Kylie Minogue : Come Into My World
“ Minogue strolling around a city block within the Boulogne suburb of Paris , France .
Each time she completes a circuit of the area , a new Minogue emerges from one of the stores ( which is in fact the ‘ old ’ minogue , that did the circuit the first time around ) , and each of the people in the background are also duplicated .
By the time the video concludes there are four Minogues and each background extra is also depicted four times . ”
Daft Punk : Around the World
“ This is meant to be a visual representation of the song ; each element in the video represents a different instrument : the robots represent the talk box ‘ robot voice ’ , the athletes move in time to the ascending - descending bass guitar , the disco girls represent the high - pitched keyboard , the skeletons move to the guitars , and the mummies represent the drum machine . ”
White Stripes : Fell In Love With A Girl
“ The video is shot frame by frame with each frame having the Lego bricks rebuilt , sometimes in a complex manner to seem as if it was an actual shot , and then formed together to give the illusion of motion .
The video is considered to be one of the most complex videos using Lego bricks ever made . ”
Matt Vongsykeo , 14 , heard the crash from his house and went to help , seeing a Holden Jackaroo propped against a small brick wall .
' I could hear a baby crying '
" As I got closer , there were two guys standing outside and they said there was a baby inside , and I could hear a baby crying .'' he told Southern Cross Radio .
" They were too big to get in , so one of them actually lifted up the boot so that I could go inside and get the baby out of its baby chair .
" I struggled holding the baby 's head up with one hand , because its head was just hanging , and I unclipped the baby belt with the other hand and got it out as quick as I could . ''
He then found the baby 's mother in the driver 's seat .
' I just freaked out '
" I was n't sure if she was dead or unconscious at the time and I just freaked out , but then I went around to the other side of the car and started talking to her , and she started to make noise , so I knew she was all right , '' he said .
" I kept telling her that her kid was all right and kept asking her to talk to me so I knew that she would stay with me , and then the ambulance people came , and it was unfortunate that she 's gone . ''
Matt dismissed suggestions he was a hero .
" I 've lived 14 years , if something had happened to me ... I 've lived 14 years .
That baby has n't and I wanted to give that baby a chance , '' he said .
Sergeant Carnie said the speeding Holden Commodore first sideswiped a Toyota Camry , shearing a wheel from the Toyota , then hit the woman 's Jackaroo before crashing into a Honda Civic .
' A massive collision '
" It was a massive collision from our point of view .
The damage to the vehicles was tremendous , '' Sgt Carnie told Southern Cross Radio .
The Commodore driver , a man aged about 40 , was thrown clear following the second collision and is in a critical condition at The Alfred hospital , he said .
" The reasons why he was on the wrong side of the road are a bit of a mystery to us at this stage , '' he said .
" Hopefully at some time in the future we can get a chance to talk to him and find out . ''
A woman in her early 20s suffered serious back and chest injuries and was also taken to The Alfred hospital .
Another woman was sent to the Monash Medical Centre with minor injuries .
The baby was taken to the Royal Children 's Hospital for observation .
Police have appealed for witnesses .

Six weeks before midterm elections in which the war is a crucial issue , the protest from the army head , General Peter Schoomaker , exposes concerns within the US military about the strain of the war on Iraq , and growing tensions between uniformed personnel and the Pentagon chief , Donald Rumsfeld .
Three retired senior military officers yesterday accused Mr Rumsfeld of bungling the war on Iraq , and said the Pentagon was " incompetent strategically , operationally and tactically " .
Major General Paul Eaton , a retired officer who was in charge of training Iraq troops , said : " Mr Rumsfeld and his immediate team must be replaced or we will see two more years of extraordinarily bad decision - making . "
The rare criticism from the three officers , all veterans of the Iraq war , is an embarrassment to Mr Bush at a time when his party had hoped to campaign on its strong leadership in the " war on terror " .
The officers echoed the findings of the National Intelligence Estimate at the weekend , which said the Iraq war had fuelled Islamist extremism around the world .
They also accused the Pentagon of putting soldiers ' lives at risk by failing to provide the best equipment available .
" Why are we asking our soldiers and marines to use the same armour we found was insufficient in 2003 ? " asked Thomas Hammes , a retired Marine Corps colonel .
The criticism comes amid an unprecedented show of defiance from the army chief , Gen Schoomaker .
The general refused to submit a budget plan for 2008 to Mr Rumsfeld , arguing the military could not continue operations in Iraq and its other missions without additional funds , the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday .
The seriousness of the protest was underlined by Gen Schoomaker 's reputation as an ally of the Pentagon chief .
The general came out of retirement at Mr Rumsfeld 's request to take up the post .
" It 's quite a debacle , " said Loren Thompson , a military analyst at the Lexington Institute thinktank .
" Virtually everyone in the army feels as though their needs have been shortchanged . "
Gen Schoomaker 's defiance gives a voice to growing concern within the military about the costs of America 's wars , and the long - term strain of carrying out operations around the world .
For the past three years , the $ 400 bn ( £ 210 bn ) cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been funded by emergency spending bills passed by Congress .
But Gen Schoomaker and others say the Iraq war has also put a severe strain on regular budgets .
That puts the generals at odds with Mr Rumsfeld 's strategic vision of a more nimble , hi-tech military .
In addition , Congress and the White House have cut a number of army spending requests over the past months .
" There is no sense in us submitting a budget that we can't execute , a broken budget , " he told a Washington audience .
As the war in Iraq continues with no sign of a reduction in US forces , military officials have repeatedly complained about the strain on personnel , and say they fear they may be forced to rely more heavily on the National Guard and reservists to meet the demands of overseas deployments .
General John Abizaid , America 's senior commander in the Middle East , said last week there was little chance of any drawing down of the 140,000 forces in Iraq before next spring .
The burden of that commitment was underlined yesterday when the army extended the combat tours of about 4,000 soldiers serving in the Ramadi area .
In Basra yesterday , British troops killed a prominent al - Qaida figure who was hiding in Iraq after escaping from US custody in Afghanistan last year , the ministry of defence said .
Omar Faruq was shot dead while resisting arrest during a pre-dawn raid by 250 soldiers after a long - planned intelligence - led operation .
A British military spokesman described Faruq as a " very , very significant man " .

Next Meeting :
Fearing that worse is still to come , Adelman believes that neoconservatism itself — what he defines as “ the idea of a tough foreign policy on behalf of morality , the idea of using our power for moral good in the world ” — is dead , at least for a generation .
After Iraq , he says , “ it ’s not going to sell . ”
And if he , too , had his time over , Adelman says , “ I would write an article that would be skeptical over whether there would be a performance that would be good enough to implement our policy .
The policy can be absolutely right , and noble , beneficial , but if you ca n’t execute it , it ’s useless , just useless .
I guess that ’s what I would have said : that Bush ’s arguments are absolutely right , but you know what , you just have to put them in the drawer marked ca n’t do .
And that ’s very different from let ’s go . ”
I spend the better part of two weeks in conversations with some of the most respected voices among the neoconservative elite .
What I discover is that none of them is optimistic .
All of them have regrets , not only about what has happened but also , in many cases , about the roles they played .
Their dismay extends beyond the tactical issues of whether America did right or wrong , to the underlying question of whether exporting democracy is something America knows how to do .
I will present my findings in full in the January issue of Vanity Fair , which will reach newsstands in New York and L.A. on December 6 and nationally by December 12 .
In the meantime , here is a brief survey of some of what I heard from the war ’s remorseful proponents .
Richard Perle : “ In the administration that I served [ Perle was an assistant secretary of defense under Ronald Reagan ] , there was a one - sentence description of the decision - making process when consensus could not be reached among disputatious departments : ‘ The president makes the decision . ’ [ Bush ] did not make decisions , in part because the machinery of government that he nominally ran was actually running him .
The National Security Council was not serving [ Bush ] properly .
He regarded [ then National - Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice ] as part of the family . ”
Donald Rumsfeld .

Michael Ledeen , American Enterprise Institute freedom scholar : “ Ask yourself who the most powerful people in the White House are .
They are women who are in love with the president : Laura [ Bush ] , Condi , Harriet Miers , and Karen Hughes . ”
Frank Gaffney , an assistant secretary of defense under Ronald Reagan and founder of the Center for Security Policy : “ [ Bush ] does n’t in fact seem to be a man of principle who ’s steadfastly pursuing what he thinks is the right course .
He talks about it , but the policy does n’t track with the rhetoric , and that ’s what creates the incoherence that causes us problems around the world and at home .
It also creates the sense that you can take him on with impunity . ”
The Aftermath
On Halloween , everything seems a little weird .
You see a spider web and it ’s not clear whether it ’s real or a prop .
You see a nun on the train and think it might just be a costume .
You see girls loitering on the street only to find they ’re just waiting for the Rocky Horror Picture Show .
So perhaps that ’s why , when I logged into my bank account this morning and saw more digits in my balance than I ’ve ever seen before , I did n’t feel anything in particular .
“ Yeah , it ’s there , ” I said , to no one in particular .
We called everyone to make sure everything went through okay .
Did I get it ?
Did you get it ?
Did we get that ?
Everything checked out .
“ Looks like we ’re all done here , ” went the email from the lawyers .
After months of negotiations for this day , it had finally come .
I almost felt sad seeing the lawyers say goodbye .
Almost .
I sat reloading TechCrunch , then wrote a script to do it for me .
Finally the notice appeared , elaborating as time went on .
Then I posted it to my blog and others to theirs .
It started seeming real .
Finally , I dashed downstairs to an ATM machine and asked it to print a slip with my balance .
“ Would you like anything else ? ” it asked .
“ No , ” I said , and grabbed the slip .
The numbers were big ; the money was there .
I started grinning and dashed back to the apartment .
But that excitement soon faded .
Post after post , congratulation after congratulation , insult after insult .
Friends emailed and called to share goodwishes .
Reporters called to talk to Alexis and Steve .
( “ No , that ’s A - L - E - X - I - S. Yes .
Yes .
Well , uh , it ’s a news site . ” )
Users emailed to send congratulations .
“ How do you feel ? ” everyone asked .
I did n’t know .
How was I supposed to feel ?
TechCrunch called to do a podcast , asked us to tell the listeners the story of how we got to this day .
And it was n’t that anything said was particularly wrong , strictly speaking , but I walked away thinking we ’d given the wrong impression .
Companies getting bought makes you think of lawyers in suits at conference tables signing papers .
And while there were lawyers and suits and conference tables and papers to sign ( oh , plenty of papers to sign ) , it was n’t really like that .
It was more just a couple guys in a apartment typing on computers and talking on the phone .
I remember how when reddit started , the whole thing seemed so childish .
The cartoony alien , the barebones design , the fresh - faced programmers , the rented house .
And none of that has really changed .
It ’s just that with success behind it , it ’s harder to dismiss .
A scribbled drawing a kid hands to you is “ cute ” , the same thing on the wall of a museum is “ art ” .
You assume there must be something there , even if you ca n’t see it .
It ’s hard to notice this when you ’re in the middle of it .
During the days , I mostly saw my co-workers , who lived and breathed the site .
At night , I hung out with my friends , who all knew what I did .
On weekends , we ’d go to parties for local startups , who all wanted to emulate reddit ’s success .
Everyone we talked to treated us like it was serious .
But whenever I stepped outside the bubble , things were very different .
At non -tech parties , I ’d have trouble explaining what it was I did .
( “ So you , uh , have a web site ? ” )
Once I went far outside the city to have lunch with an author I respected .
He asked about what I did , wanted me to explain it in great detail .
He asked how many visitors we had .
I told him and he sputtered .
“ I ’ve spent fifteen years building an audience , and you ’re telling me in a year you have a million visitors ? ” I assented .
Puzzled , he insisted I show him the site on his own computer , but he found it was just a simple as I described .
( Simpler , even . )
“ So it ’s just a list of links ? ” he said .
“ And you do n’t even write them yourselves ? ” I nodded .
“ But there ’s nothing to it ! ” he insisted .
“ Why is it so popular ? ”
Inside the bubble , nobody asks this inconvenient question .
We just mumble things like “ democratic news ” or “ social bookmarking ” and everybody just assumes it all makes sense .
But looking at this guy , I realized I had no actual justification .
It was just a list of links .
And we did n’t even write them ourselves .
But that ’s not something you can say on TechCrunch .
You can say a site is cool , stupid , popular , a flop , innovative , or clichéd .
But the one thing you ca n’t say , the one thing that everybody skips over , is that these sites are n’t anything serious .
And so when Michael Arrington told us that these stories of acquisition were his favorite part of the “ entrepreneurial spirit ” , I could n’t help but think that somebody was missing the point .

Brian Vaszily was born and raised in Chicago , growing up on the northwest side in the blue - collar Portage - Cragin neighborhood .
Brian and his wife and two children currently reside outside Chicago , Illinois .
It is one of the few things I did in my youth that haunts me still .
To be precise I should say it is one of the few things I did n't do .
I did n't stand up for Bobbie T. Every school classroom has a Bobbie T or two .
They come from both sides of the gender line .
On the female side , she may be an overweight girl who wears hand - me - down clothes and appears to take little interest in make - up or styling her hair or pop stars .
On the male side , he may be the too - thin boy with effeminate characteristics who shows no skill or interest in sports or muscle cars or blowing things up .
And they are attacked for it .
They are whispered about , taunted to their face , the butt of endless jokes , sometimes physically abused , and things are said and repeated until most everyone - often including the Bobbie T - believes them to be true .
Though the harassment and its effects certainly spill over to the opposite gender , the Bobbie Ts are primarily attacked from those within their gender .
So it was with our Bobbie T .
There was that small handful of boys within our class who routinely launched the attacks , calling him a wimp , a dork , a fag , tripping him as he entered the classroom , yanking his pants down in front of the giggling girls on the playground .
Etcetera .
And then there was that larger handful of boys who , though they did n't land the verbal and physical blows , hit Bobbie T even harder -- because they laughed when he was taunted and because they shunned him .
Because they did nothing .
I belonged to that larger handful .
Though I secretly felt sorry for Bobbie , though sometimes I felt rage for him when the bullies went to particularly cruel extremes , I never did or said anything to stand up for him for one reason alone : I did not want to get taken down along with him .
I did not want to risk being ridiculed and laughed at by the bullies and therefore laughed at and shunned by everyone else for defending a " wimp . "
No one wanted to take that risk ( save some of the teachers , which only made matters worse . )
So no one did anything .
We 're Still Afraid of the Bullies … and We 're Paying for It Most adults have not grown up .
They just suffer from the delusion that they have grown up .
In reality , they 've only developed more sophisticated ways to repeat the behaviors of their youth .
Jeer Pressure : Fear of standing up to the bullies and getting picked on and laughed at , too .
As I have suggested throughout my previous columns -- and as I am telling you outright here -- those in the business of marketing in all its names and variations take full advantage of this delusion by targeting the unaware with tactics that prey directly upon it .
The reason I am still haunted by not standing up for Bobbie T - versus merely feeling a bit guilty - is because I repeated this behavior well into adulthood .
In fact , I stood silently by and watched certain peers transform this same type of bullying without fear of repercussion into a sinister but highly effective marketing tactic , building their careers , their clients ' careers , and their pocketbooks on it .
The tactic even has a name - " jeer pressure " - whose basic definition is " conformity to a harsh , demeaning , or otherwise divisive viewpoint out of fear that you , too , will become the subject of the ridicule . "
This tactic is used to moderate extent in the marketing of products and services , though I predict that if patterns discussed below do n't change soon its use will escalate there .
BUT it is now being used to an excessive and deadly extent by those in U.S. politics and media who are marketing their chosen party , their set of ideas about what is right and wrong , and their representatives .
I am of course referring to certain Republican and Democrat politicians and especially to certain well - known " commentators " who champion rightist or leftist agendas and who dominate talk TV and radio … " commentators " of course being just another word for rabid marketers .
As many and perhaps most American adults now readily agree , the political divide between the right and left has widened to a disgusting and deadly degree -- particularly disgusting and deadly for the horrid lessons it is teaching our youth about how to deal with those who hold viewpoints different than their own ( i.e. , call them names , defame their character , attack the individual not the ideas ! )
And make no mistake : it IS primarily the sinister , extremely effective marketing tactics these politicians and commentators and editorialists are using to increase their own position and power that is contributing to the great big ugly divide .
Case in point ?
Well , before I go there , let me stress that endless examples exist from BOTH the left and right , such as Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly , and Don Imus .
But by way of example I will focus on Ann Coulter , who is by far the Queen of Vitriol and Jeer Pressure .
In her new book , Godless : The Church of Liberalism , she writes about " Miss Landolphi , " a sex educator who appears to have gone way overboard in her presentation to a high school … so overboard that if presented in a diplomatic and rational manner Coulter could have used it to solidly support her overall case .
INSTEAD though here is part of what Coulter writes :
Like most people who enjoy talking to strangers about sex , Miss Landolphi , to put it as charitably as possible , is physically repulsive in appearance .
Huh ?
More personal attacks on Miss Landolphi follow , and the book is loaded with similar personal insults , including the infamous attacks on 9/11 widows .
( What 's funny is that most of these attacks , if you ponder them just a bit , are also often bizarre and plain stupid … at that moment in her writing above , for example Ann Coulter is talking to strangers - her readers - about sex … think about it . )
The irony is that Ann Coulter claims to support Christian values ( love thy neighbor , turn the other cheek , Christ 's compassion , etc. ) but she is an ace practitioner of vitriol .
She claims to support traditional family values but practices harsh language and name - calling as the way to handle those whose opinions differ from your own ( and children are of course led by example . )
Of course , Coulter and her advisors - marketers such as producers and editors -- are 110 % aware that the reason she is one of the most popular " commentators " and a # 1 bestselling author is because of these attacks , because of the vitriol .
Hate is a powerful lure .
Her advisors undoubtedly help her " spice up " her act where she may forget to personally insult someone she disagrees with .
Like all the other politicians and " commentators " from the right and left using these same despicable marketing tactics , if you administered truth serum into Coulter 's veins she 'd admit aloud that she actually does n't give a damn about improving America and families and children , etc. … how could she if what she does is so contrary to what she preaches ?
A Couple More Examples from Left and Right … " My goal is to goad people into saying something that ruins their life . "
-- Don Imus " Anorexics never have boyfriends .
...
That 's one way to know you do n't have anorexia , if you have a boyfriend . "
--- Ann Coulter
What she definitely does give a damn about is improving her power and fortune .
And that is certainly working .
Breaking Through the Jeer Pressure Ann Coulter and her ilk from both sides of the political divide are going to keep doing the deadly thing they do as long as you keep giving them money and attention for doing it .
So… IMPORTANT Reminder to Those Who Consider Themselves Conservatives :
You ARE allowed to continue to voice and explain and debate your support for conservative ideals while publicly denouncing the ugly , divisive ( un - family values , un - Christian ) tactics of Ann Coulter and all the rest .
They are two quite different things , and must be separated … like removing a parasite from its host .
IMPORTANT Reminder to Those Who Consider Themselves Liberals :
You ARE allowed to continue to voice and explain and debate your support for liberal ideals while publicly denouncing the ugly , divisive ( uncompassionate , intolerable ) tactics of all the Ann Coulter - with - a - liberal - twist wannabes ( NONE of them even good enough at copycatting the sinister tactics to mention by name here . )
The one person with courage is a majority .

You into Submission to Get Your Money With so many people proclaiming how sad and dangerous the growing political divide is - but then so many people 's behavior supporting those ( being " entertained by " those ) doing the dividing - there is an obvious disconnect here .
That disconnect is due to the jeer pressure tactic --- most people are still afraid of standing up and saying something aloud , same as back in elementary school , because of what everyone else might say about you if you do .
Maybe for criticizing Don Imus ' tactics , Mr. Liberal , you 're afraid all your liberal friends will say YOU FASCIST , YOU MUST LOVE GEORGE BUSH !
Maybe for criticizing Bill O'Reilly 's approach , Mrs. Conservative , your conservative friends will holler YOU COMMUNIST , YOU MUST ADORE HILLARY CLINTON !
But so what .
That would make them the ignorant ones still repeating the insecure behaviors of their youth .
That would make you the strong one for standing up for what you believe in - and living it .
Time to grow up , adults .
On a personal basis for each individual , and as a nation and even world , we will all greatly benefit from some courage and fortitude from the public .
I can't change a past of not standing up to the bullies , and neither can you , but we can do the Bobbie Ts and ourselves the honor of not repeating the same mistake now , when we really do know better .

Maintaining backwards compatibility is a pain the ass .
In a perfect world ( at least from a developer 's point of view ) , every version of the software is completely free from the shackles of the previous versions .
It can be deployed without any regard to the established data , APIs and protocols .
Unfortunately , in the real world users expect the new version to be able to read old data .
They expect their plugins and extensions to continue working without having to adapt them to a new API .
They even expect old client software to work with the new version of the server , and they 'll upgrade the client software only when they damn feel like it .
All these " unreasonable " user expectations force us developers to build backwards compatibility into the product , and it's best to do that early , before there are multiple product versions out there .
In this article , I 'll show a few tips and techniques for building backwards compatibility support into the software 's data files and communication protocols .
The First Step
First and foremost , every piece of data that your application uses should include a version number .
This little piece of metadata will allow the application to give differential treatment to different data format versions .
For example if you have an XML configuration file , add a " version " attribute to its root element .
If you have a proprietary client - server protocol , add the version number as part of the first message that is sent from the client in order to connect to the server .
Now that you have a version number in place , be sure to update it each time that the data format changes , no matter how small the change is .
The numbering system is up to you - you can use an integer that is incremented each time the format changes .
Or the numbering can be in sync with the product 's version number , if you find that more convenient .
Processing Versioned Data
Not surprisingly , the code that is responsible for processing the data needs to change whenever the data format changes .
The natural tendency is to add " if " statements to handle the differences between versions , like this :
if ( version >= 7 ) { // current code } else if ( version >= 3 ) { // backwards - compatibility code } else { // ancient legacy code that nobody uses anymore }
Pretty soon , the code is peppered with ifs and elses and becomes incredibly brittle and unmaintainable .
It becomes impossible to refactor or optimize it , for fear of changing its delicate logical structures and breaking its backwards - compatibility .
In short , a nightmare .
A much better approach is to " branch " the code - make a copy and modify only the copy , without touching the original .
For example , we can have a DataProcessor interface ( call it whatever you like ) with multiple realizations , one per data format version .
So we might have a class called DataProcessor_ver_1 and another called DataProcessor_ver_2 , and so on .
We 've all been taught that code duplication is a Bad Thing that Should Be Avoided .
In this case however , code duplication is your friend .
It allows you to evolve the data format without having the slightest fear that changing the data - processing code will break backwards compatibility .
You can refactor the code , remove obsolete sections , optimize it etc. with complete confidence .
You can even make radical changes such as replacing the XML parser that you use , as long as the old code can still use the original XML parser .
And when you want to check what changed between version 7 and 8 , simply open the two classes in your favorite diff utility .
Now you may be tempted to use inheritence , like this :
public class DataProcessor_ver_2 extends DataProcessor_ver_1 { }
Please resist the temptation and make a full copy .
Using inheritence is arguably even worse than the " if- else " method , since the logic that differentiates between versions becomes implicit instead of explicit .
The code 's internal flow is more difficult to follow .
Heck , it 's not even all in the same file !
Using a Factory
To complete the picture , the application should perform the following steps :
Read the version number of the data Create the appropriate DataProcessor for this version Use the DataProcessor to process the data
Step # 2 is best accomplished using a factory .
The naive approach would look something like this :
public class DataProcessorFactory { public static DataProcessor createInstance ( String version ) { try { switch ( Integer.parseInt( version ) ) { case 1 : return new DataProcessor_ver_1 ( ) ; case 2 : return new DataProcessor_ver_2 ( ) ; case 3 : return new DataProcessor_ver_3 ( ) ; default : throw new RuntimeException ( " Unsupported data processor version " + version ) ; } } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new RuntimeException ( " Cannot create a data processor for version " + version , e ) ; } } }
The problem with this approach is that the factory class needs to be updated whenever a new version is added .
To get rid of this headache , we can use reflection :
public class DataProcessorFactory { public static DataProcessor createInstance ( String version ) { try { String className = DataProcessor.class.getName ( ) + " _ver_ " + version.replace ('.' , '_' ) ; Class c = Class.forName( className ) ; return ( DataProcessor ) c.newInstance ( ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new RuntimeException ( " Cannot create a data processor for version " + version , e ) ; } } }
Note that the code assumes that the DataProcessor realizations reside in the same package as the DataProcessor interface .
An Even Better Factory
If your application uses several different data formats , you might find it annoying to keep multiple factories that basically all do the same thing .
Instead , you can create a single generic factory that handles all of your data formats :
public class GenericVersioned Factory { public static Object createInstance ( Class targetClass , String version ) { try { String className = targetClass.getName ( ) + " _ver_ " + version.replace ('.' , '_' ) ; Class c = Class.forName(className ) ; if ( !targetClass.isAssignableFrom( c ) ) { throw new RuntimeException ( className + " is not a " + targetClass.getName( ) ) ; } return c.newInstance ( ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new RuntimeException ( " Cannot create a data processor for version " + version , e ) ; } } }
The factory expects an additional argument which is the expected interface of the created instance .
It uses this argument to infer the target class name , as well as to check that the created instance is of the correct type .
To use the generic factory , you would do something like :
DataLoader dl = ( DataLoader ) GenericVersionedFactory.createInstance ( DataLoader.class , version )
I ’m amused by Paris Hilton .
If Madonna was Marketing 1.0 then Paris Hilton is Marketing 2.0 .
She ’s a real life version of what value is and how it is created today .
Every web developer should pay attention to her .
Here is a copy of what Paris said after her recent arrest for DUI .
“ I had one margarita ( and ) was starving because I had not eaten all day , ” she said .
“ Maybe I was speeding a little bit and I got pulled over .
I was just really hungry and I wanted to have an In - N - Out Burger . ” ( source )
Did you notice that ?
If not read it again and think .
See it now ?
( the unpaid product placement )
That ’s the real reason Paris Hilton is really famous .
Because she is the queen of links .
When Paris first came on the scene with her own user generated sex video she used that attention to create a career .
Here ’s how she did it .
Though she hired a publisist to get her on Page 6
She never really talked about herself .
She talked about other people .
She would mention the designers of her clothes , the club she was going to , who made the sweater for her dog , all without any guarantee of any return .
She just threw out links .
It did n’t take long for designers and club owners to realize that Paris Hilton was a walking billboard .
So they embraced her .
She paid attention to them , so they paid attention to her .
The most valuable commodity today is attention .
And there are many ways to get it .
From sex videos to stupid pet tricks to talking bad about Muslims .
The real trick is what you do with it once you have it .
What makes Paris brilliant is that she used the attention she had and gave it to others thereby garning more attention for herself .
And it ’s been profitable .
Here ’s what ’s amusing to me though .
Whenever she tries to promote herself , it falls flat .
Books , records , movies , etc. do n’t work for Paris .
Because she ’s actually a platform .
Like Digg and YouTube .
Paris Hilton has gotten so good at garnering attention for others people are now using the fact that she does n’t visit as a marketing tool .
In a world where any attention is valuable Paris ca n’t lose .
And wo n’t be disappearing anytime soon .

YOU’VE PAID $ 10 to get into the movie and it just plain stinks .
The plot is ridiculous , the acting is terrible , the violence is excessive .
But you ’ve already watched half of it .
Do you sit through the movie to the end or do you leave ?
Just a month ago , you spent $ 2,000 getting your 10 - year - old car ’s transmission rebuilt .
Now you find out the car is leaking oil and needs a ring job .
Do you spend the next thousand or buy a new car ?
You ’ve been living with your romantic partner for 10 years .
The relationship has had its ups and downs , and both of you have invested a lot in keeping it going .
But every day it seems to involve more work and less joy .
Is it time to move on ?
You work for a private equity firm and personally persuaded your skeptical partners to invest $ 2 million in a high - tech start - up .
Now the chief executive comes to see you with the news that they ’ve hit some snags in developing their product , and they ’ll need at least another million to bring it to market .
Do you write the check ?
Advertisement
We ’ve all encountered situations like these .
We make a significant investment -- of money , time or emotion -- in some project , relationship or business deal , and it does n’t seem to be working out .
Do we continue to “ throw good money after bad ” or do we “ cut and run ” and “ stop wasting time ” ?
What ’s the right way to think about such decisions ?
Psychologists , decision scientists and economists have an answer .
They tell us that it ’s a mistake to continue with a project or an activity because of what you have already invested in it .
The time or money you ’ve already spent is gone .
You ca n’t reclaim it .
Using a past investment to justify a future investment is what they call the “ sunk - cost fallacy . ”
Instead of thinking about the past , what we should be doing is thinking about the future .
“ Will my life be better if I leave this terrible movie or if I stay to the bitter end ? ”
“ Will my car give me 20,000 more trouble - free miles if I just do this one last repair ? ”
None of these questions have sure answers .
Life is full of uncertainty .
But what we can say is that if the reason for “ staying the course ” is past commitment -- sunk costs -- we need to find a better one .
“ Cut and run . ” “ Stay the course . ”
Where have we heard these phrases lately ?
Oh , yes , we ’ve heard them trotted out in defense of continued U.S. involvement in Iraq as death , injury and insurgency mount .
President Bush has offered several reasons for staying the course .
And one of them is the more than 2,600 Americans who have already died in Iraq .
Advertisement
“ I ’m going to make you this promise , ” the president said at Ft. Bragg , N.C. , on July 4 .
“ I ’m not going to allow the sacrifice of 2,527 troops who have died in Iraq to be in vain by pulling out before the job is done . ”
And Bush has not cornered the market on this kind of reasoning .
Bill Clinton said it too , more than a year ago .
Asked about Iraq , he said that “ we ’ve all got a stake in its succeeding . ”
Why ?
“ We ’ve got over 600 dead Americans since the conflict was ended . ”
We heard this argument often enough in the 1960s .
As casualties mounted in Vietnam , it became more difficult to withdraw because withdrawal would have “ cheapened ” the lives of those already sacrificed .
We “ owed ” it to the dead and wounded to “ stay the course . ”
What staying the course produced was thousands more dead and wounded .
“ Knee deep in the big muddy ” is how folk singer Pete Seeger described it .
The question should never have been , “ What have we invested so far ? ” but “ What are our objectives for the future and can we attain them at a reasonable cost ? ”
The sunk - cost fallacy took many lives in Vietnam .
Whether Iraq is or is not another quagmire I leave to others , and to history , to determine .
But there is one respect in which we must not allow Iraq to become another Vietnam : Continued involvement must not be justified by appealing to the imperative not to allow the dead to have “ died in vain . ”
HOW SHOULD WE honor the sacrifices of those who have died or suffered serious injury in a U.S. military conflict ?
The best way to show how much we respect and value their lives is by not risking other lives unless future prospects for success fully justify putting more people in harm ’s way .
Therefore , our standards for putting more people at risk should , if anything , become more rigorous , not less , as casualties mount .

To change course under such circumstances need not be an admission of foolishness -- even if enemies do accuse the decision - maker of “ flip - flopping . ”
One can think through a problem in a logical and rigorous way , and formulate a sensible course of action , only to discover that it does n’t work out .
Good decisions do not guarantee good results ( just as bad decisions do n’t guarantee bad ones ) .
Yet people seem willing to waste even more ( time , money or lives ) to justify what they have already spent and avoid that sick feeling of failure .
Think about it .
You have n’t really lost money on a stock whose share price keeps plummeting until after you sell it .
So you keep holding on , in the hope that your judgment as an investor will eventually be vindicated .
And troops have n’t really “ died in vain ” as long as you continue to press on in the fight , no matter how disastrous the results .
I am not arguing that we should “ declare victory and leave ” Iraq .
Nor am I suggesting that the only justification being offered for continued U.S. involvement in Iraq is the “ sunk cost ” in American lives .
I am not saying that obligations from the past should never enter into one ’s consideration about the future .
And I certainly do n’t propose that we should think about death and injury , war and peace in exactly the same way we think about car transmissions and investments in start - ups .
My suggestion here is more modest .
You may attempt to justify the continued Iraq occupation in many ways , as the Bush administration has .
Perhaps you think it will prevent further terror , democratize the Middle East or restrain Iran .
Perhaps you think that leaving Iraq before “ the job is done ” will undermine the world ’s confidence in U.S. promises to other nations .

But it is unacceptable to justify continued involvement in Iraq or any other conflict on the grounds that we “ owe ” it to those who have already fallen .
That is a justification that has strong emotional appeal , but it is fallacious , and no one should be allowed to get away with it .
Whatever the differences between Iraq in 2006 and Vietnam in 1968 , if we allow policymakers to use our “ sunk costs ” -- our dead military -- to justify further conflict , we will have turned Iraq into another Vietnam .
And if we do , we will be shamed by Iraq just as we were shamed by Vietnam .

In no naval action of World War 2 will you find a German aircraft carrier taking part .
All the major navies in the war used them extensively , except for Nazi Germany .
There were lots of German U - Boats , battleships , cruisers , and destroyers , but no flattops .
However , the Nazis had plans to build a total of four carriers and almost finished one of them .
Her name was the KMS Graf Zeppelin and though launched in December 1938 she was never over 80 % completed .
Construction delays , lack of aircraft , and bitter disputes between Air Marshall Herman Goering and the Navy insured that the ship was doomed to become scrap metal .
Hitler had promised the German Navy ( The Kriegsmarine ) carriers as early as 1935 , and the keel was laid for the Graf Zepplin on December 26 , 1936 .
The Graf Zeppelin was 920 feet long and weighed 19,250 tons .
Her top speed was to be 33.8 knots .
Her crew complement was 1,760 and she was to hangar forty aircraft .
By comparison the large American Essex class carriers of WWII could carry 80 to 100 aircraft .
The Germans got as far as partly installing the catapults when the ship was then turned into a floating warehouse for u-boat parts .
Hitler ’s attitude vacillated on the project and it never had his full backing .
It also had a major detractor in Goering , who was resentful of any incursion on his authority as head of the country ’s air power .
Goering had been ordered by Hitler to develop aircraft for the ship .
His response was to offer redesigned versions of the then - obsolete JU - 87 Stuka dive bomber and older versions of the Messerschmitt 109 fighter .
Both planes were land - based aircraft never intended to meet the rough requirements for carrier operations .
Even after modifications they were hopelessly inferior to Allied types .
To insure further delay in the carrier ’s completion , Goering informed Hitler that these planes would not be ready until the end of 1944 .
Goering ’s tactics worked and the Graf Zeppelin ’s construction was halted in 1943 .
By the time work stopped on the ship , the Germany Navy had a submariner as its top naval officer ⁠ — Admiral Karl Donitz⁠ — and all ship construction was turned over to building new U - Boats .
The Graf Zeppelin stayed at her moorings in Stettin for the rest of the war never to see action .
As the end of the war in Europe neared , the Graf Zeppelin was scuttled in shallow water off Stettin ( now Szczecin in Poland ) on April 25 , 1945 just before the Red Army captured the city .
But she was n’t quite ready for the scrap yard yet .
According to recently found material in Russian archives , the ship was refloated by the Russians and towed to Leningrad filled with captured booty and military parts for use in the Soviet Union .
After unloading her cargo she was named “ PO - 101 ” ( Floating Base Number 101 ) by the Soviets .
The new owners had hoped to repair and refit the ship as a new carrier but this proved to be impractical so the Graf Zeppelin had one more task to fulfill .
On August 16 , 1947 she was towed out to sea and used for target practice by Soviet ships and aircraft .
Aerial bombs were placed in her hangers , flight deck and smoke stack .
Planes and ships then shot shells and dropped bombs on her to demonstrate how to sink a carrier , presumably American .
After twenty - four hits the Graf Zeppelin stayed afloat and had to be finished off by torpedoes .
Details on how the Nazis planned to use the carrier in action have been lost to obscurity .
The Germans had none of the experience that the American , British and Japanese navies had gained in the years between the wars .
While the Graf Zeppelin had some advanced features she displayed her designers ’ lack of knowledge about carriers .
The heavy surface armament was of little use and accounted for too much weight ; the anti-aircraft armament was heavy but badly sited , all on the starboard side .
The radius of action was low for a fleet carrier intended to operate with the capital ships on the Atlantic shipping routes .
Had she been commissioned she would have provided a considerable commerce - raiding capability .
The carrier could have provided effective support for capital ships and cruisers with air cover , and would have increased their potential for destruction considerably .
Such support operations could have changed the outcome of sea battles like the sinking of the Battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz had the Graf Zeppelin been present .
The Germans have never sailed an aircraft carrier since .
The Beatles set up record label Apple Corps in 1968
Sir Paul McCartney , Ringo Starr and the families of George Harrison and John Lennon control the Apple Corps label .
They claimed the US firm broke a deal aimed at ensuring there would not be two Apples in the music industry .
But Mr Justice Anthony Mann ruled that the computer company used the Apple logo in association with its store , not the music , and so was not in breach .
The ruling means iPods and iTunes will still be able to carry the Apple name and logo .
With great respect to the trial judge , we consider he has reached the wrong conclusion
Neil Aspinall
Apple Corps
Mr Justice Mann ruled iTunes was " a form of electronic shop " and not involved in creating music .
" I conclude that the use of the apple logo ... does not suggest a relevant connection with the creative work , " he wrote in his judgment .
" I think that the use of the apple logo is a fair and reasonable use of the mark in connection with the service , which does not go further and unfairly or unreasonably suggest an additional association with the creative works themselves . "
Apple Corps must pay its rival 's legal bill , estimated at £ 2 m , but the judge refused an interim payment of £ 1.5 m pending further hearings .
Exclusive rights
The record label said the rise of iTunes broke an agreement the two sides hammered out in 1991 after their last dispute .
That deal gave the record label exclusive rights to use the apple trademark for the record business , Geoffrey Vos QC , representing Apple Corps , told the court .
Apple Computer , whose products helped launch the personal computer industry , was founded in 1976 and its logo is an apple with a section removed from the side .
We have always loved The Beatles , and hopefully we can now work together to get them on the iTunes Music Store
Steve Jobs
Apple Computer
Apple Corps manager Neil Aspinall said : " With great respect to the trial judge , we consider he has reached the wrong conclusion .
" We felt that during the course of the trial we clearly demonstrated just how extensively Apple Computer had broken the agreement .
" We will accordingly be filing an appeal and putting the case again to the Court of Appeal . "
Apple Computer chief executive Steve Jobs said : " We are glad to put this disagreement behind us .
" We have always loved The Beatles , and hopefully we can now work together to get them on the iTunes Music Store . "
The launch of the iPod , a portable digital music player , in 2001 , and its iTunes music store two years later , prompted the latest battle .
Court download
About three million songs are downloaded from the service every day .
Tracks by The Beatles have not been licensed for downloading and are not available on the service .
Mr Vos demonstrated how to use iTunes during the hearing - downloading Chic 's 1978 disco hit Le Freak in the courtroom .
He pointed out to Mr Justice Mann how many times the Apple logo appeared on the computer screen as he went through the process .

Last month , the Web site Perverted - Justice.com posted news of the conviction of Sean Young , a Wisconsin man sentenced to 10 years in state prison for soliciting sex online from a 14 - year - old girl .
According to a transcript of an online chat posted on the site , at one point Mr. Young had asked the girl , identified only as Billie , what she was wearing .
When she answered “ sweats , ” Mr. Young typed back that if she were his daughter , “ i’d make u wear sexy clthes . ”
Billie turned out to be an adult volunteer for Perverted Justice , an anti-pedophile group , and when Mr. Young drove to a house where he expected to meet the teenager for sex , he was arrested by sheriff ’s deputies .
The conviction was logged as the 104th that Perverted Justice says it has been responsible for since 2003 , a tally that as of yesterday had reached 113 .
What started as one man ’s quest to rid his regional Yahoo chat room of lewd adults has grown into a nationwide force of cyberspace vigilantes , financed by a network television program hungry for ratings .
“ It ’s a kind of blog that has turned into a crime - fighting resource , ” said Robert McCrie , a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan .
For six years , latterly with the backing of both houses of a markedly conservative Republican Congress , George Bush has led an American administration that has played an unprecedentedly negative and polarising role in the world 's affairs .
On Tuesday , in the midterm US congressional elections , American voters rebuffed Mr Bush in spectacular style and with both instant and lasting political consequences .
By large numbers and across almost every state of the union , the voters defeated Republican candidates and put the opposition Democrats back in charge of the House of Representatives for the first time in a dozen years .
When the remaining recounts and legal challenges are over , the Democrats may even have narrowly won control of the Senate too .
Either way , the results change the political landscape in Washington for the final two years of this now thankfully diminished presidency .
They also reassert a different and better United States that can again offer hope instead of despair to the world .
Donald Rumsfeld 's resignation last night was a fitting climax to the voters ' verdict .
Thank you , America .
In US domestic terms , the 2006 midterms bring to an end the 12 intensely divisive years of Republican House rule that began under Newt Gingrich in 1994 .
These have been years of zealously and confrontational conservative politics that have shocked the world and , under Mr Bush , have sent America 's global standing plummeting .
That long political hurricane has now at last blown itself out for a while , but not before leaving America with a terrible legacy that includes climate - change denial , the end of biological stem - cell research , an aid programme tied to abortion bans , a shockingly permissive gun culture , an embrace of capital punishment equalled only by some of the world 's worst tyrannies , the impeachment of Bill Clinton and his replacement by a president who does not believe in Darwin 's theory of evolution .
The approval by voters in at least five more states of same - sex marriage bans - on top of 13 similar votes in 2004 - shows that culture - war politics are far from over .
Exit polls suggest that four issues counted most in these elections - corruption scandals , the economy , terrorism and Iraq .
In the end , though , it was the continuing failure of the war in Iraq that has galvanised many Americans to do what much of the rest of the world had longed for them to do much earlier .
It is too soon to say whether 2006 now marks a decisive rejection of the rest of the conservative agenda as well .
Only those who do not know America well will imagine that it does .
The Democratic victory was very tight in many places , but its size should not be underestimated .
November 7 was a decisive nationwide win for the progressive and moderate traditions in US political life .
The final majority in the House will be at least 18 .
The recapture of the Senate , if it happens , will involve captures from the Republicans in the north - east , the north - west , the midwest and the south .
The Democrats won seven new state governorships on Tuesday , including New York and Ohio , and now control a majority nationwide .
Republican governors who held on , like Arnold Schwarzenegger in California and Charlie Crist in Florida , only did so by distancing themselves from Mr Bush .
The statewide Democratic wins in Ohio give their 2008 presidential candidate a platform for doing what John Kerry failed to do in this crucial state in 2004 .
Claire McCaskill 's win in the Missouri Senate race showed that Democrats can win a state which almost always votes for the winning presidential candidate .
If Jim Webb has won the recounting Virginia Senate seat , Democrats will have gone another step towards re-establishing themselves in a changing part of the south .
In almost every one of these cases , as in the Connecticut contest won by Joe Lieberman running as an independent , the Democrats have won by cleaving to the centre and winning the support of independent voters .
The new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be the Armani- clad San Francisco leftwinger of the caricaturists ' dreams but she heads a caucus that will demand caution on some of the baby - boomer liberal generation 's pet subjects .
The big questions under the new Congress will be the way that Mr Bush responds to this unfamiliar reduction in his authority and whether the Democratic win will push the president into a new Iraq policy .
At his White House press conference yesterday , Mr Bush inevitably made plenty of suitably bipartisan and common - ground noises .
He had little alternative .
But they rang hollow from such a tarnished and partisan leader .
It will take more than warm words in the immediate aftermath of an election reverse to prove that Mr Bush is now capable of working in a new way .
The departure of the disastrous Mr Rumsfeld has come at least three years too late .
But it shows that Mr Bush has finally been forced to face the reality of the Iraq disaster for which his defence secretary bears so much responsibility .
As the smoke rose over the Pentagon on 9/11 , Mr Rumsfeld was already writing a memo that wrongly pointed the finger at Saddam Hussein .
He more than anyone beat the drum for the long - held neoconservative obsession with invading Iraq .
It was he who insisted , over the advice of all his senior generals , that the invasion required only a third of the forces that the military said they needed .
He more than anyone else is the architect of America 's humiliations in Iraq .
It was truly an outrage that he remained in office for so long .
But at least the passing of Mr Rumsfeld shows that someone in the White House now recognises that things cannot go on as before .
Business as usual will not do , either in general or over Iraq .
Mr Bush 's remarks last night showed that on Iraq he has now put himself in the hands of the Iraq Study Group , chaired by his father 's consigliere James Baker , one of whose members , Robert Gates , an ex-CIA chief , was last night appointed to succeed the unlamented Mr Rumsfeld .
Maybe the more pragmatic Republican old guard can come to the rescue of this disastrous presidency in its most catastrophic adventure .
But it has been the American voters who have at last made this possible .
For that alone the entire world owes them its deep gratitude today .
These mini-sauropods have now been modelled ( Image : Dinopark Munchehagen )
The creature was of the sauropod type - that group of long - necked , four - footed herbivores that were the largest of all the dinosaurs .
But at just a few metres in length , this animal was considerably smaller than its huge cousins , scientists report in the journal Nature .
The team thinks the Jurassic species evolved its small form in response to limited food resources on an island .
Martin Sander , from the University of Bonn , and colleagues studied the remains of over 11 sauropods found in a quarry at Oker , near Goslar , Lower Saxony .
With total body lengths ranging from 1.7 to 6.2 m ( 5.5 - 20 ft ) , the team originally thought the dinosaurs were juveniles .
But when the scientists examined the fossils closely , they realised they were dealing with dwarf creatures .
Nature co-author Nils Knotschke holds a skull reconstruction ( Image : M.Sander )
In height terms , an adult E. holgeri would have been about the size of a horse at the shoulder .
Compare this with other sauropods , which were bigger than buses , tens of metres in length and could weigh 100 tonnes or more .
The fossils were found in Late Jurassic carbonate rock ( about 150 million years old ) .
At this period in Earth 's history , much of what is now central Europe was under water .
Dr Sander and colleagues suggest the dinosaurs could have lived on one of the large islands around the Lower Saxony basin .
" Such islands would not have been able to support large - bodied sauropods , " they write in Nature .
" The ancestor of the Europasaurus would have dwarfed rapidly on immigrating to the island , or as a response to shrinking land masses caused by rising sea levels . "

Cat version 0.9.9
by Christopher Diggins
January 26 , 2007
Summary
The Cat programming language is fast approaching 1.0 status !
Advertisement
I have recently posted a new version of the Cat interpreter ( http://www.cat-language.com/download.html) so that people at large can start poking and prodding it with a stick before I release it as 1.0 .
For those unfamiliar with Cat , it is a functional stack - based programming language with a type system .
It looks like if ML and Forth had a baby .
it is a very concise and powerful language .
It is a pure functional language , but still allows side - effects in a very controlled manner ( without all of the confusing Monad stuff that Haskell has ) .
The Cat interpreter is entirely public domain ( that means you can do virtually whatever you want with it without obligations or restrictions ) .
The source code is written in C# and is tested on Mono ( but only on my Windows implementation of it ) .
I 'd be curious how it works out for people on other systems .
The type system underwent a recent redesign , but the language works great even without a type checker .
I plan on reintroducing the type - checking and type - inference engine in version 2.0 .
However the semantics of the type system have been ratified , and are explained at least semi-formally at http://www.cat-language.com/semantics.html.

Resveratrol , a molecule found in the skin of red grapes , among other places , has been found to have a host of health effects , most recently prolonging the life spans of obese mice .
But the natural wonder drug does not play a role in the beneficial effects of wine drinking , according to research published in the November 28 issue of " There are some fascinating effects of resveratrol in animal systems , " notes plant biochemist Alan Crozier of the University of Glasgow .
" To get similar doses into humans through red wine , you would have to consume more than 1,000 liters of red wine a day . "
Because drinking that much wine is beyond even the hardiest oenophile - - yes , even those in France -- Crozier and his colleague Roger Corder of Queen Mary 's School of Medicine and Dentistry in London set out to identify exactly the compounds in red wine that promote heart health .
Using the endothelial cells that line human artery walls , the researchers tested which compounds in wine had the greatest effect .
The tests showed that flavonoids called oligomeric procyanidins -- essentially condensed tannins , the compounds that impart bitterness to young reds -- suppressed production of the peptide responsible for hardening arteries .
Such procyanidins can make up as much as 50 percent of the bioactive compounds in a given wine , the researchers observed .
" Resveratrol , " Crozier notes , " is available at one one - hundredth or one one - thousandth of the levels of procyanidin . "
Corder adds : " The role of resveratrol in the health benefits of wine has been popularized without any scientific evidence to support it , given the amounts needed for these actions are approximately 1,000 - fold greater than could be achieved by wine consumption . "
Using French census data , the two researchers then compared regions that had unusually long - lived men with the wine produced in those areas .
The Nuoro province of Sardinia and the Gers region of southwestern France both support relatively more men who survive past 75 years of age .
Not coincidentally , these regions also produce local wines that are as much as four times richer in procyanidins than other wines .
Traditional wine - making techniques proved key : by allowing the grapes to linger on the vine for as long as possible and then leaving them to ferment for as long as four weeks ( compared with the more typical one - week period of major wineries , which keeps the level of harsh tannins low ) , vintners in these regions produce prodigious amounts of procyanidin .
Also crucial are the type of grape involved ( Tannat in Gers , a small , seedy fruit rarely grown outside the southwest of France ) and the elevation at which it is grown ( ultraviolet helps catalyze the production of procyanidins in the high - elevation vineyards of Sardinia ) .
" It is not something that in theory is unique to these areas , " Crozier adds .
" It could become more widespread . "
Of course , understanding exactly how procyanidins work in the human body remains to be investigated , and the researchers plan to dose people with the compound in a future clinical trial .
In the meantime , a few glasses of wine -- particularly a full - bodied one -- remain a recipe for a stronger heart .
Consider the signup screen for Flickr before Yahoo :
They make jokes about the screen name , remind you that it ’s changeable , express their hatred for spam , and poke fun at the terms of use .
And just as importantly , they only ask three questions and a confirmation .
That ’s it .
Takes no time to complete , involves little brain activity , and you get to chuckle about it .
In other words , a near perfect signup procedure .
Now consider the signup screen for Flickr after Yahoo ( which in true megaplex style requires three redirects and clicking signup twice , both on Flickr and the Yahoo - Flickr site ) :
Not only is it two - and - a - half times longer , it involves sixteen questions and an opt - out cross-sell “ opportunity ” to get Yahoo Mail .
It wants to know what industry you ’re in and whether you like your Yahoo content from the US or Korea .
It needs your first name , last name , gender , and possibly the middle name of your father .
It features a terms of service agreement that sounds like it was written by nasty lawyers armed with medieval instruments of truth - extraction .
And they display it in the classic nobody - is - ever - going - to - read - this 4 - line textarea .
The contrast to plain English terms like “ You must not abuse , harass , threaten , impersonate or intimidate other Flickr users ” from the original agreement could n’t be starker .
“ But only pedantic industry insiders care about all of this , ” you say ?
Wrong .
The only reason I dug into this issue and found these apalling before and after shots is because my lovely girlfriend tried to sign up for Flickr last night .
She did n’t made it and ended up at 23 hq instead .
Flickr squandered the implicit trust I had for them by subjecting her to this cruel and unsual signup hell .
This , however , is not meant to be a slam as much as a cry for mercy .
Yahoo , Flickr , we know you guys can do so much better than this .
We know that you do n’t intend to poison the well for future acquisitions and make users hate them on instinct .
To Yahoo : Recognize that the reason you bought Flickr in the first place was ( hopefully ) because you liked the groove they had going on .
And even more so , you liked the demonstrated success of said groove .
Consider if the droidinization of Flickr perhaps could n’t have happened slower , later , and with fewer casulties .
You guys stand to be the new cool .
This is one step forward , two backwards .
To Flickr : Come on , guys .
You had us eating out of your palms .
You ’re so much cooler than this .
We know its not your lips talking when you say “ Another motivation is all the stuff that Flickr can leverage from around the Yahoo !
network if people can use their Yahoo !
IDs in Flickr . ”
In other words , this is not about big being bad ( we have plenty of other posts on that ) .
This is just about not turning people away at the door , about doing more of what made you superstars in the first place , and about showing that the latest surge of M&A activity is n’t all about killing kittens .
We trust that the two of you can work it out !

BBC News , Bint Jbeil
Bint Jbeil is one of the worst hit areas in the south
The shell is huge , bigger than the young boy pushed forward to stand reluctantly next to it while we get our cameras out and record the scene for posterity .
The bomb came through the roof of the single - storey house and half - embedded itself into the floor , just missing the TV .
There is a hole in the roof with exactly the same profile as the shell itself , like when a cartoon character runs through a wall .
The tailfin - complete with skull - and - crossbones marking - still lies on the roof next to the hole where it broke off .
This is just one of thousands of nasty surprises greeting those coming back to southern Lebanon after Israel 's five - week war with the Hezbollah militant group .
" I 'm waiting for the resistance [ Hezbollah ] to take it away , " Um Ali tells me .
" But I have many other problems - there is no money , no work , my husband passed away two years ago . "
Fierce battle
Bint Jbeil - a city of 60,000 inhabitants which styles itself the capital of Lebanon 's liberation from Israeli occupation in 2000 - is one of the worst hit areas in the south .
There is hardly a building left standing in the city 's historic market or along its main roads .
Lebanese villagers return home
In pictures
For much of the time , the locals tell me , there were 2,000 people sheltering in the Mihaniya school , too frightened to leave because of bombing on the roads north .
There was also house - to - house fighting here , after Israeli troops entered Mihaniya and were engaged by Hezbollah fighters at close quarters .
A neighbour , Ghassan Dabaja , shows us congealed blood on the floor of his kitchen where an Israeli sniper was carried by his comrades after being hit by incoming fire or shrapnel .
Pride in resistance
As he takes around his three - storey house , Mr Dabaja warns us to be careful of an anti-personnel mine fitted with a tipping device that the Israeli troops left near the front door .
View a 360 panorama of damage in the village of Bint Jbail
During the fighting , Hezbollah fighters blew a hole through a wall on the ground floor with a rocket - propelled grenade , while the top floor was hit by Israel 's aerial bombing .
" Our boys came into the building at the ground floor and attacked them from below , " Mr Dabaja says proudly .
When I ask what he thinks of the government 's attempts to wrest control of this area from Hezbollah , in line with the UN ceasefire resolution , he is adamant .
" Of course we want help from the government , but not the Lebanese army - if it was n't for the resistance , Bint Jbeil would still be under occupation . "
Fleeing again
Israeli troops are still dug in at strategic points to the south and east of Bint Jbeil .
To the east , some of the few people who have come back to the town of Aitaroun are thinking of fleeing once more .
" There 's no security here , the Israeli tanks come and go all the time and helicopters fly over us at night , " says the mother .
" We came back yesterday but we will try and find somewhere to stay in Beirut again tomorrow . "
On the steep hill overlooking Bint Jbeil on the south side , the village of Maroun al - Ras has only received two families back since the ceasefire .
Many of the houses in the main street and the orchards dotted in the village appear to have been bulldozed .
Israeli troops are occupying the southern side of the village , and earlier in the day they opened fire to warn off a team from Medicins Sans Frontieres which had come to assess the situation .
One of those returning , a 75 - year - old who has come back from Tyre to check on his house , admits this was one of the most important assets for the " resistance " - high ground that offers a line of fire over a large swathe of northern Israel .
Hezbollah still maintains a discreet presence in Maroun al - Ras , scouts crouching among what is left of the orchards with walkie - talkies , just a few hundred metres from the Israeli position .
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine estimate that the human retina can transmit visual input at about the same rate as an Ethernet connection , one of the most common local area network systems used today .
They present their findings in the July issue of Current Biology .
This line of scientific questioning points to ways in which neural systems compare to artificial ones , and can ultimately inform the design of artificial visual systems .
Two broad classes of ganglion cell types in the guinea pig retina : brisk cells , which are larger and transmit electrical impulses faster , and sluggish , which are smaller and slower
Much research on the basic science of vision asks what types of information the brain receives ; this study instead asked how much .
Using an intact retina from a guinea pig , the researchers recorded spikes of electrical impulses from ganglion cells using a miniature multi-electrode array .
The investigators calculate that the human retina can transmit data at roughly 10 million bits per second .
By comparison , an Ethernet can transmit information between computers at speeds of 10 to 100 million bits per second .
The retina is actually a piece of the brain that has grown into the eye and processes neural signals when it detects light .
Ganglion cells carry information from the retina to the higher brain centers ; other nerve cells within the retina perform the first stages of analysis of the visual world .
The axons of the retinal ganglion cells , with the support of other types of cells , form the optic nerve and carry these signals to the brain .
Investigators have known for decades that there are 10 to 15 ganglion cell types in the retina that are adapted for picking up different movements and then work together to send a full picture to the brain .
The study estimated the amount of information that is carried to the brain by seven of these ganglion cell types .
The guinea pig retina was placed in a dish and then presented with movies containing four types of biological motion , for example a salamander swimming in a tank to represent an object - motion stimulus .
After recording electrical spikes on an array of electrodes , the researchers classified each cell into one of two broad classes : “ brisk ” or “ sluggish , ” so named because of their speed .
The researchers found that the electrical spike patterns differed between cell types .
For example , the larger , brisk cells fired many spikes per second and their response was highly reproducible .
In contrast , the smaller , sluggish cells fired fewer spikes per second and their responses were less reproducible .
But , what ’s the relationship between these spikes and information being sent ?
“ It ’s the combinations and patterns of spikes that are sending the information .
The patterns have various meanings , ” says co-author Vijay Balasubramanian , PhD , Professor of Physics at Penn .
“ We quantify the patterns and work out how much information they convey , measured in bits per second . ”
Calculating the proportions of each cell type in the retina , the team estimated that about 100,000 guinea pig ganglion cells transmit about 875,000 bits of information per second .
Because sluggish cells are more numerous , they account for most of the information .
With about 1,000,000 ganglion cells , the human retina would transmit data at roughly the rate of an Ethernet connection , or 10 million bits per second .
“ Spikes are metabolically expensive to produce , ” says lead author Kristin Koch , a PhD student in the lab of senior author Peter Sterling , PhD , Professor of Neuroscience .
“ Our findings hint that sluggish cells might be ‘ cheaper , ’ metabolically speaking , because they send more information per spike .
If a message must be sent at a high rate , the brain uses the brisk channels .
But if a message can afford to be sent more slowly , the brain uses the sluggish channels and pays a lower metabolic cost . ”
“ In terms of sending visual information to the brain , these brisk cells are the Fedex of the optic system , versus the sluggish cells , which are the equivalent of the U.S. mail , ” notes Sterling .
“ Sluggish cells have not been studied that closely until now .
The amazing thing is that when it ’s all said and done , the sluggish cells turned out to be the most important in terms of the amount of information sent . ”

But the man who put a capital B into the contemporary blockbuster , whose films have grossed billions and whose name is usually the stamp of glorious cinematic success , has been humbled .
By a button .
Pushed , it seems , mistakenly .
This has had a profound effect on the director 's latest opus , at least as far as the members of Bafta are concerned .
By tomorrow they have to nominate the films they think worthy of accolade , and Spielberg 's Munich was expected to be among them , tipped for awards both in Britain and at the Oscars .
But the preview DVD sent to the academy 's members is unplayable on machines used in the UK .
As a result the majority of Bafta 's 5,000 voters will not have seen the film , due to be released in Britain on January 27 , and can hardly be expected to recommend it for acclaim .
Sara Keene at Premier PR , the company coordinating Munich's Bafta campaign , blamed the mistake on human error at the laboratory where the DVDs were encrypted .
" Someone pushed the wrong button , " she said .
" It was a case of rotten bad luck . "
She insisted that the film 's distributor , Universal , was not at fault .
The problem , it appears , was partly down to teething troubles with the limited edition DVD players issued last year to Bafta members .
Developed by Cinea , a subsidiary of Dolby , the players permit their owners to view encrypted DVD " screeners " , but prevent the creation of pirate copies .
Munich screeners were encoded for region one , which allows them to be played in the US and Canada , rather than region two , which incorporates most of Europe .
The faulty DVDs only reached Bafta members on Saturday , which meant the film had already missed out on the first round of voting on January 4 .
In a further twist to the tale , a previous batch mailed out before Christmas were reportedly held up by customs officials in the UK .
" It 's been quite a cock - up , " said one Bafta member , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" We were promised that they were going to send screeners before Christmas , but they never arrived .
Now we finally have a copy but there is no way we can watch it .
" The general feeling among members is that the film has now been shut out of the nominations simply because not enough people have actually had the opportunity to see the thing . "
Having organised several London preview screenings of Munich before Christmas , Premier PR hastily scheduled three more for this week .
" The trouble is that Bafta members are scattered all over the country , " the Bafta voter said .
" We 're not all based in London . "
As arguably Spielberg 's most controversial film to date , Munich is a dramatisation of the 1972 Olympic hostage crisis that resulted in the death of 11 Israeli athletes .
The plot follows a hit squad from the Israeli secret service , Mossad , on the trail of the Palestinian Black September group behind the kidnappings .
The film has been criticised by Israeli officials for what is perceived as Spielberg 's sympathetic attitude towards the Palestinian cause , and for allegedly equating Mossad 's actions with those of the terrorists .
Reviews in the US have largely been positive .
DVD screeners remain a vexed issue for distributors concerned about the potential for piracy .
But the evidence suggests that they play a vital role in raising a film 's profile among award voters .
" There are over 5,000 Bafta members , " Ms Keene explained .
" With the best will in the world , they do n't all come to the preview screenings .
Unless you send them DVDs it is really hard to get a film nominated . "
This point was brought home last year when the distributor Entertainment took the decision not to provide Bafta voters with screeners of Million Dollar Baby .
Clint Eastwood 's boxing drama failed to gain a single nomination at the 2005 awards .
One month later it scooped the major honours at the Academy Awards .
The book reveals that while President Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney insist there is no comparison between Iraq and the Vietnam War , Henry Kissinger , the secretary of state during the Nixon administration , has become a regular adviser to the President .
Mr Kissinger has argued that the Vietnam War was lost because of a lack of political will .
He confirmed at the weekend that he had private meetings with Mr Bush — " just me and the President " .
Some of the Administration 's conservative supporters would find that revelation surprising given that they considered Mr Kissinger to have been too soft on the Soviet Union during the Cold War .
The 82 - year - old Mr Kissinger is quoted as telling Mr Bush that the US could not afford to lose in Iraq and that " victory over the insurgency " was the only meaningful way out .
The publishers of State of Denial rushed almost a million copies of the book to bookshops at the weekend , pushing the publication date forward as reports of some of its charges started to appear in newspapers and television news reports late last week .
It is believed that a team of White House officials have been combing through the book to prepare a rebuttal , which Administration officials will roll out this week , as Woodward begins appearances on talk shows and current affairs programs to promote the book .
Publication could not have come at a worse time for the Administration and the Republican Party , with mid-term elections just over a month away .
Party strategists are concerned that if the war is the main campaign issue , Republican control of Congress will almost certainly be lost .
The 500 - page book has no smoking gun that proves , for instance , that the Administration cooked the intelligence to justify the war .
But given Woodward 's celebrity status — which means the book is already a bestseller — and the fact that his previous two books on the Administration were considered favourable to the White House , it will be hard for officials to suggest that he is just another liberal journalist who can not be believed .
Some books in recent months , including Fiasco , by the Washington Post 's Pentagon reporter , have revealed how the Bush White House ignored advice from senior military officers and State Department officials that more troops were needed to defeat the Iraqi insurgency .
Those warnings came within weeks of Mr Bush declaring victory .
State of Denial confirms this and goes further , revealing how Mr Bush has never tried to question the officials who issued these warnings .
Instead , he relies on advice from senior commanders who , according to Woodward , are loath to tell him the hard truths .
Mr Bush emerges as a man who not only lacks intellectual curiosity but is untroubled by self - doubt , a man who constantly tells his aides that as commander - in - chief his job is to exude confidence in his decisions .
He is , according to Woodward , a man of deep faith , who prays regularly for guidance and believes his prayers are answered .
There may not be a truly major revelation in the book — the fact that the then secretary of state , Colin Powell , and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld could not stand each other is not new — but that Condoleezza Rice urged Mr Bush to sack Mr Rumsfeld was not known .
Woodward suggests that several Administration officials , including Andrew Card , the White House chief of staff until March this year , urged Mr Bush to sack Mr Rumsfeld , as did Laura Bush .
The White House has emphatically denied this .
The book reveals that Mr Bush 's parents have become increasingly concerned about the war .
At one stage , his mother , Barbara , spoke to a former Democratic senator David Boren who had worked closely with her husband at the CIA in the 1970s , and asked him to be candid .
" Are we right to be worried about this Iraq thing ? " she asked .
" Yes , very worried , " he said . —
" Do you think it 's a mistake ? " —
" Yes , ma'am .
I think it 's a huge mistake if we go in … " " Well , his father is certainly worried , and is losing sleep over it .
He 's up at night worried . " —
" Why does n't he talk to him ? " —
" He does n't think he should unless he 's asked . "
Woodward suggests that Mr Bush never asked his father for advice , and has not talked to him at any length about Iraq since the war started .
Woodward 's description of the relationship of Mr Bush with his father suggested that the President may love his father , but does not respect him much as a politician .
At one stage , according to Woodward , Republican presidential hopeful John McCain was asked whether Mr Bush had ever asked him for his views on Iraq .
" No , no , he has n't , " Senator McCain said .
" As a matter of fact , he 's not intellectually curious .
But one of the things he did say one time was , ' I do n't want to be like my father .
I want to be like Ronald Reagan ' . "
There are some minor but interesting revelations .
Mr Bush and his senior adviser , Karl Rove , for instance , enjoy fart jokes , which they sometimes swap in the middle of Oval Office meetings .
Mr Rove , when bored , plays with a battery - powered " Redneck Horn " , which can be attached to a car dashboard .
When you press a button , it rattles off such obscenities as : " What race are you in , shithead " and " Put the cell phone down , dickhead " .
Mr Bush , Woodward implies , found the toy amusing .
According to the Washington Post , Helen and James Briggs adopted the boy six years ago , after Mrs Briggs - a foster mother - fell in love with him .
But in 2003 the boy , who cannot be named , sexually abused a six - year - old boy and a two - year - old girl .
Mrs Briggs said it was only then that she discovered his troubled past .
The newspaper said confidential files revealed that the boy 's biological parents , who were alcohol and drug addicts , had physically abused him to the extent that his brain stem was damaged - hindering his ability to gauge the passage of time .
The files also suggested that he had been sexually abused .
The boy had been in and out of five foster homes since he was 16 months old , in psychiatric institutions seven times and diagnosed as possibly psychotically bipolar .
' Wrongful adoption '
Mrs Briggs said she had not been told any of those details before she adopted him .
" They just told me he was hyperactive , " she told the Washington Post .
Under Virginia policy , caseworkers must provide the full facts about a child to adoptive parents .
She never would have adopted the boy and put other children in danger if she had had the information that was withheld from her
David Albo
Virginia politician
State child welfare officials have not commented on the case , due to confidentiality .
But the newspaper claims some caseworkers do not believe that Mrs Briggs was uninformed .
A Fairfax County court has allowed Mrs Briggs to relinquish custody of the boy , but she is still bound to pay $ 427 a month in child support and cover the court costs when a judge makes a decision on his future .
Mrs Briggs , 57 , could have filed a " wrongful adoption " lawsuit within two years of discovering the boy 's true history , but failed to .
' Sexual predator '
She had wanted to bring the boy home after his sex offender treatment , following the case in 2003 .
But then psychologists labelled him a sexual predator , meaning she would have to give up being a foster parent , which she sees as her livelihood , and would no longer be able to allow her three grandchildren in the house or keep a young girl she had fostered from birth .
Mrs Briggs decided to dissolve the adoption , which requires the consent of the boy , who is now back in foster care .
But so far he has refused .
She is said to be asking politicians to help her find a way out .
" At first blush , you think ' What , you 're trying to give up your kid ? ' " , Virginia politician David Albo told the Washington Post .
" Then you find out this lady has received awards for all the foster work she 's done .
And that she never would have adopted the boy and put other children in danger if she had had the information that was withheld from her . "
sound scary
As part of my remedial Haskell learning process , I ’ve been getting my feet wet once more with monads .
Here are a few notes on the techniques that I ’ve tried , and how I ’ve fared with them .
Not surprisingly , my first step was to try reading some tutorials .
If you ’ve looked , you may have noticed that the web is awash with monad tutorials .
There ’s something about monads that seems to compel people to write tutorials about them .
They : what ’s this chunk of category theory doing in my language soup ?
After a few nights of reading , but absorbing little , I concluded that this was getting me nowhere .
I ’m happy to concede that this was in large part my fault ; I prefer taking things apart to reading about how they ’re put together ; and I have two little kids , so my attention is perforce limited to brief spans , right before bed .
But I suspect that Sturgeon ’s Revelation may have had more than a little to do with my indifferent level of enlightenment .
My reaction was to abandon the tutorials , and start reading the source code of the Haskell prelude ( the chunk of standard library that ’s always available without you having to explicitly pull it in ) .
To my delight , I found that the Maybe type was a monad ; even better , it looked like it might be easy to use .
Armed with a text editor and a Haskell interpreter , I wrote a simple parser and interpreter for a pattern language , and used the Maybe monad to represent the results of both parsing and matching .
( In case you ’re interested , I reimplemented the Unix fnmatch library call .
It ’s a nice , tidy problem that does n’t require a full regexp engine to solve , and that provides a bit of useful functionality that ’s not available through any standard Haskell library . )
While I was doing this , I deliberately avoided Haskell ’s “ do ” syntax , the better to give me an idea of what was really happening .
And rather than try to follow the rickety exposition of a tutorial , I simply made lots of elementary mistakes .
Each infinite loop and type error was my own shining beacon of stupid , lighting a step on the random walk towards slightly less stupid .
At the end of a few hours of hacking , I had a nifty little piece of code going , complete with uses of the three monad functions .
I was satisfied that I at least had some notion of the use of the Maybe monad , albeit in splendid isolation .
This turned out to be an especially good place to start , because the Maybe datatype is incredibly simple , as are the monad functions defined on it .
Once I was happy with the Maybe monad , I decided to try the State monad .
My programming vehicle this time was much simpler than fnmatch ; I just decided to count repeated instances of an item in a tree .
This turned out to be a lucky choice , because I found State much harder to grasp than Maybe .
( Perhaps this was because I was coming from the direction of reading the source code in a vacuum and trying to decide how to put the pieces together .
I wo n’t be surprised if the “ read the source ” approach fails me at some point , but so far , so good . )
This was an endeavour where Haskell ’s brevity and type system really shone for me .
Even though I had little initial idea of what I was doing , I was able to run my initial State - using code through the interpreter , have it point out something egregious that I was misunderstanding , and iteratively refine ( I mean “ rip to shreds and rewrite ” ) my code until I got it to actually work , all the while referring to the source for the State monad so that I could find functions like evalState , get , and put .
The brevity of Haskell helped me here because the State monad is tiny ; even though it ’s much more complex than the Maybe monad , it ’s still small enough that the source fits in a single editor window .
And the type system was valuable not only because the interpreter could spank me whenever I was being dull - witted , but because I could read the type signatures of functions and actions around the State monad that I thought I might need , and tell whether they had a chance of doing what I wanted .
Once I had a basic grasp of the Maybe and State monads , I found that going back and rereading the same tutorials that had initially baffled me had a profoundly different result .
I now had a framework in which I could think usefully about what the tutorial authors were trying to tell me .
( I also have stronger opinions as to which of the tutorials and references are best , but I ’ll save those for another time . )
After a few days of tinkering with them , monads are looking decidedly less scary to me .
We ’ll see if I ’m still saying that after spending a little time with StateT and a few stacked monads , but getting my hands dirty has given me a degree of understanding that I could not have matched with reading .
If monads still give you palpitations , I urge you to dive in , create a silly contrived problem for yourself , and just wallow with Maybe for a while .
The voice sounded friendly enough .
" Hi , my name is Danny .
I 'm an officer in Israeli military intelligence .
In one hour we will blow up your house . "
Mohammed Deeb took the telephone call seriously and told his family and neighbours to get out of the building .
An hour later , an Israeli helicopter fired three missiles at the four - storey building in Gaza City , destroying the ground floor and damaging the upper storeys .
Mr Deeb was on the receiving end of a new Israeli tactic of using telephone , radio and leaflets to warn Gazans of impending attacks .
The army claims it is an attempt to minimise civilian casualties , but Palestinians say it is a new way of terrorising the population .
Raji Serrani , the director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) , which has collected several examples of the tactic , described it as " psychological warfare " , adding : " Since when did Israel feel the need to warn people that they were about to bomb their homes ?
They are simply playing with people 's minds and inflicting a new panic in Gaza . "
The family of Ibrahim Mahmoud in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza were ordered to leave their home by an Israeli intelligence officer .
The officer called back one hour later to say she had made a mistake .
She ended her call to Mr Mahmoud by telling him to " be safe " , he told the Associated Press .
The warnings , which sometimes are followed by an Israeli attack and sometimes not , are happening as Israel continues its latest invasion of the Gaza Strip .
Four people were killed and dozens injured yesterday as Israeli tanks patrolled residential areas to the east of Gaza City .
Twenty - five people were killed on Wednesday .
Fears that Israel will destroy homes are widespread : 900 residents of the al Nader towers , a complex of 12 apartment blocks in the north of Gaza , fled on Tuesday after 10 Israeli shells landed close to them , killing three residents .
According to the PCHR , Israel had also informed Palestinian police that they planned to demolish the towers .
Izzat al Jamal , 38 , a Palestinian policeman , moved his wife and eight children out of their apartment to emergency accommodation in a local school .
" When they started firing , it was clear it was aimed directly at us and it was n't a random mistake .
I had to leave for the children 's sake .
I have n't been paid in four months and now I do n't even have a home . "
Hundreds of families have also moved out of the east of Gaza City in the al Shaaf and al Tuffah suburbs after Israeli tanks took up position on Wednesday .
Two tanks were visible on hills above the suburbs and many more could be heard shooting and moving in the narrow streets .
Scores of Palestinian fighters armed with rifles attempted to approach the tanks , which - supported by drones and helicopters - fired shells and machine guns throughout yesterday .
At Shifa Hospital , the ambulances lined up to deliver the injured and crowds of men waited to take away the dead .
Dr Jumah Sakkah said the hospital had taken in 16 injured people and two had died .
The death toll later rose to four .
He said that all of the injured were non-combatants .
Once again the " independent Democrat " from Connecticut is burnishing his Republican credentials , this time by announcing that he will join in a filibuster against the Senate resolution opposing the escalation of troops in Iraq .
MS . BLOCK : Can you imagine a scenario where you would join in with a Republican filibuster to stop the resolution , if it comes to that ?
SEN .
LIEBERMAN : I can because I think that it – this is this important .
Calling the resolution , " phony , " Lieberman says :
I say to those who are opposed to what the president is now suggesting that they have a responsibility to do one thing : one is to come up with a better plan if they do n’t like this one ...
First , for the origin of this argument , go here .
And Lieberman , like Bush and his acolytes , continue to ignore that there have been other plans put forward , such as the ones offered by John Murtha , Joe Biden and Jack Reed .
But of course their fatal flaw is that they do n't agree with the Bush plan to " stay the course , plus 21,500 . "
And speaking of the number 21,500 , is it enough ?
MS . BLOCK : Would you say that we actually would need more troops ?
Is this too little too late ?
SEN .
LIEBERMAN : It ’s an interesting question .
I do n’t think it ’s too late .
It ’s not as many as I would like , but it ’s not too little .
If I had my druthers , we would be sending 35,000 troops – additional reinforcement troops there , and I base that on a very effective work that has been done by a retired Army chief of staff , Jack Keane and military historian , Fred Kagan .
Leaving aside the credentials of Fred Kagan , let 's look at what he and Keane had to say about troop levels :
We need to cut through the confusion .
Bringing security to Baghdad -- the essential precondition for political compromise , national reconciliation and economic development -- is possible only with a surge of at least 30,000 combat troops lasting 18 months or so .
Any other option is likely to fail .
So those whose work that Lieberman is relying on , as he advocates sending even more American servicemen and women to their possible death , have already said that this escalation is " likely to fail . "
But as is always the case with the Bush - enablers , it 's not Lieberman 's ass on the line so what the heck , let 's give it another shot .
But if this latest plan does n't work ?
From an appearance on Imus , Lieberman said :
... Not everybody can understand they do n't want an occupying force but they know that the place really would fall apart .
There would be open armed civil war and the Iranians would come in and dominate a good part of the country , so let 's hope and pray it works . " [...]
But some say if you begin to withdraw , then Maliki and the other Iraqis will say ' Oh , my God , they 're leaving .
We got to get our act together .
I do n't think so .
I think what is more likely is that the Iraqi politicians will begin to hedge their bets , and the militias and the Al Qaeda terrorists will just hold back until the day we 're gone , and then chaos will break out , ... There 's a famous old saying that war is a series of catastrophes that ends up in victory for one side , and right now I 'd say this plan is the best next step we 've got .
Let 's hope it works , pray it works , and if it does n't , then we 'll figure out what we 're gonna do then . "
As opposed to the closed , unarmed civil war that there is now ?
And the militias and terrorists would just hold back ?
Well , we would n't want that to happen , would we ?
But here are two things that we can all agree on .
That this war has been a series of catastrophes , despite how some people choose to describe it , and that there will be no victory for either side .
And what about the fact that more than 60 % of Americans oppose this escalation ?
SEN .
LIEBERMAN : Yeah .
Look , it ’s very – this is very troubling in many ways .
I do think that because of the mistakes that have been made in the prosecution of the war , because of the fact that this is an unconventional war in which people – what they see on television at night or hear about on the radio or read in the newspapers are the suicide bombings .
And in matters of national security , ultimately two things : one is elected leaders have a responsibility to do what they think is right for the country and the future of the country and not to play to public opinion .
Again , for the origins of this rationalization to ignore the will of the people , see here .
When asked if he still considers himself a Democrat , Lieberman said , " Yeah , I do , " and then proceeded to show his loyalty to the Party by saying :
But if the Democratic Party cannot convince the American people that we are prepared to protect them in a dangerous world , ultimately I do n’t think we ’re going to be successful in national elections . [...]
Frankly , I ’m surprised that at this moment I ’m in a very small group within the Democratic Party in Congress that ’s taking the position I am .
Yes , it 's surprising that more Democrats are n't willing to join with the Republicans to continue to support the failed policies of this President .
A failure that has already cost 3025 American , and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives .
Chomsky effectively won this debate , at least in the sense that most American linguistics departments still teach it his way .
( To this day , the two men do n't speak . )
Undeterred , however , Lakoff and his like - minded colleagues marched off and founded the field of cognitive linguistics , which seeks to understand the nature of language -- how we use it , why it is persuasive -- by exploring the largely unconscious way in which the mind operates .
In the 1970's , Lakoff , verging into philosophy , became obsessed with metaphors .
As he explained it to me one day over lunch at a Berkeley cafe , students of the mind , going back to Aristotle , had always viewed metaphor simply as a device of language , a facile way of making a point .
Lakoff argued instead that metaphors were actually embedded in the recesses of the mind , giving the brain a way to process abstract ideas .
In other words , a bad relationship reminds you on an unconscious level of a cul - de- sac , because both are leading nowhere .
This results from what might be called a " love as journey " frame in the neural pathways of your brain -- that is , you are more likely to relate to the story of , say , a breakup if it is described to you with the imagery of a journey .
This might seem intuitive , but in 1980 , when Lakoff wrote " Metaphors We Live By , " it was considered fairly radical .
" For 2,500 years , nobody challenged Aristotle , even though he was wrong , " Lakoff told me , sipping from a goblet of pinot grape juice .
Humility is not his most obvious virtue .
Through his work on metaphors , Lakoff found an avenue into political discourse .
In a seminal 1996 book , " Moral Politics , " he asserted that people relate to political ideologies , on an unconscious level , through the metaphorical frame of a family .
Conservative politicians , Lakoff suggests , operate under the frame of a strict father , who lays down inflexible rules and imbues his family with a strong moral order .
Liberals , on the other hand , are best understood through a frame of the nurturant parent , who teaches his child to pursue personal happiness and care for those around him .
( The two models , Lakoff has said , are personified by Arnold Schwarzenegger on one side and Oprah Winfrey on the other . )
Most voters , Lakoff suggests , carry some part of both parental frames in the synapses of their brains ; which model is " activated " -- that is , which they can better relate to -- depends on the language that politicians use and the story that they tell .
The most compelling part of Lakoff 's hypothesis is the notion that in order to reach voters , all the individual issues of a political debate must be tied together by some larger frame that feels familiar to us .
Lakoff suggests that voters respond to grand metaphors -- whether it is the metaphor of a strict father or something else entirely -- as opposed to specific arguments , and that specific arguments only resonate if they reinforce some grander metaphor .
The best evidence to support this idea can be found in the history of the 2004 presidential campaign .
From Day 1 , Republicans tagged Kerry with a larger metaphor : he was a flip - flopper , a Ted Kennedy - style liberal who tried to seem centrist , forever bouncing erratically from one position to the other .
They made sure that virtually every comment they uttered about Kerry during the campaign reminded voters , subtly or not , of this one central theme .
( The smartest ad of the campaign may have been the one that showed Kerry windsurfing , expertly gliding back and forth , back and forth . )
Democrats , on the other hand , presented a litany of different complaints about Bush , depending on the day and the backdrop ; he was a liar , a corporate stooge , a spoiled rich kid , a reckless warmonger .
But they never managed to tie them all into a single , unifying image that voters could associate with the president .
As a result , none of them stuck .
Bush was attacked .
Kerry was framed .
According to Lakoff , Republicans are skilled at using loaded language , along with constant repetition , to play into the frames in our unconscious minds .
Take one of his favorite examples , the phrase " tax relief . "
It presumes , Lakoff points out , that we are being oppressed by taxes and that we need to be liberated from them .
It fits into a familiar frame of persecution , and when such a phrase , repeated over time , enters the everyday lexicon , it biases the debate in favor of conservatives .
If Democrats start to talk about their own " tax relief " plan , Lakoff says , they have conceded the point that taxes are somehow an unfair burden rather than making the case that they are an investment in the common good .
The argument is lost before it begins .
Lakoff informed his political theories by studying the work of Frank Luntz , the Republican pollster who helped Newt Gingrich formulate the Contract With America in 1994 .
To Lakoff and his followers , Luntz is the very embodiment of Republican deception .
His private memos , many of which fell into the hands of Democrats , explain why .
In one recent memo , titled " The 14 Words Never to Use , " Luntz urged conservatives to restrict themselves to phrases from what he calls , grandly , the " New American Lexicon . "
Thus , a smart Republican , in Luntz 's view , never advocates " drilling for oil " ; he prefers " exploring for energy . "
He should never criticize the " government , " which cleans our streets and pays our firemen ; he should attack " Washington , " with its ceaseless thirst for taxes and regulations .
" We should never use the word outsourcing , " Luntz wrote , " because we will then be asked to defend or end the practice of allowing companies to ship American jobs overseas . "
In Lakoff 's view , not only does Luntz 's language twist the facts of his agenda but it also renders facts meaningless by actually reprogramming , through long - term repetition , the neural networks inside our brains .
And this is where Lakoff 's vision gets a little disturbing .
According to Lakoff , Democrats have been wrong to assume that people are rational actors who make their decisions based on facts ; in reality , he says , cognitive science has proved that all of us are programmed to respond to the frames that have been embedded deep in our unconscious minds , and if the facts do n't fit the frame , our brains simply reject them .
Lakoff explained to me that the frames in our brains can be " activated " by the right combination of words and imagery , and only then , once the brain has been unlocked , can we process the facts being thrown at us .
EMACS : The Extensible , Customizable Display Editor
This paper was written by Richard Stallman in 1981 and delivered in the ACM Conference on Text Processing .
Table of Contents
EMACS ( 1 ) is a real - time display editor which can be extended by the user while it is running .
Extensibility means that the user can add new editing commands or change old ones to fit his editing needs , while he is editing .
EMACS is written in a modular fashion , composed of many separate and independent functions .
The user extends EMACS by adding or replacing functions , writing their definitions in the same language that was used to write the original EMACS system .
We will explain below why this is the only method of extension which is practical in use : others are theoretically equally good but discourage use , or discourage nontrivial use .
Extensibility makes EMACS more flexible than any other editor .
Users are not limited by the decisions made by the EMACS implementors .
What we decide is not worth while to add , the user can provide for himself .
He can just as easily provide his own alternative to a feature if he does not like the way it works in the standard system .
A coherent set of new and redefined functions can be bound into a library so that the user can load them together conveniently .
Libraries enable users to publish and share their extensions , which then become effectively part of the basic system .
By this route , many people can contribute to the development of the system , for the most part without interfering with each other .
This has led the EMACS system to become more powerful than any previous editor .
User customization helps in another , subtler way , by making the whole user community into a breeding and testing ground for new ideas .
Users think of small changes , try them , and give them to other users -- if an idea becomes popular , it can be incorporated into the core system .
When we poll users on suggested changes , they can respond on the basis of actual experience rather than thought experiments .
To help the user make effective use of the copious supply of features , EMACS provides powerful and complete interactive self - documentation facilities with which the user can find out what is available .
A sign of the success of the EMACS design is that EMACS has been requested by over a hundred sites and imitated at least ten times .
By a display editor we mean an editor in which the text being edited is normally visible on the screen and is updated automatically as the user types his commands .
No explicit commands to `print ' text are needed .
As compared with printing terminal editors , display editor users have much less need for paper listings , and can compose code quickly on line without writing it on paper first .
Display editors are also easier to learn than printing terminal editors .
This is because editing on a printing terminal requires a mental skill like that of blindfold chess ; the user must keep a mental image of the text he is editing , which he cannot easily see , and calculate how each of his editing command `moves ' changes it .
A display editor makes this unnecessary by allowing the user to see the `board ' .
Among display editors , a real - time editor is one which updates the display very frequently , usually after each one or two character command the user types .
This is a matter of the input command language .
Most printing terminal editors read a string of commands and process it all at once ; a useful feature on a printing terminal .
For example , there is usually an `insert ' command which inserts a string of characters .
When such editors are adapted to display terminals , they often update the display at the end of a command string ; thus , the insertion would be shown all at once when it was over .
It is more helpful to display each inserted character in its position in the text as soon as it has been typed .
A real - time display editor has ( primarily ! ) short , simple commands which show their effects in the display as soon as they are typed .
In EMACS , text ( printing characters and formatting characters ) is inserted just by typing it ; there is no `insert ' command .
In other words , each printing character is a command to insert that character .
The commands for modifying text are nonprinting characters , or begin with nonprinting characters .
Many - character commands echo if typed slowly ; if there is a sufficiently long pause , the command so far is echoed , and then the rest of the command is echoed as it is typed .
Aside from this , EMACS acknowledges commands by displaying their effects .
EMACS is not the first real - time display editor , but it derives much appeal from being one .
It is not necessary to know how to program , or how to extend EMACS , to use it successfully .
To illustrate and demonstrate the flexibility which EMACS derives from extensibility , here is a summary of many of the features , available to EMACS users without the need to program , to which extensibility has contributed .
Many of them were written by users ; some were written by the author , but could just as well have been written by users .
Many minor extensions can be done without any programming .
These are called customizations , and are very useful even by themselves .
For example , for editing a program in which comments start with `<**' and end with `**>' , the user can tell the EMACS comment manipulation commands to recognize and insert those strings .
This is done by setting parameters which the comment commands refer to .
It is not necessary to redefine the commands themselves .
Another sort of customization is rearrangement of the command set .
For example , some users prefer the four basic cursor motion commands ( up , down , left and right ) on keys in a diamond pattern on the keyboard .
It is easy to reassign the commands to these positions .
It is also possible to rearrange the entire command set according to a different philosophy .
EMACS can be programmed to understand the syntax of the language being edited and provide operations particular to it .
Many major modes are defined , one for each language which is understood .
Each major mode has the ability to redefine any of the commands , and reset any parameters , so as to customize EMACS for that language .
Files can contain special text strings that tell EMACS which major mode to use in editing them .
For example , `-*- Lisp -*-' anywhere in the first nonblank line of a file says that the file should be edited in Lisp mode .
The string would normally be enclosed in a comment .
For editing English text , commands have been written to move the cursor by words , sentences and paragraphs , and to delete them ; to fill and justify paragraphs ; and to move blocks of text to the left or to the right .
Other commands convert single words or whole regions to upper or lower case .
There are also commands which manipulate the command strings for text justifier programs : some insert or delete underlining commands , and others insert or delete font - change commands .
Many commands are controlled by parameters which can be used to further adapt them to particular styles of formatting .
For example , the word moving and deletion commands have a syntax table that says which characters are parts of words .
There are two commands to edit this table , one convenient for programs to use and an interactive one for the user .
The paragraph commands can be told which strings , appearing at the beginning of a line , constitute the beginning of a paragraph .
Such parameters can be set by the user , or by a specification in the file being edited .
But normally they are set automatically by the major mode ( that is , by telling EMACS what language the file is written in ) and do not require attention from the user .
A very powerful extension facility is the ability to redefine the graphic and formatting characters as commands .
These characters , which include letters , digits and punctuation , are normally all defined as commands to insert themselves into the text .
Useful alternate definitions for these characters usually insert the character as usual , and then do additional processing which is in some way meaningfully associated with the insertion of that character .
The single most useful command for editing text is the `auto - fill space ' .
It is a program intended to be used as the definition of the space character .
In addition to inserting a space , it breaks the line into two lines if it has become too long .
With the space character redefined in this way , the user can type endlessly ignoring the right margin , and the text is divided into lines of a reasonable length .
Of course , this feature is not always desirable .
It is turned on or off by redefining the space command .
If the auto - fill space did not exist , any user could write it and also the command to turn it on and off .
A bolder use of redefinition of self - inserting characters is the abbreviation facility , part of the standard EMACS system but still implemented as an extension maintained by the user who wrote it .
The abbreviation facility allows the user to define abbreviations for words , and then type the abbreviations in order to insert the words .
For example , if `cd ' were defined as an abbreviation for `command ' , typing `i /o - cd ' would insert `i/o- command ' into the text .
Abbreviation expansion preserves case , so ` Cd ' would expand into ` Command ' .
Abbreviation works by redefining all punctuation characters ( the list of which can be altered by customization ) to run a program which looks at the preceding word and , if it is a defined abbreviation , replaces it with its expansion .
Yet another application of redefining printing characters is automatic parenthesis - matching .
When this feature is in use , every time the user inserts a close - parenthesis , the cursor moves briefly to the matching open - parenthesis , then back again .
Automatic matching is especially useful in editing Lisp code , but it is helpful with most other programming languages also .
It is implemented by redefining the close - parenthesis character .
Extensibility is especially useful for editing programs .
One might conceivably design in advance all the editing commands needed for editing English text , but each programming language has its own set of useful syntactic operations , which suggest useful editing commands .
Because languages differ so much , simple customization is not in general enough to implement familiar operations for a new language .
A new extension package is required .
EMACS commands have been written , for many languages , to move over or kill balanced expressions , to move to the beginning or end of a function definition , and to insert or align comments .
But the most useful editing operation for programs , and the first one to be implemented for any programming language , is automatic indentation .
The structure of a program can be made clear at a glance by adjusting the indentation of each line according to its level of nesting .
Most programming communities attempt to indent code properly but do it manually .
Automatic indentation is used mostly by Lisp programmers .
Automatic indentation was traditionally done by a program which would read in an entire source file , rearrange the indentation , and write out a corrected source file .
Such a tool has several disadvantages .
For one thing , processing the entire file is likely to take a while .
For another , the tool insists on imposing its own idea of proper formatting , which the user cannot override .
Even after a lot of effort is put into heuristics for good indentation , users are still dissatisfied .
Automatic indentation in EMACS is done incrementally .
The Tab character is redefined , as a command , to update the indentation of the current line only , based on the existing indentation of the preceding lines .
The Tab command is used on lines whose nesting has changed .
With it , the user can indent code properly as it is first typed in .
If he does not agree with the Tab command 's choice of indentation , he can override it .
Because the indentation function must understand the syntax of the programming language being edited , each language requires a separate indentation function .
It is the job of the major mode for each programming language to redefine the Tab character to run an appropriate indenter .
Users can always use the same command to indent , no matter what sort of program they are editing .
In addition , another editing command can do indentation by calling the current definition of Tab as a subroutine .
( One such function is the one which indents several consecutive lines . )
Conventions such as this are vital , in an extensible system , for enabling unrelated extensions to avoid interacting wrong ; one user can write an indentation function for a new language , while another user writes new language - independent operations for requesting indentation , and the two automatically work properly together .
Languages which have support for indentation include Lisp , Pascal , PL/I , Bliss , BCPL , Muddle and TECO .
Comprehension of the user 's program reaches its greatest heights for Lisp programs , because the simplicity of Lisp syntax makes intelligent editing operations easier to implement , while the complexity of other languages discourages their users from implementing similar operations for them .
In fact , EMACS offers most of the same facilities as editors such as the Interlisp editor which operate on list structure , but combined with display editing .
The simple syntax of Lisp , together with the powerful editing features made possible by that simple syntax , add up to a more convenient programming system than is practical with other languages .
Lisp and extensible editors are made for each other , in this way .
We will see below that this is not the only way .
Large programs are composed of many functions divided among many files .
It is often hard to remember which file a given function is in .
An EMACS extension called the TAGS package knows how to keep track of this .
The TAGS package makes use of a file called a tag table , which records each function in the program , stating what file it is defined in and at what position in the file .
The tag table is made by running a special program named TAGS , which is not part of EMACS .
Once the tag table is loaded into EMACS , the command Meta -- Period ( 2 ) finds the definition of any function , using the information in the tag table to select the proper file and find the function in it .
The positions within the source file , remembered in the tag table , are used to find the function in the file instantly .
Changing the file makes the remembered positions inaccurate .
If this has happened , Meta -- Period searches in both directions away from the remembered position until it finds the definition .
So small inaccuracies cause only slight delays .
When many new functions have been added , or moved from one file to another , the TAGS program can reprocess the tag table into an updated one .
To make this more automatic , the tag table also remembers which language each source file is written in .
This information is needed for recognizing the function definitions in the file .
Interactiveness is useful in many activities aside from editing text .
For example , reading and replying to mail from other users ought to be interactive .
Many of these activities occasionally involve text editing : for example , editing the text of a reply .
If a special editor is implemented for the purpose , it can easily be much more work to write than all the rest of the system .
It is easier to write the other interactive system within the framework of an extensible editor .
EMACS has two extensions , RMAIL and BABYL , for reading mail .
Commands in RMAIL and BABYL are not like EMACS commands ; typical commands include ` D ' for `delete this message ' , and ` R ' for `reply to this message ' .
Editing the text of the reply is done with ordinary EMACS commands .
DIRED is used for editing a file directory .
The normal editing commands , as extended , can be used to move the cursor through the directory listing .
Other special commands defined only in DIRED delete , move , compare or examine the file whose name is under the cursor .
The INFO extension is designed for reading tree - structured documentation files .
These files are divided textually into nodes , which contain text representing pointers to other nodes .
INFO displays one node at a time , and INFO commands move from one node to another by following the pointers .
The primary components of the EMACS system are the text manipulation and I/O primitives , the interpreter , the command dispatcher , the library system , and the display processor .
The text and I/O primitives are used to operate on the text under the command of the program .
The interpreter executes programs , using the primitives when called for .
The command dispatcher remembers which program corresponds to each possible input character ; it reads a character from the terminal and calls the associated function .
The library system associates functions with their names and documentation , and allows groups of related functions to be loaded quickly together .
The display processor updates the screen to match the text as changed by the text primitives ; it is run whenever there is nothing else to do .
An EMACS system actually implements two different languages , the editing language and the programming language .
The editing language contains the commands users use for changing text .
These commands are implemented by programs written in the programming language .
When we speak of the interpreter , we mean the one which implements the programming language .
The editing language is implemented by the command dispatcher .
Previous attempts at programmable editors have usually attempted to mix programming constructs and editing in one language .
TECO is the primary example of this sort of design .
It has the advantage that once the user knows how to edit with the system , he need only learn the programming constructs to begin programming as well .
However , there are considerable disadvantages , because what is good in an editor command language is ugly , hard to read , and grossly inefficient as a programming language .
A good interactive editing language is composed primarily of single character commands , with a few commands that introduce longer names for less frequently used operations .
As a programming language , it is unreadable if the editor is to be customizable , the user must be able to redefine each character .
This in a programming language would be intolerable !
When the programming language is the editing language , the built - in editing commands and the primitive operations they use have to be written in another language .
Then the user cannot change part of the standard system slightly by making a small change to its definition ; it has to be reimplemented from scratch as a macro .
Since the primitives available are only the commands he uses for editing , this will often be impossible because the necessary primitives will be internal routines that the user cannot call .
The primitives that an extension would like to use are not always the same as the editing operations the user wants .
The implementor of a macro processor is encouraged to ignore such deficiencies because he himself does not use the language in implementing the rest of the system .
Since it is traditional , in designing a macro language , to ignore the standards of readability , power and robustness typically applied to the design of programming languages , these deficiencies are usually considerable .
The original TECO is a good example of this sort of problem .
In EMACS , each language is designed for its purpose .
The editing language has single - character redefinable commands .
The programming language is TECO , modified and extended to be more suitable for writing well - structured and robust programs , and to provide the primitives needed by editing programs as opposed to editor users .
It remains hard to read , so the descendents of EMACS generally use Lisp instead .
TECO was used only for reasons of historical convenience .
More information on the requirements extensibility imposes on the system 's programming language is in the next chapter .
An important part of any practical extensible system is the ability to use more than one extension at one time , and begin using an additional extension at any time .
Extensions should be able to override or replace parts of the standard system , or previous extensions .
In EMACS the library system is responsible for accomplishing this .
An EMACS library is a collection of function names , definitions and documentation that can be loaded into an EMACS in mid-session .
Libraries are read - only and position - independent , so that they can be loaded just by incorporating them into the virtual memory of the EMACS .
This allows all EMACSs using a library to share the physical memory .
Each library contains its own symbol table which connects function names with definitions , and also with their documentation strings .
Libraries are generated from source files in which each function definition is accompanied by its documentation ; this encourages all functions to be documented .
When a function name is looked up , all the loaded libraries are searched , most recently loaded first .
For the sake of uniformity , the standard EMACS functions also reside in a library , which is always the first one loaded .
Therefore , any library can override or replace the definition of a standard EMACS function with a new definition , which will be used everywhere in place of the old .
This , together with the fact that EMACS is constructed with explicit function calls to named subroutines at many points , makes it easy for the user to change parts of the system in a modular fashion without replacing it all .
Subroutines are normally called by their full names .
The user can also call any command by name , and many commands are primarily intended to be used in that way .
However , the most common editing operations need to be more easily accessible .
This is the purpose of the command dispatcher , which reads one character and looks it up in the dispatch table , a vector of definitions to find the function to be called ( the definition - object , not the name ) .
Functions residing in the dispatch table can be invoked either by the character command or by name .
A function which does not appear in the dispatch table can be called only by name .
The user calls functions by name by means of a single - character command ( Meta - - X ) whose definition is to read the name of a function and call that function .
Each user has his own patterns of use .
Many functions in EMACS are accessible only by name because we expect most users to use them infrequently .
If a particular user uses one such command often , he can place the definition in the dispatch table using the function Set Key .
The function calling conventions are designed so that almost any function definition will behave reasonably if called by the command dispatcher .
If a function tries to read a string argument from its caller , then when called by the command dispatcher it will automatically prompt and read the argument from the terminal instead .
( 3 )
Some libraries contain functions that are intended to be called with single character commands .
The library can arrange to place those functions ' definitions in the dispatch table by defining a function called Setup .
This will be called automatically when the library is loaded , and it can redefine character commands as needed .
However , because EMACS is intended to be customized , no library can reasonably make the assumption that a function belongs on a particular character without allowing the user who loads the library to override that assumption .
For example , a library might wish to redefine Control -- S on the assumption that it invokes the search function , but a user might prefer to keep his search on Control - - T instead , and he might prefer that same library to alter the definition of Control - - T when loaded by him .
The author of the library cannot anticipate the details of such idiosyncrasies , but he can provide for them all by following a convention : in the Setup function of the library ( TAGS , say ) , he checks for a variable called TAGS Setup Hook , and if it exists , its value is called as a function instead of the usual setting up .
The display processor is the part of EMACS which maintains on the display screen an up - to - date image of the text inside the editor .
Since the size of the screen is limited , only a portion or `window ' can be shown .
The display processor prefers to continue to start its display at the same point in the file , so as to minimize the amount of changes necessary to the screen .
However , the text where the editor 's own cursor is located must appear on the screen so that the terminal 's cursor can show where it is .
This sometimes forces a new window position to be computed .
The user can also command changes in the window position , moving the text up or down on the screen .
The EMACS display processor embodies an unusual principle which makes for much faster responses to the user : display updating has lower priority than cogitation .
Most display editors change the display after each user command .
This is the simplest strategy to implement , since each command knows precisely how it has changed the text .
But it is very inefficient , not just of the computer 's time , but of the user 's time , because it makes the user wait for the completion of display updates that have already been made obsolete by further commands waiting to be executed .
Here is an example of the problem .
If the user types Carriage Return to create a new line , all the lines below that point need to be redisplayed in their new positions .
While this is still going on , if he types an additional Carriage Return to create another new line , the rest of the display update is obsolete ; there is no use displaying the rest of the lines in their second positions , only to display them again in their third positions .
( 4 )
The EMACS display processor is best understood as being a separate , lower priority process that runs in parallel with the editing process .
The editing process reads keyboard input and makes changes in the text .
The display process is always trying to change the screen to match the text ; it keeps a record of what is on the screen , and in each cycle of operation finds one discrepancy between the editing buffer and the screen record and corrects it .
After each cycle , the display process can be pre-empted by the editing process , which has higher priority .
The display process can be thought of as chasing an arbitrarily moving target , the edited text , with a speed limited by the terminal baud rate .
Multiple processes are not actually used in the implementation .
Instead , after each line of display output , the display processor updates its data base and polls for input .
An additional benefit of this input - before - output philosophy is that it uses less computer resources when the system is heavily loaded .
When not enough computer power is available , EMACS gets behind in processing the user 's input .
When the first command is completed , more input is available , so no effort is put into display updating yet .
By saving computer time this way , EMACS eventually catches up with the user and does its display updating all at once .
Since display updating is not necessarily done at the same time as the editing operation which necessitates it , display updating cannot be the responsibility of the editing command itself .
Instead , the display update must be done by somehow comparing the new text with the previous displayed text , or information about it .
In EMACS , each editing command returns information on the range of text it has changed , but aside from that the display processor operates independently .
This is good for extensibility as well : it is easier to write or change an editing command if it does not have to contain algorithms for updating the screen .
Because the TECO language is not very efficient , the display processor had to be written in assembler language to get adequate performance .
This is unfortunate because extensions to the display processor could be very valuable .
In later implementations of EMACS , the display processor is written in Lisp along with the editing commands , and can be extended .
Despite its syntactic obscurity , TECO is actually one of the best languages to use for implementing an extensible editor .
This is because most traditional programming languages simply cannot do the job !
Implementing an extensible system of any sort requires features that they intrinsically lack .
Specifically , it requires a language with an interpreter and the ability for programs to access the interpreter 's data structures ( such as function definitions ) .
Adherents of non-Lisp programming languages often conceive of implementing an EMACS for their own computer system using PASCAL , PL/I , C , etc .
In fact , it is simply impossible to implement an extensible system in such languages .
This is because their designs and implementations are batch - oriented ; a program must be compiled and then linked before it can be run .
An on - line extensible system must be able to accept and then execute new code while it is running .
This eliminates most popular programming languages except Lisp , APL and Snobol .
At the same time , Lisp 's interpreter and its ability to treat functions as data are exactly what we need .
( 5 )
A system written in PL / I or PASCAL can be modified and recompiled , but such an extension becomes a separate version of the entire program .
The user must choose , before invoking the program , which version he wants .
Combining two independent extensions requires comparing and merging the source files .
These obstacles usually suffice to discourage all extension .
The only way to implement an extensible system using an unsuitable language , is to write an interpreter for a suitable language and then use that one .
Prime is now implementing an EMACS using a simple Lisp written in PL / I .
This technique works because an editor does not require a very efficient interpreter ; even the most straightforward Lisp interpreter is more efficient than the TECO interpreter which is empirically observed to be good enough .
I would not regard this as implementation `in ' the original language , however .
A PASCAL or PL / I implementation which uses an interpreter , and allows the user program to access the interpreter data structures sufficiently , could be used just as a Lisp implementation would be used .
However , such implementations are very rare , because these languages are not designed for them .
If the implementor appreciates the importance of the interpreter , and of treating functions as data , he will usually choose to implement Lisp .
It is also possible to use dynamic linking -- the ability to load additional modules of compiled code during execution , and refer to subroutines therein by name -- in place of an interpreter .
However , dynamic linking operating systems are rarer than good Lisps , harder to implement , and not as convenient for the job .
One of the few such operating systems , Multics , has an EMACS written in Lisp .
SINE , the EMACS implementation on Interdata computers , uses dynamic linking to load files compiled from a language which resembles Lisp .
When a language is used for implementing extensible systems , certain control structure and data structure features become vital .
One difference between Lisp ( and TECO ) and most other programming languages , which is very important in writing extensible systems , is that variable names are retained at run time ; they are not lost in compilation .
In typical compiled languages , variable names are meaningful only at compile time .
In the compiled code , uses of one variable name become references to one location in memory , but the name itself has been discarded .
By contrast , Lisp remembers the connection between variable names and their values , so that new programs can be defined .
Global variables are essential for parameters used for customization .
EMACS has a variable named Comment Start which controls the string recognized as starting a comment in the text being edited .
Its value is supposed to be that string .
This variable is used by the comment indenting command to recognize an existing comment .
The fact that the variable name is known at run time enables the user to
ask to see the value of the string .
change the string .
define or redefine major modes , for various programming languages which change the string .
define or redefine comment - manipulation commands , which refer to the variable so that they will work on text in various languages .
Most batch languages use a lexical scope rule for variable names .
Each variable can be referred to legally only within the syntactic construct which defines the variable .
Lisp and TECO use a dynamic scope rule , which means that each binding of a variable is visible in all subroutine calls to all levels , unless other bindings override .
For example , after
( defun foo1 ( x ) ( foo2 ) ) ( defun foo2 ( ) (+ x 5 ) )
then ( foo1 2 ) returns 7 , because foo2 when called within foo1 uses foo1 's value of x .
If foo2 is called directly , however , it refers to the caller 's value of x , or the global value .
We say that foo1 binds the variable x .
All subroutines called by foo1 see the binding made by foo1 , instead of the global binding , which we say is shadowed temporarily until foo1 returns .
In PASCAL the analogous ; program would be erroneous , because foo2 has no lexically visible definition of x .
Dynamic scope is useful .
Consider the function Edit Picture , which is used to change certain editing commands slightly , temporarily , so that they are more convenient for editing text which is arranged into two - dimensional pictures .
For example , printing characters are changed to replace existing text instead of shoving it over to the right .
Edit Picture works by binding the values of parameter variables dynamically , and then calling the editor as a subroutine .
The editor `exit ' command causes a return to the Edit Picture subroutine , which returns immediately to the outer invocation of the editor .
In the process , the dynamic variable bindings are unmade .
Dynamic binding is especially useful for elements of the command dispatch table .
For example , the RMAIL command for composing a reply to a message temporarily defines the character Control -- Meta --Y to insert the text of the original message into the reply .
The function which implements this command is always defined , but Control -- Meta -- Y does not call that function except while a reply is being edited .
The reply command does this by dynamically binding the dispatch table entry for Control -- Meta --Y and then calling the editor as a subroutine .
When the recursive invocation of the editor returns , the text as edited by the user is sent as a reply .
It is not necessary for dynamic scope to be the only scope rule provided , just useful for it to be available .
Some language designers believe that dynamic binding should be avoided , and explicit argument passing should be used instead .
Imagine that function A binds the variable FOO , and calls the function B , which calls the function C , and C uses the value of FOO .
Supposedly A should pass the value as an argument to B , which should pass it as an argument to C .
This can not be done in an extensible system , however , because the author of the system cannot know what all the parameters will be .
Imagine that the functions A and C are part of a user extension , while B is part of the standard system .
The variable FOO does not exist in the standard system ; it is part of the extension .
To use explicit argument passing would require adding a new argument to B , which means rewriting B and everything that calls B .
In the most common case , B is the editor command dispatcher loop , which is called from an awful number of places .
What 's worse , C must also be passed an additional argument .
B does n't refer to C by name ( C did not exist when B was written ) .
It probably finds a pointer to C in the command dispatch table .
This means that the same call which sometimes calls C might equally well call any editor command definition .
So all the editing commands must be rewritten to accept and ignore the additional argument .
By now , none of the original system is left !
Suppose one file is formatted with comments starting at column 50 .
Editing this file is easier if the variable Comment Column , which is used ( by convention ) to decide where to align comments , is always set to 50 whenever this file is being editing .
EMACS provides a way to request this ; but since it also provides the feature of visiting several files at once , it must take special care to keep each file 's variables straight .
Suppose one file wants Comment Column to be 50 while another is formatted with 40 ?
This is solved by allowing each file to have its own local values for any set of variables .
Specially formatted text at the end of the file specifies them :
Local Modes : Comment Column:50 End :
When a file is brought into EMACS , this local modes list is parsed and the variables and values remembered in a local symbol table .
While the file is not selected , its local symbol table contains the local values of the variables .
While a file is selected , its local symbol table contains the global values , and the real symbol table contains the file 's local values instead .
When an extensible system allows the user to provide a function to be called on certain well - defined occasions , we call it a hook .
For example , we have already mentioned the hook which is executed whenever a certain library is loaded ; for the TAGS library , the hook is named TAGS Setup Hook .
Another important class of hooks is executed when a major mode is entered .
Each major mode has its own hook .
For example , Text mode 's hook is named Text Mode Hook .
This hook can be used to request arbitrary actions in advance for each time text mode is entered .
Many users always define this hook to turn on Auto Fill mode , so that Auto Fill mode is always on when Text mode is .
Hooks can be associated with variables as well .
Then , each time the value of the variable changes , its hook is run .
Usually these hooks are used to change other data structures so that they always correspond to the value of the variable .
This is often more efficient and more modular than checking the variable itself whenever its value is relevant .
For example , changing the value of Auto Fill Mode to turn auto - filling on or off calls a function which automatically redefines the Space character 's command definition .
Some hooks are attached to specific points within the interpreter or display processor .
For example , there is a hook which is called whenever it is time to read a character of input from the terminal .
The hook program can supply the character itself .
These hooks can be thought of as compensating for the fact that some parts of the system are written in assembler language and cannot simply be redefined by the user .
A system for programming editor commands needs more sophisticated facilities for handling errors and other exceptional conditions than most programming systems provide .
Let us consider what an error is , and what ought to happen when there is an error .
First of all , what exactly is an error ?
Sometimes the user asks to do something that can not be done ( a user error ) .
Sometimes a program asks to do something which can not be done ( a program error ) .
Program errors often accompany user errors , but either one can happen without the other .
Program errors can be defined objectively : any event which executes a certain part of the interpreter is a program error .
User errors cannot be defined objectively in this way because they are a matter of attitude toward events rather than events themselves .
If a command has done nothing , we can regard this either as the response to an error or as normal functioning .
And this choice of attitude has no necessary connection with whether the command definition required special code to make it do nothing in the circumstances in question .
When a program error happens , EMACS prints the error message and then gives the user the chance to invoke the error handler to debug it .
If he does not do this , control returns to the innermost error return point .
Programs can create error return points with a special construct .
( We use a Lisp - style syntax in these examples for clarity ) .
( error -return ( arbitrary - code - here ) )
The end of the error - return construct becomes an error return point which is in effect while the code inside the construct is being executed .
Error returns are usually used by loops which read and execute commands of some sort , including the built - in one which reads and displays editing commands .
( do - forever ( error- return ( read- and - execute - one - command ) ) )
Sometimes interpreted functions are called asynchronously or unpredictably .
An example is the one which optionally saves the text every so often to reduce the amount lost if the system crashes .
If this function gets a program error , it should notify the user , but should not interfere in any way with the user 's explicit commands .
This requires a construct known in Lisp as errset , which prevents all normal processing of errors that occur within it .
An error occurring within an errset does nothing but return control immediately to the end of the errset .
The programming system does not provide any such uniform handling for user errors because the concept of a user error is not defined at that level .
Instead , the designer of each editing command must decide what conditions ought to be considered errors , and what to do in each case .
Sometimes the command simply does nothing .
Sometimes it rings the terminal 's bell and perhaps throws away type ahead .
This can be best if we expect that , once the user is told that there is something wrong , it will be obvious what it is .
When the cause of the error is less obvious , causing a program error deliberately with a specially chosen error message is a good way of informing him .
A special primitive is used to cause a program error with an arbitrary specified error message so that the error - return processing can be invoked .
Sometimes the user error leads naturally to an error in the program , which may be all the handling it needs .
This can be so if the program error 's error message is an adequate explanation for the user , or if the situation is not deemed likely enough to deserve the effort required to make anything else happen .
The error handler for debugging program errors is an interpreted program itself .
This is possible because primitives are provided for examining the function call stack and all other data structures which the programmer would want to examine while debugging .
Users have actually written extensions and complete replacements for the standard error handler program .
Returning to the example of the user - written command loop , there has to be a command to exit the loop .
How can it be done ?
( do - forever ( error- return ( read- and - execute - one - command ) ) )
We do it by means of a non-local control transfer .
We create the transfer point by means of a catch construct around the loop .
The catch creates a named transfer point at the end of the loop , which is accessible only within the loop .
( catch ( do - forever ( error- return ( read- and - execute - one - command ) ) ) exit - my - loop )
At any time during the loop , execution of ( throw exit - my - loop ) transfers control immediately to the end of the catch , thus exiling the loop .
The catch and throw constructs were copied from Maclisp .
Like variable names , catch names have dynamic scope : the program can throw to a catch from any of the subroutines called while inside the catch .
This is important because ease of extension dictates that each command which the command - reading loop understands be implemented by a separate function , so that the user can redefine one command without replacing the framework of the loop .
( 6 )
A complex program is much easier to learn if it can answer questions about how to use it .
When the program is customizable , it is important for the answers to reflect any customization that has been done .
The easiest way to do this is for questions to be answered based on the same tables and data structures that control the functioning of the system .
In EMACS , these include the command dispatch table and the loaded libraries .
The most basic kind of question that a user might want to ask is , " What does this command do ? "
He can inquire about either a function name or a command character .
A library contains a documentation string for each function in it , and this is used to answer the question .
When the question is about a command character , the dispatch table is used to find the function object which is currently the definition of that character .
Then the library system is used to find the name of the function , and then , from that , the documentation string .
The ability to ask what a certain command does only helps users who know what commands to ask about .
Other users need to ask , " What commands might help me now ? " EMACS attempts to answer this by listing all the functions whose names contain a given substring .
Since the function names tend to summarize what the functions do ( such as ` Forward Word ' or ` Indent for Comment ' ) and follow systematic conventions , this is usually enough .
The list also contains the first line of each function 's own documentation , and how to invoke the function with one or two characters , if that is possible .
The documentation for a function is usually just a string of text , but it can also contain programs to be executed to print the documentation , interspersed with text to be printed literally .
This comes in handy when the description of one function refers to another function which is usually accessed as a one or two character command .
It is better to tell the user the short command , which he would actually use , than the name of the function which defines it .
But exactly which command -- if any -- runs the function in question depends on the user 's customization .
What we do is to use a program , in the middle of the documentation string , which searches the dispatch table and prints the command which would invoke the desired function .
Another application of this facility is for functions which simply load a library and call a function in it .
The documentation string for such functions is a program to load the library and print the documentation of the function which would be called .
To help users remember how to ask these questions , we make it simple and standard .
A special character , called the Help character , is used .
This character is only used for asking for help , and is always available .
Help is normally followed by another character which specifies the type of inquiry .
If the user does not remember these characters , he can type Help again to see a list of them .
To close the remaining loophole of confusion , EMACS prints a message about the Help character each time it starts up .
Help is also available in the middle of typing a command .
For example , if you start to type the Replace String command and forget what arguments are required , type Help .
The documentation of the Replace String function will be printed to tell you what to do next .
Because questions are answered based on the data structures as they are at the moment , many changes in EMACS require no extra effort to update the documentation .
It is only necessary to update the documentation of each function whose definition is changed .
The format for EMACS library source files encourages this by requiring a documentation string for every function , between the function name and its definition .
I began the development of EMACS in 1974 with an improvement to TECO : the implementation of the display processor and a command dispatcher with a small fixed set of commands .
These were inspired by the editor E of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab .
They were not considered a new editor , but rather one new feature in TECO to join many existing features .
The user would give the TECO command Control - R to enter display editing mode , whose commands were suitable only for making local changes to the file .
He would exit display editing mode to do anything else .
But once display editing was implemented , it was fairly easy to allow commands to be redefined to call functions written in TECO .
TECO already contained considerable facilities for text manipulation , I/O , and programming , so almost immediately many users began to implement large collections of editing commands , powerful enough to do every part of editing .
One of the most popular of these systems was TECMAC .
Others included MACROS , RMODE , TMACS , Russ - mode and DOC .
The need to exit from display editing mode to use TECO directly became less and less frequent until new users no longer learned how .
But TECO was still missing many at the important control and programming constructs which allow programs to be readable and maintainable ( for example , named functions and variables ! ) .
So the early TECO - based display editors were very hard to maintain .
In 1976 the TMACS system experimented with adding named functions and variables , with good results limited by the inefficiency of implementing them with TECO programs .
This inspired me to implement EMACS itself .
Writing EMACS involved simultaneously adding to TECO the features which make up the library system and self - documentation , which permitted a new readable programming style , and writing a new set of display editing commands using this style .
The design for the commands themselves was based on examining the command sets of the many TECO - based editors for inspiration , and choosing commands so that the most common operations would take few keystrokes .
The first operational EMACS system existed in late 1976 .
Since then , development has proceeded steadily , most new code being written in TECO .
New features are added to TECO itself only to speed up loops such as table searching and s-expression parsing , or to make possible new kinds of I /O or interface operations .
EMACS was developed on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP -- 10 computer using MIT 's own Incompatible Timesharing System .
By 1977 , outside interest in EMACS was sufficient to motivate Mike McMahon of SRI International to adapt it to Digital 's Twenex ( `Tops - - 20 ' ) operating system .
EMACS is now in use at about a hundred sites .
Several post-EMACS editor implementations have copied from EMACS both the specific command set and user interlace and the fundamental principle of being based on a programmable interpreter .
The motivation for these projects was to transfer the ideas of EMACS to other computer systems .
Two of them , now in use , are Multics EMACS , a Honeywell product , and ZWEI , the editor for the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lisp machine .
Because EMACS supplied the implementors with a clear idea of what was to be implemented , their focus was on making the foundations clean .
The essential improvement was the substitution of an excellent programming language , Lisp , for the makeshift extended TECO used in EMACS .
Lisp provides the necessary language features in a framework much cleaner than TECO .
Also , it is more efficient .
A Lisp interpreter is intrinsically more efficient than a string - scanning interpreter such as TECO's , and Lisp compilers are also available .
This efficiency is important not just for saving a few microseconds , but because it reduces the amount of the system which must be written in assembler language in order to obtain reasonable performance .
This opens more of the system to user extensions .
Another improvement has been in the data structure used to represent the editing buffer : Multics EMACS developed the technique of using a doubly - linked list of lines , each being a string .
This technique is used in ZWEI as well .
Many other editors imitate the EMACS command set and display updating philosophy without providing extensibility .
Despite that deficiency , and despite the greatly reduced set of features that results from it , these can be useful editors , though not as useful as an extensible one .
For a computer with a small address space or lacking virtual memory , this is probably the best that can be done .
( 7 )
The proliferation of such superficial facsimiles of EMACS has an unfortunate confusing effect : their users , knowing that they are using an imitation of EMACS , and never having seen EMACS itself , are led to believe that they are enjoying all the advantages of EMACS .
Since any real - time display editor is a tremendous improvement over what they probably had before , they believe this readily .
To prevent such confusion , we urge everyone to refer to a nonextensible imitation of EMACS as an ` Ersatz EMACS ' .
The conventional wisdom has it that when a program intended for multiple users is to be written , specifications should be designed in advance .
It this is not done , the result will be inferior .
The place to try anything new is in a research project which users will not see .
Some people know better than this , but they have been silenced .
The development of EMACS followed a path that most authorities would say is a direct route to disaster .
It was the continuous deformation of TECO into something which is totally unlike TECO , from the typical user 's point of view .
And during the whole process , TECO and programs containing TECO were the only text editors we had on ITS .
(8 ) Indeed , there are ways in which EMACS shows the results of not having been completely thought out in advance : such as , in being based on TECO rather than Lisp .
But it is still reliable enough to be widely used and imitated .
The disaster which would have been forecast has not occurred .
Instead , a new and powerful way of constructing editors has been explored and shown to be good .
I believe that this is no accident .
EMACS could not have been reached by a process of careful design , because such processes arrive only at goals which are visible at the outset , and whose desirability is established on the bottom line at the outset .
Neither I nor anyone else visualized an extensible editor until I had made one , nor appreciated its value until he had experienced it .
EMACS exists because I felt free to make individually useful small improvements on a path whose end was not in sight .
While there was no overall goal , each small change had a specific purpose in terms of improving the text editor in general use , and each step had to be individually well designed and reliable .
This helped to keep things on the right track .
Research projects with no users tend to improve the state of the art of writing research projects , rather than the state of the art of writing usable system tools .
The individual commands of EMACS benefited from a stage of unregulated experimentation also .
When the display processor and the capability for extension were created , many users began to write extensions , which developed into the complete editing environments of which EMACS is the most recent .
Each command in EMACS benefits from the experimentation by many different users customizing their editors in different ways since that time .
This experimentation was possible only because a programmable display editor existed .
New implementations of EMACS can now be carefully designed , because they have the advantage of hindsight based on the original EMACS .
However , the implementor must carefully restrict his careful design to the parts of the editor that are already well understood .
To go beyond the original EMACS , he must experiment .
But why is n't such a program of exploration doomed to be sidetracked by a blind alley , which will be unrecognized until too late ?
It is the extensibility , and a flexibility of mind , which solves this problem : many alleys will be tried at once , and blind alleys can be backed out of with minimal real loss .
The traditional attitude towards Lisp holds that it is useful only for esoteric amusements and Artificial Intelligence .
The appearance of Multics EMACS as a Honeywell product is the death knell of this view .
Now , a mainframe manufacturer is offering a system utility program written in Lisp ; a program intended for heavy use by the general user community .
The special properties of Lisp , which make extensibility possible , are a key feature , even though many of the users will not be programmers .
Lisp has escaped from the ivory tower forever , and is a force to be reckoned with as a system programming language .
The programmable editor is an outstanding opportunity to learn to program !
A beginner can see the effect of his simple program on the text he is editing ; this feedback is fast and in an easily understood form .
Educators have found display programming to be very suited for children experimenting with programming , for just this reason ( see LOGO ) .
Programming editor commands has the additional advantage that a program need not be very large to be tangibly useful in editing .
A first project can be very simple .
One can thus slide very smoothly from using the editor to edit into learning to program with it .
When large numbers of nontechnical workers are using a programmable editor , they will he tempted constantly to begin programming in the course of their day - to - day lives .
This should contribute greatly to computer literacy , especially because many of the people thus exposed will be secretaries taught by society that they are incapable of doing mathematics , and unable to imagine for a moment that they can learn to program .
But that wo n't stop them from learning it if they do n't know that it is programming that they are learning !
According to Bernard Greenberg , this is already happening with Multics EMACS .
The way EMACS records what remains on the screen , and compares it with what is now in the text being edited , is determined by the representation used for that text .
The post -EMACS editors use better text representations that make for easier display updating algorithms .
The representation used in EMACS is a straightforward linear string of characters .
A movable gap which can grow and shrink makes it unnecessary for insertion and deletion within a small region of the file to move half of the file up and down .
The gap was essential in making it practical to insert characters one at a time , instead of en masse in an `insert ' command , but aside from that it is made invisible at all but the lowest levels of software , so essentially the representation is just a linear string .
It is the task of the display processor 's auxiliary data to make sense out of the amorphous mass of text .
The lowest level of avoiding wasteful output is a checksum of the characters displayed on each line of the screen .
It a screen line is about to be rewritten , the new and old checksums are compared .
If they match , the rewriting is skipped .
Once in every 2^36 times this will leave old incorrect text on the screen .
Higher levels of display optimization work by preserving information which is a byproduct of writing the display - - namely , where in the text string the beginning of each screen line comes -- and combining it with information which localizes the regions of the text string in which alteration has taken place .
This allows it to restrict display update processing to a horizontal band of screen which contains all the necessary changes ( often just one line ) .
While processing the other lines on the screen would do no actual output , because of the checksums , even the time to compute the checksums is noticeable to the user as a delay .
The same information can be used to decide when some lines on the screen should be moved up or down .
When lines are inserted in the middle of the screen , it is much better to scroll the following lines downward ( if the terminal can do this ) than to rewrite them all in their new positions .
The record of where in the text string changes have taken place is maintained by requiring every command to return values saying what part of the string it has changed .
It can identify a subinterval of the string which contains all the changes made , it can say that no change was made ( though the cursor may have been moved ) , or it can say nothing , which requires the display processor to make no assumptions .
A better way , developed by Bernard Greenberg in Multics EMACS and used in ZWEI , is to represent the buffer as a doubly - linked list containing pointers to strings , one for each line .
Newline characters are not actually present , but implicitly appear after each line except the last .
This requires the lowest level insert , delete and search subroutines to be more complicated ( for example , inserting a string cannot treat Newline characters like other characters ) , but this is just a finite amount of complexity ; and it greatly simplifies efficient display computations .
The state of the screen can be remembered in an array of pointers to the string that was displayed on each screen line .
When the display is updated , one can compare the strings in the buffer with the strings in the display , both to see whether they are the same objects ( the pointers are equal ; EQ , in Lisp ) , and to see whether their contents are the same .
Multics EMACS never changes the contents of a string in the buffer .
It creates new strings to replace the old ones when the text changes .
Thus , the string pointers in the screen state continue to record the screen as it was .
ZWEI does change the contents of existing strings .
To make sure that it does not fail to notice that the text no longer matches the screen , ZWEI maintains a `clock ' which increments each time a change is made in the text .
Each line records the clock tick of the last modification .
Each screen line records the clock tick as of the time it was displayed .
If the line in the text matches the line in the screen record , but the tick counts do not match , then the contents of the line have been changed .
Line list representations also eliminate the requirements on commands to say what they have changed .
Reducing the need for the programmer to worry about how display will be done is very desirable .
Another advantage is that it becomes feasible to have pointers to characters in the text which relocate when insertions or deletions are done , so that they continue to point to the same place in the text .
An EMACS sharable library contains , first of all , a symbol table which can be binary searched for the name of an object to find the object named .
The symbol table points at both the names and the definitions using offsets from the beginning of the file , so that the file can be valid at any location in memory .
The names and definitions are all examples of the TECO string data type , in the internal TECO format , so that the library does not need to be translated or parsed in any way when it is loaded .
The symbol table points to the documentation of functions in the library as well as their definitions .
The documentation for the function Visit File is an object entered in the symbol table with the name ~ Doc~ Visit File .
There is also a string named ~ Directory ~ whose definition contains a list of the names of all the objects in the file which the library wishes to advertise .
This is used for documentation purposes , not for looking up names , and it does not contain names of auxiliary objects such as ~ Doc~ V1 sit File or ~ D1rectory ~ .
It is possible to search the symbol table in reverse , to take a definition and find its name .
Since one can tell which library an object is in by comparing its address with the range of memory occupied by the library , this makes it possible to find the name of any object which has one .
The ability to do this is important , because when the user asks what the character Control - K does , it is desirable to be able to tell him that it runs the function Kill Line .
The names themselves are not kept in the dispatch table because looking up a name in the loaded libraries is slow .
For other implementations , that is a reasonable strategy .
EMACS is available for distribution to sites running the Digital Equipment Corporation Twenex ( `Tops - 20 ' ) operating system .
It is distributed on a basis of communal sharing , which means that all improvements must be given back to me to be incorporated and distributed .
Those who are interested should contact me .
Further information about how EMACS works is available in the same way .

Multics EMACS
Multics EMACS was written in MacLisp by Bernard S. Greenberg of Honeywell 's Cambridge Information Systems Lab , starting in 1978 .
When first implemented , it could be used only by its author , because he alone had the necessary privileges to patch the Multics operating system so that a program could read one character from the keyboard instead of waiting for a complete line .
After seeing the new editor in operation , the other Honeywell people were convinced to make the feature generally available .
Because it is written in Lisp , Multics EMACS is even more extensible than the original EMACS , and as a result it has accumulated even more powerful features .

However , the user can load his own compiled files into a running editor .
This design was chosen because of the small address space of the machine , an Interdata at the MIT Architecture Machine Group .
See Owen T.Anderson , The Design and Implementation of a Display - Oriented Editor Writing System , Undergraduate Thesis , MIT Physics Department , January 1979 .
TECMAC TECMAC was the first editor implemented in TECO to work with the display processor .
It developed many of the ideas used in the EMACS user interface .
It was retired because , written when TECO was less suited to system programming , it was unable to attain either readability or efficiency .
TECMAC was maintained from 1974 to 1976 by John L. Kulp and Richard L. Bryan .
TECO PDP -- 10 TECO was originally written by Richard Greenblatt , Stew Nelson and Jack Holloway at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab , based on PDP -- 1 TECO which was written by Murphy in 1962 .
The TECO in which EMACS is implemented is its direct descendant .
The PDP -- 10 TECO from Digital , a typical example of TECO , is also a descendant of an early version from MIT .
It is documented in Digital Equipment Corporation , DECsystem - 10 TECO Programmer 's Reference Manual , DEC --10-- ETEE --D ( revised from time to time ) .
Ordinary TECO lacks many important programming constructs .
In MIT TECO , the constructs may be syntactically ugly , but they exist .
So programs can be well organized , and clean except in the lowest level of detail .
TMACS TMACS was an editor implemented in TECO which began to develop the idea of the sharable library with commands that could be assigned to keys by the user .
TMACS was the project of Dave Moon , Charles Frankston , Earl A. Killian , and Eugene C. Ciccarelli .
Interestingly , it had no standard command set .
The implementors were unable to agree on one , which is what motivated them to work on making customization easier .
ZWEI ZWEI ( `ZWEI Was EINE Initially ' ) is the editor for the Lisp machine .
EINE ( `EINE Is Not EMACS ' ) , the former editor for the Lisp machine , was also based on EMACS ; it was operational for late 1977 and 1978 , and was redone to make it cleaner .
Both EINE and ZWEI are primarily the work of Daniel Weinreb and Mike McMahon ; see Daniel L. Weinreb , A Real - Time Display - oriented Editor for the LISP Machine , Undergraduate Thesis , MIT EECS Department , January 1979 .
Augment Augment ( formerly known as NLS ) is a display editor whose interesting feature is its ability to structure files into trees .
Making the tree structure useful required the concept of the viewspec , which specifies that only certain levels in the tree structure will be visible .
This is the sort of feature which cannot be added by a user to EMACS , because it involves modification of the display processor ; but it could be added by a user to Multics EMACS or ZWEI .
Augment popularized the graphical input device known as the `mouse ' , which is a small box with wheels or balls on the bottom and buttons on the top , which the user moves on the table with his hand .
This device has been copied widely because of its simplicity and low cost .
Augment was designed at SRI International but is now supplied by Tymshare .

Bravo Bravo comes from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center .
Its orientation is toward text formatting , and it can display multiple fonts , underlining , etc .
It makes heavy use of a graphical pointing device , the `mouse ' ( see Augment ) .
It is not programmable and offers no special help for editing programs as opposed to text .
For more information , see your local industrial espionage agent .
E
The editor used at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab , E interfaces with a `line editor ' ( used to edit within a line , on a display terminal ) which can also be employed to edit the input to any other program .
The line editor does not allow commands to be redefined ; since it is part of the timesharing system , that is not trivial ( though possible in principle ) .
E allows macros to be written using the same language used for editing .
These are as powerful as a Turing machine , and as easy to program with .
See the on - line documentation file ` E.ALS [ UP , DOC ] ' of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .
TRIX TRIX is a language similar to TRAC designed at Lawrence Livermore Lab specifically for writing editors .
It has been used to write commands that are specific to particular languages , and to write text formatters .
Its fatal flaw is that it was designed for printing terminals .
See Cecil , Moll and Rinde , TRIX AC : A Set of General Purpose Text Editing Commands , Lawrence Livermore Lab UCID 30040 , March 1977 .
TVEDIT TVEDIT is a distant relative of E ( above ) which is used at Stanford on the Twenex and Tenex operating systems .
These systems do not provide a line editor , so TVEDIT has its own facilities for changes within lines .
TVEDIT is a good example of a generally reasonable but nonprogrammable display editor .

The Lisp Machine The MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory has built a machine specifically for the purpose of running large Lisp programs more cheaply than ever before .
One of its goals is to make the entire software system interactively extensible by writing it in Lisp and allowing the user to redefine the functions composing the innards of the system .
Part of the system is an EMACS - like editor ( ZWEI ; see above ) written entirely in Lisp , which shares in this extensibility .

Footnotes
EMACS stood for Editing Macros , before we realized that EMACS is composed of functions written in a programming language rather than macros in the editor TECO .
Meta is the name of a shift key on the ideal EMACS terminal .
On terminals which do not have this key , the ASCII character Escape is used as a prefix instead .
The process of reading the argument from the terminal is implemented by a function which the user can replace .
This particular sequence of events poses no problem on terminals which can move text up and down on the screen .
But the same problem can still result from other events .
It is o.k. to use a Lisp compiler , if there is one .
What counts is not using the interpreter all the time , but having it available all the time .
Normally the command reading loop uses the name of the command to compute the name of the function to call .
For example , if RMAIL reads the letter N as a command , it calls the function # RMAIL N .
This way the user can easily define new commands .
The standard EMACS system is bigger than the entire 64 k - byte address space of the PDP - - 11 , despite constant strenuous efforts to reduce its size .
And TECO is equally large .
The post -EMACS editors are even larger .

A Skeptical Look at Karl Popper
The following essay was published in Skeptical Inquirer ( 2001 ) .
by Martin Gardner
" Sir Karl Popper / Perpetrated a whopper /
When he boasted to the world that he and he alone / Had toppled Rudolf Carnap from his Vienna Circle throne . "  a clerihew by Armand T. Ringer
ir Karl Popper , who died in 1994 , was widely regarded as England 's greatest philosopher of science since Bertrand Russell .
Indeed a philosopher of worldwide eminence .
Today his followers among philosophers of science are a diminishing minority , convinced that Popper 's vast reputation is enormously inflated .
I agree .
I believe that Popper 's reputation was based mainly on this persistent but misguided efforts to restate common - sense views in a novel language that is rapidly becoming out of fashion .
Consider Popper 's best known claim : that science does not proceed by " induction " that is , by finding confirming instances of a conjecture  but rather by falsifying bold , risky conjectures .
Conformation , he argued , is slow and never certain .
By contrast , a falsification can be sudden and definitive .
Moreover , it lies at the heart of the scientific method .
A familiar example of falsification concerns the assertion that all crows are black .
Every find of another black crow obviously confirms the theory , but there is always the possibility that a non -black crow will turn up .
If this happens , the conjecture is instantly discredited .
The more often a conjecture passes efforts to falsify it , Popper maintained , the greater becomes its " corroboration , " although corroboration is also uncertain and can never be quantified by degree of probability .
Popper 's critics insist that " corroboration " is a form of induction , and Popper has simply sneaked induction in through a back door by giving it a new name .
David Hume 's famous question was " How can induction be justified ? "
It can't be , said Popper , because there is no such thing as induction !
There are many objections to this startling claim .
One is that falsifications are much rarer in science than searches for confirming instances .
Astronomers look for signs of water on Mars .
They do not think they are making efforts to falsify the conjecture that Mars never had water .
Falsifications can be as fuzzy and elusive as confirmations .
Einstein 's first cosmological model was a universe as static and unchanging as Aristotle's .
Unfortunately , the gravity of suns would make such a universe unstable .
It would collapse .
To prevent this , Einstein , out of thin air , proposed the bold conjecture that the universe , on its pre-atomic level , harbored a mysterious , undetected repulsive force he called the " cosmological constant . "
When it was discovered that the universe is expanding , Einstein considered his conjecture falsified .
Indeed , he called it " the greatest blunder of my life . "
Today , his conjecture is back in favor as a way of explaining why the universe seems to be expanding faster than it should .
Astronomers are not trying to falsify it ; they are looking for confirmations .
Falsification may be based on faulty observation .
A man who claims he saw a white crow could be mistaken or even lying .
As long as observation of black crows continue , it can be taken in two ways ; as confirmations of " all crows are black , " or disconfirmations of " some crows are not black . "
Popper recognized  but dismissed as unimportant  that every falsification of a conjecture is simultaneously a confirmation of an opposite conjecture , and every conforming instance of a conjecture is a falsification of an opposite conjecture .
Consider the current hypothesis that there is a quantum field called the Higgs field , with its quantized particle .
If a giant atom smasher some day , perhaps soon , detects a Higgs , it will confirm the conjecture that the field exist .
At the same time it will falsify the opinion of some top physicists , Oxford 's Roger Penrose for one , that there is no Higgs field .
To scientists and philosophers outside the Popperian fold , science operates mainly by induction ( confirmation ) , and also and less often by disconfirmation ( falsification ) .
Its language is almost always one of induction .
If Popper bet on a certain horse to win a race , and the horse won , you would not expect him to shout , " Great !
My horse failed to lose ! "
Sir Karl Popper ( 1902 - 1994 )
Astronomers are now finding compelling evidence that smaller and smaller planets orbit distant suns .
Surely this is inductive evidence that there may be Earth - sized planets out there .
Why bother to say , as each new and smaller planet is discovered , that it tends to falsify the conjecture that there are no small planets beyond our solar system ?
Why scratch your left ear with your right hand ?
Astronomers are looking for small planets .
They are not trying to refute a theory any more than physicists are trying to refute the conjecture that there is no Higgs field .
Scientists seldom attempt to falsify .
They are inductivists who seek positive conformations .
At the moment the widest of all speculations in physics is superstring theory .
It conjectures that all basic particles are different vibrations of extremely tiny loops of great tensile strength .
No superstring has yet been observed , but the theory has great explanatory power .
Gravity , for example , is implied as the simplest vibration of a superstring .
Like prediction , explanation is an important aspect of induction .
Relativity , for instance , not only made rafts of successful predictions but explained data previously unexplained .
The same is true of quantum mechanics .
In both fields researchers used classical induction procedures .
Few physicists say they are looking for ways to falsify superstring theory .
They are instead looking for confirmations .
Ernest Nagel , Columbia University 's famous philosopher of science , in his Teleology Revisited and Other Essays in the Philosophy and History of Science ( 1979 ) , summed it up this way : " [ Popper 's ] conception of the role of falsification . . . is an oversimplification that is close to being a caricature of scientific procedures . "
For Popper , what his chief rival Rudolf Carnap called a " degree of confirmation " a logical relation between a conjecture and all relevant evidence is a useless concept .
Instead , as I said earlier , the more tests for falsification a theory passes , the more it gains in " corroboration . "
It 's as if someone claimed that deduction does n't exist , but of course statements can logically imply other statements .
Let 's invent a new term for deduction , such as " justified inference . "
It 's not so much that Popper disagreed with Carnap and other inductivists as that he restated their views in a bizarre and cumbersome terminology .
To Popper 's credit he was , like Russell , and almost all philosophers , scientists , and ordinary people , a thoroughgoing realist in the sense that he believed the universe , with all its intricate and beautiful mathematical structures , was " out there , " independent of our feeble minds ,
In no way can the laws of science be likened to traffic regulations or fashions in dress that very with time and place .
Popper would have been appalled as Russell by the crazy views of today 's social constructivists and postmodernists , most of them French or American professors of literature who know almost nothing about science .
Scholars unacquainted with the history of philosophy often credit popper for being the first to point out that science , unlike math and logic , is never absolutely certain .
It is always corrigible , subject to perpetual modification .
This notion of what the American philosopher Charles Peirce called the " fallibilism " of science goes back to ancient Greek skeptics , and is taken for granted by almost all later thinkers .
In Quantum Theory and the Schism in Physics ( 1982 ) Popper defends at length his " propensity theory " of probability .
A perfect die , when tossed , has the propensity to show each face with equal probability .
Basic particles , when measured , have a propensity to acquire , with specific probabilities , such properties as position , momentum , spin and so on .
Here again Popper is introducing a new term which says nothing different from what can be better said in conventional terminology .
In my opinion Popper 's most impressive work , certainly his best known , was his two - volume The Open Society and Its Enemies ( 1945 ) .
Its central theme , that open democratic societies are far superior to closed totalitarian regimes , especially Marxist ones , was hardly new , but Popper defends it with powerful arguments and awesome erudition .
In later books he attacks what he calls " historicism , " the belief that there are laws of historical change that enable one to predict humanity 's future .
The future is unpredictable , Popper argued , because we have free wills .
Like William James , Popper was an indeterminist who saw history as a series of unforeseeable events .
In later years he liked to distinguish between what he called three " worlds " the external physical universe , the inner world of the mind , and the world of culture .
Like Carnap and other members of the Vienna Circle , he had no use for God or an afterlife .
Karl Raimund Popper was born in Vienna in 1902 where he was also educated .
His parents were Jewish , his father a wealthy attorney , his mother a pianist .
For twenty years he was a professor of logic and scientific method at the London School of Economics .
In 1965 he was knighted by the Crown .
I am convinced that Popper , a man of enormous egotism , was motivated by an intense jealousy of Carnap .
It seems that every time Carnap expressed an opinion , Popper felt compelled to come forth with an opposing view , although it usually turned out to be the same as Carnap 's but in different language .
Carnap once said that the distance between him and Popper was not symmetrical .
From Carnap to Popper it was small , but the other way around it appeared huge .
Popper actually believed that the movement known as logical positivism , of which Carnap was leader , had expired because he , Popper , had single - handedly killed it !
I have not read Popper 's first and only biography , Karl Popper : The Formative Years ( 1902 - 1945 ) , by Malachi Haim Hacohen ( 2000 ) .
Judging by the reviews it is an admirable work .
David Papineau , a British philosopher , reviewed it for The New York Times Book Review ( November 12 , 2000 ) .
Here are his harsh words about Popper 's character and work :
By Hacohen 's own account , Popper was a monster , a moral prig .
He continually accused others of plagiarism , but rarely acknowledged his own intellectual debts .
He expected others to make every sacrifice for him , but did little in return .
In Hacohen 's words , " He remained to the end a spoiled child who threw temper tantrums when he did not get his way . "
Hacohen is ready to excuse all this as the prerogative of genius .
Those who think Popper a relatively minor figure are likely to take a different view .
When Popper wrote " Logik der Forschung , " he was barely thirty .
Despite its flawed center , it was full of good ideas , from perhaps the most brilliant of the bright young philosophers associated with the Vienna Circle .
But where the others continued to learn , develop and in time exert a lasting influence on the philosophical tradition , Popper knew better .
He refused to revise his falsificationism , and so condemned himself to a lifetime in the service of a bad idea .
Popper 's great and tireless efforts to expunge the word induction from scientific and philosophical discourse has utterly failed .
Except for a small but noisy group of British Popperians , induction is just too firmly embedded in the way philosophers of science and even ordinary people talk and think .
Confirming instances underlie our beliefs that the Sun will rise tomorrow , that dropped objects will fall , that water will freeze and boil , and a million other events .
It is hard to think of another philosophical battle so decisively lost .
Readers interested in exploring Popper 's eccentric views will find , in addition to his books and papers , most helpful the two - volume Philosophy of Karl Popper ( 1970 ) , in the Library of Living Philosophers , edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp .
The book contains essays by others , along with Popper 's replies and an autobiography .
For vigorous criticism of Popper , see David Stove 's Popper and After : Four Modern Irrationalists ( the other three are Imre Lakatos , Thomas Kuhn , and Paul Feyerabend ) , and Stove 's chapter on Popper in his posthumous Against the Idols of the Age ( 1999 ) edited by Roger Kimball .
See Also Carnap 's reply to Popper in The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap ( 1963 ) , another volume in The Library of Living Philosophers .
Of many books by Popperians , one of the best is Critical Rationalism ( 1994 ) , a skillful defense of Popper by his top acolyte .

Error messages are usually a bland and opaque non-explanation of what has gone wrong .
Especially when they 're posted by large companies .
So hats off to Fish4.co.uk for a truly fine , if slightly bitter , error message .
The problem is blamed on a piece of Sun equipment - a Sun Fire E6900 Server - described by Sun as an " Extreme Enterprise Powerhouse " .
The message says : " Thank you for coming to Fish4 this morning .

No one seems to be able to go agree on exactly how much of the traffic on file sharing networks is pornographic .
However , what is generally agreed upon is that pornography is the most commonly traded type of file , far outstripping music and Hollywood movies , and constituting nearly half of all searches .
Though this is n’t a shock to anyone who has surfed the Web , what is interesting is that , unlike the RIAA and MPAA , the porn companies have not sued any file sharing companies or individual users over this infringement .
Yet , despite this rampant copyright infringement , Internet porn has grown dramatically as a business over the last few years , now reaching an estimated $ 2.5 billion per year compared to just $ 1 billion a few years ago .
This explosive growth is taking place even as record labels and movie studios are in the throes of a major slump .
Though there are many differences between the three industries , porn might offer some suggestions to other content creators on how to profit in an environment where piracy is rampant .
Lawsuits Are n’t Sexy
To be fair , it is much easier to sell porn on the Web than music or movies .
The ancient maxim of “ sex sells ” immediately leaps to mind .
However , in recent history , pornography has been at the forefront of every media revolution .
VHS , DVD and the Internet itself owe a great deal of their success to the adult entertainment industry .
Pornographers , no matter what one may think about them ethically , have generally been the first to embrace new technology even as other content industries have been dragging their heels .
The same has been true for file sharing .
Despite the rampant copyright infringement , the porn industry have filed no lawsuits over it .
Instead , they ’ve tolerated file sharing and , in many cases , even encouraged it by distributing free samples .
This is in sharp contrast to the record and movie industries that have filed thousands of lawsuits against both file sharing companies and individual sharers .
Clearly , pornography is resistant to negative effects of piracy .
Thousands and thousands of people continue to pay for the same thing they can get for free and their numbers are growing .
How they achieve this , however , is no mystery .
All one has to do is look at how the industry works .
The Secrets to Porn Success
Though porn undoubtedly owes a great deal of its success to its subject matter , there are several things that are unique about Internet porn that make it significantly more resistant to piracy :
Watermarked Content – Almost all content from porn sites , including images and videos , free and paid , are watermarked and tagged .
This means that , even if they are copied and pirated , that they will be advertisements for the site itself .
This eliminates plagiarism and content theft by other sites while also helping interested viewers find the original site .
Regular Updates – Most pornographic sites update either weekly or monthly with new content .
This means that , in most cases , when the content hits the file sharing networks it is already out of date .
If people enjoy the content they download for free and wish to keep up to date on it , they have to pay the monthly fee .
Niche Content – Though adult sites try to push boundaries , most operate in very tight niches .
This enables them to earn a reputation as the best in a field and makes owning a membership there a prerequisite for anyone interested in that type of material .
This also helps to attract the rabid fans that pay for content even when it is available for free .
In short , if a site produces regularly updated , high - quality niche content that is easily recognized as it is passed around .
File sharing and piracy might not become the major issues they once were .
Though this does n’t do a lot aid writers since text can easily be stripped of attribution , musicians , photographers and videographers can benefit greatly from this formula .
That ’s probably why it ’s expanded to more traditional media on the Web .
Not Just For Porn
More recently , mainstream sites have adopted similar formula for using piracy to their advantage .
Rooster Teeth , the makers of the popular Red vs.
Blue series , and Ask a Ninja have both made livings off of physical copies of their videos , merchandise and , in the case of Rooster Teeth , memberships to their site .
This is in spite of the fact that they give their content away for free and encourage sharing .
Similarly , others have been able to sell copies of CDs and even books while giving away the original work in its entirety .
However , their models are different from that of the Internet porn industry in that much of their revenue comes from selling physical objects .
Most porn sites , by comparison , make money exclusively from monthly memberships and digital - only content .
Despite that important distinction , the overall principles do still apply and can be used by anyone willing to take a chance on allowing some piracy to take place .
The End of Content Protection ?
All of this raises the difficult question , is it necessary to even protect content anymore ?
If piracy can be a good thing , why bother defending copyright at all ?
First off , this strategy wo n’t be viable for all content .
It works best for large collections of media such as images , video and audio .
Raw text can be separated from its attribution too easy and will just as likely be plagiarized at the same time it is being copied .
Likewise , small collections can be easily downloaded for free , making the paid for copies almost useless .
Second , it wo n’t work on content with long turnaround times .
If it takes more than a few weeks to produce a new work , the free copies will be much more appealing as they are much more up to date .
Finally , this does n’t work for content that is designed , even in part , to draw the attention of search engines .
Duplicate content can greatly hurt one ’s effectiveness in the search engines , either directly through an alleged duplicate content penalty , or indirectly through confused users directed to the wrong site .
So , while some sites will be able to change strategies and benefit from users copying and sharing their works openly , most will not .
Originality does still count and some content types are just too vulnerable to plagiarism , scraping and abuse .
Furthermore , even sites that do make money by allowing piracy of their work will likely have some material , even if it is only a small portion , that they will need to protect .
Still , by riding the wave of user sharing , Webmasters are able to focus their copyright protection efforts on the real villains of the Web .
This can save time and help build a larger audience all at the same time .
Conclusions
Content protection is only as valuable as it is a good business and personal decision .
That is why , in many situations , it is better to go with the flow than to fight it .
Content does want to be free and , in many cases , it can be without repercussions .
If you can work with those that want to share your content , either through Creative Commons Licenses or some other arrangement , you can spend your time fighting more serious cases .
Combine that with an effective prevention , detection and cessation system , you can easily whittle down your copyright protection issues to a very insignificant task .
It can require some creativity and new thinking , but others have shown that it can work .
It just requires the willingness to take a chance and not rely on old models .
However , anyone running a site on the Web that relies on old models of business probably need to take a long look at their plans anyway .
They were probably flawed from the start .

Well .
That took rather longer than expected .
We have , finally , moved , into the new Fog Creek office at 535 8th Avenue , officially ten months after I started pounding the pavement looking for a replacement for my grandmother ’s old brownstone where we spent our first few years , working from bedrooms and the garden .
Most software managers know what good office space would be like , and they know they do n’t have it , and ca n’t have it .
Office space seems to be the one thing that nobody can get right and nobody can do anything about .
There ’s a ten year lease , and whenever the company moves the last person anybody asks about how to design the space is the manager of the software team , who finds out what his new veal - fattening pens , uh , cubicle farm is going to be like for the first time on the Monday after the move -in .
Well , it ’s my own damn company and I can do something about it , so I did .
Maybe I ’m just an architecture queen .
I probably pay more attention to my physical surroundings than the average software developer .
I might take it too seriously .
But there are three reasons I take it so seriously :
There ’s a lot of evidence that the right kind of office space can improve programmer productivity , especially private offices .
Having drop - dead gorgeous , private , windowed offices makes it a lot easier to recruit the kinds of superstars that produce ten times as much as the merely brilliant software developers .
If I have to compete at New York salaries against Bangalore salaries , I ’m going to need those superstars , so when people come in for an interview , I need to see jaws on the floor .
It ’s about drama .
.
Hey , this is my job ; this is where I spend my days ; it ’s my time away from my friends and family .
It better be nice .
Working with architect Roy Leone , a lot of space ( 425 r.s.f. per employee ) , and an enlightened CEO , I set out to create the ultimate software development environment .
Architects use the term “ brief ” for what we software developers call “ system requirements . ”
Here was the brief I gave Roy .
Private offices with doors that close were absolutely required and not open to negotiation .
Programmers need lots of power outlets .
They should be able to plug new gizmos in at desk height without crawling on the floor .
We need to be able to rewire any data lines ( phone , LAN , cable TV , alarms , etc. ) easily without opening any walls , ever .
It should be possible to do pair programming .
When you ’re working with a monitor all day , you need to rest your eyes by looking at something far away , so monitors should not be up against walls .
The office should be a hang out : a pleasant place to spend time .
If you ’re meeting your friends for dinner after work you should want to meet at the office .
As Philip Greenspun bluntly puts it : “ Your business success will depend on the extent to which programmers essentially live at your office .
For this to be a common choice , your office had better be nicer than the average programmer ’s home .
There are two ways to achieve this result .
One is to hire programmers who live in extremely shabby apartments .
The other is to create a nice office . ”
Roy did a great job .
This is what you pay an architect for .
I predict he will become something of a world expert on designing offices for software teams .
Here ’s how he translated my brief into three dimensional space .
Private Offices .
Not only did we get spacious , windowed private offices , but even the common area workstations ( for non-developers ) are hidden in clever angular alcoves , so everyone gets their own private space without line of sight to anyone else .
The walls between the offices and the workstations are made of high tech , translucent acrylic which glows softly and provides natural light to the interior without reducing privacy .
Power .
Every desk has twenty , that ’s right , twenty outlets .
Four of them are colored orange and have uninterruptible power coming off of a UPS in the server closet , so you do n’t need a UPS in every office .
The outlets are right below desk level in a special trough which runs the entire length of the desk , about six inches deep and six inches wide .
The trough is a place to hide all your cables neatly and has a handy cover which blends in with the desk .
Wiring .
There is a Snake Tray system running near the ceiling from the server room and throughout the office , running through every room .
It is completely accessible so if you want to run any kind of ( low voltage ) cable from point A to point B you can do this neatly .
We only moved in Friday , and we ’ve already redone the intra- office LAN wiring , in a project which took about half an hour , so the snake tray has already proven itself .
Every office has its own 8 - port network switch , so you can plug in your laptop and your desktop and your Macintosh and that old computer you keep around to read Joel on Software when your main computer is rebooting to install today ’s Windows Update , and still have 3 ports left over ( attention math geniuses : no need to email .
One port is the uplink . )
I sneer at silly building managers who still think that one LAN port per office is about right .
For lawyers , maybe .
Pair Programming .
When you make typical L - shaped desks many developers set themselves up in the corner .
When they need to collaborate temporarily , or pair program , or even just show something to someone on their screen , the second person has to either lean all the way across the desk or look over the first person ’s shoulder .
To avoid this we designed all the desks to be long and straight so that wherever a software developer sits , there ’s always room for another person to pull up a chair and sit next to them .
Resting eyes .
Although the desks are up against the walls , there is an interior window in that wall , which cleverly looks across the corner of the next developer ’s office and through his window .
Because of the rather brilliant layout this does n’t reduce privacy because even though you have a window onto the next office , it is angled so that from most positions you really only look across a small corner of that room and out its exterior window .
The net result is that every office has windows on three sides , two of which look outside , creating the architectural pattern Light on Two Sides of Every Room .
This is quite an accomplishment : you try coming up with a scheme to give everyone a corner office in a conventional building .
Another reason hiring a great architect was well worth the money .
Hang out .
We furnished the office with a kitchenette and a lounge area with sofas and a huge HDTV plasma screen with DVD player .
We ’re planning a pool table and game console .
Private offices means you can listen to music at reasonable volumes without headphones and nobody will care .
Bottom Line it For Me .
The monthly rent for our offices , when fully occupied , will run about $ 700 per employee .
The build - out was done on budget and paid for almost entirely by the landlord .
I suspect that $ 700 per person is on the high side for software developers throughout the world , but if it means we can hire from the 99.9 percentile instead of the 99 percentile , it ’ll be worth it .
As one might expect of a man so brilliant , Thomas Jefferson had the perfect answer to modern politicians itchy to disarm the ordinary citizen .
" Laws that forbid the carrying of arms … disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes .
…
Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . "
This is an entry in his Commonplace Book , dated sometime between 1774 and 1776 .
Can anyone argue against his logic ?
Criminals are by definition lawbreakers and do n’t obey gun-control laws .
It will be no consolation to you that police may later charge the man who murdered you with the additional crime of possession of a firearm by a felon .
That wo n’t buy you a ticket out of the cemetery .
You ’re history .

Even in our modern society , 99 percent of the time police do n’t get to the scene until after the crime has been committed .
Between the time you first perceive yourself as the pending victim of a crime until the police arrive ( if they do at all ) , you are on your own .
Self - defense is no longer a theory .
Running away is rarely an option .
Your choice is to fight or suffer what the criminal has decided to do to you .
Having a gun wo n’t guarantee you ’ll win a gunfight , but it will certainly guarantee that you will have a chance of winning .
If the criminal is armed and you are n’t , you have no chance at all .
Some younger men who keep in shape might imagine they can handle their assailant , so I will simply pass on to them the advice of a tae kwon do master who was a member of the South Korean intelligence agency .

Any honest martial artist will tell you about the principle of distance .
You ca n’t hit a man beyond the distance of your outstretched arm .
You ca n’t kick a man beyond the length of your leg .
But a man with a gun can stand 15 yards away and shoot you .
And unlike Jackie Chan or Chuck Norris , you do n’t have a scriptwriter who will determine how the fight will end .
I ’m not suggesting everyone go out and buy a gun .
Owning a firearm for self - defense is a serious business .
A gun is an inanimate object .
If it ’s loaded , cocked and the trigger is pulled , the gun will kill or maim anybody who happens to be in front of the barrel when the firing pin strikes the cap .
You want to be dead certain the person who gets the bullet deserves it , because killing is an act of finality .
You ca n’t undo it .
You ’d better be sure you can live with it .
And for God ’s sake , do n’t leave a loaded gun where children — yours or a neighbor ’s — can get to it .
Because you ca n’t rely on the modern justice system to produce justice , I will also pass along some advice an old country lawman gave me when I was a young reserve deputy .
" Son , if you ever have to use that thing , " he said , " make sure the judge can hear only one version of what happened . "
In plainer language , if you have to shoot somebody , kill him .
Otherwise , in these crazy times , the perp may sue you even though he is a career criminal who initiated the assault .
Or some prosecutor who does n’t believe people should defend themselves might try to indict you .
The human race has n’t changed over the millennia .
There are still good people and bad people , kind people and cruel people .
There are still predators who will prey on people they think are too weak to defend themselves .
There is a lot more to self - defense than I have space to talk about , so I will close with a story from the 1800s .
A man on his way to Texas asked an Arkansas store owner if he thought he would need a gun .
" Well , " the store owner said , " maybe you will and maybe you wo n’t , but if you do , you ’ll need it in a hurry . "

Are Arab Oil kingdoms and China Attracted to Golds Glitter ?
American political history has repeated itself again .
Since World War II , whichever political party controlled the White House during mid-term Elections has lost an average of 6 Senate seats and 30 seats in the House of Representatives .
On November 7th , it was the Republicans ’ turn to endure a thumping , losing control of Congress to the Democrats for the first time since 1994 .
Just a few days earlier , US Labor Apparatchniks had revised their originally reported 128,000 increase in August payrolls into a gain of 230,000 jobs , and September ’s 51,000 increase was tripled to a 148,000 gain .
The change for the two months combined was the biggest upward revision since July and August 2000 .
That sent the US jobless rate 0.2 % lower to 4.4 % of the workforce , a 5 - year low .
However , the glowing jobs report , a 12,000 +
Dow Jones Industrials , inflated 401 - k’s , and an 86 cents per gallon plunge in gasoline prices since August , could not brainwash enough US voters on Election Day .
The GOP had wandered too far from its commitment 12 - years ago to clean up corruption , shrink the federal government and slash irresponsible spending .
Anger about America ’s war in Iraq , and frustration with the Bush administration ’s reckless trade polices with China , trumped the doctored employment stats and the wealth generated on Wall Street .
A Newsweek poll showed that 48 % of registered US voters would generally like to see a Democrat elected to the White House in 2008 , compared to 28 % who want a Republican .
Such hypothetical polls are likely to narrow significantly by November 2008 , but already the Persian Gulf oil kingdoms foresee major chaos and instability in the region , and Beijing is warning Congress to keep its hands off protectionist legislation concerning China ’s massive trade surplus with the US .
Saudi Princes Rattled by Democrats , Shifting into Gold
Saudi princes , who control 70 % of the stock market in Riyadh have been bailing out of local stocks and moving funds into Gold since early October .
The Saudi elite are worried that Democrats could hasten an American withdrawal from Iraq .
Defense chief Donald Rumsfeld ’s departure could well be a first move in that direction .
Signaling a broad shift in his Iraq policy , President Bush on Nov 11th described his new pick for defense secretary , Robert Gates , as an “ agent of change . ”
The Democratic chairman , Howard Dean , says Congress will keep up the pressure for change in Iraq .
“ Americans across the country made it clear that they want a new direction in Iraq and in the war on terror . ”
Sen. Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat and the next probable chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said , “ The first order of business is to change the direction of Iraq policy .
The American presence was not open - ended , and that , as a matter of fact , we need to begin a phased redeployment of forces from Iraq in four to six months , ” Levin said on Nov 12th .
The man who is about to be isolated in the White House is Vice President Dick Cheney , the last neo -con left .
Robert Gates , James Baker , and Brent Scowcroft , have been called in for strategy on exiting Iraq over the objections of VP Cheney .
But an abandoned Iraq could be seen as a major victory for Islamic insurgents , embolden Iranian and Syrian kingpins , lead to a full - blown civil war in Iraq , and future al - Qaeda or Hizbollah attempts to overthrow the Saudi kingdom .
Saudi Arabia 's interior minister on Nov 12th called Iraq a major base for terrorism , a sign of growing concerns in the oil - rich kingdom over its violence - plagued neighbor .
“ There is no doubt that Iraq now forms a main base for terrorism , " said Saudi Interior Minister Prince Naif .
“ The situation in Iraq is deteriorating daily , and the country has become a threat in the region , ” he warned .
While stock markets around the world are climbing to 5 - year or new record highs , Saudi blue chips plunged to the 8000 level on Nov 11th , their lowest close in almost 20 - months .
The sudden collapse below the psychological 10,000 level , sent shockwaves through other Gulf bourses where investors are nervous over Iran ’s escalating nuclear weapons program , the Shiite revolution moving across the Middle East , and the slide of OPEC ’s benchmark oil price to below $ 60 a barrel .
Since October 29th , the Saudi All - share Index has plunged 25 % , and the average P/E has fallen to 14 from around 40 times earnings at its peak in February .
New listings in Saudi Arabia are also taking a hit as the Arab world ’s largest stock market posts its sharpest decline since losing half of its capitalization between February and May during a region - wide stock market crash .
Proving its mettle as a safe haven in dangerous times , gold has climbed steadily against the price of OPEC ’s benchmark crude oil prices from 8.75 barrels in early August to a high of 11.5 barrel last week .
Gold traders in London , New York , and Tokyo , have noticed that gold diverged from its tight linkage to the crude oil market over the past few weeks , and the phenomena might have its origin in the Gulf .
Abu Dubai ’s stock index fell below the 400 - level to its lowest close in nearly two years as investors sold shares in the largest companies across the Gulf in response to a slump in Saudi Arabia .
Qatar ’s market fell to its lowest close since Jan 2005 .
Persian Gulf bourses are also nervous about US - led naval maneuvers off Iran ’s west coast that included warships from Australia , Bahrain , Britain , France , and Italy .
Gulf bourses were pounded on November 3rd , when Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards fired land - to - sea and sea - to - sea missiles into Gulf waters .
“ We have improved the range of our missiles to 170 kilometres ( 105 miles ) .
This will bring the entire Persian Gulf from the Straits of Hormuz and most of the Sea of Oman within range , ” said Revolutionary Guards deputy naval chief General Ali Fadavi .
Iran said it fired its longer - range Shahab - 3 ballistic missile for the first time , which has a range of up to 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 miles ) , sufficient to threaten US bases in the Gulf , Tel - Aviv , and parts of Eastern Europe .
The next day , on November 4th , six Arab states including Algeria , Egypt , Morocco , Saudi Arabia , Tunisia and the UAE said they want to acquire the technology to unlock the secrets to the atomic bomb .
The specter of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East is linked to the failure of Europe and Washington to adopt any meaningful measures that can block Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons .
However , there are reports from Moscow , that the Bush administration is offering Russia entry to the World Trade organization , in return for the Kremlin ’s approval of sanctions against Iran .
What ’s Behind the Plunge in Oil prices ?
Nearly $ 15 per barrel of the plunge in oil prices was linked to the evaporation of the Iranian “ war premium ” , after traders gave up on ideas of a US or Israeli air strike on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
UN Security Council members have been dithering for months over divisions over a text , calling for sanctions against Iran , with no agreement in sight .
Bush toned down his war mongering rhetoric with Tehran , unwinding the “ fear factor ” that inflated $ 15 / barrel into oil prices earlier this year .
Also weighing on oil prices , US crude inventories are 16.3 million barrels above year - ago levels , and 10 % above the average for the last five years , while heating oil supplies are 18.1 million barrels higher .
On October 25th , British Petroleum said its recoverable oil reserves in the Caspian Sea had risen to 6.5 billion barrels from 5.4 billion .
The Caspian fields are the main source of crude oil for the BP - led Baku - Ceyhan pipeline , which will eventually pump more than 1 million bpd from Azerbaijan to the Turkish Mediterranean coast in 2007 .
On Nov 15th , OPEC noted oil stocks in industrialized countries were at their highest level since November 1998 , which could set the stage for further precipitous price falls next year when the northern hemisphere winter ends .
“ The continuation of above average stock levels may point to a further imbalance in supply / demand fundamentals . ” OPEC said .
OPEC reckons world oil demand will grow 1.33 million bpd to 85.58 million bpd in 2007 , mostly due to stronger demand from China .
At the same time however , demand for OPEC oil is expected to fall as new non-OPEC supplies , mainly from Russia and the Caspian , enter the market .
OPEC sees supply from rival producers growing by 1.8 million bpd to 53 million bpd next year .
“ This indicates a shortfall in the demand for OPEC oil in 2007 of around 700,000 bpd , ” OPEC said .
Crude oil was rattled on Nov 15th , after Kuwaiti Energy Ministry Undersecretary Issa al - Oun said Gulf OPEC producers believe US oil prices between $ 55 and $ 60 a barrel are acceptable and OPEC would act to defend that range .
“ The Gulf Cooperation Council states see oil prices between $ 55 and $ 60 a barrel as an acceptable level but if they start to decline then there should be action , ” he said .
Gulf oil ministers have carefully avoided mentioning a target price for their oil , and Nymex oil traders had assumed that OPEC was defending $ 58 to $ 62 per barrel .
But OPEC delegates say top world exporter Saudi Arabia prefers a level of $ 50 for OPEC ’s basket of crude .
That would equate to about $ 55 for US crude oil .
The latest 30 % slide in crude oil prices from the record $ 78.40 / bl set on July 14th has energized global stock markets , which climbed to record highs last week , as measured by the MSCI All - world index .
The global economy is growing 5.1 % this year , after expanding 4.9 % in 2005 and 5.3 % in 2004 .
The world has not enjoyed a sustained period of growth faster than 4 % since the early 1970’s .
However , the latest plunge in crude oil prices might be signaling a significant slowdown in global economic growth in 2007 .
“ A further correction in the housing market could lead to an even sharper slowdown in the US economy and have spill - over effects abroad , ” warned IMF Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato on Nov 18th .
The US economy slowed to an annualized 1.6 % growth rate in Q ’3 , the slowest since the first quarter of 2003 .
Housing starts in the US tumbled 14.6 % in October to the lowest level in more than six years , and were 27.4 % lower from a year ago .
Beijing Disturbed by Democrats , Signals shift from US $
The news of a Democratic sweep of Congress lifted the price of gold by nearly $ 20 per ounce on October 8th .
Democrats are likely to take aim at China ’s mushrooming trade surplus with the US , which has skyrocketed from $ 4 million per month in 1976 to $ 4 billion per week in 2006 .
There could be greater Congressional pressure on Beijing to push up the value of the yuan against the US dollar , putting China ’s portfolio of $ 700 billion of US bonds at risk from currency devaluation .
On October 31st , Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton suggested US efforts to get China to move toward a more flexible exchange rate had been in part frustrated by the leverage given to the Chinese through their huge ownership of US Treasury debt .
“ How do you get tough on your banker ?
We have to hope every morning that Beijing and other nations will continue to buy our debt instruments .
The trade deficits with China give the US a weakened hand in global trade and economic diplomacy . ”
On November 4th , Senator Jack Reed ( D - RI ) , the ranking Democrat on the JEC , Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) , Senior House Democrat on the JEC , and Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee , released the report , “ Relying on the Kindness of Strangers : Foreign Purchases of US Treasury Debt . ”
Key findings from the study include the following :
“ At the end of fiscal year 2005 , 42.1 % of the public debt of the United States was held by foreigners .
That foreign ownership share rose by 11.8 % just since 2001 and will be higher still when the data for 2006 are released .
Foreign ownership of Treasury securities more than doubled from $ 1.0 trillion in January 2001 to $ 2.2 trillion in August 2006 .
China ’s holdings rose 450 % to $ 339 billion .
The OPEC nations have doubled their holdings to over $ 100 billion in the past two years . ”
“ If the United States does not begin to take steps to reduce its unsustainable dependence on foreign borrowing in an orderly way , there could be a run on the US dollar and that could precipitate an international financial crisis and a sharp increase in interest rates , ” the report warned .
Trying to pre-empt a Democratic showdown on China ’s $ 210 billion per year trade surplus with the US , Beijing issued a veiled threat that it might stop buying US bonds , thus exerting upward pressure on US mortgage rates .
“ China has a clear plan to diversify its $ 1 trillion foreign exchange reserves and is considering various options to do so , ” said Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan on Nov 9th .
Zhou ’s signal of a possible shift away from US dollars was in quick reaction to harsh rhetoric from Rep. Charles Rangel , a New York Democrat , who wants to get tougher on trade with China .
“ I do n’t think the Bush administration has taken up any trade issue with the Chinese .
We should insist if they are going to trade with us it ’s going to be fair trade .
We have to protect American jobs , ” he said .
Under the Bush administration ’s trade policies , 3.1 million US manufacturing jobs have been lost .
“ Diversification includes currencies , investment instruments , including emerging markets , ” Zhou warned the next day .
Asked if Beijing is buying gold , Zhou would only say , “ That ’s a separate thing . ”
In a knee - jerk reaction to Zhou , the British pound and Euro rose to the upper end of their six month trading ranges last week , and both currencies are benefiting from rising short - term interest rates .
At the end of 2005 , central banks held FX reserves of around $ 3.5 trillion , with 15 % invested in gold .
Gold accounted for 70 % of US reserves , 50 % of ECB reserves , 40 % held by Switzerland , 4 % by India , 2 % by Japan , and around 1 % by Brazil , China , Hong Kong , Korea or Malaysia .
The big players are China and Japan which hold a combined $ 1.9 trillion of FX reserves , followed by Russia ’s $ 265 billion .
Ironically , the central banks with the largest FX reserves own the least amount of gold .
In the 1990 ’s , the prevailing question was , what if European central banks reduce their gold holdings to 10 % of their reserves ?
Now , the question is what if Asian central banks increase their holdings to 10 % of their reserves ?
said Philipp M. Hildebrand , member of the Swiss National Bank , on June 26th , 2006 .
But to what extent would the People ’s Bank of China shift into other currencies or gold , while shunning the US dollar , given its dependence on exports to the US to keep its economy humming at 10 % per year ?
European Central Bankers to Resist Gold ’s Advance
Gold ’s latest surge from as low as $ 560 per ounce on October 6th , to as high as $ 635 per ounce on November 8th , disturbs central bankers in Europe .
They do n’t want to see gold become a one - way bet to the upside that could signal a collapse of the US dollar , or higher global inflation on the horizon .
The first line of defense against gold ’s advance is “ Jawboning . ”
The second option is European central bank gold sales .
The third and least palatable option is higher short - term interest rates .
European central banks may have dumped far more gold on the markets over the last three weeks of September than officially reported , accounting for the sudden plunge in prices below $ 600 per ounce that stunned traders .
Barclays Capital , one of the world ’s top - 3 gold traders , said Europe ’s banks had sold an extra 100 tons from reserves in a rush to meet a quota deadline on September 26th , but had done so by selling through forward contracts that disguised the effect .
The huge sales would help explain gold ’s brutal fall from 500 Euros an ounce in early September to as low as 440 Euros / oz on October 3rd , compounded by hedge fund liquidation of crude oil contracts .
The central banks had reported sales of just 393 tons of gold for the fiscal year , far below the 500 annual ton limit agreed under the Washington Accord , an agreement by 15 central banks in Europe .
However , Russia ’s central bank says it wants to raise the gold share of its $ 267 billion of FX reserves from 3 % to 10 % , a move that would soak much of global mine supply .
For gold bugs , it ’s a healthy sign that gold absorbed the European bank sales in September in impressive fashion , and then rebounded to levels that prevailed before the dumping by the Bank of France and others .
In the past two weeks , 3 Euro zone central banks have sold gold in exchange for 290 million Euros .
Also , the chart above highlights gold ’s recent break away from the tight grip of North Sea Brent crude oil .
Once again , the divergence is probably linked to gold accumulation by nervous Persian Gulf banks and traders .
For good measure , gold traders are also betting that OPEC can succeed in stabilizing US crude oil prices near $ 60 per barrel , eliminating a potential risk to the downside .
For more than a year , gold traders have been waiting for a 1 % shift in the Bank of China ’s FX reserves from US dollars into gold , which could soak up much of the European Central Bank gold sales .
At the end of 2005 , central banks held FX reserves of around $ 3.5 trillion , with 15 % invested in gold .
Gold accounted for 70 % of US reserves , 50 % of ECB reserves , 40 % held by Switzerland , 4 % by India , 2 % by Japan , and around 1 % by Brazil , China , Hong Kong , Korea and Malaysia .
Ironically , the central banks with the largest FX reserves own the least amount of gold in their portfolios .
In the 1990 ’s , the prevailing question was , what if European central banks reduce their gold holdings to 10 % of their reserves ?
Now , the question is what if Asian central banks increase their holdings to 10 % of their reserves ?
said Philipp M. Hildebrand , member of the Swiss National Bank , on June 26th , 2006 .
Recognizing gold ’s 10 % recovery towards 500 Euros per ounce , Italy ’s central bank chief Bini Smaghi is now warning that the European Central Bank will adopt the unpalatable option of tighten its monetary policy further , to keep global inflation in check .
“ What counts in evaluating monetary policy is not today 's inflation but the medium - term outlook .
It ’s clear that with an economy that grows at the current pace of 2.7 % and with inflation above 2 % for the coming months , an interest rate of 3.25 % might not be adequate , " he said .
“ To keep it at this level would mean too accommodative a policy that would increase the inflation outlook well beyond 2 % , forcing us to take a highly restrictive move , ” Smaghi said .
But already , a long line of European finance ministers are speaking out against further ECB rate hikes beyond 3.50 % for 2007 , to help preserve the big gains on European stock markets so far this year .
Federal Reserve Handcuffed on Interest rates , Turns to Jawboning
Now that crude oil prices are trying to stabilize near $ 60 per barrel , in the wake of cutbacks in oil output by the OPEC cartel , Fed officials are jawboning about a resurgence of inflation in 2007 .
Chicago Fed chief Moskow warned on November 6th , “ My current assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth being too low .
By my standards , inflation has been too high , and more interest rate increases may be needed , ” he said .
On October 30th , Richmond Federal chief Jeffrey Lacker sounded similar views .
“ The US economy is resilient enough right now to withstand further tightening .
The longer inflation remains elevated , the more difficult it will be to bring it back down .
If the Fed allows inflation to remain above target for too long , expectations could become tightly centered around a higher rate .
This danger is what prompted me to vote at recent FOMC meetings for tactics aimed at bringing inflation down more rapidly . ”
But can the Fed go beyond the Jawboning phase and raise interest further to combat the gold rally and rescue the US dollar ?
An outright decline in US housing prices of about 5 % next year would reduce housing wealth by more than $ 1 trillion , and that could put a significant dent into consumer spending in 2007 .
Depending on which estimate you accept , US consumers extracted about $ 550 billion through cash - out refinancing against the inflated value of their homes in 2005 .

To be sure , as Mr. McClellan said Wednesday , there is more to President Bush 's energy policy than seeking to ensure surplus capacity .
The administration has called for increasing domestic production and refineries , development of alternative and renewable fuels , expanding nuclear energy and , recently , greater conservation .
Still , the Persian Gulf countries are seen as crucial in moderating future prices .
During the 2000 presidential campaign , when high gasoline prices were an issue , Mr. Bush pledged to do a better job of influencing Persian Gulf producers to pump more oil .
Early on , the administration was mostly interested in whether the Saudis would produce more oil during the anticipated conflict in Iraq .
Long before the war began , Saudi spare capacity -- roughly three million barrels a day above the seven million barrels being pumped daily in 2002 -- seemed adequate .
Productive capacity depends on the amount of oil in the ground as well as the infrastructure required to drill , process , store and transport the oil .
In addition , increasing capacity is very costly and time - consuming .
" The long - term capacity was not considered a problem , " said Robert W. Jordan , the American ambassador to Riyadh from 2001 to 2003 .
The Saudis , he added , " never expressed any concern about the need to expand . "
" Nor did we , or at least me , engage them on this topic , " he said .
In April 2002 , when President Bush met Crown Prince Abdullah , now the Saudi king , the focus was not on oil but on Israeli - Palestinian matters , according to Mr. Jordan .
The United States did not press the capacity issue because , even two years later , Saudi officials were publicly expressing confidence that there was no need over the next five years to add capacity .
Going to 12 million or 15 million barrels a day was possible , though , because the country had an estimated 150 billion barrels above the 260 billion in proven reserves , Nansen G. Saleri , a senior Saudi oil executive , said at an oil conference in Washington in February 2004 .
Earlier this week Bush telephoned the Iraqi prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , to reassure him about rumours swirling through Washington that the Pentagon was about to topple him for being useless .
It was reported that Maliki had just two months to get both his army and the escalating violence - running at some 100 deaths a day - under control .
Washington was allegedly searching for a new " strong man " to pull the militias into line and assert the power of central government over Iraq 's catatonic insecurity .
Lending force to these rumours , Republican Senator John Warner has spoken of a deadline for withdrawal and some version of a " three - state " solution .
The Kurds are already autonomous .
Let the same apply to the Sunnis and Shia .
In the west of the country a Sunni body , the Mujahedin Shura , has come out for a six province western region under Prince Abu Omar Baghdadi .
In the south the Iranians are watching as the British cede control and a possible eight - province " confederacy " slides effortlessly under their de facto aegis .
Every US thinktank is now busying itself ( at last ) with alternative futures for Iraq .
Since accurate reporting is near impossible , the scale of that country 's collapse under three years of US and UK occupation is hard to measure .
Civil war is normally indicated by death rates and population movements .
Whether the figure of civilian deaths is 50,000 or ten times that number is immaterial ; either is a horrific comment on the impotence of the occupation .
The UNHCR estimates 365,000 internal refuges in Iraq this year alone .
More are seeking asylum abroad than from any other nation .
A third of Iraq 's professional class is reported to have fled to Jordan , a flight of skills worse than under Saddam .
UN monitors now report 2,000 people a day are crossing the Syrian border .
Over a hundred lecturers at Baghdad university alone have been murdered , mostly for teaching women .
There are few places in Iraq where women can go about unattended or unveiled .
Gunmen arrived earlier this month at a Baghdad television station and massacred a dozen of the staff , an incident barely thought worth reporting .
The national museum is walled up .
Electricity supply is down to four hours a day .
No police uniform can be trusted .
The arrival anywhere of an army unit can be prelude to a mass killing and makes a mockery of the American policy of " security transfer " .
All intelligence out of Iraq suggests this is no longer a functioning state .
For all the abuse which Europeans regularly heap on the American political process , it has one strength , its capacity for course - correction .
A constitution heavy with checks and balances enables it to respond to new circumstances with brutal pluralism .
Three years ago America went to war on a lie , a wing and a prayer .
That war has clearly failed and consensus is disintegrating .
Congress subjects serving and retired generals to searing cross-examination .
Senior figures go to Baghdad and , when they break free of their minders , report independently .
There is none of the executive deference of Britain 's parliamentary committees and tongue - tied " loyal opposition " .
America 's debate on Iraq is now a grim , grinding encounter with reality .
The debate must contemplate the painful but not unfamiliar experience of imperial retreat .
As in Vietnam , Lebanon and Somalia the moment is delayed but the deed will be efficient .
The Baker commission , appearing in full after November 's congressional election , realises the senselessness of the present bloodbath .
It reportedly accepts that the continued presence of foreign forces does not prevent but adds to the chaos .
American troops are in occupation but not in control .
Their departure can hardly undermine security , except possibly that of Baghdad 's green zone , and that is largely privatised .
A measure of the collapse is the astonishing suggestion that America find a new regime in consultation with Iran and Syria .
This can only mean accepting some degree of confederacy , looking to the shadowy militias , warlords and sheikhs for provincial and regional leadership .
Last year 's Iraq constitution negotiated by the American ambassador in Baghdad , Zelmay Khalilzad , remains the best template for this .
It is significant that Maliki , in a recent interview with US Today , referred to the possibility of giving Sunnis and Shia muslims some of the autonomy enjoyed by the Kurds .
Given the sheer scale of civil violence rife in and around Baghdad the price of such autonomy may be population migration , but that is happening on a massive scale already : Iraq is partitioning itself .
It might at least presage a sort of political reconstruction , without which peace and prosperity are inconceivable .
What is humiliating for Britons is that not a whisper of such lateral thinking can be heard from the government .
Downing Street is intellectually numb , like a forgotten outpost of a crumbling Roman empire .
It can see the barbarians at the gates yet it dare not respond as it knows it should because no new instructions have arrived from Rome .
As for parliament , the opposition , academics , thinktanks and most of the media , a zombie - like inertia is all .
Last week 's row over controversial remarks by the army chief , Sir Richard Dannatt , was concerned not with what he said but whether he should have said it .
Every one is waiting for the US to move .
Blair 's last comment on Iraq was that any withdrawal would be " craven surrender " and would endanger British security .
This is mad .
Even Bush can admit to be " open to new ideas on Iraq " .
Blair has clearly not heard of Baker 's report .
Perhaps he should hurry to Washington for new instructions from the boss .

The fine folks at the Future of Freedom Foundation posted a piece of mine on how government cons people into submission .
The timing is a bit unfortunate , since the 2006 election campaign disproved my assertion that politics is perennially dishonest .
Lies and Leviathan
by James Bovard Freedom Daily August 2006
Big government requires big lies — and not just on wars but across the board .
The more powerful government becomes , the more abuses it commits and the more lies it must tell .
Interventions beget debacles that require cover-ups and denials .
The more the government screws up , the more evidence the government is obliged to bury or deny .
The government becomes addicted to the growth of its own revenue and power — and this growth cannot be maintained without denying or hiding the adverse effects of government power .
Likewise , rulers become addicted to prestige and adulation — and these often cannot survive honest accounts of their actions .
Lies have propelled Leviathan ’s growth .
Social Security is the single largest government aid program and the big lie of domestic politics .
From the start , the Roosevelt administration deceived Americans about the nature of the program .
People were endlessly told that it was an insurance program that would give them vested rights akin to a private contract .
But in a 1937 brief to the Supreme Court , the Roosevelt administration conceded that Social Security “ cannot be said to constitute a plan for compulsory insurance within the accepted meaning of the term insurance ” and characterized Social Security as a “ public charity ” program under the “ general welfare ” clause of the Constitution .
On the day in 1937 that the Supreme Court declared Social Security constitutional precisely because it was a welfare system and not an insurance system , the Social Security Administration changed the name of the program from “ old age benefits ” to “ old age insurance . ”
The Brookings Institution ’s Martha Derthick observed , “ In the mythic construction begun in 1935 and elaborated thereafter on the basis of the payroll tax , Social Security was a vast enterprise of self - help in which government participation was almost incidental . ”
In a 1960 Supreme Court case , the U.S. solicitor general stated that Social Security “ must be viewed as a welfare instrument to which legal concepts of ‘ insurance , ’ ‘ property , ’ ‘ annuities , ’ etc. can be applied only at the risk of a serious distortion of language . ”
New groups were continually dragooned into the system , partly as a result of the state ’s “ power to use funds raised by compulsory means to make propaganda for an extension of this compulsory system , ” as economist Friedrich Hayek noted .
When groups such as the Amish objected on principle and refused to pay Social Security taxes , federal agents swept down and seized their cows , buggies , and other property .
The Social Security commissioner , Stanford Ross , after he announced his resignation , conceded in 1979 that “ the mythology of Social Security contributed greatly to its success … .
Strictly speaking , the system was never intended to return to individuals what they paid . ”
If Roosevelt and subsequent politicians had been forthright with Americans — informing them that they were becoming ensnared in a welfare system that quickly became a war chest for incumbents ’ vote buying — far more citizens would have opposed the program .
Deceit and federal programs
Government aid programs perpetually deceive the public on their batting average .
Politicians and bureaucrats are renowned for hyping dishonest job - placement numbers .
Sen . Dan Quayle ( R - Ind. ) , who parlayed his role as chief author of the 1982 Job Training Partnership Act ( JTPA ) into the vice presidency , claimed that the act “ has a job placement rate … for the young people around 70 percent . ”
However , this statistic was actually based not on jobs but on “ positive outcomes ” — which included learning how to make change from a dollar and demonstrating “ effective non-verbal communication with others . ”
The Job Corps , the flagship of Lyndon Johnson ’s war on poverty , padded its success claims by counting Corps trainees as employed simply by confirming that they had had one job interview .
The U.S. Employment Service , which bankrolls state employment services around the country , was long notorious for cooking its books .
A 1977 General Accounting Office study found that the Employment Service exaggerated the number of its job placements by 75 percent .
These false claims have allowed federal agencies to distract attention from numerous studies that show that federal job training is often worse than useless , undermining the work ethic and employability of people the programs purported to help .
Government education programs are notorious for using deceptive statistics to lull parents about the quality of schooling their children receive .
School test data have been manipulated to allow “ all 50 state education agencies to report above - average scores for their elementary schools , with most claiming such scores in every subject area and every grade level , ” as former Education Department official Larry Uzzell stated in 1989 .
Pervasive statistical shenanigans at local and state levels helped inspire the Bush administration ’s No Child Left Behind Act , which purported to bring honesty to education .
President Bush declared in July 2003 that the new act “ essentially says … there is [ sic ] going to be high standards and strong accountability measures to every State in the Union . ”
But the No Child Left Behind
Act itself has become another fount of scams .
The act spurred states to slash their learning standards so that they could claim “ adequate progress ” in the following years , thereby complying with the new law and continuing to receive federal subsidies .
Such false claims of the achievements of public schools have been vital to defending government ’s de facto monopoly on education .
Deceit has long since become institutionalized in some government operations .
In February 2002 , the New York Times reported that a new Pentagon operation , the Office of Strategic Influence , was “ developing plans to provide news items , possibly even false ones , to foreign media organizations as part of a new effort to influence public sentiment and policy makers in both friendly and unfriendly countries . ”
Federal law prohibits the Pentagon from conducting propaganda operations within the United States ( except for recruiting operations ) .
The proposal was widely derided as a 1984 - style Ministry of Truth .
When Bush was asked about the new endeavor , he denied any intent to deceive and declared , “ We ’ll tell the American people the truth . ”
The administration speedily backtracked .
Rumsfeld bitterly announced the shutdown of the new office , and the media quickly returned to treating the pronouncements of Pentagon officials as gospel truth .
Nine months later , Rumsfeld notified the press corps that though the Office of Strategic Information was gone , its controversial activities were continuing : “ You can have the name , but I ’m gonna keep doing every single thing that needs to be done and I have [ sic ] . ”
Rumsfeld ’s comments were ignored by all the major media outlets .
The de facto revival of the Office of Strategic Information was part of a massive redesign of how the government seeks to manipulate domestic and world opinion .
Los Angeles Times columnist William Arkin noted that Rumsfeld ’s redesign of military operations “ blurs or even erases the boundaries between factual information and news , on the one hand , and public relations , propaganda and psychological warfare , on the other . ”
Under the new regime , the Air Force ’s “ information warfare now includes controlling as much as possible what the American public sees and reads . ”
Arkin foresaw that “ while the policy ostensibly targets foreign enemies , its most likely victim will be the American electorate . ”
The sheer number of government interventions can drive politicians to scramble away from the facts .
In 1976 , Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter promised that he would never lie to the American people .
By 1980 , his promise was a source of mirth .
On the campaign trail , Ronald Reagan , after reciting Carter ’s pledge , would comment , “ That reminds me of the quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson :
‘ The more he talked of his honor , the faster we counted our spoons . ’’’
The quip got audiences laughing and nodding because it hit home .
Governor Bill Clements of Texas , a Democrat , condemned Carter as a “ goddamn liar ” for claiming that his oil - profits tax program resulted in an increase in the number of oil wells that had been drilled , as well as the claim that there were more wells drilled in 1980 than in 1979 .
Washington lying
In today ’s Washington , lying for a president may be the ultimate proof of trustworthiness .
Bush chose Elliot Abrams as his deputy national security adviser in charge of democracy promotion , even though Abrams had pled guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress in the Iran - Contra scandal .
( Bush ’s father pardoned Abrams in December 1992 . )
Bush put John Poindexter in charge of the Pentagon ’s Total Information Awareness surveillance network , notwithstanding Poindexter ’s five felony convictions , including two perjury counts , which had been overturned on appeal on legal grounds involving the Fifth Amendment .
Bush also appointed Henry Kissinger as the first chairman of the 9/11 Commission , despite Kissinger ’s legendary record of duplicity .
John Negroponte was appointed first as UN ambassador and then as the national intelligence director , despite his falsehoods regarding the Nicaraguan Contras during the time he was ambassador to Honduras in the early 1980s .
Why do Americans trust government officials when they make it clear that they are not bound by the facts ?
Shortly after his first inauguration , Bush joked to a crowd of Washington insiders , “ You can fool some of the people all of the time , and those are the ones you need to concentrate on . ”
During a May 24 , 2005 , speech in New York , he admitted , “ See , in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in , to kind of catapult the propaganda . ”
Bush ’s solicitor general , Theodore Olson , informed the Supreme Court in 2002 , “ It ’s easy to imagine an infinite number of situations where the government might legitimately give out false information . ”
Lying is part of the larger problem of deference to the government .
If people were not trained to genuflect to their rulers , politicians could not afford to tell so many lies .
Will future historians say of today ’s Americans that “ truth was unimportant and entirely subordinate to tactics and psychology , ” as Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels wrote in 1941 ?
If citizens wish to retain their liberty , they cannot assume that those who seek power over them are honest .
Skepticism of government is one of the most important — and most forgotten — bulwarks of freedom .

While the marriage of iPods and shoes might seem strange to some , die - hard runners and fans of “ Get Smart ” will be happy to know that their iPod Nano music player can now do more than just pump out the tunes : it can also talk to your Nikes .
The Nike+iPod , a partnership between Nike and Apple , consists of an attachment for the Nano and a sensor that fits into specially designed Nike shoes , sold separately .
The sensor wirelessly transmits speed and stride length to the Nano attachment , which plugs into the bottom of the player .
Using special software , the Nano then becomes a training partner , providing time , distance and speed information on its color screen or via voice prompts piped through the headphones .
Once you reach home , the Nike + iPod can connect to your PC or Mac and upload data about your run .
The kit , available online for $ 30 , works best with the Nike + line of shoes , which cost about $ 100 .
The shoes have a small hole in the instep that cushions the sensor .
The sensor itself weighs less than an ounce , so you wo n’t notice it during your wind sprints .

One quasar is rare , three are unprecedented , said Prof Djorgovski
Quasars are powerful sources of energy , thought to be powered by supermassive black holes .
At first , researchers thought the triplet was just an illusion , caused by the splitting of light beams .
But a team using Hawaii's WM Keck Observatory has found the system really involves three black holes .
Each quasar produces massive amounts of electromagnetic energy , including visible light and radio waves .
They are powered by gas falling into a black hole at the centre of a galaxy .
This happens most efficiently when galaxies collide and merge .
A single quasar could be a thousand times brighter than an entire galaxy of a hundred billion stars .
Lensing effect
Professor George Djorgovski , from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , and colleagues studied a system called LBQS 1429 -008 .
Quasars are extremely rare objects - to find three is unprecedented
Professor George Djorgovski
At first , it was thought that one of the quasar pair was a mirage caused by an effect known as gravitational lensing .
This effect is caused by an object of large mass getting in the path of light coming from the quasar .
This splits the light beams , in essence creating a double image .
But astronomers have since identified around 100,000 quasars and dozens of genuine binary quasars .
Professor Djorgovski's team found a third , faint quasar using one of the Keck 's 10 m telescopes and measurements from one of the European Southern Observatory 's 8.2 m telescopes in Chile .
Galaxy regulation
The team used computer modelling to see if the observations could be easily explained by gravitational lensing .
This explanation turned out not to be a good fit .
If the triple quasar had been down to lensing , the astronomers should have seen four quasar sources , not three .
There would have to be something hiding one of the images .
There was no sign of a galaxy , or cluster of galaxies , that could have been the cause of the lensing effect .
The team has also documented small , but significant differences in the properties of the three quasars .
This observation is much easier to understand if the three quasars are physically distinct objects , rather than mirages .
" Quasars are extremely rare objects , " says Professor Djorgovski .
" To find three is unprecedented " .
Professor Djorgovski thinks that the distribution of quasars in the Universe is not random .
Instead , he thinks that the collision and merging of galaxies - and the supermassive black holes that reside at their centres - may actually fuel these powerful sources of energy .
This could explain why there are more than the expected number of binary quasars .
The quasar is being seen during a period of cosmic time when such interactions between galaxies were at their height .
These phenomena may even play an important role in regulating galaxy growth , leading to the joint formation of galaxies and their supermassive black holes - which power the quasars .
Professor Djorgovski said it was also possible that quadruple quasars could yet be found .

Mr Cheney calls Mr Libby " one of the more honest men I know "
Vice - President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , is accused of obstructing an investigation into the leak of a CIA agent 's name .
The prosecution will attempt to show he lied to investigators about his role in the disclosure of Valerie Plame 's identity .
His defence will claim he had no motive to do so - and is set to take the historic step of putting Mr Cheney on the stand .
There does not seem to be precedent for a sitting vice - president testifying in a criminal court .
Washington insiders are salivating at the thought of prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald - a famously tough cross-examiner - harrying Mr Cheney , whose debating skills are legendary .
CIA revelation
Mr Fitzgerald began an investigation more than three years ago into who revealed Ms Plame 's identity in the summer of 2003 to a number of top Washington journalists .
Her CIA connection was disclosed in a column by Robert Novak in July 2003 .

The column was published only eight days after her husband , former diplomat Joseph Wilson , wrote in the New York Times that a key justification for the US - led invasion of Iraq was unfounded .
Mr Wilson wrote that he had been sent to Niger to find out whether Saddam Hussein had tried to buy ingredients for nuclear weapons from the African country .
He said he had found no evidence of it - but that Mr Bush had ignored his findings and made the claim in a State of the Union address before the invasion .
Mr Wilson accused the White House of leaking Ms Plame 's CIA connection to discredit him , or in revenge for his criticism .
The White House denies the allegation .
Mr Fitzgerald never charged anyone with the leak , but after two years of questioning key figures in the White House and the Washington media , he charged Mr Libby with lying to investigators about conversations he had with journalists .
Mr Libby resigned after being charged at the end of 2005 , saying he was confident of being " completely and totally exonerated " .
He faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 1.25 m ( £ 637,000 ) if he is convicted on all counts .
Source revealed
Richard Armitage , who was Colin Powell 's deputy when Mr Powell was secretary of state , has since admitted that he was the original source of the leak to Mr Novak .

Ms Plame says the White House attacked her husband
Mr Libby 's defence will claim that he was too busy with national security issues - he was Mr Cheney 's national security adviser in addition to being chief of staff - to remember the details of his conversations with journalists months after they took place .
Mr Cheney called Mr Libby " one of the more honest men I know " in a television interview ahead of the trial .
The vice - president refused to say if he would testify in person or via videotape .
Experts say the prosecution 's challenge will be to keep the trial focused tightly on what Mr Libby did or did not say to investigators , since Mr Armitage has been revealed as the original source of the leak .
The trial is expected to last about six weeks .
HP : I wonder if you feel that a constitution like the American one makes people more aware of their rights .
AG : I think it does .
Those who wrote the constitution were very steeped in the culture of the printed word and the essays that were written to define the theory of representative democracy .
The debates and the Constitutional Convention were all re-capitulated in elaborate written accounts .
The debates over each precise word actually did focus public attention then , and continue to influence public attention now , to individual rights .
HP : Is a constitution a way of putting certain rights beyond the reach of ambitious men ?
AG : If I felt that was the principal effect of having a written constitution , I would say yes .
If I were a citizen in your country , I would be in favour of it .
But being a citizen of the US and seeing the shocking ease with which these principles have been violated in the US , I 'm worried that the causes of this invasion of rights may be deeper .
HP : The public here and in America have been prepared to put these rights on hold to a degree .
AG : Well , they have , but [ in America ] these rights have been weakened since the Bush - Cheney administration chose to use the war against terror as a basis for both political argument in a partisan context and for an assault on the individual rights , including the right to be free of government eavesdropping .
The conversation of democracy has been degraded , emotions and appeals to fear have been given a priority over reasoned debate .
HP : Has there been a pumping up of this climate of fear ?
AG : Yes , sure .
HP : What was the purpose ?
To extend executive powers or to get people to back the war in Iraq ?
AG : A combination of motives .
The Bush - Cheney administration was declining in popularity rapidly prior to the 9/11 attacks .
In the initial aftermath , Bush responded quite well in rallying public opinion and going after the perpetrators .
But then , for whatever reason , he began to make a lot of mistakes in my view ; by not pursuing Osama bin Laden until he was captured ; by invading a country that had n't attacked us ; by launching this assault on the protections written into the constitution against invasions of liberties .
They conflated the threat from al - Qaeda and the purported threat from Saddam which , of course , did n't exist .
HP : In the days after 9/11 , did you imagine that we would see this kind of attack on civil liberties ?
AG : No , and it should be seen as shocking , in America at least , that so many individual rights have been lost so quickly .
I believe that there has been a diminishing of the role played by reasoned debate .
And when logic and reason are withdrawn from the public sphere , it creates a vacuum into which ideology and religious extremism rush in .
HP : In the Middle East , America and Britain are trying to persuade countries to become more democratic , yet in our own societies rights are being reduced and power centralised .
How does that play in the Middle East ?
AG : America 's power in the world has always been based primarily on moral authority , and if we undermine our moral authority then any exercise of raw military power produces its own resistance .
We 're seeing that in Iraq .
HP : Do you think things can be restored ?
Say you become President , could this happen ?
AG : Well , first of all I 'm not planning to be a candidate , but a new President committed to restoring these rights could do so .
The greater vulnerability we have now involves a rather radical change .
Democracy is ultimately a conversation .
If people are routinely excluded from that conversation or absent of their own choice , then it will be dominated by those who are primarily interested in political and economic power .
Individual rights will be honoured and protected when individuals are full and vigorous participants in the public conversation .

Offer to buy the world a Coke and you 'll probably find plenty of takers .
But try to sell the iconic American drink , and you might meet with some ambivalence among youths these days , particularly abroad .
That 's according to a recent study that compared big global brands it considered " teen relevant , " gathering feedback from thousands of youths in 13 countries - including the United States .
Coca - Cola still topped the chart in terms of name recognition , followed by McDonald's .
But Coke fell to eighth place when it came to likeability , and the burger chain dropped all the way to No. 32 .
Disney and America Online also nose - dived in appeal .
The top three affinity slots went to Sony ( Japan ) , Nokia ( Finland ) , and Adidas ( Germany ) .
Top US finisher : Nike at No. 4 , a somewhat surprising result given that US firms have traditionally wielded a collective hegemony with this very desirable demographic .
" If you wanted to characterize what the ' cool ' brands were for global teens 10 years ago , what they had in common was that a lot of them were from America , " says Chip Walker , executive vice president of Energy BBDO , the market - research firm that ran the study , called GenWorld .
Branding experts differ on the chief causes of the apparent loyalty shift .
They cite factors that range from deft , low - key marketing and product innovation by firms to a political pushback by young consumers .
But the study suggests that control is slipping from brands that try to impose images on teens rather than reflecting teens ' perceptions of themselves .
And experts agree that marketers and even government policymakers would be unwise to shrug off any shifts .
The buying habits of today 's teen market - reportedly worth some $ 170 billion a year in the US alone - stand to alter the economic landscape .
Researchers hesitate to assign a dollar figure to the spending of the so - called " global teen " market , with its shared cultural reference points .
In 1998 , a United Nations report estimated there were 270 million such teens worldwide in the 15 - 18 age bracket .
Smart brands win teen market share by allowing teens to be part of a brand " story , " experts say .
Mr. Walker names the global teen " passion points " as music , media , sports , and communication .
" Adidas , and really all the brands at the top of the list , have ' imaged ' themselves in the same way that these kids see themselves , " says Schuyler Brown , a trend - spotter and former managing director of Euro RSCG , an international marketing - service agency .
" They 're global brands that have really deep tentacles and draw on the local culture very well , " she says , tying promotions to local soccer teams , for example .
Becoming ubiquitous in a culture can attract entire teen enclaves .
Suddenly , " everybody has a Nokia phone , " she says .
It helps to have an ear for " global teen " values , some of which extend across cultures , according to the GenWorld study .
" [ The Adidas slogan ] ' Impossible is Nothing ' resonates with this generation almost like no other campaign that I 've seen , " says Walker , who calls global teens engaged , optimistic , and connected .
Product details matter .
Nokia has held sway over American rival Motorola , he says , because of their emphasis on cellphone design .
Motorola , however , has focused on internal engineering .
Politics , too , can play a role .
Many teens abroad are developing a " new nationalism , " says Ms. Brown .
American brands used to carry edgy cultural cachet , she says .
Today , " teens around the world have become disenchanted with the mythological portrayal of American youth . "
Sometimes that nationalism finds an outlet in satire and humor at America 's expense .
" It 's been very easy to spoof America in the past few years , " Brown says .
Others say that disenchantment could have a dire economic effect .
" America has taken some very unpopular positions on the [ Iraq ] war and the environment , " says Irma Zandl , principal of Zandl Group , a marketing consultancy .
" American brands are starting to suffer as people vote at the cash register , " she writes in an e-mail .
Ms. Zandl points out that a number of leading - edge brands , such as Apple , even take care to point out that their products ( such as iPod ) are designed , if not made , in California , versus the US at large - a move she reads as a kind of separation .
Still , not all experts see country of origin as an issue with teens .
Some doubt whether many US teens could name Adidas 's home base .
Marian Salzman , author of the 2003 book " Buzz , " points out that teens outside the US have " effectively localized " the US brands they like .
" I do n't think there are any concerns on the part of teens as to where stuff comes from , " says Jim Taylor , vice chairman of the Harrison Group , a marketing agency .
He has worked with the trend - watcher firm Intellisponse on its annual surveys of what ( primarily US ) teens want .
" Kids do n't necessarily [ even ] sort out the difference between store brands and product brands , " says Mr. Taylor , pointing to the rise of Hollister , a store brand in apparel that has surged of late .
For today 's teens , he says , online buzz is king , and peers hold the most sway .
" What applies to young people is ' Did it break ?
And did my friends say it was cool ? '
[ It 's an ] opinion process that goes on through IMs and text - messaging , and it applies to everything from movies to cargo pants . "
“ The selection committee is now focusing their discussions on S.M.U. ; however , no final decision has been made , ” Mr. Griffin said .
He said the final decision was expected to be reached within “ a few months , ” although others have estimated the process could be completed within weeks .
Mr. Griffin said he could not discuss the criteria for the selection process , and he said issues concerning financing of the library and control of content , including interaction between the policy institute and the library , had not been decided .
“ The committee has been focused on the selection of the site rather than fund - raising decisions , ” Mr. Griffin said .
“ It could vary depending on what the site would be .
We are in an early phase in the process , and those decisions about how much money will need to be raised will come later . ”
The complex under discussion would include a public policy institute independent of the university and answerable to a Bush foundation , while the library and a museum would be under the auspices of the National Archives and Records Administration .
But control of presidential documents remains a subject of dispute .
About 150 of the university ’s 600 faculty members attended the meeting , voicing a range of concerns , particularly on whether the school ’s academic freedom and political independence might appear compromised by an association with not only the Bush library but also a museum that would accompany it .
Thomas J. Knock , a professor of history , said the public might have trouble differentiating between the library , museum and the university .
James K. Hopkins , chairman of the history department who was co-chairman of the meeting with Ms. Blair , a professor of theater , said he had asked Dr. Turner under what circumstances the university would “ walk away ” from a deal with the library .

The disturbed artist intuited the deep forms of fluid flow .
The Starry Night has really turbulent swirls .
© AP Photo / Mary Altaffer
Vincent van Gogh is known for his chaotic paintings and similarly tumultuous state of mind .
Now a mathematical analysis of his works reveals that the stormy patterns in many of his paintings are uncannily like real turbulence , as seen in swirling water or the air from a jet engine .
Physicist Jose Luis Aragon of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Queretaro and his co-workers have found that the Dutch artist 's works have a pattern of light and dark that closely follows the deep mathematical structure of turbulent flow1 .
The swirling skies of The Starry Night , painted in 1889 , Road with Cypress and Star ( 1890 ) and Wheat Field with Crows ( 1890 ) — one of the van Gogh 's last pictures before he shot himself at the age of 37 — all contain the characteristic statistical imprint of turbulence , say the researchers .
These works were created when van Gogh was mentally unstable : the artist is known to have experienced psychotic episodes in which he had hallucinations , minor fits and lapses of consciousness , perhaps indicating epilepsy .
" We think that van Gogh had a unique ability to depict turbulence in periods of prolonged psychotic agitation , " says Aragon .
In contrast , the Self - portrait with Pipe and Bandaged Ear ( 1888 ) shows no such signs of turbulence .
Van Gogh said that he painted this image in a state of " absolute calm " , having been prescribed the drug potassium bromide following his famous self - mutilation .
Measured chaos
Scientists have struggled for centuries to describe turbulent flow — some are said to have considered the problem harder than quantum mechanics .
It is still unsolved , but one of the foundations of the modern theory of turbulence was laid by the Soviet scientist Andrei Kolmogorov in the 1940s .
He predicted a particular mathematical relationship between the fluctuations in a flow 's speed and the rate at which it dissipates energy as friction .
Kolmogorov 's work led to equations describing the probability of finding a particular velocity difference between any two points in the fluid .
These relationships are called Kolmogorov scaling .
Aragón and colleagues looked at van Gogh 's paintings to see whether they bear the fingerprint of turbulence that Kolmogorov identified .
" ' Turbulent ' is the main adjective used to describe van Gogh 's work , " says Aragn .
" We tried to quantify this . "
Darkness and light
The researchers took digital images of the paintings and calculated the probability that two pixels a certain distance apart would have the same brightness , or luminance .
" The eye is more sensitive to luminance changes than to colour changes , " they say , " and most of the information in a scene is contained in its luminance . "
Several of van Gogh 's works show Kolmogorov scaling in their luminance probability distributions .
To the eye , this pattern can be seen as eddies of different sizes , including both large swirls and tiny eddies created by the brushwork .

Van Gogh seems to be the only painter able to render turbulence with such mathematical precision .
" We have examined other apparently turbulent paintings of several artists and find no evidence of Kolmogorov scaling , " says Aragon .
Edvard Munch 's
The Scream , for example , looks to be superficially full of van Gogh - like swirls , and was painted by a similarly tumultuous artist , but the luminance probability distribution does n't fit Kolmogorov 's theory .
The distinctive styles of other artists can be described by mathematical formulae .
Jackson Pollock 's drip paintings , for example , bear distinct fractal patterns .

Der Gemeinde der Programmierer freier Software haftet seit langem die Duftnote der Weltverbesserer an .
Erst gar kein Geheimnis aus diesem Bestreben macht das etwa fünfzigköpfige Kernteam der Code - und Marketingexperten hinter Ubuntu - Linux .
Hauptgeldgeber der Firma Canonical und der Ubuntu - Stiftung , welche die Linux - Distribution hauptsächlich vorantreiben , ist der schillernde südafrikanische Millionär Mark Shuttleworth .
Er machte mit dem Verkauf einer Sicherheitsfirma an VeriSign ein Vermögen und sich selbst einen Namen als Weltraumtourist auf der Internationalen Raumstation .
Sein Software - Abenteuer hat er nach dem Begriff für " Menschlichkeit " aus der Zulu - Sprache benannt .
Zum Abschluss des Free and Open Source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM ) in Brüssel erläuterte Jeff Waugh , Community - Chef der Linux - Distribution , am gestrigen Sonntagabend nun erstmals vor großem Publikum in Europa die Philosophie des aufstrebenden Free -Software - Projekts näher .
Demnach geht es den Ubuntu - Entwicklern vor allem darum , " die Freiheit als eine Nutzererfahrung erfassbar zu machen " .
Man habe es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht , Werte wie die von freier Software erreichte Unabhängigkeit von den Designvorgaben großer Konzerne " zum Rest der Welt zu bringen " , nicht nur " zu den Geeks " .
Der Fokus liege dabei auf dem Ziel des " universellen Zugangs " .
Ubuntu würde daher etwa auf die Anwendbarkeit für Menschen mit Behinderungen getrimmt .
" Außerdem haben wir ein großes Übersetzungsteam " , damit nicht nur englischsprachige Computerfreaks in den Genuss freier Software kommen würden .
Was das seit etwa zwei Jahren arbeitende Projekt bereits erreicht hat , demonstrierte Waugh mit einem Rückblick auf die ganz in grau gehaltene Voreinstellungsauswahl beim Linux - Desktop GNOME .
Dort hätte man zwar beispielsweise die Wiedergabe von Animationen bis auf den Millisekundenbereich einstellen können .
Die Dialogboxen hätten aber selbst erfahrene Techniknutzer oft überfordert und gleichzeitig oft wesentliche Entscheidungen ausgeblendet .
Eine möglichst große Auswahl ist nicht immer von Vorteil , wenn es auf die Bedienerfreundlichkeit und den Erfolg beim einer möglichst umfangreichen Anwenderzahl ankommt , lernte Waugh daraus .
" Für 99 Prozent der Menschen besteht die Freiheit von Software aus Megapixel " , stellte er einen Vergleich mit dem für viele besonders häufig beim Kauf einer Digitalkamera herangezogenen Kriterium an .
Den leicht bedienbaren und direkt um den Musikgenuss herum gestrickten und mit Lifestyle - Effekten vermarkteten iPod Apples stellte der Australier als ein Vorbild für Ubuntu dar .
Eine " Killer - Applikation " braucht eine auch auf dem Desktop erfolgreiche Linux - Distribution laut Waugh dagegen nicht .
Viel wichtiger sei das Erzielen von Netzwerkeffekten .
Dazu sei es vor allem von Bedeutung , sein Produkt möglichst einfach unters
Volk zu bringen .
" Frei im Sinne von Freibier spielt bei freier Software eben durchaus eine Rolle " , glaubt der Ubuntu - Entwicklungschef .
Die Distribution mit dem minimalistischen Design , die auf Debian basiert und mit einem auf GNOME sowie alternativ inzwischen auch auf KDE aufbauenden Desktop ausgerüstet ist , wird daher kostenlos über eine eigene Website aus einem Vertriebslager in den Niederlanden verschickt – für alle , die sich den Dowload der knapp 550 Megabyte schweren Software - Suite sparen wollen .
" Die Leute verstehen die Freiheit schließlich nur , wenn sie diese selbst erleben können " , begründet Waugh dieses Angebot .
Er erinnerte zudem an das klare Versprechen Shuttleworths , Ubuntu immer kostenfrei verfügbar zu halten .
Geld verdienen wolle man künftig über Support - Angebote , Serverergänzungen , Partnerschaften oder Zertifikationen aber durchaus .
Ohne ein strenges Management der Entwicklergemeinde lassen sich dem Free - Software - Befürworter zufolge die erforderlichen Netzwerkeffekte nicht erreichen .
Bei Ubuntu habe man daher etwa mehrfach die Position eines " Baby Jesus " vergeben .
Diese Entscheider sollen als " kleine Diktatoren " über wichtige Weichenstellungen in der Community wachen .
Nicht zu vernachlässigen sei es zudem , kostenlos Hilfe für Nutzer übers Netz anzubieten .
Ubuntu hat dazu unter anderem ein Wiki sowie eine weitere Foren - Site eingerichtet .
Ausschlaggebend für den mittelfristigen Erfolg sei ferner , offene Standards rund um Linux und die darauf laufenden Medienformate zu etablieren .
Ubuntu selbst , das gemäß der befürworteten Designprinzipien mit einer sehr übersichtlichen Bildschirmoberfläche und Menüführung aufwartet , ist laut Waugh schon recht weit gekommen .
Dank dem verwendeten Paketmanager verlaufe die Installation " aus der CD - Schachtel heraus " etwa schon einfacher als bei Windows XP .
Dass das Microsoft - Betriebssystem auf den meisten Desktop - Rechnern und Laptops schon vorinstalliert ist , sei ein Problem , an dem man arbeite .
Waugh kündigte diesbezüglich für " die nächsten sechs Monate " Nachrichten über eigene Vertriebskooperationen mit Computerherstellern an .
Der versammelten Entwicklergemeinde rief er letztlich ins Gedächtnis zurück , dass " jedes Stück Technik eigene Regeln hat , die oft versteckt sind .
Wir können sie gerade noch verstehen , die meisten Leute erkennen sie aber nicht . "
Es sei daher unerlässlich , die Freiheit etwa auch der Meinungsäußerung in den künftigen Technikarchitekturen fest zu verankern .

Performing Music in the Age of Recording by Robert Philip Yale University Press , 293 pp. , $ 35.00
1 .
Before 1900 in Europe and America , it was at home that music was most often experienced , by family members who played some instrument or sang , and by , willingly or unwillingly , the rest of the family and friends .
( In Western society among the lower middle class and upward , most music was made by women , who were generally expected to learn to cook , sew , and play the piano .
The majority of professional musicians may have been male , like the majority of professional cooks , but most of the cooking and piano playing was the lot of women .
Music , like breakfast and dinner , was part of life at home . )
More exceptionally , music could be heard in some public places — concert hall , opera house , or church .
The public realm was essentially a complement to the private .
It set standards and added glamour .
By the twenty - first century , all this has changed .
Both private and public music are being displaced by recordings .
Few people make music themselves at home anymore .
Because of more cramped living space , it is now inconvenient to house a piano , a once indispensable piece of furniture for any household with even modest pretensions to culture and the instrument that for more than a century was the mainstay of classical music .
Outside the big cities , live public music is disappearing as well .
Most of the smaller towns that used to have a classical concert series have lost that , and if they are too insignificant to sponsor a popular rock group event , their public music must be confined to clubs .
Even live symphony and opera broadcasts have been largely eliminated .
At home today we play records .
Classical and pop radio stations play records .
And often ballet companies and theatrical productions play records in place of hiring musicians .
Robert Philip ’s Performing Music in the Age of Recording is a brilliant analysis of how this has affected performance style .
It is also incidentally , for much of the time , the best account I know of how musical life in general has changed since the introduction of vinyl and long - playing records in the 1950s , which made it possible for records to invade everyone ’s home .
But it starts even further back with the end of the nineteenth century , when recording was invented by Thomas Edison , who recited “ Mary Had a Little Lamb ” into his new machine .
The book is full of fascinating detail cogently presented on rehearsal practices and standards , recording on piano rolls , the different instruments used in orchestras , the way records are edited , and the contrasting musical ideals of performers .
Philip is large - minded , tolerant , and sympathetic to various positions , and consistently judicious .
His main thesis is that recording has directed performance style into a search for greater precision and perfection , with a consequent loss of spontaneity and warmth .
Various expressive devices once common in the early twentieth century have been almost outlawed : “ portamento ” ( sliding from one note to another on a stringed instrument ) ; playing the piano with the hands not quite together ( Philip calls this dislocation ) ; arpeggiating chords …

With the floodwaters still high in New Orleans last week , with 25,000 body bags on their way to the city , with the Gulf of Mexico oil industry crippled - 160 platforms and 16 rigs still evacuated , oil refineries shut down - there was one group of people who , nevertheless , could see some good coming out of the wreckage .
Who ?
Halliburton shareholders .
The Houston - based company - once headed by vice - president Dick Cheney , who was dispatched by George Bush to survey the damage - has been a star performer on the markets since the storm hit the Gulf .
Its shares have risen by more than 10 per cent to $ 65 .
It has out - performed the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which itself recovered last week .
Concerns in the US are mounting that Katrina could prompt a round of ' pork barrel ' contracts - rewarding companies with strong links in the area such as Louisiana engineer Shaw Group - which last week won a federal rebuilding deal .
Meanwhile firms known for their close links with the White House are winning work .
California - based contractor Bechtel won work from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide short - term housing , in the form of ' trailer ' accommodation , to the homeless .
But eyes will be most closely fixed on Halliburton .
Other companies have attracted attention for potential work in the southern states - including some outside the US - Aggreko , the UK - owned supplier of generators , and Wolseley , the plumbing group , for example .
But Halliburton has shone in the markets partly because it is expected to do well out of the catastrophe .
It has outperformed competitors in servicing oil infrastructure and engineering and construction work , such as Schlumberger and Fluor ( which has also won work ) .
According to experts , Katrina was almost the perfect storm for Halliburton .
Estimates of the cost of rebuilding the city range as high as £ 100 billion ( £ 54bn ) .
On 2 September , Congress voted $ 10.5 bn for emergency relief .
Last week the White House asked for $ 50 bn more .
Poe Fratt , analyst at AG Edwards in St Louis , says : ' Oil field services groups will get work on repairing the infrastructure .
Halliburton would expect to win contracts on refineries and production facilities . '
Fratt estimates that some $ 1bn will initially be spent on oil infrastructure .
' Other oil service groups do n't have any engineering or construction like Halliburton 's KBR subsidiary , which will benefit from the broader picture , ' says Fratt .
' And the construction companies do n't have oil services . '
But these observations will be of secondary importance to US politicians and the growing industry of Halliburton watchers .
Many expect that Halliburton will use its legendary lobbying power and close relationship with the White House , via Cheney and others , to win big .
The shadow of the last big win - Iraq - is already looming .
Last week Bush was criticised for underspending on flood defences in New Orleans because of overspending in Iraq - and Iraq has made Halliburton an enormous amount of money .
Before war was even declared over , Halliburton was awarded , a non competitive contract to put out oil well - head fires .
Along with this , it had a long - standing rolling cost - plus deal to supply the army with support from food to accommodation , known as LogCap .
The oil contracts were extended to fuel supply .
Halliburton reported making $ 10.7 bn from Iraq work in 2004 - 05 .
But there was controversy , not only because of how Halliburton won the contracts , but that it overcharged the army for food and inflated the price of fuel it bought in from Kuwait .
Leading the barrage of criticism heaped on the company critics was Democrat representative Henry Waxman , a member of the Congressional Committee on government reform , who last week wrote a 17 - page letter savaging the federal response .
Waxman 's staff say it is too early in the reconstruction effort to decide if there has been any impropriety , but they confirm the committee will be keeping a very close eye on it .
There are differences from Iraq .
For example , KBR , the subsidiary that did much work there , is now up for sale .
As Fratt says : ' If they win a lot of work , it will help the price they finally get for it . '
The oil contracts will mostly be competitively tendered for by private companies owning the assets in the Gulf of Mexico .
For non-oil contracts , instead of a single , shambolic agency , the Coalition Provisional Authority , acting as a central administrative point , there is likely to be a plethora of overlapping federal , state and local buyers .
According to Fema , which has born the brunt of criticism for the response , there are about 30 agencies currently involved .
' They are likely to be streamlined , ' said a Fema spokesman .
So far , the lack of clarity has been exacerbated by squabbling between the White House , the state government , and the New Orleans city authorities .
Will Halliburton benefit from such confusion ?
To date , there has been little major reconstruction work done while Fema has concentrated supplying water , ice , food and shelter .
Last week helicopters dropped sand bags and containers on the breached levees that allowed the city to be flooded .
The work was overseen by the US Army Corps of Engineers ( ACE ) , and carried out by local contractors Boh Brothers and CR Bittman .
ACE is also in charge of contracts for removing storm debris .
In Louisiana and Mississippi , this will be carried out by US contractor Ashbritt , and in Alabama by another , Phillips and Jordan .
ACE was the agency that offered Iraqi contracts .
Earlier this year a ACE whistleblower , Bunnatine Greenhouse , criticised the contracts between Washington and Halliburton , saying the relationship between the company and ACE , was too close .
She pointed to a revolving door , through which army employees moved over to Halliburton .
And she called the oil contract ' the most blatant improper contract abuse I have witnessed in the course of my career ' .
It is unclear how much work will be handled by ACE and how much will be done through the LogCap contract .
In either case , Halliburton is highly likely to be a beneficiary .
Charlie Cray , an advisor to Halliburtonwatch.org , a website that details the company 's contracts in Iraq , says : ' If they have the relevant experience , they are well placed , because they certainly have the inside track . '
Halliburton also has strong connections with Fema .
Joe Allbaugh , formerly chief of staff to Bush when he was governor of Texas and manager of the Bush - Cheney campaign in 2000 , was appointed a director of Fema in 2001 .
According to Senate records , Allbaugh 's Washington - based lobbying company , registered KBR as a client in March .
Cray says : ' He is very close to Bush .
This guy is the Karl Rove of contracting .
It is unclear how much work will go through Fema , but having this guy lobbying for you is going to get all your calls answered . '
So far , the work Halliburton has done after Katrina has come from neither of these sources .
The US Naval Facilities Engineering Command has awarded $ 17 m of repair work at three naval stations in the region .
This was part of a $ 500 m contract with the Navy known as Concap - similar to LogCap - used for natural disaster recovery work .
According to Pratap Chatterjee of Washington - based CorpWatch : ' This is a large amount of work .
It is under the ConCap , which is similar to LogCap .
It shows Halliburton is in there already . '
Chatterjee believes that whichever agencies end up running the reconstruction , the company will be able to take advantage .
Committees and watchdogs will be looking out for other key names .
Some , such as Bechtel , the privately owned construction company that is close to Bush , are well known .
Bechtel 's work for Fema is not governed by a formal contract .
There is a ' letter agreement ' , while Bechtel determines the scope of the work needed .
In the meantime Fema is issuing instruction , or ' task orders ' , as the situation evolves .
The value ' changes frequently ' according the the comp[any .
It could not say if these are cost plus agreements or not .
According to Chatterjee , other , less recognisable , names are worth following for evidence of ' revolving door ' syndrome .
HNTB , an engineering company recently hired Lt - General Robert Flowers to head its federal services subsidiary - the part of the group that would bid for government work .
' If HNTB bids and wins , it will show that if you have the right connections , you get the work , ' says Chatterjee .
But for the time being , as Chatterjee concedes , all eyes will be on Halliburton .
The drug appeared to change brain volume
Methamphetamine users had bigger brain areas involved in attention , motivation and the control of movement .
They also fared worse in tests of brain function , the University of California , San Diego team found .
If the individual was HIV - positive the impairment was even worse , the American Journal of Psychiatry study found .
Abusers of the drug have impaired decision - making abilities
Lead researcher Dr Terry Jernigan
However , in those individuals , the volume of certain areas of the brain appeared to shrink , rather than increase .
The brain regions affected by HIV are those that help with higher thought , reasoning , memory and learning .
The researchers studied 103 adults - some who were HIV positive and some who were HIV negative , and who did or did not use methamphetamine , also known as " meth " or " crystal " .
The drug is a powerful central nervous system stimulant which increases energy and alertness and decreases appetite .
Brain volume change
Each volunteer had a brain scan taken and completed a battery of tests that examined cognitive skills such as learning and recall , verbal fluency , information processing and motor functioning .
The meth users had increased volumes of the parietal cortex and the basal ganglia in the brain , while those with HIV had smaller than normal volumes of the cerebral cortex , basal ganglia and hippocampus .
I 'm not surprised by the findings given the way the drug acts in the brain
Professor Trevor Smart , head of pharmacology at University College London
All of the abnormalities were linked to poorer performance on the cognitive tests .
The researchers said these alterations and impairments could cause problems in every day life for the individual .
Head of the team Dr Terry Jernigan said : " In HIV - infected people , the cognitive impairments are associated with decreased employment and vocational abilities , difficulties with medication management , impaired driving performance and problems with general activities of daily living , such as managing money .
Emerging problem
" The impact of methamphetamine on daily functioning is less well studied , although it is known that abusers of the drug have impaired decision - making abilities .
" These could potentially affect treatment and relapse prevention efforts , as well as things like money management and driving performance , " he said .
It 's important that people with HIV are made aware of the potential dangers of crystal
Will Nutland from the Terrence Higgins Trust
He recommended more research to find out why both HIV and methamphetamine appeared to be damaging to the brain , particularly as the number of people who use the drug and are also HIV positive is growing .
He said it might be linked to brain inflammation .
Professor Trevor Smart , head of pharmacology at University College London , said : " I 'm not surprised by the findings given the way the drug acts in the brain .
" It is relatively well known if you take methamphetamine for a long time , instead of causing an increase in dopamine - which is thought to give the euphoric effect - it causes a decrease with time .
" The basal ganglia is an area where you get a lot of dopamine . "
This controls movement and you sometimes see methamphetamine users who get tremors similar to those seen in Parkinson 's disease , he said .
Will Nutland from the Terrence Higgins Trust said : " This research adds to the body of evidence that methamphetamine can have long term effects on the health of people with HIV .
" It 's important that people with HIV are made aware of the potential dangers . "

Emacs Tips
Here are some more commands you will find useful in Emacs .
Practice them to learn them .
Searching
It is typically useful to be able to search for strings in Emacs .
Emacs provides an incremental search command that is very useful .
You begin the search using C-s .
In the message window at the bottom of the screen , you will see :
I - search :
The cursor will be following this prompt .
Here you can type in the string that you are looking for .
The search is done incrementally as you enter characters in the string .
So , for example , suppose I wanted to search for the word " regions " .
I would type in " r " with no carriage return and Emacs will immediately move the cursor in the main buffer to the next r in the buffer .
Now , when I type an " e " , Emacs will move to the next location of " re " .
After typing characters one of 3 things will happen :
You will find the occurrence of the string you are looking for .
In this case , type C - SPACE ( the control and space keys ) .
This will exit the search leaving you where the character was found .
You will find an occurrence of the string you are looking for , but not the occurrence that you want .
In this case , type C-s again .
You do not need to enter the string again .
The string will not be found .
In this case , you will get the message : Failing I - search
What this means is that string did not occur between the point in the buffer where you started the search and the end of the buffer .
It still might be in the buffer prior to where you started the search .
If you believe that is true , type C-s again .
The search will now wrap around to the beginning of the buffer .
The prompt will change to Wrapped I - search :
If you keep searching beyond your original search point , the prompt will change to Overwrapped I - search
This is an indication that you are searching through text that you have already searched through once .
If at any point you want to abort the search , use the cancel command ( C - g ) .
This will put you back in the buffer where you started the search .
Also , if you type lowercase characters in your search string , they will match both uppercase and lowercase characters in the text .
If you enter uppercase characters , however , it will assume the case is significant and will only match uppercase characters .
There is a similar search that goes up from your current location in the buffer .
This is bound to C-r and uses the prompt
I - search backward
Replacing
Replacement is related to searching .
There are two replacement commands .
The first is global , while the second is incremental .
For each command , you give the string you want to replace , hit carriage return , and then give the string to replace it with .
The global replacement will replace all occurrences of the first string with the second string and then tell you how many replacements were done .
The incremental replacement will show you each occurrence and ask you if you want to change that occurrence or not .
To use global replacement , type " M- x replace - string " .
You will get the prompt :
Replace string :
Type the existing string to replace followed by carriage return .
Now you will get the prompt :
Replace string < old string > with :
where < old - string > is the first string you typed .
Enter the new string followed by carriage return .
You will then see the message
Replaced < num > occurrences .
where < num > is the number of strings replaced .
Incremental replace is actually called query replace and can be executed using M- % .
The first prompt is :
Query replace :
Type the existing string to replace followed by carriage return .
Now you will get the prompt :
Query replace < old string > with :
where < old - string > is the first string you typed .
Enter the new string followed by carriage return .
Emacs will move the cursor in the buffer to the next occurrence of the first string .
You will then see the prompt :
Query replacing < old - string > with < new - string > : (? for help )
Type y to replace that occurrence and move to the next occurrence .
Type n to leave that occurrence unchanged but move to the next .
Use the cancel command ( C - g ) to quit query replace and go back to the point in the buffer where you started the replace .
Canceling will not undo any replacements already done and will leave you at the last occurrence Emacs visited , not where you started the replacement .
If you do not cancel , when you reach the end of the buffer , you will be told how many occurrences were changed as before :
Replaced < num > occurrences .
where < num > is the number of strings replaced .
For both global and query replacement , only those occurrences between your starting point in the buffer and the end of the buffer are changed .
If you want to change all occurrences in the buffer , you must first go to the start of the buffer .
Also , the global replacement is somewhat hazardous to use , especially for short strings , as it also matches parts of words .
So you need to think carefully when using global replacement about whether you will accidentally change some text you do n't want to change .
Regions
The cursor is the dark rectangle visible when editing in a buffer .
It is possible to set a mark at the current cursor position .
When you move the cursor , the mark stays at the old cursor location .
The area between the mark and the cursor is called a region .
There are numerous operations that can be performed on a region .
The most important of these are described in this section .
One thing you can use this for is to quickly move between two points in your buffer .
Set the mark at one point , using C- SPACE then go to the place you want to edit .
When you want to jump back to the saved point , type C-x C-x .
This will swap the mark and the cursor .
Your cursor will be at the previously marked point and the mark will be at your recent cursor position .
In this way , typing C-x C-x a second time will take you back to where you jumped from .
It is often a good idea to confirm that the region includes what you expect before applying a region command .
To do this , just type C-x C-x once to confirm what one boundary is and then C-x C-x again to confirm where the second boundary is .
One thing that regions are very useful for is cut - and - paste and copy - and - paste .
To cut a region , type C-w .
To copy a region .
type M-w .
To paste in the cut / copied text , type C-y ( yank ) .
Note that some commands set the mark in addition to performing their main action .
These commands will print
Mark set .
in the message buffer .
That is why it is a good idea to confirm region boundaries before applying region commands .
More on cutting and pasting
On previous days , we have seen C-d and Backspace as ways of deleting individual characters .
In the previous section , we saw C-w as a way of cutting an entire region .
There are some other useful cut commands :
M-d Cut next word C-k
Cut rest of the line
The cut commands put the text cut into a kill ring .
The kill ring contains the last 30 chunks of text that were cut .
The paste command ( C-y ) pastes back in the most recently cut text .
If that is not the one you want use M-y as your next command .
That replaces the pasted text with the next most recently cut text .
It is called a kill ring because it is circular .
Eventually , you might get the 30th most recently cut text .
If you type M-y again , you will wrap around to the most recently cut text .
Note that C-d and Backspace , which delete individual characters , do not update the kill ring .
These deletions are small and are therefore not worth having each character take up a slot in the kill ring .
It would be just as easy to type in that single character .
Only commands that normally excise multiple characters are saved in the kill ring .
Also , note that if you use multiple cut commands consecutively , they cut text will be grouped together into one entry in the kill ring .
This is very convenient so that you can use C-k to cut multiple consecutive lines and then paste them as a single unit elsewhere in the text .
Undo
I am sure you are all familiar with Undo from using Macintosh and Windows applications .
Undo in Emacs is bound to " C- x u " .
You can issue it multiple times in a row to undo multiple commands .
Typing any command other than undo will stop the undo .
Now , an interesting thing happens .
Your command history now has several undo commands in it .
If you start undoing , you will essentially undo the undo commands .
Think of this as a redo command but it does not have a separate key binding .
If you want to undo all the editing changes since the last time you saved the file use the revert - buffer command ( M - x revert - buffer ) .
If you start a command and then decide you do n't want to complete it , type C -g to cancel it .
Mr. Boyd , 49 , who preaches in blue jeans and rumpled plaid shirts , leads a church that occupies a squat block - long building that was once a home improvement chain store .
The church grew from 40 members in 12 years , based in no small part on Mr. Boyd ’s draw as an electrifying preacher who stuck closely to Scripture .
He has degrees from Yale Divinity School and Princeton Theological Seminary , and he taught theology at Bethel University in St. Paul , where he created a controversy a few years ago by questioning whether God fully knew the future .
Some pastors in his own denomination , the Baptist General Conference , mounted an effort to evict Mr. Boyd from the denomination and his teaching post , but he won that battle .
He is known among evangelicals for a bestselling book , “ Letters From a Skeptic , ” based on correspondence with his father , a leftist union organizer and a lifelong agnostic — an exchange that eventually persuaded his father to embrace Christianity .
Mr. Boyd said he never intended his sermons to be taken as merely a critique of the Republican Party or the religious right .
He refuses to share his party affiliation , or whether he has one , for that reason .
He said there were Christians on both the left and the right who had turned politics and patriotism into “ idolatry . ”
He said he first became alarmed while visiting another megachurch ’s worship service on a Fourth of July years ago .
The service finished with the chorus singing “ God Bless America ” and a video of fighter jets flying over a hill silhouetted with crosses .
“ I thought to myself , ‘ What just happened ?
Fighter jets mixed up with the cross ? ’ ” he said in an interview .
Patriotic displays are still a mainstay in some evangelical churches .
Across town from Mr. Boyd ’s church , the sanctuary of North Heights Lutheran Church was draped in bunting on the Sunday before the Fourth of July this year for a “ freedom celebration . ”
Military veterans and flag twirlers paraded into the sanctuary , an enormous American flag rose slowly behind the stage , and a Marine major who had served in Afghanistan preached that the military was spending “ your hard - earned money ” on good causes .
Gifts for mom | Mother 's Day | Your photos | Special Report U.S. has second worst newborn death rate in modern world , report says Research : 2 million babies die in first 24 hours each year worldwide By Jeff Green
CNN
A 15 - year - old mother holds her 9 - day - old baby in Bangladesh , where 153,000 newborns die each year .
KEY INDICATORS
The report listed 10 measures used to compile the Mother 's Index :
Lifetime risk of maternal mortality
Percent of women using modern contraception
Percent of births attended by skilled personnel
Percent of pregnant women with anemia
Adult female literacy rate
Participation of women in national government
Infant mortality rate
Gross primary enrollment rate
Percent of population with access to safe water
Percent of children under 5 with nutritional wasting SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Parenting Reproduction or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
An estimated 2 million babies die within their first 24 hours each year worldwide and the United States has the second worst newborn mortality rate in the developed world , according to a new report .
American babies are three times more likely to die in their first month as children born in Japan , and newborn mortality is 2.5 times higher in the United States than in Finland , Iceland or Norway , Save the Children researchers found .
Only Latvia , with six deaths per 1,000 live births , has a higher death rate for newborns than the United States , which is tied near the bottom of industrialized nations with Hungary , Malta , Poland and Slovakia with five deaths per 1,000 births .
" The United States has more neonatologists and neonatal intensive care beds per person than Australia , Canada and the United Kingdom , but its newborn rate is higher than any of those countries , " said the annual State of the World 's Mothers report .
The report , which analyzed data from governments , research institutions and international agencies , found higher newborn death rates among U.S. minorities and disadvantaged groups .
For African - Americans , the mortality rate is nearly double that of the United States as a whole , with 9.3 deaths per 1,000 births .
Sub -Saharan Africa remains the worst place in the world to be a mother or child , with Scandinavian nations again taking the top spots in the rankings by the Connecticut - based humanitarian group .
Sweden heads the list , with Niger last .
( 10 worst and best )
The " Mothers ' Index " in the report ranks 125 nations according to 10 gauges of well - being -- six for mothers and four for children -- including objective measures such as lifetime mortality risk for mothers and infant mortality rate and subjective measures such as the political status of women .
Charles MacCormack , president and CEO of Save the Children , said the report card " illustrates the direct line between the status of mothers and the status of their children . "
" In countries where mothers do well , children do well , " he said in a written statement accompanying the report .
But each year , according to the report , more than a half - million women die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth difficulties , 2 million babies die within their first 24 hours , 2 million more die within their first month and 3 million are stillborn .
An unhealthy start As Americans celebrate Mother 's Day on Sunday , " 5,000 mothers will mourn the loss of the newborn they bear that very day in the developing world , " said Anne Tinker , director of Save the Children 's Saving Newborn Lives initiative .
" All children , no matter where they are born , deserve a healthy start in life , " Melinda Gates wrote in a foreword to the report , which was funded in part by the foundation she runs with her husband , Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates .
MacCormack said " significant progress " had been made in reducing deaths in children under age 5 in recent years , but " we have made little progress in reducing mortality rates for babies during the first month of life . "
Causes of death in the developing world were dramatically different from those in the developed world , the report said .
In industrialized nations deaths were most likely to result from babies being born too small or too early , while in the developing world about half of newborn deaths were from infection , tetanus and diarrhea .
The newborn mortality rate in the United States has fallen in recent decades , the report said , but continues to affect minorities disproportionately .
Only 17 percent of all U.S. births were to African - American families , but 33 percent of all low - birthweight babies were African - American , according to the report .
The research also found that poorer mothers with less education were at a significantly higher risk of early delivery .
The study added that in general lower educational attainment was associated with higher newborn mortality .
Tinker said some nations ranked high in part because they offer free health services for pregnant women and babies , while the United States suffers from disparities in access to health care .
" We can do better here , but what 's really important is that we do something " in the developing world , she said .
The report said almost all newborn and maternal deaths take place in developing nations -- 99 percent and 98 percent , respectively .
The newborn mortality rates were particularly high in countries with a recent history of armed conflict , including Liberia and Sierra Leone .
But the report also concluded that political will was more important than national wealth .
A " newborn scorecard " ranking 78 developing nations found that some relatively impoverished countries -- including Colombia , Mexico , Nicaragua and Vietnam -- fare better than others .
Ranking at the bottom of the scorecard were Liberia , Afghanistan , Angola and Iraq -- countries where armed conflict and cultural practices impede newborn survival .
" It 's tragic that millions of newborns die every year , especially when these deaths are so easily preventable , " Gates wrote .
" Three out of four newborn deaths could be avoided with simple , low - cost tools that already exist , such as antibiotics for pneumonia , sterile blades to cut umbilical cords and knit caps to keep babies warm . "
' The good news ' The Mothers ' Index -- which excluded some nations that lacked sufficient data -- highlights huge disparities between the nations at the top and the bottom of the list .
Compared with mothers in the top 10 countries , a mother in the bottom 10 was found to be more than 750 times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth .
In top - ranked Sweden , skilled personnel are present at nearly all births , but in bottom - ranked Niger , such help is available for only 16 percent of women in labor .
" The good news , " said MacCormack , " is that we know what it takes to help these moms and children survive and thrive . "
The report highlights the three areas it says have the most influence on child well - being : female education , presence of a trained attendant at birth and use of family planning services .
Educated women , the report said , are more likely to marry and give birth later in life , to seek health care and to encourage education for their children , including girls .
The report said that family planning and increased contraception use leads to lower maternal and infant death rates .
Many women and children in developing nations , it said , die as a result of births that come at the wrong time -- too close together , too early or too late in the mother 's life .

New evidence from unmanned underwater cameras has proved that dolphins are only pretending to be friendly to humans and that the moment that our backs are turned , a sour and indignant expression returns to their faces .
The discovery , which will traumatise animal lovers the world over , was made when Californian marine biologist Mike Varney sensed that the smiling , chattering manner of dolphins and porpoises was somehow a little insincere .
He set up a series of remote controlled underwater cameras to record ceteceans interacting with swimmers and divers and then filmed the same dolphins as they left their human companions .
‘ It ’s fascinating , ’ said Varney .
‘ As the excited eco -tourists climb onto the boat , still thrilled at their real - life encounter with wild bottlenose dolphins , you can see the dolphins turn away and their cheerful expression suddenly changes .
They looked really pissed off , and were sort of tutting and looking skywards .
It ’s like they were saying ‘I AM SO BORED OF THIS !’
Varney ’s research has also demonstrated that their high - pitched animated chattering is also contrived and phoney .
Amongst themselves , dolphins manage little more than an occasional indignant grunt , and often ca n’t even bothered to reply to other family members .
This is the second major discovery by maverick naturalist Varney .
Last year his remote controlled cameras discovered that gorillas are actually really smiley when they are left to themselves .

One of the things that honest reviewers hate the most , , is the email - or phone call - that thanks them for a " great " review .
An assessment that a review is fair or accurate makes no one squirm .
But calling it " great " makes us worry that we missed some fundamental flaw the manufacturer expected us to spot .
Either that or they think we went easy on them - nudge , nudge - because they advertise with us .

dRubyは ，Railsサーバーと巡回サーバーの間のやり取りに利用している。巡回サーバーは，RailsサーバーのサービスからdRubyオブジェクトを受け取る。そして，指定されたURLのWebページのスクリーンショットを撮る。撮った結果はdRubyオブジェクトに渡すだけでいい。これにより，モデルはRailsサーバー側，巡回や撮影は巡回サーバー側に実装を集約できる。巡回サーバーを増やすには，新しいWindowsサーバーにRubyをインストールし，巡回/撮影用のアプリケーションを起動するだけ。舘野氏はdRubyの利点を「表側のWebアプリケーション以外にも，（裏で）dRubyを使った便利な処理ができる」と語る。「dRuby最高」（舘野氏）。

A group of historians , including representatives of the National Coalition for History and the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations , wrote to Mr. Leonard on Friday to express concern about the reclassification program , which they believe has blocked access to some material at the presidential libraries as well as at the archives .
Among the 50 withdrawn documents that Mr. Aid found in his own files is a 1948 memorandum on a C.I.A. scheme to float balloons over countries behind the Iron Curtain and drop propaganda leaflets .
It was reclassified in 2001 even though it had been published by the State Department in 1996 .
Another historian , William Burr , found a dozen documents he had copied years ago whose reclassification he considers " silly , " including a 1962 telegram from George F. Kennan , then ambassador to Yugoslavia , containing an English translation of a Belgrade newspaper article on China 's nuclear weapons program .
Under existing guidelines , government documents are supposed to be declassified after 25 years unless there is particular reason to keep them secret .
While some of the choices made by the security reviewers at the archives are baffling , others seem guided by an old bureaucratic reflex : to cover up embarrassments , even if they occurred a half - century ago .
One reclassified document in Mr. Aid 's files , for instance , gives the C.I.A.'s assessment on Oct. 12 , 1950 , that Chinese intervention in the Korean War was " not probable in 1950 . "
Just two weeks later , on Oct. 27 , some 300,000 Chinese troops crossed into Korea .
Mr. Aid said he believed that because of the reclassification program , some of the contents of his 22 file cabinets might technically place him in violation of the Espionage Act , a circumstance that could be shared by scores of other historians .
But no effort has been made to retrieve copies of reclassified documents , and it is not clear how they all could even be located .
" It does n't make sense to create a category of documents that are classified but that everyone already has , " said Meredith Fuchs , general counsel of the National Security Archive , a research group at George Washington University .
" These documents were on open shelves for years . "
The Tesla Oscillator
Tesla was experimenting with ways to transmit motive power through the Earth !
Large versions of these oscillators , weighing perhaps 200 pounds , and being about three feet high could transmit usable motive power anywhere on te entire planet .
As fantastic as it sounds , this device can also locate ships , submarines and buildings anywhere on a global scale .
Tesla 's device was purely mechnical , and is outlined below :
Steam would be forced into the oscillator , and exit through a series of ports , the net effect of which was to cause the armature to vibrate at high speed , within is casing .
The casing was by necessity very strong , as temperatures due to pressure heating in the upper chamber exceeded 200 degrees , and the pressure reached 400 psi .
Other versions of the machine were created , designed to produce electrical power , both alternating and direct , ( without the need for rectifiers ) .
The Plan
With this in mind , I began to think of a way in which I could build one of these oscillators more easily than with a steel pressure vessel .
Since the air piston relies on compressed air to effect the oscillating motion , it seemed to me that another way of forcing the piston to move might be useful .
I hit upon the idea of using a magnetic field to create part of the motion .
Having variable frequency AC would be the perfect solution to this problem , allowing flawless tuning of the oscillation frequencies with a simple coil setup , without the need for air or steam at all .
Eventually , the solution which best seemed to fit the job was the one below :
How it works is as follows .
Compressed air entering the inlet port forces the piston head upwards .
However , the piston shaft is impeded from moving upwards by the action of opposing magnetic fields between the two coils .
The current in the coils can be varied to create a field of specific strength , and therefore amount of force required for the piston to rise .
The field pushes down and the air pushes up .
When the air push exceeds the field push , the piston will shoot upwards , but as soon as the piston head rises above the air vent port , the cavity will depressurise .
When that happens , the field will slam the piston downwards , and the hammer head will strike the steel plate at the base .
By varying the air pressure and magnetic field strength , any range of frequencies desired could be created .
Bringing the House Down !
Everything in nature vibrates at a certain frequency .
When an object is vibrated at its natural resonance , it begins to undergo severe shock , as it tries to shake itself apart .
It would be ludicrous to imagine that a tiny oscillator could by itself bring down a building , if not for the principle of resonance .
Like a child on a swing , only a very small force is required to maintain a fairly large reciprocating motion .
A major vibration could be established in a house by coinciding each stroke of the piston with the return of the individual vibrations through the building to where the oscillator is .
Every time the piston hits , it magnifies the force a little more .
At frequencies of 1000 Hz , the force build - up can be very appreciable !
The frequency of resonance is linked to the time it takes for the vibrations to spread out through the building , reverberate , and the " echoes " to return to the oscillator again .
By finding the correct frequency , ANY structure can be destroyed .
In fact , the larger it is , the lower the resonant frequency is , so the easier it is to destroy .
Tesla once joked that he could split the Earth with one of these devices , and no - one ever knew if he was joking ....................
Construction
I am presently considering constructing an oscillator to test , based upon my design on this page .
The device is rather dangerous , so I will need to proceed with caution .
If anyone has any suggestions of further improvements which could be made , please mail me .
A man who claims to have developed a free energy technology which could power everything from mobile phones to cars has received more than 400 applications from scientists to test it .
Sean McCarthy says that no one was more sceptical than he when Steorn , his small hi-tech firm in Dublin , hit upon a way of generating clean , free and constant energy from the interaction of magnetic fields .
' It was n't so much a Eureka moment as a get - back - in - there - and - check - your - instruments moment , although in far more colourful language , ' said McCarthy .
But when he attempted to share his findings , he says , scientists either put the phone down on him or refused to endorse him publicly in case they damaged their academic reputations .
So last week he took out a full - page advert in the Economist magazine , challenging the scientific community to examine his technology .
McCarthy claims it provides five times the amount of energy a mobile phone battery generates for the same size , and does not have to be recharged .
Within 36 hours of his advert appearing he had been contacted by 420 scientists in Europe , America and Australia , and a further 4,606 people had registered to receive the results .
Update 2/24/07 : Naomi
Watts may not have been pregnant back then , but she certainly looks like she is now .
Is Naomi Watts pregnant ?
While everyone is speculating about Nicole Kidman 's belly , now rumors are surfacing that BFF Naomi may be pregnant as well .
I bet they would be psyched to raise their kids together .
Too bad right now it is all just speculation .
Here 's more :
Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper reports it was “ the second time Watts had been spotted visiting the clinic and that she was ‘ sporting a definite glow ’ when she attended the Shakespeare in the Park gala in New York City 's Central Park with beau Liev Schreiber on Thursday . ”
The Naomi and Liev expecting rumors began back in late December when they were seen at a fertility specialist in Australia .
Then in April there were rumors of an engagement .
She has been wearing a lot of baggy clothes these days but she still looks fabulous .
A few more pics of Liev and Naomi at the MacBeth in the Park Summer Benefit so read more

Kurdish officials toured the United States last week to launch a massive advertising and public relations campaign thanking the United States for overthrowing Saddam Hussein and urging U.S. companies to invest in the region .
The campaign looks suspicious to some observers , however , since it is run by an A - list Republican public relations firm that refuses to divulge how much money it is spending .
" The Kurds of northern Iraq just want to say ‘ thank you for helping us win our freedom , ’ " says the voice - over in one of the commercials currently showing nationally on the MSNBC and Fox television channels and in Washington , D.C. , Portland , and the San Francisco Bay area .
On the screen , Kurdish children wave U.S. flags .
" Thank you America , " one says .
" Thank you for democracy , " says another .
The ad campaign , as well as a U.S. tour by Kurdish politician Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman , was put together by the California PR firm Russo , Marsh , and Rogers .
In addition to representing the Kurdish government , the firm founded the " Stop Michael Moore " campaign to discredit the film Fahrenheit 9/11 and a group called Move America Forward , which has brought parents of dead U.S. soldiers to be counter - protesters at peace demonstrations .
The firm has also brought right - wing talk show hosts to Iraq on a " truth tour " to tell " the good news that the old - line liberal news media wo n’t tell you about . "
All were in attendance at the Kurdish government ’s press conference in San Francisco with the head of Move America Forward , local radio talk show host Melanie Morgan , serving as master of ceremonies .
" I believe the mission needs to be completed , " Mark Crowley told reporters at the event , sporting a T - shirt with a U.S. Marine holding two machine guns with a U.S. flag in the background .
His son , Lance Corporal Kyle Crowley , was killed in an ambush in Iraq on April 6 , 2004 .
For the last year , Russo , Marsh , and Rogers has been flying Crowley around the country as part of its Move America Forward campaign .
Like other speakers at the press conference , he did n’t know much about the Kurds , but wanted to support the war .
" I believe the world is in trouble and that those who would do harm to the innocent will continue until they ’ve wiped us off the planet , " he explained .
Another father of a fallen Marine , flown up from San Diego for the event , started to cry as the television cameras rolled .
While he cried , talk show host Melanie Morgan walked across the room , and delivered a hug .
" We wo n’t ever give up on the mission , " she said .
" " Your son did not die in vain . "
Despite appearances , the head of Russo , Marsh , and Rogers , Sal Russo , maintains that the Kurd ’s media campaign has nothing to do with Move America Forward or any of his other work for Republican clients or the Republican Party .
" There ’s not a relationship , " he tells IPS .
" Other than we have a lot of clients and those are two of them . "
But some observers do n’t buy that assertion .
" What ’s going on here is that Russo , Marsh , and Rogers  the PR firm that organized Move America Forward and so - called media tours of Iraq to show how smashingly well the war is going  are engaged in an illegal propaganda campaign aimed at influencing the November [ U.S. congressional ] elections , " said John Stauber , co-director of the Center for Media and Democracy and co-author of the book Weapons of Mass Deception : The Uses of Propaganda in Bush ’s War on Iraq .
Stauber believes the Kurdish government is using U.S. government money to hire the Russo firm , which is then using the money to lobby for a continuation of the war .
It ’s a case that is difficult to prove since neither Russo nor the Kurdish government will disclose where they got their money from or how much they are spending .
" It ’s a very shadowy business , " Stauber says of the public relations industry .
" They do n’t have to disclose anything so we may never really know where they got the money to run these campaigns . "
If the allegations are true , it would n’t be the first such incident .
In 1991 , prior to the first Gulf War , George Bush Sr. signed an executive order directing the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to create the conditions for Saddam Hussein ’s removal .
So the CIA hired a public relations firm called the Rendon Group to run an anti-Hussein propaganda campaign .
As part of that campaign , the group founded the Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) headed by exile Ahmed Chalabi .
Writing in the New Yorker magazine , investigative journalist Seymour Hersh said the Rendon Group paid " close to a hundred million dollars " of CIA money to the INC .
Then , using U.S. tax dollars , Chalabi fabricated evidence of weapons of mass destruction which George W. Bush used to make the case for war in 2003 .
( Inter Press Service )
I ’ve been going through a big pile of applications for the summer internship positions at Fog Creek Software , and , I do n’t know how to say this , some of them are really , really bad .
This is not to say that the applicants are stupid or unqualified , although they might be .
I ’m never going to find out , because when I have lots of excellent applications for only two open positions , there ’s really no need to waste time interviewing people that ca n’t be bothered to spell the name of my company right .
So here are a few hints to review , if you ’re sending out résumés .
A résumé is a way to get to the next stage : the interview .
Companies often get dozens of résumés for every opening … we get between 100 and 200 per opening .
There is no possible way we can interview that many people .
The only hope is if we can screen people out using résumés .
Do n’t think of a résumé as a way to get a job : think of it as a way to give some hiring manager an excuse to hit DELETE .
At least technically , your résumé has to be perfect to survive .
If you do n’t have the right qualifications , do n’t apply for the job .
When the job listing says “ summer intern , ” do n’t ask for a full time job .
You ’re not going to get it and you ’re just going to waste your time .
( It wo n’t count against you in the future , of course , because your original application was deleted so quickly I ’ll have no memory of you when we do get a full time opening and you apply for it . )
OK , this one really bugs me .
Learn where spaces go in relation to other punctuation .
Whenever you have a comma , there is always exactly one space and it ’s always after the comma and never before it .
Thank you .
.
Whenever you have a comma , there is always exactly one space and it ’s always after the comma and never before it .
Thank you .
In the olden days résumés were sent out in the mail and included a cover sheet on top which explained why the résumé was being sent .
Now that we use email , there is no reason whatsoever to send the cover letter as an attachment and then write a “ cover cover ” letter in the body of the email .
It ’s just senseless .
Even stupider is submitting two big Word documents with no body text in the email .
This just gets you spam filtered .
I do n’t even SEE these .
Please do not use cover letters that you copied out of a book .
If you write “ I understand the position also requires a candidate who is team - and detail - oriented , works well under pressure , and is able to deal with people in departments throughout the firm ” then at best people will think you ’re a bullshit artist and at worst they will think that you were not born with the part of the brain that allows you to form your own thoughts and ideas .
The personal pronoun “ I ” is always capitalized .
All sentences must end in a period .
If your cover letter looks like this I will not even look at your résumé :
i m interested in your summer job .
here is my resume
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
Do you Yahoo !?
Yahoo !
SiteBuilder – Free web site building tool .
Try it !
And while I ’m on it , anonymous email accounts and AOL accounts just do n’t send a good message .
They wo n’t exactly disqualify you since so many people use them , but crazydood2004 at hotmail.com does not really impress me as much as name at alumni.something .edu .
Do you really need to know if I Yahoo !?
Do you really want to advertise Yahoo !
SiteBuilder , a competitor to one of Fog Creek ’s products , when you ’re actually applying for a job at Fog Creek ?
In most of the English speaking world it is not considered polite to open letters to a Mr. Joel Spolsky by writing “ Dear Spolsky . ”
One might write “ Dear Mr. Spolsky , ” or “ Dear sir , ” or perhaps , “ Hi Joel ! ” But “ Dear Spolsky ” is usually followed by some story about embezzled funds and needing to borrow my bank account .
Do n’t tell me about one of the requirements of the position and then tell me that you do n’t want to follow it .
“ One of the requirements for Summer Internship says that you need to interview in person in New York City .
I am interested in the position but I stay in East Nowhere , TN . ”
OK , that ’s nice , hon , you stay there .
Another PS , I thought we said in the requirements “ Excellent command of written and spoken English . ”
Oh , yes , indeed , that was our first requirement .
So at least do yourself a favor and get someone to check your cover letter for obvious mistakes .
Like I said , do n’t give me an excuse to throw your résumé in the trash .
I do n’t know why I need to spell these out because they ’re probably listed in every single “ how to send out résumés ” book on the planet , right there in chapter 1 , but I still get more résumés that show an appalling lack of concern for what it takes to get an interview .
Let me try not to be so negative and provide some constructive advice .
Proofread everything a hundred times and have one other person proofread it .
Someone who got really good grades in English .
Write a personal cover letter that is customized for the job you are applying for .
Try to sound like a human in the cover letter .
You want people to think of you as a human being .
Study the directions that are given for how to apply .
They are there for a reason .
For example our website instructs you to send a résumé to jobs@fogcreek.com .
This goes into an email folder which we go through to find good candidates .
If you think for some reason that your résumé will get more attention if you print it out and send it through the mail , that you ’ll “ stand out ” somehow , disabuse yourself of that notion .
Paper résumés ca n’t get into the email folder we ’re using to keep track of applicants unless we scan them in , and , you know what ?
The scanner is right next to the shredder in my office and the shredder is easier to use .
Do n’t apply for too many jobs .
I do n’t think there ’s ever a reason to apply for more than three or four jobs at a time .
Résuméspam , or any sign that you ’re applying for 100 jobs , just makes you look desperate which makes you look unqualified .
You want to look like you are good enough to be in heavy demand .
You ’re going to decide where you want to work , because you ’re smart enough to have a choice in the matter , so you only need to apply for one or two jobs .
A personalized cover letter that shows that you understand what the company does goes a long way to proving that you care enough to deserve a chance .
Some of this stuff may sound pretty superficial .
Indeed , what we ’re really looking for when we look at résumés is someone who is passionate and successful at whatever they try to do .
We like people who are passionate about software .
Writing a shareware app when you ’re a teenager is just as good a qualification to us as getting into MIT .
This is your life story , and by the time you ’re applying for a job it ’s probably too late to change that .
Would I reject someone just because they do n’t quite understand the relationship between the comma and the space ?
Well , not necessarily .
But when I have to find two summer interns out of 300 applicants , here ’s what I do with the résumés : I make three piles : Good , OK , and Bad .
I give the same résumés to Michael and he does the same thing .
There are always enough people that we both put in the Good pile that those are really the only people that stand a chance .
In principle if we ca n’t find enough people we like that we both rated as “ good ” we would consider some people who got Good / OK , but in practice this has never happened .
Much as I ’d love to be able to consider everyone on their merits instead of on superficial résumé stuff , it ’s just not realistic , and there ’s just no reason a college graduate ca n’t get this right .
( Added 1/27/2004 )
The number one best way to get someone to look at your resume closely : come across as a human being , not a list of jobs and programming languages .
Tell me a little story .
“ I ’ve spent the last three weeks looking for a job at a real software company , but all I can find are cheezy web design shops looking for slave labor . ”
Or , “ We yanked our son out of high school and brought him to Virginia .
I am not going to move again until he is out of high school , even if I have to go work at Radio Shack or become a Wal * Mart greeter . ”
( These are slightly modified quotes from two real people . )
These are both great .
You know why ?
Because I ca n’t read them without thinking of these people as human beings .
And now the dynamic has changed .
I like you .
I care about you .
I like the fact that you want to work in a real software company .
I wanted to work in a real software company so much I started one .
I like the fact that you care more about your teenage son than your career .
I just ca n’t care about “ C/C++/ Perl / ASP ” in the same way .
So , maybe you wo n’t be qualified for the job , but it ’s just a lot harder for me to dismiss you out of hand .
The Madrid fashion week runs from 18 September
UN health experts recommend a BMI of between 18.5 and about 25 , and some models may fall well below the minimum .
The Spanish Association of Fashion Designers has decided to ban models who have a BMI of less than 18 .
Unhealthily skinny models at last year 's fashion shows led to protests from doctors and women 's rights groups .
The association agreed to use the BMI - a calculation based on height and weight - in response to local government pressure .
It suggests that 30 % of would - be participants fail this test and this year 's fashion week , which begins on 18 September , will offer medical treatment to excessively thin models .
Outrage
" The restrictions could be quite a shock to the fashion world at the beginning but I 'm sure it 's important as far as health is concerned , " Leonor Perez Pita , director of the Madrid fashion show , was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency .
Madrid 's local government says it wants to set a more positive , healthy image of beauty for teenagers to follow .
You cannot ban skinny women in the same way you cannot ban fuller bodied women

" Fashion is a mirror and many teenagers imitate what they see on the catwalk , " said regional official Concha Guerra .
Spain 's Anorexia and Bulimia Association says if designers refuse to follow these voluntary restrictions the government should legislate to ban thin models .
However , some sections of the fashion world have expressed outrage at the idea of weight restrictions .
Cathy Gould , of New York 's Elite modelling agency , said the fashion industry was being used as a scapegoat for weight - related illnesses .
" I understand they want to set this tone of healthy beautiful women but what about discrimination against the model and what about the freedom of the designer ? " she asked , adding that the careers of naturally " gazelle - like " models could be damaged .
Nine years ago , as a probationary teacher , I was initiated by a fellow probationer , Vasso , into the mysteries of an annual ritual we call .
It 's strictly off the handbook , threatening stuff , not sanctioned by any teaching authority anywhere , that plays reverse psychology tricks on your weirdest most misbehaving kids .
Do not try this technique if you are n't willing to risk everything to get what you want .
It 's worth the risk , though , because if you do it right , your worst student is going to disappear .
The ritual must take place in late May or early April , when there are only maybe three weeks at most left before study leave begins .
When most graduating students have already voted with their feet , and the remainder fall clearly into good / evil camps .
The motivated conscientious students , who do n't want to risk humiliation by being loud about it , or the ne-er - do - wells whose more ambitious parents force them to get up and into class every morning , but are putting in seven hours a day on the teen classic of It 's this latter group whom you will prioritise in seeking this year 's victim for initiation into the mysteries of Do Not Come Into My Class .
Select a student who has potential , but whose presence in your classroom causes a heavier heart , a sinking realisation that your energies will be utterly wasted upon babysitting , reprimands , on keeping a lid on this student 's wisecracks and boisterousness rather than any actual meaningful interaction .
Make sure your student 's attendance record is patchy at best .
If you can persuade him or her to admit to truancy in the past , this mitigates your implementation of Do Not Come Into My Class all the more .
Choose your moment carefully - you should be careful to wait until the end of a lesson where Student X ( let 's call him serial practical joker Ross ) has displayed behaviour of a particularly galling and persistent sort .
To the degree that he knows he has a talking to coming to him .
Preferably , a fair amount of behavioural modification strategies should already have been attempted during the lesson , to no effect .
It all adds weight to your grim faced authority if Student X / Ross is aware you will rip a chunk out of him as soon as the other students leave .
Seat the student calmly and alone in the room , once his or her peers have left at break .
Choose a location for Do Not Come Into My Class where you will not be overheard by any other member of staff .
Speaking quietly , and standing at ease , arms folded , point out to Student X / Ross that you have had quite enough of his infantile behaviour .
Do not mince your words .
Make it clear that you find him a petty fool whose progress you are entirely willing to sacrifice to ensure your classes ' grades do not suffer .
Refer to the small amount of time left before Study Leave starts .
Raise your voice as you list any amount of annoying and petty time wasting infractions .
Make it clear you are angrier than ever before .
Appear to be consumed by frustration , as if unable to speak , temporarily .
Lean in towards Student X / Ross , and fix your eye upon his .
"
You know what ?
I do n't want you in this class any more ..
" Allow that to sink in a second .
" I wo n't make a fuss , or report you missing .
Just do n't turn up .. " Student X will protest - I guarantee it .
What is he supposed to do during lesson ?
Where is he supposed to go ?
Enunciate very clearly indeed : " I do n't care .
" Student X will be horrified .
You , a teacher , breaking the rules .
Rejecting him .
Worst of all , withdrawing your attention .
Forever .
At this point in Do Not Come Into My Class , all students say the same thing .
" You ca n't do that !
" A very calm , even , modulated tone is required .
" Oh yeah ? " Eyes fixed , unmoving .
" My word against yours .
Who they gonna believe ?
" Usually there is an outburst , a railing against fate , you , education , the world , everything that cruelly denies
Ross the autonomy to play with mini video cameras under the desk , flick wet paper pellets , throw textbooks out of the window , lock smaller kids in the stock cupboard , bunk random lessons , swear obscenely at girls and ridicule anyone trying to work .
The unfairness of it all .
He will flounce , remonstrating .
Do not respond .
Simply remain still , arms folded .
You will see , before he goes , a light of acceptance in his eyes .
You have just played your entire hand in the off - message , un - PC , dodgy teacher 's gamble that is Do Not Come Into My Class .
Yes , it 's a risk .
Yes , it 's a gamble .
Yes , he could report you .
But I can assure you that I 've done this ritual almost every year for nigh on a decade .
It 's never failed yet .
Your wicked ruinous wanton troublemaker will disappear .
How ?
Listen .
From this point on , Student X will faithfully attend every single remaining lesson , punctually , with equipment , and will make an attempt at effort .
He or she will restrain the rumbustiousness to ' low level ' and will do anything to avoid a confrontation with you .
Any reprimand will not need to go further than a raised eyebrow in his direction .
His attendance and levels of co-operation will shoot from execrable to exemplary .
You have succeeded , once again , in perpetuating the wicked mystery that is Do Not Come Into My Class .
Now , tell me another way you could have made that happen without paying the kid cash ?
日本語の解説で RubyGems パッケージの作り方や rubyforge 登録までの一連の方法が書いてあるところを見かけたことがないため、エントリーにしてみます。なれると割と簡単です。
優しい RubyGems パッケージの作り方 newgem コマンドでのひな形作 成
http://drnicwilliams.com/2006/10/11/generating-new-gems/
perl には module - starter など 、CPAN モジュールのひな形を作ってくれる便利なユーティリティがありますが、gem でそれにあたるのが newgem というパッケージです 。
使い方は簡単で、 # gem install newgem で newgem をインストールしてから newgem コマンドを実行するだけで以下のようにひな形を作ってくれます。 $ newgem packagename creating : packagename creating : packagename / CHANGELOG creating : packagename / README creating : packagename / lib 〜以下略〜 そして cd packagename してから rake package で gem パッケージがもうできあがります。すてき！簡単！ $ rake package ( in /home / gorou / tmp/ruby / gem/ packagename ) rm -r .config 〜中略〜 Successfully built RubyGem Name : packagename Version : 0.0.1 File : packagename -0.0.1.gem mv packagename - 0.0.1.gem pkg/packagename-0.0.1.gem
これで pkg ディレクトリ以下に gem と tar の package ができあがってます。めっちゃらく ！
なお rubyforge にアップロードの予定がある人は 、packagename は rubyforge のプロジェクトの unix アカウント 名 ( 後述 ) にしておいた方が無難です。
ひな形のカスタマイズ で、普通は lib 以下にライブラリを作ったり、test を書いたり 、README をきちんと書いたりします。その 後 Rakefile を自分なりにカスタマイズしましょう。上の方の AUTHOR = " secondlife " EMAIL = " your contact email for bug fixes and info " DESCRIPTION = " description of gem " RUBYFORGE_PROJECT = " packagename " あたりは適当に書き換えるとして、真ん中あたりの
# s.add_dependency('activesupport ' , '> = 1.3.1 ' ) #s.required_ruby_version = '>= 1.8.2 ' とコメントアウトされている箇所を、依存関係で入れたいパッケージがあれば適当に書き換えます。たとえばライブラリ内部で
ActiveRecord と ActiveSupport を使ってるので gem のインストール時に一緒に依存ライブラリとして追加したければ以下のように。
s.add_dependency('activerecord ' ) s.add_dependency (' activesupport ' ) これで RubyGems パッケージの作り方は終わりです。かんたんに作れますね。

から登録を行います 。 Project full name プロジェクト名です 。Hatena API Graph とかそういう。これは後からでも変えられ( たしか ) ます。 Project Purpose And Summarization これはたぶん rubyforge 管理している人がプロジェクトの 許可 /拒否 するのに使うところなので熱い思いを込めて書きましょう。
ちなみにいままで自分が申請したプロジェクトはほぼ一行の適当サマリーでしたがすべて通ったので、適当でも良さそうです（マテ）。
License 適当なライセンスを選びましょう。 Project Public Description 概要です。後からでも変えられます。 Project Unix Name プロジェクトの unix アカウントの名前です。たとえば example で登録すると、もらえるサブドメイン が example.rubyforge.org になったり、svn のレポジトリ が
/var/svn/example になったりしますので割と慎重に決めましょう。
SCM 好きな方を選びましょう。ちなみに CVS は選んだことがありません。最近の subversion子は問答無用で SVN でいいでしょう。 さて、すべてに記入して submit を押すと申請されます。なお実際にプロジェクトの認可が下りるまでにだいたい数時間〜十数時間かかります。
ssh の公開鍵の登録 rubyforge を簡単に使うには ssh の公開鍵の登録が欠かせません。今後解説する subversion の利用でも svn+ssh で ssh の公開鍵が登録されてると何かと便利です 。
というわけで scp なりなんなり で username@rubyforge.org :.ssh/authorized_keys を置いておきましょう。
subversion レポジトリのチェックアウト プロジェクトの認可が通ったらせっかくなので rubyforge の subversion レポジトリを使ってみましょう 。
チェックアウトは svn co svn+ssh://secondlife@rubyforge.org /var/svn/example ./ な感じで。公開鍵が登録されており ssh-agent や keychain を使ってれば毎回パスワードの入力いらなくなるので楽です。また、デフォルトでは誰でも svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/example ./ の svn プロトコルでチェックアウトできます 。
gem パッケージのアップロード それでは rake package などで作成した gem パッケージをアップロードしてみましょう。プロジェクトページから右上の「 ファイル」を選び、「 To create a new release click here .」をクリックするするとアップロードの画面が表示されます。
そこで適当に入力して ( FileType は .gem にすることを忘れずに！ ) アップロードし、少したつと gem install packagename で登録したパッケージが rubyforge から gem コマンドでインストールできるようになります 。
The US supreme court ruled today that the US president , George Bush , overstepped his authority in creating military war crimes trials for detainees at Guantánamo Bay .
In a rebuke to the Bush administration , Justice John Paul Stevens said the proposed trials were illegal under US law and Geneva conventions .
The ruling could hasten the closure of the US detention centre in south - east Cuba , which was set up to hold terror suspects picked up in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere , beyond the reach of the US constitution and international law .
It raises major questions about the legal status of around 450 men still being held there , and how , when and where the administration will pursue the charges against them .
Two years ago , the court rejected Mr Bush 's claim to have the authority to seize and detain terrorism suspects and indefinitely deny them access to courts or lawyers .
In this follow - up case , the justices focused solely on the issue of trials for some of the men .
The case focused on Salim Ahmed Hamdan , a Yemeni who worked as a bodyguard and driver for the al - Qaida leader , Osama bin Laden .
Mr Hamdan , 36 , has spent four years in the US prison in Cuba .
He faces a single count of conspiring against US citizens from 1996 to November 2001 .
Mr Hamdan has claimed he is an innocent father of two young daughters and that he worked as a driver for Bin Laden in Afghanistan only to eke out a living for his family .
The supreme court justices voted 5 - 3 against the government .
Justice Anthony M Kennedy , regarded as a moderate conservative , joined the court 's liberal members in most of the ruling against the Bush administration .
" Trial by military commission raises separation - of - powers concerns of the highest order , " Mr Kennedy wrote in his opinion .
" Concentration of power [ in the executive branch ] puts personal liberty in peril of arbitrary action by officials , an incursion the constitution 's three - part system is designed to avoid . "
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a strongly worded dissent and took the unusual step of reading part of it from the bench - something he had never done before in his 15 years on the supreme court .
He said the court 's decision would " sorely hamper the president 's ability to confront and defeat a new and deadly enemy " .
Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito also filed dissents .
The chief justice , John Roberts , named to lead the court last September by Mr Bush , was sidelined in the case because , as an appeals court judge , he had backed the government over Mr Hamdan .
Today 's ruling overturned that decision .
The camp , where inmates endure open - ended interrogation and detention , has become an international symbol of the Bush administration 's aggressive anti-terror policies .
Three detainees committed suicide there this month , using sheets and clothing to hang themselves .
The deaths brought new scrutiny and criticism of the prison , along with fresh calls for its closure .
The Bush administration hinted in recent weeks that it was prepared for the court to set back its plans for trying Guantánamo detainees .
Mr Bush said last week that he would like to close the camp , but was waiting for direction from the supreme court .
" I 'd like to end Guantánamo .
I 'd like it to be over with , " he said after meeting European leaders in Vienna last Wednesday .
Today , Tony Snow , a spokesman for Mr Bush , said the White House would have no comment until lawyers had had a chance to review the decision .
Amnesty International responded by calling for the US to " immediately release prisoners or allow fair trials for all detainees " .
Amnesty 's UK director , Kate Allen , said : " This ruling should now lead to the US administration ending the scandal of holding Guantánamo prisoners in defiance of international human rights law . "
She also called for authorities to disclose details about all other alleged anti-terror detention centres .
More than 750 inmates have passed through the prison at Guantánamo , which was erected in the months after the terrorist attacks on the US on September 11 2001 .
The number of prisoners held at Guantánamo has , however , been falling , with no new detainees arriving since September 2004 .
Of the current 450 inmates , the Pentagon has already said it intends to transfer 120 to their home countries .
Asserting that one must first know the rules to break them , this classic reference book is a must - have for any student and conscientious writer .

British psychiatrists are beginning to debate the highly sensitive issue of using LSD for therapeutic purposes to unlock secrets buried in the unconscious which may underlie the anxious or obsessional behaviour of some of their patients .
The UK pioneered this use of LSD in the 1950s .
But psychiatrists found their research proposals rejected and their work dismissed once " acid " hit the streets in the mid-60s and uncontrolled use of the hallucinogenic drug became a social phenomenon .
Today , on the 100th birthday of Albert Hofmann , the scientist who discovered the mind - expanding properties of lysergic acid diethylamide in Switzerland , one consultant psychiatrist is openly risking controversy to urge that the debate on the therapeutic potential of LSD be reopened .
Ben Sessa has been invited to give a presentation on psychedelic drugs to the Royal College of Psychiatrists in March - the first time the subject will have been discussed by the institution in 30 years .
" I really want to present a dispassionate medical , scientific evidence - based argument , " says Dr Sessa .
" I do not condone recreational drug use .
None of this is tinged by any personal experience .
" Scientists , psychiatrists and psychologists were forced to give up their studies for socio-political reasons .
That 's what really drives me . "
LSD was brought to the UK in 1952 by psychiatrist Ronnie Sandison who had visited the labs of the drug company Sandoz , where Dr Hofmann worked .
He came home with 100 ampoules in his bag and began to use them at Powick hospital , near Malvern in Worcestershire , on selected patients with conditions such as obsessional hand - washing or anxiety who did not respond to psychoanalysis .
Dr Sessa has looked back on the papers published by Dr Sandison and others from the heyday of psychedelic psychiatry , and thinks they may have modern relevance .
They claim positive results in patients who were given LSD in psychotherapy to get to the deep - seated roots of anxiety disorders and neuroses .
It took them , as the title of Aldous Huxley 's book has it , from the poem of William Blake , through " the doors of perception " .
Yet when he was a student , says 33 - year - old Dr Sessa , all his textbooks stated categorically that LSD had no medical use .
" It is as if a whole generation of psychiatrists have had this systematically erased from their education , " he says .
" But for the generation who trained in the 50s and 60s , this really was going to be the next big thing .
Thousands of books and papers were written , but then it all went silent .
My generation has never heard of it .
It 's almost as if there has been an active demonisation . "
He says he understands why .
LSD became a huge social issue .
But he argues that nobody would ask anaesthetists to forgo morphine use because heroin is a social evil , and cannabis is now being formulated as a therapeutic drug .
Since the 1960s , when research was stopped on LSD , " depression and anxiety disorders have risen to almost epidemic proportions and are now the greatest single burden on today 's health services .
Therefore , today 's political climate may be just right for the medical profession to reconsider the use of psychedelic drugs " , writes Dr Sessa in an as - yet unpublished paper with Amanda Feilding of the Beckley Foundation which promotes research into the nature of consciousness .
A major conference is being held in Basel , Switzerland , this weekend in honour of Dr Hofmann 's birthday .
Scientists in the burgeoning psychedelic psychiatry movement will be there , alongside artists , musicians and those who look to hallucinatory drugs for spiritual experience .
In the past five years , the international climate has been changing , albeit very slowly .
In the US , Israel , Switzerland and Spain , a few research projects have been permitted into the effects of LSD , MDMA ( ecstasy ) and psilocybin - the active ingredient in magic mushrooms - on the brain .
They look at the use of the drugs in conditions such as post - traumatic stress , obsessive compulsive disorder and the alleviation of distress in the dying .
But Dr Sessa knows it will be an uphill struggle to get research proposals approved and funded in the UK .
He believes the drugs are safe in medical use - given in a pure form in tiny doses and in controlled and supervised surroundings .
But LSD is associated with flashbacks , and brain scans of clubbers using ecstasy have shown damage .
Some psychiatrists are likely to be appalled at the idea .
Former patients of Dr Sandison claimed his use of LSD had caused them long - term problems and attempted to bring a court action for compensation .
Dr Sandison says his early experimentation with LSD in the 50s produced results in difficult cases .
" I recall one young woman .
She had a near - drowning experience .
She developed a severe anxiety state .
It coloured everything .
" We did n't get anywhere with ordinary psychotherapy , so we went on to LSD .
She recalled an extraordinary memory of how , when she was eight , she had gone into a store with her mother and become separated from her .
She went to a counter to ask an assistant and felt a man behind her trying to feel her up .
She felt very confused by this and said she thought it was an odd way of stealing her purse . " he said .
" It was pretty alarming .
She had suppressed all this .
We began to get somewhere and we discovered why she had sexual difficulties with her husband and felt angry towards men . "
In 1954 he wrote his first paper , for the Journal of Mental Sciences , on LSD use in 36 patients .
It concluded : " We consider that the drug will find a significant place in the treatment of the psychoneuroses and allied mental illnesses . "
But by the mid-60s , Dr Sandison had had enough .
The drug had become a street problem .
He gave evidence in a couple of Old Bailey cases where arson and a murder were committed under the influence of LSD .
" I do n't see either ethically or professionally or technically why it should n't be used in the future , " he says .
" But anything done now has to be very different from what we did .
All the expertise developed in those years by a large number of people has been lost so we have to start again . "
This is another of the scams that they perpetrate on us .
For a large number of us , our prescriptions really do n't change outside of the tolerances of human error and daily differences -- " One or two ?
Click .
Click .
One or two ?
Click .
Click .
One or two ?
Click .
Click .
Click . "
I know for a fact that my last two prescriptions have n't changed enough to warrant a new pair of glasses .
How do I know this ?
My ophthalmologist told me so .
Something to the effect of , " this is a very minor change , if you do n't need new glasses , you certainly do n't need to get new ones . "
I 'm no doctor , but I think I understand what he 's trying to relate .
He 's a good guy and why I keep going back every two years to get my eyes checked out .
It 's not for the the prescription , I can tell if I need a new one .
It 's for the eye - pressure tests and all of the other things they look to catch early before they become a problem .
I have a " valid " prescription .
It 's less than a year old .
I always have a valid prescription , but if I did n't for the year and needed new glasses , the eyeglasses store at the mall would have me over a barrel on a technicality .
No longer .
I did n't need to fax anyone my prescription when I ordered from Zenni and Goggles4U .
I entered the numbers on a form on a web page , checked them for accuracy ( about 6 times ) , and hit submit .
My PD was easy enough to measure .
Like all of this stuff , it ain't " rocket surgery " .
This two - year prescription law is protectionist , it 's also pretty much unenforceable .
I can't imagine any " hard time " for using a three - year old prescription .
If your lenses are still working for you and they get scratched or broken and you 're in " prescription limbo - land " there is no reason you should n't consider ordering online and taping up your glasses for the interim .
Better yet , order the $ 25 pair right now and do n't fret .
Lately I 've been busy correcting the work of lots of unsupervised programmers , and I 've come to think something different about this whole debate .
It 's not the tool that matters , but the people choosing the tools .
Their decisions are not rational or based on technical merit , and we can't solve this problem with reason or merit .
There are good reasons to choose Java for some things , just like there are good reasons to choose Perl for other things , or even Python or Ruby or something else .
The problem does n't have much to do with the language .
It 's a failure in management .
Now , I know the you ( Jim ) use Perl in your department , but that you also have regular training for everyone , comprehensive code reviews , and that you follow the technology .
Not too many places I run into seem to do that , even at the technical worker level .
Thinking about that , and after listening to an interview with AT&T's Ed Amoroso , and probably after reading a bit too much Joel Spolsky , led me to think that the lack of management is the problem in these cases .
Aside from the usual , puerile generalizations about pointy - haired bosses , in my fire - fighting work I 've noted several things that set up the problem .
( Update : I 'm not generalizing about managers , just some patterns of behavior I 've seen from some people in those positions .
Being a manager does n't mean you do any of these things :) .
Managers who do n't know enough to do it themselves , and they put too much trust in what the code cowboys tell them
Managers who do n't have a strong technical background , but they like to think they do ( Ed 's comments here are interesting )
Managers who do n't enforce proper coding standards , or do n't even have any
Managers who do n't make their technical people learn more
Managers who do n't give their subordinates the opportunity for formal training ( in any subject )
Managers who do n't know how to measure productivity
Managers who can't or wo n't solve personality disputes between developers
Managers who do n't make their team work as a team
Managers who do n't build a team with diverse skills and use workers are commodities
Managers who are afraid to piss off the tech guys
Managers who want to be liked
Managers who do n't want to work
Managers who ultimately want to protect their ego
There are all sorts of reasons why any of those things might be true , and not all of them are bad or even the manager 's fault :
Ill - conceived company policy
Limited dollars and resources
Lots of work , not enough people
Fear of losing good employees because they might get better jobs if they knew more
Time wasted in useless meetings
Incompetence
... and so on ...
No language is going to solve any of those problems , but I 've heard many Java proponents say that they can take mediocre programmers and turn them loose without worrying about them .
The problem there is n't Java , it 's the lack or worry ( which you should really read as " supervision " ) .
Managers do n't want to manage .
A language like Perl , however , just makes the management problems more apparent , mostly because Perl does n't let you blame some things a Java programmers gets to blame ( and sometimes with good reason ) .
the JVM
the browser
the operating system

There are some generalisations there that I 'm not entirely in agreement with - remember , managers are people too .
But your comments reflect something that I 've been fulminating about for quite a while .
Take a look at any job advert for an IT manager .
What characteristics are they asking for ?
Line management experience obviously , but primarily business management skills , budget management skills etc .
Technical comprehension is * way * down the list , on the rare occasions it even appears .
It 's my contention that to provide a good standard of service an IT manager must have a good technical understanding , as well as an understanding of business priorities .
Not that an IT manager must be a world class coder , or a top notch oracle DBA ; but he or she should at least understand the issues , comprehend software life cycles , testing principles , and be able to see without assistance where code can do one thing easily , and another with difficulty .
That list is specific to managing coders , but the same principles apply to managing an internal IT department .
Most IT managers make choices based on sales pitch , not on technical suitability .
You do n't have to be Donald Knuth to understand the relative merits of different products , you just have to have some understanding of them .
Underlying this IMO is the fact that technical expertise is largely devalued by business people , so the business managers ( possibly the board ) who appoint the IT manager want someone with the same skills as them .
The fact that they have half a dozen accountants who can manage a budget in their sleep , but no one who can tell them why a server costs more than a desktop does n't seem to matter .
In my perfect world , the IT manager would be a business oriented person who can code , but probably not very well .
Someone who can meaningfully translate between business priorities and technical feasibility ( am I bitter about not making the shortlist ?
You bet I am ) .
But that is n't happening any time soon , so ( to return to the topic of the thread ) if we want to promote
Perl to the people who make the language decision , we need to put cbrandtbuffalos very well thought out , and crucially non technical article in front of them - very few of them visit PM , in case you had n't noticed .
How can we do that ?
Suggestions are welcome , but perhaps identifying the right magazines , getting the right journalists on side , and getting well written , business oriented ( not technical ) case studies and articles out there .
--------------------------------------------------------------
" If there is such a phenomenon as absolute evil , it consists in treating another human being as a thing . "
John Brunner , " The Shockwave Rider " .
The way I 've addressed this issue of technical and non-technical managers is to try to champion Brooks '
The Mythical Man-Month .
Despite the age of the book , his conclusions are as amazingly relevant to coding today as they were when he wrote them .
The bit that I 've pulled out and harped on is that there should be two advancement paths within a technical department : project manager and technical manager .
Both need to be equal paths , and people with equal experience and skill in each need to be treated equally in the company ( authority , pay , etc. ) .
Each significant project should have both a project manager and a technical manager assigned and they work together , each focusing on their expertise .
This has been very successful in our shop .
We have several people who are certified project managers and do their job very well .
They handle allocations , schedules , and dealing with stakeholders .
I work as a technical manager where I keep my hands out of the project management software and make sure the technical challenges of the project are taken care of .
I know about other projects going on , I help with code reviews , and I make sure coders know about all of our shared code and best practices .
You can't get this to work everywhere , but I feel rewarded for plugging away until we tried it .
And the success has kept it going .
The project managers really like having someone on the project whose job it is to know the technical bits .
And I feel my time is better spent away from Gantt charts .
As for you other point , I thought about working this into something that we could share somewhere else .
I just wanted to vet it through perlmonks first .
I 'm in The Perl Foundation , so maybe I can ask about throwing up a page on the TPF site somewhere .
Lately I 've been busy correcting the work of lots of unsupervised programmers Hmmm .
Maybe Perl : : Critic needs some greater publicity as an automated management tool . :-) - xdg Code written by xdg and posted on PerlMonks is public domain .
It is provided as is with no warranties , express or implied , of any kind .
Posted code may not have been tested .
Use of posted code is at your own risk .
I do n't think this is a technical problem , or one that we 'll solve with technology .
It 's a people problem .
If you already have a bad situation , an automated tool is n't going to make it any better .
I know you said this with the smiley face attached , but the problem is n't the language .
By the time people get to quibbling about the actual code , they 've already passed through most of other problems that allowed that to happen .
The best thing that people can do , I think , is work together .
Programmers ( or any other sort of worker ) are n't veal calves to shove in cubicles .
Although I wo n't go as far as recommending company retreats , people in the same organization should know each other , and know what other people are doing .
For managers , this means actually inspecting the work of their subordinates and tracking its progress .
You do n't do that with an automated tool .
You actually have to look at the code , and you have to think about it in terms of everything else .
It 's not just the syntax that 's important , but how it relates to everything else .
What does the code let you do ?
More importantly , what does it keep you from doing ?
What decisions does the code make for you if you allow a certain design ?
A good manager could use Perl : : Critic , but tools do n't and wo n't make good managers .

Some notes below your chosen depth have not been shown here
Managers are afraid to piss off the tech guys
Managers want to be liked I 've worked at a job where the problem was the exact opposite of these two statements -- the director of the department had been a consultant -- he believed that the solution to any problem was to throw bigger hardware at the problem , and that the tech folks were just an annoyance that he had to deal with .
Because he came from a semi-technical background , he thought that he was instantly knowledgable in all things technical .
I do n't know about you , but I do n't want an ear - nose - and - throat specialist performing open heart surgery on me .
Likewise , someone who designed a Citrix solution for the company might not have the necessary skills to deal with a 35 k user mail system .
( hell , he did n't even have the skilsl to design a replacement Citrix solution years later , when the Citrix consultants were trying to explain that the system ran best on faster dual processor machines , and he had already blown the budget on quad processor machines that he got a good deal on ( and were discontinued shortly after he bought them ) ) .
In this case , the management only cared if they were liked by other management folks -- they could n't care less about the people who worked around the clock for 2 weeks straight to try to repair a mail system that had tanked .
( but of course , it was the system w/ student 's accounts that went down , not the one with faculty and staff , so it was n't that big of a deal )
When I was appointed ' technical oversight ' for a project , whenever I raised an issue with a solution that our director had proposed , I got bitched at , and told I was wrong .
( the director had actually threatened multiple staff members , and I heard that there was a meeting that he tried taking a swing at one of my former managers ) .
I was informed after I was fired that he had told one of my project managers to try to force me out .
I 'll agree on some of the reasons for such occurances , but we had 12 ' UNIX administrators ' , the most of whom sat idle , and there were two of us who did the majority of the work , because we actually delivered .
( but although we were the only two focused on development , they left us doing production support , and then got pissed off whenever a schedule slipped )
They spent lots of money on training -- they even sent managers to training , but did n't bother sending the people who were actually maintaining the particular systems because they could n't risk having those people out for a week .
Money was n't really an issue , either -- management would go to the board of trustees , explain how they needed another $ 1.5 mil , and when the quote turned out to be lower than they thought , they 'd just buy more systems than needed ( to sit in a store room for more than a year ) ... and of course , there 'd be no budget left for disk upgrades because of it ... well , there was money spent on disks , but they went to a different project , so we did n't have the necessary disk space for our project .
In this case , the director wanted to micro-manage -- he specifically kept overriding what my managers ( yes , I reported to more than one ... I asked for clarification once , and he told me I took orders from any manager who had an emergency , and he refused to elaborate on what qualified as an emergency , and who made the judgement ) ...
So yes , I 'll agree on the management incompetance , but there are a few , possibly outlying cases where managers try to rule by fear , and / or spend the time sucking up to their superiors ( when they 're not playing Jedi Academy at their desk ) , and could n't care less about being liked by their underlings or even trying to do a semi- competant job -- just the appeareance of doing one to their superiors .
And they 're perfectly willing to piss off the tech guys , if it means they 'll go away , so they are n't around to expose their lack of knowledge .
I 've worked at a job where the problem was the exact opposite of these two statements -- the directory of the department had been a consultant -- he believed that the solution to any problem was to throw bigger hardware at the problem , and that the tech folks were just an annoyance that he had to deal with .
I 've had similar experience .
Some of the very best managers I 've worked with have been completely non-technical .
Some of the very worst managers I 've worked with have been ex-techies .
In my experience the divide between good and bad management has very little to do with technical experience , and a lot to do with being able to trust people to do their job well and remove the things that stop them doing it .
Let me just update you all with my personal experience .
Mostly we use Perl .
Our top managent decided to start few projects in Java , very recently .
I casually passed this information to one of my friends , who is a Manager in a good Software firm .
He advised me Not to go with Java , and his reason was purely Non-technical .
Java professionals are in high demand and hence they do n't stick to one place for long time .
This makes project very unstable and Manager has to spend sleepless nights in planning hand - over and recruiting the similar talent .
Back in the early days of the internet ... long , long ago .
The big rule was that no website a browser visits can ever run code on the client system ( except browser limited scripting ) .
In order to allow an " enriched user experience " to be supplied to basically unsecure windows systems owned and run by people who have little awareness of security we have gone away from this basic rule .
I have encountered client systems trashed ( I believe ) by java code unwittingly accepted from the web .
I 've also encountered many systems trashed from the web because windows users routinely run with less tight security than they should because if they do n't loads of " enriched experience " sites wo n't work .
Do n't websites realise that when many users are faced with " download plugin " or " update JVM " they just go somewhere else less threatening .
I do n't see how a similar scenario can ever be brought about by cgi / perl because of the way the whole thing works ( ie. as it was originally envisaged by the wise ancestors ) .
I 've noticed that whenever I encounter a site that is a bit clunky or just downright does n't work there is usually one of these " enriching " technologies behind it .
This is why the websites of many very large companies with large bugets are just crap from a users perspective .
Most people do n't want their experience enriching they just want to buy their stuff and then go do something else .
In fact too much enrichment is n't good for them , though they do n't know it .
Around the world millions of basically sound windows systems are dying under the weight imposed by unrestrained enrichment ( application bloat ) .
I think its the main thing that gives windows a bad rep but its also how windows development corporations make their money .
Like paying a school dentist by the number of teeth pulled - result lots of bare gums .
Unfortunately when open source wallahs are posed the question by website owners " his enriched gizmo can do this why can't your homemade thing ? " the true answer of " cos its a crap idea for reasons you would n't understand " does n't really cut it .
I was recently talking to the head of security for such a company who asked my opinion of their site I told him to go visit amazon cos its miles better than his site and he agreed with me .
In fact I had a bit of a constructive rant and he agreed with everything I said to such a degree that I was a bit worried that he was going to get me the job of sorting it out with perl / apache - way above my pay grade .
I notice some months later they have just anounced a total rework of their presence on the web .
In short , as a web user not as a perlist , I say do n't enrich my web experience - just give me sites that work reliably without forcing me to make security compromises and do n't be a cheapskate run YOUR code on YOUR computer where it belongs not on mine .
Unfortunately the suits do n't seem to look at it sufficiently from the users perspective and in real terms this is where perl really shines - basic reliable sites that always work for virually every user irrespective of their individual software circumstances or security policy .
IT 'S THE ENDUSER , STUPID !
I 've also encountered many systems trashed from the web because windows users routinely run with less tight security than they should because if they do n't loads of " enriched experience " sites wo n't work .
Yeah .
" Enriched " sites suck .
I was updating somebody else 's computer the other day because their free demo of Norton was expiring .
I installed a new AV app for them , and then went out to download Zone Alarm ( because Norton was their firewall , too ) , and Zone Alarm offered to scan me for spyware .
Sure , I thought .
That 's great .
Except that " feature " wanted me to install Active X !
Ack !
In the name of making my computer more secure , they wanted me to install the world 's biggest security hole ???
No thanks !
Random Synapse Firing --
We often hear the comment , " No IT Manager ever got fired for picking Java . "
I have a counterexample at my present client .
The IT managing director was pushed out at the beginning of last year , because of a Java project going horrendously over budget and off the rails .
It was not the programming language that was at fault , but the project management ( or lack of it ) .
Redundancies were made in May , and ironically a large proportion of these had attended the Java certification courses .
Within the organisation , Java programming has acquired a bitter taste in the mouth .
They are favouring C++ which is the language that the 5 year old " legacy " systems were written in .
In terms of Perl use and acceptance , I 'm working on it .
I do have Perl code in use in the production environment , for application monitoring and suchlike .
They 've also got a big downer on Open Source . --

A few small comments : * fastcgi is not purely used for perl .
Eg. it is one of the serving methods of choice for Ruby on Rails
* my experience is that jobs .
perl.org is in fact a poor indicator of the availability of perl jobs .
On any given day , cwjobs .co.uk lists way more perl jobs ( with way higher salaries ) than jobs .
perl.org in banking , telco 's etc .
Many of your points are about the benefit of open source agile environments .
I am happy for anyone choosing Ruby or Python or Perl .
They are relatively equally valid choices .
I think the one choice that is not valid is Java .
Just my opinions !
Thanks for the input .
I 'll add that site to the list .
I 'm still not clear how to present the general perl jobs picture .
I wanted to keep it simple , without listing every internet job bank , but still accurately make the point .
If I was going to list a subset of jobs sites , can the monks suggest maybe a top 5 that they might be familiar with ?
Also , it would be nice to post a link that includes the search .
For example , it appears I could post your link above like so : http://cwjobs.co.uk/JobSearch/Results.aspx?Keywords=perl
I think the one choice that is not valid is Java .
Unless :
You have several million existing lines of Java code
You have a good team of developers who write Java well , meet their deadlines , etc .
You 're targeting a platform that only supports Java
etc .
Basically , the number of companies listing Perl as a job pre-requisite is large relative to other technologies and has been consistent .
It can be illuminating to see this trend graph , which shows the percentage of jobs that contain the search terms : ASP , C , C++ , C# , Java , Perl , PHP , Python , Ruby and .NET on job - aggregator site indeed.com
To deduct any any meaning out of it is left as an exercise for the reader .
If you think of a company 's IT as a solution ( it provides solutions to required tasks ) and in turn think of that as a part of the whole of the company , then , in my experience , IT is not a major factor in a company 's success .
Now I know a lot of people will disagree and miss my point , and I feel that I understand what your arguments will be ( they are obvious ) , but I stand by it .
For example , consider Microsoft ; the quality of their IT has not been the major factor in their success .
I 'm not saying that you should n't strive to improve yourself and others .
But Perl is a valid choice for anything that it can do and your arguments hold true for that set of people who put value in your measurements .
But do n't expect any business to pay it more than affordable lip service .

Edit : g0n - reparented from Re^2 : Why Perl is a Valid Choice at authors request
These are all valid , accurate points ... but can we humble employees get our directors to listen to them ?
I think that the opposing viewpoint is based on a very simple thing ... marketing .
Marketing , rather than programmer skill or the strengths of the language has been the foundation for the success of the languages pushed by the largest software company .
Now , do n't get me wrong ...
I agree that Perl is a valid choice and , for me , it 's the best choice .
But , in my limited experience , I 've known too many IT managers and directors whose only skillset was " management " .
I know that none of them would bother to read anything as technical as PerlMonks :)
They tend to play it safe in order to hide the fact that they do n't know anything .
They will choose the language pushed by the best known company if they have the budget to pay for the development tools .
As a second choice they choose Java because it 's the second best known platform .
They may try to sell it in their meetings as a money saving initiative .
They 'll pretend to be innovative , but they 're still just playing it safe .
I know this has already been said :
In truth , the language choice does n't matter much in many work environments .
It 's the skill and creativity of the developers .
For example , I could build a very capable CGI Web Application using Bash shell script .
If I was pressed to do it , I might even be able to do it with a DOS batch file ( I 'd quit the job first ) .
My opinion is based on experience , but only very limited experience .
I have no formal education and , because of that , I have ( happily ) never been in management .
I 've only been working in this field for about 5 years .
The only reason I can maintain a career in this field , and participate in conversations here , is because I take a certain masochistic pleasure in reading documentation from the first page to the last ... and luck .
So , my perspective is bound to be different , but not wholly unique .
-- -- GhodMode
Open Source : * You can look in and fix perl modules .
*
You can look in and fix perl itself .
That , I think , is actually a bad argument .
What corporate manager wants to spend man-hours and money on fixing the programmin language he chooses ?
Yes , it 's nice that we can if we need to , but using that as a selling point rather implies that we 're going to need to ...
Random Synapse Firing --
Every IT manager worth his salt will know that there comes a time when you need to find out more about your underlying libraries / systems than the API documentation tells you .
With closed - source systems this often means scouring the web for anecdotal evidence or begging the vendor for more detailed information .
Having the source available is the ultimate documentation and can save you lots of hours of guessing and testing .
To then have the possibility to change the underlying system to better suit your needs , legally distribute your changes and even maybe merge your changes back into the mainline distribution , can be invaluable .
So yes , I think it 's a strong selling point .
For clueful people , that is .
All dogma is stupid .
Good point .
' Fix ' implies broken .
I changed it to ' modify ' since that implies choice of different behavior , and that 's what I really meant .
The funny thing is , in my head , I was contrasting Perl to some purchased apps we have that have problems right now .
And , of course , we can't see what 's wrong and we 're waiting for support to figure it out . :)
Thanks .
LOS ANGELES , Dec. 18 — With Judith Regan ’s authors still reeling from their publisher ’s abrupt dismissal , the sparring between the headline - making Ms. Regan and her former employer , Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation , grew more intense , more personal and more specific today over allegations of anti-Semitism .
The News Corporation released what it described as notes from a heated telephone conversation on Friday between Ms. Regan and Mark Jackson , a top lawyer for HarperCollins , the company publishing division which included her imprint , ReganBooks — a conversation that News Corporation officials said was instrumental in her dismissal .
According to the notes , taken down by Mr. Jackson as the conversation unfolded , Ms. Regan protested that the publishing house had not supported her during last month ’s firestorm over a confessional book by O.J. Simpson and related television program , which the News Corporation canceled in the wake of public protests and unease by some affiliate television stations .
“ ‘ Of all people , the Jews should know about ganging up , finding common enemies and telling the big lie , ’ ” Ms. Regan said , according to a transcript of Mr. Jackson ’s notes provided by Gary Ginsberg , an executive vice president of the News Corporation .
I 've lost count of how many clients have requested that music be playing in the background of their website .
As a professional web developer with a few too many years of implementing ridiculous requests , I 've acquired quite a knack for convincing a client that music is a bad idea .
There are obvious exceptions : such as band websites or sites heavily involved in multimedia .
I 'm talking about content - rich sites where the user does not expect ( or want ) a multimedia experience .
The next time a client decides that a bit of oontz - oontz might give them a bit of an " edge , " refer to this list to convince them that they 're really just making their site suck .
It 's obtrusive : Having music playing in the background can interrupt whatever is currently coming through the users speakers .
Many people use their computers as media stations that play music and video .
Having this suddenly interrupted is the equivalent of having a newspaper that jumps off the table and wraps around your head like a facehugger and starts laying headlines in your throat .
There 's probably a better example to use when actually speaking to the client , but you get the idea :
It 's forcing something down the users throat they did n't ask for .
Users expect web pages to contain useful information , not carry a tune .
It cuts off when you click around : Unless you 've got some kind of hidden frame ( if you do , you 've got bigger problems than music right now ) , the sound will cut off every time they click from page to page .
Not all browsers and operating systems support multimedia content :
There are a lot of older browsers out there on the net that might not support multimedia or will have serious issues playing it .
This is a difficult point for the client to argue with because it 's a technical issue .
I always like to present them with the question : " If you had to choose between some users being able to hear music and some having their browser crash OR having everyone be able to view the site without any issues , which would you choose ? "
It slows things down : Having music playing will decrease the performance of the site , especially on slower machines .
Not only will this make the user experience poor during their visit , it 'll also make them less inclined to visit your site again for fear it 'll once again transform things into molasses .
It 's tacky and unprofessional : Play to their vanity : having background music was cool in the mid-nineties when the web was first coming together .
Now it 's not , it 's considered dated and the mark of an amateur .
If you 're gonna put background music in , you might as well put on a pair of hammer pants .
You 're a fossil , go sit in a museum and fart dust .
There 's a reason other sites do n't have music :
Many clients think that since the majority of the web does not play music , by having it on their site they 're being exceptional and will stand out from the competition .
This is wrong , the reason most sites do n't have music playing is because most sites agree that it 's a bad idea .
Just because you 've never seen a site on the web with a giant kitten for a cursor does n't mean that you should be the first one to try .
Not everyone may like your music :
What some people consider ambient and pleasant , others may find to be annoying , elevator music .
Ask them if they 've ever surfed myspace :
Ever gotten to someone 's myspace page and found yourself frantically trying to find the STOP button on the music player they 've embedded somewhere in the abomination they call a profile ?
Meanwhile your speakers are blaring some crappy emo song about crying in dark puddles .
Chances are many clients have experienced this firsthand and can directly relate to your frustration .
If this backfires , however , and the client thinks that since myspace is huge and successful that mimicking them is a good idea , point out that they were voted the # 1 worst website of 2006 by PC World .
It uses up bandwidth :
This is hardly an issue nowadays , but if it 's a high traffic site having music may run the risk of putting it over its traffic limit and costing extra money .
In July , scientists at the University of Maryland announced the development of bioengineering techniques that could be used to mass - produce a new food for public consumption : meat that is grown in incubators .
The process works by taking stem cells from a biopsy of a live animal ( or a piece of flesh from a slaughtered animal ) and putting them in a three - dimensional growth medium -- a sort of scaffolding made of proteins .
Bathed in a nutritional mix of glucose , amino acids and minerals , the stem cells multiply and differentiate into muscle cells , which eventually form muscle fibers .
Those fibers are then harvested for a minced - meat product .
Scientists at NASA and at several Dutch universities have been developing the technology since 2001 , and in a few years ' time there may be a lab - grown meat ready to market as sausages or patties .
In 20 years , the scientists predict , they may be able to grow a whole beef or pork loin .
A tissue engineer at the Medical University of South Carolina has even proposed a countertop device similar to a bread maker that would produce meat overnight in your kitchen .
There are still several major hurdles to clear , like figuring out a way to get stem cells to proliferate cheaply enough that meat could be mass - produced .
But if in vitro meat becomes viable , the environmental and ethical consequences could be profound .
The thought of beef grown in the lab may turn your stomach , but in vitro meat would avoid many of the downsides of factory farming , most notably pollution : in the United States , livestock produce 1.4 billion tons of waste each year .
What 's more , once a meat - cell culture exists , it could function the way a yeast or yogurt culture does , so that meat growers would n't need to use a new animal for each set of starter cells -- and the meat industry would no longer be dependent on slaughtering animals .

One of things that came out of the Google Analyst briefing presentation was a project Google is working on called Lighthouse .
This is what we were able to glean :
With infinite storage , we can house all user files , including : emails , web history , pictures , bookmarks , etc and make it accessible from anywhere ( any device , any platform , etc ) .
We already have efforts in this direction in terms of GDrive , GDS , Lighthouse , but all of them face bandwidth and storage constraints today .
And :
Another important implication of this theme is that storing 100 % of a user ’s data makes each piece of data more valuable because it can be access across applications .
For example : a user ’s Orkut profile has more value when it ’s accessible from Gmail ( as addressbook ) , Lighthouse ( as access list ) , etc .
Richard McManus speculated that it might be a ” a next - generation file search solution that ‘ shines a light ’ inside documents on your desktop ” .
Shii asked : “ Could Lighthouse be a privacy - enabled bookmarks system , like Yahoo My Web 2 ? ”
Having thought about this for a couple of days , I think it ’s highly likely that Lighthouse is Google ’s Online File Management system .
Every file system needs a file management system to organise and set up a file retrieval system and GDrive will be no different .
In fact , the challenges that Google faces in building a file management system for an online drive are enormous .
It ’s also critical .
I ’ve mentioned before that I have been favouring Writely over Zoho Writer simply because I felt it had a superior file management system ( Zoho has improved their system lately but I still prefer Writely ) .
We ’re talking about a couple of dozen word processing files here , imagine how much complex and challenging it gets when you ’re talking about storing ALL of your files on an online drive and what ’s more making that your “ Golden Copy ” .
Problems have already been noted with Google Desktop Search ( GDS ) which breaks when you move files around on your local drive .
Google has an enormous amount of work to do in trying to replicate files with a user ’s local machine and that ’s even without tackling the issue of file sharing .
A key advantage of an online file system is the ease of being able to share documents for collaboration and what not , but that opens up a can full of worms in terms of replication issues , copyright issues , privacy issues .
( This is likely what Google is talking about in terms of Orkut profiles being used as access control lists in Lighthouse ) .
While the challenges are enormous , the rewards for making this all work are enormous .
If you control the online file management system , surely you also control what online application is used to manipulate a file when online .
If you click on an a Word file in your GDrive , ‘ Lighthouse ’ if this is what it is , will surely launch Writely , if you click on an email GMail will open it up , launch an image and the online version of Picasa kicks into action , etc , etc. Kent Newsome asked why Google would bother with Writely .
If you consider Writely in conjunction with my Lighthouse theory then you start to see how Google might successfully lock you into their ecosystem and therefore it ’s important that they can provide the whole picture .
This is looking even more monopolistic than Microsoft has ever been !
Google Lighthouse ( again , assuming I ’m right about it ) just might be the most important Google application of all .
( If you have n’t read my Google / Writely Online / Offline post , it might be worth reading as background as to where Google ’s general strategy could be heading )
Nick FitzGerald forwards me another animated GIF spam that takes the animation plus transparency trick I outlined in the blog post A spam image that slowly builds to reveal its message to a new level .
And it shows why spammers will work around OCR as fast as they can .
Here 's what you see in the spam image : Looks simple enough until you take a look at the GIF file that actually generated what you see .
It 's animated and it has three frames :
The first image is the GIF 's background and is displayed for 10ms then the second image is layered on top with a transparent background so that the two images merge together and the image the spammer wants you to see appears .
That image remains on screen for 100,000 ms ( or 1 minute 40 seconds ) .
After that the image is completely blanked out by the third frame .
My favourite touch is that it's not the entire image that 's transparent , not even the white background , but just those pixels necessary to make the black pixels underneath show through .
If you look carefully above you can see that some of pixels appear yellow ( which is the background color of this site ) indicating where the transparency is .
That is darn clever .

About the VB
About Jurgen Verstrepen
If Verstrepen does n’t stop with that fucking garbage in his columns , I will make sure no official will be his studio guest ever again .
We 've noticed that international and Belgian press described our project VB6015 as an extreme - right political propaganda broadcast .
This is absolutely not the case ; this information is false .
The talk radio show Zwartof Wit ( Black or White ) can be described as " more stimulating talk radio " and best of all compared with the US talk shows like Rush Limbaugh and others .
[…]
The name of the network was inspired by the nickname Jurgen Verstrepen had been using for years in the Flemish media : " Vlaams Bakkes " which means " Flemish Bigmouth " .
About the decision
Art. 34 . § 2 . Private radio broadcasts have to offer a variety of programs . [...]
Either as to content as in broadcasting schedule , there should be no discrimination whatsoever .
[ They mean you should n’t be Islamophobic ; you can tackle the Church , but not Islam ; your can tackle locals but not immigrants . ]
§ 3 . It is strictly forbidden for private radio stations to broadcast programs that jeopardize the public order , public decency , state security or that are insulting to people ’s beliefs or to a foreign state .
[ They mean you should n’t be Islamophobic ; you can tackle the Church , but not Islam ; your can tackle locals but not immigrants ; how can you show porn on radio ?
Does it involve moaning ? ] .
A private radio station cannot broadcast electoral propaganda .
[ Why not ?
Elections are essential to democracy .
And why is it their business ? ]
Art. 35 .
Private radio stations must be independent from any political party .
[ Why ?
Parties are essential to democracy .
And why is it their business ? ]
Art. 36 .
Content broadcasted has to obey current rules of journalism deontology and the impartiality and journalists ’ independency has to be guaranteed .
[ Why are all the state - controlled media then manned by lefties ? ]
Art. 37 .
Broadcasting equipment of private radios should be located in Flanders or Brussels .
[ How can they ever enforce that ?
It ’s clearly incompatible with the freedom to establish a business anywhere in the EU ] .

Mr. Verstrepen became quite popular with a Howard Stern - like weekly Sunday morning Talk Show ( in Dutch , ) simultaneously both on Radio and on TV .
In the show , he covered a wide range of controversial subject with uncensored audience telephone input .
What bothered leading officials and government parties most is that he did n’t back off raising sensitive issues like Muslim immigration , and inviting leaders of the right - wing Flemish independence and anti-immigration party ) as studio guests .
All other Belgian political parties consider the VB to be " racist " and have put a ) around it .
They refuse any cooperation or coalition with the VB , blocking it from the state - controlled media ( like the government - owned Radio and TV - channels VRT ) , and heavily and successfully pressuring private media to do so too .
As the situation became embarrassing because the VB kept winning every election and even ended up as the largest party in the last 2004 general elections , both on the Belgian and the Flemish level , - they had to resort to other measures . [.]
Near the end of 2004 , the VB was convicted in court for being a " racist " party , a trial that has raised some eyebrows here and there , as it was perceived by many as atrial and technically flawed .
Whatever , since the VB was now a , it quickly dissolved itself , and as a Phoenix it formed a " new " party with a different name ( Vlaams Belang ) , and with some minor changes in its political program , but with still the same leaders and the same elected parliamentarians .
The vaudeville goes on , by the way , since the new VB faces a trial once more , simply because one its leaders said in an interview with an American - Jewish magazine to be " " .
The Belgian crown prince Philippe also added to the turmoil earlier this year , by declaring that he would fight the VB because they " " , - thereby violating the neutral political position of the king as required by the Belgian constitution .
Mr. Verstrepen apparently did n’t want to give in to pressures from the government ( and especially from the Socialist parties in the coalition ) to observe some auto - censorship in his Zwartof Wit show .
But his commercial hostsanddiscontinued the show for " " , while no other channel wanted to host the show either .
It was the second time that Verstrepen had to cancel his show .
The first time it was hosted onandbut Belgian ’s prime minister , was .
Verstrepen had to stop it in 2001 .
In an interview with the Dutch newspaperon November 16 , 2002 , Verstrepen told that he was under intense pressure from circles around Verhofstadt who should have said ( in Dutch , ) : ( with thanks to lvb. net for the quote ) .
In the mean time , the popular and flamboyant media figure and rebel Verstrepen was elected as Flemish parliamentarian in the June 2004 general elections as an " independent " candidate for the VB , on the theme of .
He subsequently tried to revive his Radio Show ason the short waves either analog or in DRM ( ) , and broadcasting from outside the Belgian territory .
But his providers in the UK and in Germany were allegedly pressured not to do so .
In his weblog , Verstrepen stated on May 31 , 2005 : Apart from political pressures , the initiative also faced some technical difficulties , as it went from 6.015 MHz over 13.680 MHz to 15.660 MHz .
Moreover , not everybody can listen to DRM yet .
The program was also broadcasted on the , as a podcast , both streaming and as a MP3 file .
Currently , this is the most popular way to listen to the program , as the ether broadcast seems to be discontinued .
But it ’s unclear , on the VB - site " ether " is still mentioned , but their MP3 archive does n’t work either .
Flanders ’s media regulation stipulates that ( political ) broadcasts are subject to a license when transmitted through the ether .
If through the Internet , the VCM must be notified by registered mail .
Some excerpts ( translated into English ) : Verstrepen apparently did n’t either ask for a license nor register his podcasts with the VCM .
Let ’s not focus on the ether - broadcasts , since it is perfectly reasonable that the limited ether bandwidth should be regulated and assigned by the authorities .
Let ’s focus on the Internet podcast instead .
In a preliminary inquiry by the VCM about his station VB6015 , Verstrepen objected that the servers he is " transmitting " from are located abroad , and that the content of his program is targeted to Flemish .
The VCM discarded these arguments in its decision , claiming that the content of the VB6015 program apparently is targeted mostly to Flemish in Flanders itself , and that the programs were actually recorded on Flemish territory by a Media Company called " BCC&V " with its seat on Flanders ' territory .
They considered the actual location of the transmitting servers as a mere technicality .
Furthermore , Radio Stations owned by political parties are outlawed by the Flemish Media regulation .
Verstrepen claims that his station offers a broad coverage of subjects like political gossip , politics , media events , music and trivia about all flavors in society , - is indeed slightly .
Most of the politicians interviewed belong to the VB or at least appear to be very sympathetic towards it .
Political issues selected mostly represent VB issues .
VB1602 is mirrored on the VB - site and apparently the VB supports it .
On the other hand , Verstrepen claims his Station is independent and personal .
He has a point , is likely to be in tune with Christian - Democrat parties too .
And anyways , the friendly link between VB6502 and the VB is really irrelevant as the state - owned and state - sponsored media like the VRT are mostly populated by left - wing journalists and have an official policy of ignoring the VB .
VB1602 just fills a gap in the political media spectrum .
Strictly spoken , the VCM might have a point , but one can wonder if the ban on political Radio Stations is fundamentally not against , and if so , one can easily claim a station is voicing concerns of a , not of aas such .
That ’s how all the other parties do it by the way , quite hypocritically .
Verstrepen has been negligent and reckless not registering his Station .
If the VCM had denied his request , he would have had a much more validcase .
He also could have registered his Media Company BCC&V abroad .
That ’s what the Isle of Man postboxes are for .
Concerning the Internet podcasts , his reasoning could have been that a mandatory preliminary registration is unconstitutional , since the Belgian constitution guarantees Free Press and forbids preemptive censorship or state control of the Press .
It ’s quite clear that the Establishment and the Flemish media Commissars are playing games with technicalities and use a very wide definition of the concept " broadcast " .
What they actually want to do , of course , is to stifle Verstrepen ’s " free radio " and the voice of the " Vlaams Belang " , just because its content is against the convictions of theruling Socialists and Social ( ist ) - " Liberals " .
[ in the Flemish sense are equivalent within the American sense ; in fact the Flemish Liberals gradually evolved into a weak species of Collectivists over the years . ]
For , the decision ( which is not a ruling yet ) , has alarming consequences to be worried about .
If a podcast on the Internet is considered to be a , what about a weblog then ?
Especially when the weblog carries some sound too ?
Since blogged podcasts are sprouting all over , they might be considered to be just a sound - version of a weblog .
None of these podcasts / weblogs has been under scrutiny by the VCM yet .
Verstrepen was singled out , just because of his popularity and because of his connection with anparty .
But where is the guarantee thatorweblogs wo n’t take the heath soon too , if the Internet is not a form of Press but a form of Broadcast ?
Do the Flemish commissars realize they can only succeed then by imposing away of controlling the Internet ?
Luckily , is hosted on an American server , its content is posted from Asia , and the audience targeted arethe inhabitants of the outer moons of Uranus .
Verstrepen announced 2 days ago on his weblog that he will object the VCM decision , that he will file a complaint against Prime Minister ’s Verhofstadt ’s personal podcast on his site , the Flemish and Belgian Federal Parliament ’s podcasts , - and that he willpay the fine and willpodcasting .
As every citizen can report a podcast to the VCM , of which heit might not have been registered , - Verstrepen urges on his weblog today to file complaints againstpodcasts of politicians and government institutions tothe VCM .

Some of the same problems plagued this flight , panellists say
Their views are included in a report by the Return to Flight task group , overseeing how Nasa responds to recommendations following Columbia .
They said leadership shortfalls made the shuttle effort costlier , longer and more complex than it needed to be .
Space shuttle Discovery launched successfully from Florida on 26 July .
The task group 's final report was released on Wednesday .
The views of the more critical seven panellists are individual observations only .
Nasa 's administrator Michael Griffin requested that all individual comments , including the 20 - page critique from the seven panel members , be included in the official task force report .
It was the first flight since shuttle Columbia broke up over the US in 2003 , killing seven astronauts .
Failed recommendations
" We expected that Nasa leadership would set high standards for post - Columbia work ... we were , overall , disappointed , " the panellists wrote in the report .
" It is difficult to be objective based on hindsight , but it appears to us that lessons that should have been learned have not been . "
The seven critics included a former shuttle astronaut , former undersecretary of the Navy , a former congressional budget office director , former moon rocket engineer , a retired nuclear engineer and two university professors .
They were part of the 26 - member Return to Flight task group appointed to evaluate how the US space agency meets the recommendations by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( Caib ) .
The task group concluded in an advance summary in late June - just a month before Discovery 's launch - that Nasa had failed to satisfy three of the 15 return to flight recommendations .
Those three failed recommendations were : an inability to prevent dangerous pieces of foam and ice from breaking off the fuel tank during launch ; no capability to fix damage to the shuttle in orbit ; and a failure to make the shuttle less vulnerable to debris strikes .
But during launch on 26 July , a 1lb ( 450g ) chunk of foam debris peeled away from the external fuel tank , though , fortunately , the foam did not hit Discovery .
Nevertheless , Nasa has since grounded the entire shuttle fleet until the problem has been fixed .
A new direction
The Nintendo Wii represents a bold new direction for the company , one that came as somewhat of a surprise .
The integration of a motion - sensitive controller combined with the decision to go with a more modest technological improvement in processing power and graphics were both risky decisions , and the jury is still out on how successful these gambles will play out .
Recently , Nintendo released an interview from with some key executives and engineers at Nintendo .
The topic of discussion was the reasoning behind the company 's design decisions with the Wii , and what benefits they expected to receive from these decisions that would give them an advantage over their competitors .
The interview featured Iwata Satoru , Nintendo's president and CEO ; Takeda Genyo , the head of development ; and engineers Takamoto Jouji , Ashida Kenichiro , and Shiota Kou from the company 's various design departments .
All of them seemed excited and cautiously optimistic about the Wii's chances in the market , and were more than happy to discuss how they came to the decisions about the console .
Lessons from the GameCube
Nintendo dominated the market with their original NES console , but every generation since then has seen them not only grabbing a lower percentage of overall sales , but selling fewer consoles than they had in the previous generation .
While some competitors , such as Sega , have exited the hardware business , the arrival of Sony and Microsoft has turned what was traditionally a two - way race to a much more difficult three - way competition .
On the flip side , Nintendo has been doing extremely well in the portable console market , with its GameBoy series dominating the landscape .
Even the arrival of Sony's PSP has n't dented Nintendo 's dominance in this arena : while the PSP and DS battle it out for first place , the lower - powered GameBoy Advance continues to rake in the cash .
Data source : Nintendo
During this time , Nintendo has been observing something that many industry analysts have been warning about : the runaway costs of video game development .
As each new console generation has been released , the amount of time and money required to generate more detailed content for new games has been rising exponentially .
Takeda explained the predicament that developers were finding themselves in :
" It was around a year after we started the development of the Wii , " he recalled .
" When talking with our development partners , I noticed that there is no end to the wants a person can have when they keep thinking of making things better .
It is n't like a person who gained one then reaches for two , and then for three .
Its more like five , ten , 30 , then 100 and onwards .
These wishes exponentially increase .
If we simply follow these , we 'd end up with a disaster . "
Data sources : Business Week ; www.eurogamer.net; www.buzzcut.com; www.erasmatazz.com
It was this potential disaster that Takeda wanted to avoid .
Engineer Shiota realized that simply going with " cutting - edge technology in a normal way " would lead to " higher performance and more glitz . "
This race for performance can be tracked by the increasing power of the central processing unit .
Chips such as the triple - core Xenon in the Xbox 360 and the Cell in the PlayStation 3 use much more power than their predecessors in order to deliver next - gen performance .
" More glitz " is always welcome in any new generation , but at some point one runs into laws of diminishing returns .
Shiota wondered if advances in technology could be used in a different way .
The Wii was designed to take processor technology improvements and use them to make the unit run with less heat , by making the chips smaller .
This enabled features that other consoles could n't duplicate , such as the ability to leave the console powered on all the time ( we 'll return to this later ) .
Shiota admitted that this was a risky decision .
" Diverging from the road map takes a fair amount of courage , " he said , " especially when we did n't have a clear image of what we were going to do with this hardware . "
However , once he saw the power level reduction ( from one - third to as little as one - fourth that of current hardware ) he was very excited .
Instead of competing on " how many more times the CPU is going to be faster , how much more memory is going to be on the machine , and how many more polygons can be rendered " he saw Nintendo as being able to do something different and unique .
Of course , performance was still an issue .
Takeda pointed out that increasing the CPU performance was still a goal , and the team was aiming at " high performance , low power " rather than looking for economy on both sides .
The Wii's CPU , while retaining compatibility with the GameCube 's G3 - inspired Gekko chip , will have additional features and performance that developers will be able to take advantage of .
In addition , of course , there is the motion - sensitive controller technology , which adds a new dimension to game play .

It is a conventional wisdom and as far I know , unlike some others not a malicious one that the native civilizations of the Americas had an oral tradition rather then a written one .
It looks as though the Inca with the help of Gary Urton and Carrie J. Brezine of Harvard University may prove that history mistaken .
Unraveling an Incan mystery
WASHINGTON – The Incas ’ curious knotted strings called khipu were probably used by bosses and accountants to keep track of taxes and tributes and carried both words and numerical information , two experts said yesterday .
Many of these strings have turned out to be a type of accounting system , but interpreting them has been complex .
The Inca have long been described as an advanced civilization excepting that they frustrated anthropologists who thought of writing as the benchmark for complexity .
The Inca did have everything else – a monetary system , political institutions , mathematics , art and architecture .
Urton and his team of researchers have taken their theories about khipu a step further ( see the January 2007 print edition of Wired ) .
They think the knots ( photo at link ) are clearly more then simple bookkeeping and contain a complex language that is akin to a three - dimensional binary code .
As Wired points out this could be the most important discovery in language and writing since the deciphering of ancient hieroglyphics .
The right - wing bloggers obsession about denying the level of civil strife in Iraq reminds me of Holocaust deniers .
While they seize the opportunity to use Holocaust denial by Iran ’s current president to condemn him , Holocaust denial has been a hallmark of America ’s fringe Right since the fifties .
The denial of inconvenient truths are and have always been a full time occupation of the unAmerican Right , Tracing “ Jamil Hussein ’s ” footsteps and ignoring anti-blog hatred .
By Michelle Malkin · December 20 , 2006 03:17 PM
This is not just one story .
It is at least 61 .
And all of these .
And this big one .
It is not about conservative bloggers ignoring the bona fide , grim realities on the ground .
It is about the credibility , veracity , trustworthiness , and accountability of the world ’s “ essential global news network ” –more important than ever in a time of war .
Some notes on Malkin ’s post and the genuflecting echo across the blogs of wing - nuttia : Malkin is still calling Jamail Hussein Jamil Hussein .
You ca n’t confirm sources if you ca n’t spell the name correctly .
I do n’t read Makin ’s blog very often , but it is amazing how often she uses titles to her posts that portray her as some poor beleaguered victim while at the same time using wild speculation and bizarre suppositions to drag her opponents of the moment through the mud .
The names game can get confusing , but let ’s introduce or rather reintroduce a name into the proceedings – Imad al - Hasimi – New Savage Twist to Violence in Baghdad
Imad al - Hasimi , a Sunni elder in Hurriyah , confirmed Hussein ’s account .
He told Al - Arabiya television he saw people who were soaked in kerosene , then set afire , burning before his eyes .
While I have read this name once at Hotair it generally goes unmentioned or the importance of it has not taken root in the brains of the Iraq Civil War - Kerosene Deniers .
No one on the right has questioned his existence or his account of events .
I do n’t have time to read every wing - nut blog , but you would think that the major rightie blogs , when not regurgitating Malkin ’s rhetoric would at least bother to discredit him too , not to mention three other witnesses .
Then there is the Right ’s twisted logic : if the Kerosene story is not 100 % pure without even a few mitigating details here or there then every report ( 61 ? ) filed by AP in Iraq is false .
Can we hold Michelle Malkin , Power Line , Wizbang , Confederate Yankee , Flopping Aces , Newsbusters and an assortment of the usual conservative suspects to that same standard ?
If we find one falsehood on their blogs or their books in Malkin ’s case , then we have licence to assume that everything they have written is spurious .
The Associated Press lost Iraq ? by Eric Boehlert
Warbloggers are obsessed with all things AP , or the “ Associated ( with terrorists ) Press , ” as Malkin subtly calls it .
Which brings us back to news of Lutfallah ’s death and the odd silence that emanated from the warblogs — and by odd , I mean , wildly hypocritical , because the silence sprang from the fact that the circumstances of Lutfallah ’s murder did n’t fit the warbloggers ’ ideological script .
Namely , that Lutfallah was executed by insurgents , which completely undermined the warbloggers ’ theory that the AP enjoys close ties to terrorists .
According to warblogger logic , the insurgents should have made sure Lutfallah got the best film of the gun fight with police ; in fact , insurgents might have even tipped him off that a battle was going to take place .
That ’s how the drill is supposed to work .
Yet insurgents in Mosul , after seeing the AP cameraman filming and then identifying him , approached the father of two and emptied five bullets into his body , took his equipment , cell phone , and press ID .
They shot him like a dog in the street .
( emphasis mine )
Eric Boehlert goes on to highlight 6 deaths of the 129 journalists and associates that have been killed by insurgents in a country that is not in a civil war .
Unfortunately , given her widely read blog and her platform as a Fox News analyst , Malkin has influenced a new generation of right - wing press critics , who sloppily draw all sorts of dark and dishonest conclusions about the press .
The phenomenon has been rampant during the Hussein controversy .
Here ’s one small example .
Warblogger Curt at Flopping
Aces raised doubts about a December 12 AP dispatch , which reported that 66 Iraqis had been killed by an insurgency car bomb in downtown Baghdad .
The number of dead was probably inflated , according to Curt at Flopping Aces , given the “ prior reporting history by the AP . ”
Specifically , the warblogger questioned the report because it was written by the two AP journalists who had previously quoted Jamil Hussein , the “ fake policeman , ” which meant “ anything printed by these two ” was possible fiction .
[ Emphasis added . ]
Slight problem : Central Command quickly confirmed that a car bomb on December 12 did kill 66 people in Baghdad , which matched what AP had reported .
So much for that round of media gotcha .
So playing by right - wing rules , rules that Curt and Malkin have issued , everything that Flopping Aces has written is suspect and is not to be taken as an honest attempt at citizen journalism , but pure Pravda - like propaganda .
When the Republican bloggers get finished with AP they can start on UPI , Eye on Iraq : The other Iraq report
The new report , entitled ‘ Iraq`s Sectarian and Ethnic Violence and Evolving Insurgency : Developments through mid-December 2006 ’ is by Anthony H. Cordesman , who holds the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .
The 92 - page report was released to none of the media hoopla and obsession that greeted the Iraq Study Group report chaired by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton .
But it is even more frank and harsh in its assessments of the current chaos in Iraq than the ISG document .
The CSIS report acknowledged what we predicted and then saw confirmed in the fall : that the ill - fated U.S. - led Operation Together Forward II in Baghdad had only made ‘ slow progress in clearing the volatile neighborhoods , and the initiative lacked sufficient forces to maintain peace in cleared areas ’
‘ Baghdad was the center of the sectarian conflict , but violence spread to surrounding towns — particularly Baquba , Balad , and Amara — as the civil war threatened to engulf the entire country , ’ the report said .
Cordesman noted that the United Nations had concluded that by mid-December , sectarian violence was killing 120 Iraqis a day .
Back in the spring , we warned that the escalating violence by that point was on schedule to kill more than 30,000 people a year in Iraq . , even if things did not get any worse .
Cordesman has now confirmed things have gotten worse than that .
The U.N. figures he cites mean that even if the current levels of violence in Iraq do not deteriorate further ( in fact they show every sign of doing so ) 43,800 people will die next year there at the current rates of carnage .
( emphasis mine )
“ It was then that I began to look into the seams of your doctrine .
I wanted only to pick at a single knot ; but when I had got that undone , the whole thing raveled out .
And then I understood that it was all machine - sewn . ” – Henrik Ibsen
Etched nanostructured rings around an LED can make it more than seven times brighter .
The novel technique developed at NIST may have applications in areas such as in biomedical imaging where LED brightness is crucial .
Credit : NIST
Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology have made semiconductor light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) more than seven times brighter by etching nanoscale grooves in a surrounding cavity to guide scattered light in one direction .
The novel nanostructure , which may have applications in areas such as in biomedical imaging where LED brightness is crucial , is described in the July 17 issue of Applied Physics Letters .
Semiconductor LEDs are used increasingly in displays and many other applications , in part because they can efficiently produce light across a broad spectrum , from near - infrared to the ultraviolet .
However , they typically emit only about two percent of the light in the desired direction : perpendicular to the diode surface .
Far more light skims uselessly below the surface of the LED , because of the extreme mismatch in refraction between air and the semiconductor .
The NIST nanostructured cavity boosts useful LED emission to about 41 percent and may be cheaper and more effective for some applications than conventional post - processing LED shaping and packaging methods that attempt to redirect light .
The NIST team fabricated their own infrared LEDs consisting of gallium arsenide packed with " quantum dots " of assorted sizes made of indium gallium arsenide .
Quantum dots are nanoscale semiconductor particles that efficiently emit light at a color determined by the exact size of the particle .
The LEDs were backed with an alumina mirror to reflect the light emitted backwards .
The periphery of each LED was turned into a cavity etched with circular grooves , in which the light reflects and interferes with itself in an optimal geometry .
The researchers experimented with different numbers and dimensions of grooves .
The brightest output was attained with 10 grooves , each about 240 nanometers ( nm ) wide and 150 nm deep , and spaced 40 nm apart .
The team spent several years developing the design principles and perfecting the manufacturing technique .
The principles of the method are transferable to other LED materials and emission wavelengths , as well as other processing techniques , such as commercial photolithography , according to lead author Mark Su .

What to Watch ( 6/18 to 6/24 )

Do you an idea for a column or just something to say ?
Scroll down and leave a comment !
The existence of the American Teen Drama series is something that most teenagers today take for granted .
Afterall , on any given night , a kid can turn on the TV and find some show set in a high school or college that involves teenagers and young - adults battling a myriad of dramatic issues .
This was not always the case though .
Only in the last twenty years or so have networks begun to recognize the huge teen demographic in this country that are craving TV shows they can relate to .
Aaron Spelling ’s ‘ Beverly Hills , 90210 ’ was one of the first truly successful teen drama series .
After ‘ 90210 ’ aired , an onslaught of teen drama shows followed in its wake , hoping for the same success .
It would be an understatement to say that while ' 90210 ' may have paved the way for future high - schooly type shows , it was by no means , the best of it 's genre .
Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a huge fan of ' 90210 '
( One of my guiltiest pleasures is the collection of ' 90210 ' reruns on my Tivo ) but show 's like ' Buffy The Vampire Slayer ' and ' Veronica Mars ' outstrip ' 90210 ' by miles .
And while shows like ' The OC ' carry the torch for one - dimensional teen drama shows like ' 90210 ' , writers such as Joss Whedon ( ' Buffy ' ) and Rob Thomas ( ' Veronica Mars ' ) are catering to the teens and young adults who do n't mind thinking and feeling while watching TV .
So here 's my breakdown of some of the more popular teen dramas .
( 1990 - 2000 ) - In its 10 - year run , ' 90210 ' captured an audience ranging from about 13 to 25 .
It started out centering on a family from Minnesota who moved to Beverly Hills and attempted to adjust to the ritzy LA lifestyle .
In their high school years , twins Brenda and Brandon Walsh and their gang of over - privileged pals battled the usual issues ( sex , mild drug abuse , cheating on exams , etc ) but by the end of the series the group 's issues had expanded greatly .
In fact , if you added up all of the crazy things that have happened to the ' 90210 ' friends , you 'd realize just how ridiculous it all was .
Sure there has to be an element of suspension of disbelief but the writers of ' 90210 ' took the show to the level of soap - opera - fakeness .
If the ' 90210 ' gang could make a list of all of their misfortunes , it would include : rape , murder , unplanned pregnancy , alcohol abuse , dozens of infidelities ( many of which included members of their tight group of friends ) , drug abuse , gambling addiction , theft , wrongful accusations and abusive boyfriends among other things .
In essence , the show relied on dramatic circumstances to keep viewers interested .
While that 's all fine and good because afterall , this is a teen - drama series , other shows that came later proved it was n't necessary to over - dramatize the lives of regular people in order to produce a watchable show .
' Party of Five ' was not one of these exceptions .
( 1994 - 2000 ) - Like ' 90210 ' , ' Party of Five ' was supposed to center around an " average " American family , however , the Salingers were by no means , average .
After losing their parents in a car accident , the Salingers have to raise themselves .
Charlie ( the oldest of the siblings ) as the reluctant father - figure , Bailey , Julia , Claudia and Owen ( the baby ) attempt to make it on their own so they wont get split up .
The premise of the show was good and lasted about half a season before the real drama set in .
Writers apparently ran out of normal , realistic circumstances to put the Salingers through and decided to throw the not - so - typical problems into the mix .
Alcoholism , abuse and date rape , among other things became part of the daily Salinger life .
Once I realized nothing good ever happened to the Salingers , I stopped watching .
I do n't mind a bit of drama but who wants to watch a show where the characters are always miserable ?
' Dawson ’s Creek ' fans , maybe . ( 1994 - 1995 ) - ' My So Called Life ' was a short - lived drama series that managed to capture the truth of a generation .
If I wanted to show my kids what it was like to be a teenager in " my day " , I would hand them the DVD set of ' My So Called Life ' .
Angela Chase ( played by Claire Danes ) was just your average American teenager .
Going through the usual teen identity crisis , she abandons her childhood friends in favor of the outcast - crowd .
The show essentially centers on Angela , her old friends , her new friends and her family , all of which are intertwined .
In the eyes of many teens that watched the show , she was a real girl .
The show 's demise was said to be a combination of poor ratings and Claire Danes ' desire to pursue a film career .
It ended prematurely , leaving viewers to wonder if Angela would end up with dreamy but somewhat mentally vacant Jordan Catalano ( Mmmm Jared Leto ) or nerdy but sweet Brian Krakow ?
Chances are if the show continued , she would n't have ended up with either of them .
In the end , the show stayed as true to real - life as it got and how often does high school romance last , anyway ?
Either way , viewers were devastated when the show was cancelled .
MTV reran the episodes on and off for a year or two afterwards and die - hard fans managed to get the show distributed on DVD for a brief time .
I like to think ' My So Called Life ' was a bit to ahead of its time in terms of writing .
( 1997-2003 ) - I just heard all the Whedon - haters sigh .
Hear me out , though !
I myself was anti-Buffy until very recently !' Buffy ' was a phenomenal show that I regret having missed the boat on .
In fact , I did n’t watch the series until two years after the final season aired .
It was one of those shows that annoyed me even though I 'd never caught more than a few minutes of it .
It was n't until after I watched the series that I realized it was / is the fandom surrounding the show and not the series itself , which tends to irritate non -' Buffy ' fans .
Joss
Whedon put the ' Buffy ' series together a year or two after the film version of ' Buffy the Vampire Slayer ' came out .
The show was nothing like the movie and perhaps that was what drew some viewers in and drove other viewers away .
Set in the fictional town of Sunnydale , California , ' Buffy ' is the " chosen one " .
There 's one Slayer in every generation and Buffy 's it .
She and her mother move to Sunnydale , which Buffy quickly learns is set on the mouth of hell .
Sunnydale being all hell - mouthy means its basically a magnet for demons .
As fate would have it , Buffy shows up in time to repeatedly ward off the forces of evil while maintaining a decent GPA .
Demons aside , ' Buffy ' was one of the best teen drama series in television history .
Definitely in the top three .
Joss Whedon managed to capture the minds and hearts of viewers with characters who are not only good looking ( a necessary factor in any successful teen - drama show ) but also smart , funny and emotionally realistic .
It could be said that ' Buffy ' was one of the first teen drama shows that recognized the ability of teen and young - adult viewers ' to think and watch tv at the same time .
The formula for the show defied the usual " OMG !
Bailey 's an alcoholic !
Dylan cheated on Brenda ! " junk that other teen shows force - fed their viewers .
Instead of the melodramatic ' 90210 ' route , Whedon addressed the hardships of adolescence indirectly through the supernatural stuff .
In that way he was able to make a quality teen / young - adult drama series that did n’t recycle storylines from other shows .
Each season had the overall " Big Bad " that Buffy and her " scoobies " had to battle but there were also many stand - alone episodes .
It 's in these episodes ( usually when there 's a new demon in town who wont make it to the end of the episode ) that the characters in the show are developed .
Whedon 's characters are multi-dimensional .
Not only do they have realistic attributes ( including flaws ! ) but they also have memories .
When I say memories , I mean they actually remember things that happened in previous seasons and reference them from time to time .
Unlike shows like ' 90210 ' where its ok to date your friend because chances are , one year later it will be as though the relationship never existed , ' Buffy ' characters are actually affected by their interactions for more than just a few episodes .
It 's almost as though Whedon made a list of all the teen - drama clichés and said " How can I make a show that does n't have any of this and maybe even on occasion , pokes fun at these clichés " .
' Buffy ' raised the bar when it comes to drama in a TV series and not just among teens and young adults .
As a 28 - year - old , I can honestly say that few shows ( adult and young adult alike ) measure up to the quality of writing in the ' Buffy ' series .
( 1999 - 2000 ) - Another teen series that was squashed well before its time was ' Freaks and Geeks ' .
Set in the early 80s , this show would technically be defined as a " dramedy " because though it was quite a dramatic series , there was definitely an element of humor mixed in .
‘ Freaks and Geeks ’ centered on Lindsey Weir and her younger brother .
While Lindsey attempts to abandon her group of mathlete - band - geek friends in favor of the grungier crowd ( you know , the ones who barely go to class and can often be found smoking under the bleachers ) , her younger brother Sam struggles with the realization that he is in fact , a geek .
Like any significantly dorky kid in the 80s , Sam and his friends spend their time playing D&D , returning to the theaters repeatedly to watchfor the billionth time and of course , getting their butts kicked at Dodgeball .
While Sam is busy getting pantsed , Lindsey wants desperately to shed her goody - goody reputation and manages to gain the friendship of some of the " freaks " in the school .
Once in with them , she finds that the grass really is always greener on the other side of the cafeteria .
The show got cancelled right around the time when it seemed Lindsey was finding a balance between who she was and who she thought she wanted to be .
Like ' My So Called Life ' , viewers felt they could relate to the Weirs and the other characters in the show ( both the freaks and the geeks ) .
The show did n't last to the end of its first season but was re-aired on Fox Family after its cancellation .
The humor of the show centered mainly on the 80's - ness .
Common references to 80's pop-culture were made throughout the series , which made the show all the more enjoyable .
I blame the failure of the show on NBC for moving it around too much .
The show 's inability to anchor itself to a timeslot no doubt affected its ratings .
Afterall , it was aired in the pre-Tivo years .
How can we watch a show when we do n’t know when its going to be on ?
What a waste .
Buy the DVD set .
You wont be disappointed .( 2004 - present ) - Like ' Buffy ' , I was late in the game with ' Veronica Mars ' .
Its on UPN and as I barely watch that channel , it never occurred to me to give this show a chance .
Season 2 finished up this year and after hearing that the writing was comparable to ' Buffy ' , I decided to give it a chance .
I netflixed the first disc of Season 1 and after four episodes , I bought the season on DVD .
I 'd seen enough in the first four episodes of the show to know that this was one of those rare quality teen - drama shows that comes around once every five years or so .
I was not about to miss the boat this time around .
Veronica
Mars is a high school student whose father is a private detective .
As the apple to her father 's tree , Veronica takes after her old man by moonlighting as a private detective .
In season one , we 're introduced to the cute and perky Veronica , a high school student who , after the death of her best friend Lily , has been cast out of the " cool crowd " ( The ' 09ers ) .
Along with doing side - job detective work for her fellow classmates , she does her best to find out who really killed her best friend .
What makes ' Veronica Mars ' one of the best series on TV today ?
Good writing , plain and simple .
While the show 's reality definitely leans towards the make - believe existence in which many teen - drama shows reside ( by season 2 , four of the main characters were living on their own without parental supervision despite the fact that they 're all still in high school ) , the characters in ' VM ' are well developed and more human than most of the plastic characters you see in teen dramas .
Their behavior has a reason as well as a purpose .
Throughout the first two seasons , getting to understand what motivates the characters has been part of what draws viewers back .
The hook of ' VM ' is the detective work .
A common theme between the first two seasons is the big mystery .
In season one it was " Who Killed Lily ? " and in season two it was " Who caused the bus to crash ? " .
But it ’s the little mysteries that keep ' VM ' fresh .
Whether she 's finding a lost dog or proving a friend 's innocence , Veronica is almost always willing and able to take on a new mystery .
She 's loyal and well intentioned ( unless you get on her bad side , in which case , watch out ! ) .
Veronica 's personal relationships with her father , her friends and boyfriends ( especially the on - again / off - again relationship with Logan ) have definitely played a part in the growing number of viewers ( mostly teens and young adults ) who are addicted to the show .
Again , I attribute this to a combination of good writing and good chemistry among the actors .
Never once in the 10 years that ' 90210 ' was I ever so caught up in the relationships of the characters the way I am with the ones in ' Veronica Mars ' .
Granted these teenagers barely act like real teenagers but the intensity of their relationships and the way they 're portrayed on screen have put the show very high up on my list of best tv shows ever ( I 'll write it in pencil though , as the show is only in onto its third season ) .
The show can deliver a simple moment like two characters having their first kiss , in such a way that viewers will find themselves holding their breaths through the scene and then clawing for their DVR remote to roll it back and see it again ( ok maybe I 'm just speaking for myself here but there you are ) .
The right lighting , the right music , well written lines ( thank you Rob Thomas ! ) and phenomenal acting all contribute to the success of these moments and its these moments that make the show as good as it is .
In this way , ' Veronica Mars ' makes shows like ' 90210 ' look like cheesy teen soap operas with corny story lines and absolutely no suspense or plot - momentum .
Then again , that is pretty much what ' 90210 ' was .
Much like ' Buffy ' , ' Veronica Mars ' seems to have developed a pretty intense fan base .
When UPN and WB were deliberating over which shows to keep and which shows to dump once the networks officially merged into the CW Network , fans launched internet campaigns to make sure season 3 of Veronica Mars would happen .
Some fans even went so far as to have a banner flown over CW headquarters just to make sure execs knew the show was wanted .
Their voices were heard and the show is set to air on the CW Network this fall .
So there you have it .
I know there are a number of other teen - drama shows out there that went unmentioned ( ' Popular ' , ' Felicity ' , ' Degrassi High ' etc ) but it was my intention to touch on the ones that I think had the biggest impact on the genre ( for better or for worse ) or served as the best example of its kind .
Many people look down their noses at this type of show but I consider my tastes in television programs to be pretty eclectic .
Teen Dramas seem to be evolving from what they once were ( soapy fluff ) and finally giving teenagers and young adults a genre they can latch onto and realistic characters that they can idolize or demonize to their liking .
While there will always be ‘ OC ’ type shows out there catering to the future soap - opera addicts of America , its comforting to know that shows like ‘ Buffy ’ and ‘ Veronica Mars ’ are raising the standard for teen drama series ’.- ( rerun ) - ‘ The Family Guy ’ is mostly guy - humor but each episode is usually jam - packed with random pop-culture references which means laughter for the whole family .
Though its animated , like the ‘ Simpsons ’ and ‘ South Park ’ , ‘ Family Guy ’ does tend to have adult and young - adult oriented storylines . - ( rerun ) – I ’ll be honest , I have n’t actually seen this show yet but the commercials in which they do a spoof of the opening of ‘ Friends ’
( The couch and the splashing around in the fountain ) makes me laugh .
New episodes of this sitcom will air on FX later in the month , but in the meantime , why not try out a rerun ?
The show takes place in Philly ( duh ) and centers on 4 friends who run a bar .
Hmmm … sounds like the perfect setup for a sitcom .
Cheers , everyone !- ( New ! ) –
If you have HBO and you are n’t watching ‘ Entourage ’ , you ’re seriously missing one of the best 30 minutes the channel has to offer each week .
The third season started last week so it ’s not too late to get caught up !
In this week ’s episode , Vince ’s agent , Ari and manager , Eric worry that the rolling blackouts in LA will affect the opening weekend box - office sales of Vince ’s new movie– ( rerun ) – And they said the sitcom was dead ?!
‘ HIMYM ’ ( as I like to call it ) is one of the best sitcoms on TV right now .
Granted , that ’s not saying much but if you ’re in desperate need of a break from trashy reality shows or crime investigation dramas , ‘ HIMYM ’ is the way to go !
The basic premise is that a bunch of 20 - somethings try to figure out how to be grown ups .
Watch it if only for the hilarious Neil Patrick Harris ( best known for playing the title character in ‘ Doogie Howser , MD ’ ) . is the episode when Ted and Marshall use their decorative swords to battle it out to decide who will get the apartment after Lily and Marshall get married .
Of course , someone ended up making friends with the pointy end of one of the swords but I wont say who !- ( rerun ) -
One of the great things about the CSI shows is that you do n’t have to tune in every week in order to be able to watch an episode now and then .
In this episode , detectives are trying to find a man who shot up a bunch of people at a day spa then began breaking into the victim ’s homes .
And to think , getting a facial and a mani - pedi is supposed to be relaxing .- ( rerun ) – I never get tired of ‘ House ’ .
In this episode , a college senior binge - drinks himself into a shocking overdose and when I say shocking , I mean that literally .
He ends up as Dr. House ’s patient because he has seizures that literally cause electric shocks to course through his body .
As usual , House and his band of good - looking brainiac doctors have to figure out what ’s wrong with this kid before he fries to death .- ( rerun ) –
Oh how I adore this show ( see the above essay ) !
In this episode , Veronica tries to track down Abel Koontz ’s daughter because he ’s on his deathbed and wants to see her one last time .
In the mean time , Logan is reunited with his dad when he ’s arrested for the murder of Felix .
The show ’s about a quarter of the way into the season so if you ’ve never seen it , you might have trouble getting into it . - ( New ! ) –
In this episode of ‘ Rescue Me ’ the guys attempt to save a bus full of children in Harlem .
On the more dramatic side , Sean tells Tommy about his relationship with Maggie , Franco figures out what the deal is with sexy - older - woman Alicia ( Susan Sarandon ) , Probie and his roomie discuss their sexuality and Janet wants Tommy to discuss their divorce settlement sans lawyers .
I expect this episode to be 1 part funny and 2 parts dramatic .- ‘ Big Brother ’ has become one of my guiltiest TV - watching pleasures .
This season as most BB fans know , they ’re doing an All - Star season .
In this week ’s episode , we will get to see which 20 previous houseguests are up for another chance at the game .
After the episode , America will get to decide which houseguests will return to the house for another summer of laughs , lies and PB&J .
My hopefuls – Kaysar ( 6 ) , Howie ( 6 ) , Dr. Will ( 2 ) , Janelle ( 6 ) , Drew ( 5 ) , Roddy ( 3 ) and James ( 6 ) .-
Simon Cowell ’s new series in which he scours the country looking for talented American ’s who will compete to win $ 1,000,000 .
The contestants will range from the typical singers and dancers to less popular talents like magicians and “ bizarre novelty acts ” .
Sounds like another chance for Simon to use words like “ dreadful ” and “ I ’m - not - being - rude - but ” .- ( rerun ) - If you have n’t been watching ‘ My Name Is Earl ’ , now ’s your chance to see what all the fuss is about .
I jumped into the series about halfway through the season so I can confirm that this is definitely the kind of show where its ok to have missed episodes .
It ’s both funny and sweet in a simple kind of way .
In this episode , Earl attempts to repay the government after not paying taxes for years .
There ’s another episode of ‘ Earl ’ on at 9 pm . - ( rerun ) – This show never fails to make me laugh .
In this episode , Michael and Dwight are out of the office today so Pam and Jim get everyone in the office together to play some made - up games for the unofficial “ Office Olympics ” .
There ’s another episode of ‘ The Office ’ at 9:30 pm . - ( rerun ) –
So this show ’s been cancelled and will fall off the radar the second WB and UPN merge but that does n’t mean you ca n’t enjoy this girly sitcom while it ’s still around !
The episode looks like it ’s a good one because OMG , Brandon and Kelly are finally reunited !
Ok not really but kind of .
The show stars ‘ 90210 ’s ’ own Jennie Garth and this episode does happen to feature a guest appearance than Jason Priestly .
Yes , you can probably bet on at least one well - placed but cheesy ‘ 90210 ’ reference so really if you ’ve been writing in your diary begging the universe to put these two back on screen together , your wish has been granted .
I have n’t seen this episode but I have seen this show on more than a few occasions .
Its charming in a squeaky - clean kind of way .- ( rerun ) – Another casualty of the big WB / UPN merge , ‘ Twins ’ is taking its final breaths in the rerun season which is kind of a shame because it was actually a pretty decent show .
Starring Larry from ‘ Perfect Strangers ’ ( Mark Linn - Baker ) , Melanie Griffith , Molly Stanton and Sara Gilbert ( Darlene from ‘ Roseanne ’ ) , ‘ Twins ’ is a show about two fraternal twins who are polar opposites in terms of personality .
They take over their dad ’s business and the chuckles ensue as Farrah ( the girly blonde twin ) acts all girly and blonde while Mitchee counters her twin ’s girliness with lots of non -blonde / non - girly behaviorisms .
It ’s a recipe for good clean Friday night family time .
Unfortunately there just were n’t enough good clean families watching TV on Friday nights because CW is replacing the timeslot with a big chunk of wrestling .
“ Daniel LaRusso ’s gonna fight ?!
Daniel LaRusso’s gonna fight ! ” – that ’s right ladies and gentleman , call your friends and tell them you cant go out with them Friday night .
There ’s waxing to be done ( of the on and off variety ) .
Turner Classic
Movies will be playing one of the greatest 80 ’s movies of all time .
When I sawwas on TCM I had to do a reality check .
Realizing that this movie , which premiered in 1984 is in fact , 22 years old , made me feel ridiculously old but I wont let that stop me from enjoying it in all it ’s awesomeness .
Who could forget Mr. Miyagi beating up a bunch of high schoolers as they were dressed in their oh - so - cool skeleton unitards or the part when you think Daniel ’s out because Tommy took Kreese ’s orders and swept his leg .
Or that beautiful moment at the end when Johnny , bleeding profusely from his recently crane - kicked nose , passed Daniel the giant trophy .
We did it Mr. Miyagi !!!
Profiles of young TV and movie stars in all their adorableness then does a sort of “ where are they now ” piece .
Expect lots of dimples and celebrity appearances from people like Candace Cameron ( Bure ) .
Since its on Saturday night I suggest you turn this into some kind of drinking game .
Drink every time an Olsen twin shows up on screen .
Drink for every dimple shown .
Drink for every celeb that at one point in time , turned to drugs and / or alcohol .
Drink whenever a catchphrase is used ( “ how rude ! ” , “ oh , brother ” , “ whatcha talkin ’ bout willis ” , etc ) .
A friend of mine has a problem - his team worked for months on a big system with great success , marvellous technical achievements and a very elegant architecture .
However , the users do n’t share his enthusiasm .
They do n’t appreciate the architecture , flexibility and openness to change .
Somehow , they seem ‘ blinded by the user interface ’ .
Although the statement is completely correct , it ’s hardly something that developers should be moaning about - on the end , ‘ user interface ’ is called like that because it is exactly what users see .
Instead of complaining how users only see ‘ the stupid UI ’ , we can embrace that fact and improve their feelings about our software .
Developers tend to over - emphasise functional aspects , underlying structure and technical achievements .
But users are blind to that - they only see what the software does , not how .
Most users are only concerned about how the software will help them get their regular job done , and how pleasant it will be to work with .
For them , the underlying structure , service layers and database optimisations exist somewhere over the rainbow …
Restaurant chefs have learned this lesson a long time ago – a great meal tastes excellent , but it opens your appetite with the first look , not the first bite .
Although the real value of the meal is in it ’s taste , the visual impression is also very important .
A tasty meal looking like a mess might even disgust me , and if it was not in a restaurant I know and respect , I might just get up and leave .
On the other hand , I will surely take a few bites of a nice looking meal , but if the taste is not there , I ’ll eat something else .
A great meal has to have both components .
It ’s the same with winning software solutions – they must have both the functions and the looks .
It is incredible how much a few polishing touches can improve the customer ’s perception of software and the team .
The image that sold the system
My first encounter with this phenomenon was six years ago , while I worked on an energy - trading software system .
Electrical energy trading is somewhat strange , as the current goes where physical laws govern , but traders set their own abstractions for ‘ transiting ’ and ‘ trade ’ .
There is no warehousing , and if you are a middle - man , what you buy must match what you sell at any given time , and buy / sell contracts are coordinated and matched by various network operators on 15 or 60 minute levels .
One of the key selling points of our software was automation of the transit planning – which would save our clients a lot of effort and money , because they were doing it manually at the time .
It took us a few months just to come up with mathematical models for an optimisation algorithm , merging few existing network - flow optimisations and adding some ideas of our own .
Then , we spent a month or two developing software which would read the trading plans and network limits , find the optimal transit plan and present it in a 15 minute breakdown table .
Traders would then verify the plan and the software would send it to appropriate network operators .
As a quick check tool , we developed a graphical display of suggested transit routes , and used it to see visually whether the optimised routes made sense .
Just for the fun , we polished that code and added it to the GUI client , putting a map of Europe under the plotted lines .
My boss , at the time , was complaining about how we were wasting time on silly eye - candy when we should be working on the real stuff .
When we presented the system to the clients , their top - management attended the meeting along with leading traders .
Very proud of our new algorithm , both in terms of the mathematical model and light - speed implementation , we talked a lot about all the boring details ( I ’m pretty sure we could have given them a sedative and achieved the same effect , as they all were all sleeping ) .
On the end , when I pushed the Optimise button , and Europe with red , blue and yellow lines came up on the screen , they all suddenly woke up with faces reminding me of a child getting a new toy .
One of the leading traders shouted something like ‘ This is great , it ’s going to make my work so much easier !’.
Like a fool , I thought that they were thrilled by how the process finished in a few seconds , and continued talking about the resulting table and the algorithm .
But the trader interrupted me – ‘ I ’m not talking about the table – this map is fabulous …
I ’ve never been able to see my plans that way . ’
Everything before and after that moment did not matter , they ‘ loved it ’ .
That single feature , developed in less that 8 hours , sold the software on the end , and we could have given them a faulty model with the same success .
Of course , the real value of the system was in the way it correctly and swiftly managed tons of data to produce an optimal transit map .
But all they were talking about was the silly map .
Imagine my anger - we could have spent those months playing games and I guarantee that the silly map would still sell the software ( not that it would do much good later ) .
Improving the view
If the clients are not very technical , they will only see the GUI - so let ’s give them something nice to see .
If the GUI is not polished , from my experience it ’s best to delay the project for a few days to clean it up , even if the clients are screaming to get it ASAP .
It may sound against common sense , but in practice it works great .
Sprinting to add raw , unpolished functionality almost never pays off , and it can blow up in your face .
Putting a bit of eye - candy into the project can really help with first impressions , and it ’s incredible how much a few days of polishing can improve the customer perception .
I ’ve worked with clients that have a very good understanding of what goes on under the hub , but these are an exception rather than a rule .
Most cannot see trough the visual interface , so the functionality is really not that important to them as long as it does the job .
And , even those with technical background will also appreciate a nice GUI , so polishing the user interface is time well spent in any case .
Even if you do not have the budget to pay professional designers , the software does not have to be grey and ugly .

hype /hīp /
Noun : Extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion .
A hypodermic needle or injection .
Verb : Promote or publicize ( a product or idea ) intensively , often exaggerating its importance or benefits .
Stimulate or excite ( someone ) : " I was hyped up because I wanted to do well " .
One of my crusades recently in online beer communities has been against the word " hype " .
I 'll discuss my rationale below , but if you 're the impatient , TL ; DR type , I 'll summarize here : 1 ) It 's being used incorrectly ( this is actually fairly minor ) .
2 ) Using it that way corrodes discussion and inhibits clear thinking ( major ) .
I 'll explain .
First , let 's start with a dictionary definition .
I loathe doing this because I think that , in general , any literate adult should be able to tell you roughly what a word means , but we may as well go to the " authorities " .
My favorite method is to use the google search " define : foo " which leads to these results
Now , it 's clear that the meanings we 're dealing with are both of the # 1's ( although you could sort of make a case for verb # 2 , I do n't think it really makes sense in pretty much any context , and really needs to be followed by " up " ) .
And both of those explicitly mention " publicity " or " promotion " , as well as " extravagant " , " intensive " , or " exaggerating " .
It is completely clear that " dudes talking about a beer on a beer website " are n't meeting this definition .
Saying your opinion of something , even in hyperbolic terms ( " that was the best beer ever ! " ) is n't promoting / publicizing something intensively , let alone extravagantly .
Maybe you 're exaggerating ( although if it 's your honest opinion then you 're obviously not , by definition everyone has had a " best beer ever " so stating yours is just stating an opinion ) , but unless you 're doing this repeatedly ( to meet " intensive " ) then it 's not hype .
So whatmeet this definition ?
Well , typically any publicity push by a company will at least get close .
Bud Lite or Dos Equis are obviously hyped .
Even in the craft beer world it does happen .
One could accuse Shelton Brothers of hyping Westvleteren 12 in advance of their shipment of it to the US later this year ( I think that 's debatable , but regardless , it 's a reasonable case ) .
ONCEMADE was absolutely hyped .
At the time of the launch I said that it was a fantastic example of hype in the craft beer world .
It was a product that was n't really all that different from dozens of other products that had a big marketing push ( publicity / promotion ) using over - the - top ( exaggerated ) language , and it showed up all over the place in a short time span ( intensive ) .
I hope that illustrates why calling something like , say , Pliny the Elder / Younger or Heady Topper ( or most other craft beers ) " hyped " is using the word incorrectly .
There 's no intense publicity , no exaggeration , no extravagance .
There are just beer fans enjoying a beer and talking about it .
You might disagree , and you 're free to ( taste is subjective , after all ) , but their expressed enjoyment of something is not hype , it is praise .
( This is a tangent , but I wanted to include it .
While it's not in the definitions I think a very important part of thinking about hype is asking , " Who benefits ? "
If I go on Beer Advocate and make a post about how Pliny is the best beer ever , there 's no way in which I benefit .
First , pretty much everyone on BA already knows about Pliny , I 'm not actually spreading the word to anyone new .
Second , even if I were , what do I gain ?
It 's an off - the - shelf beer , already very well known , it wo n't trade any better .
I also wo n't gain financially .
If anything increased awareness will just make it harder for me to buy !
The same is true of most beers that people consider " hyped " .
Really , when you 're talking about BA or /r / beer the posts that could be hyping are the ones talking about a great new local place with hard - to - get stuff ( think Funky Buddha ) , but even then it 's probably just genuine praise , not an attempt to inflate trade values ( although it could also be homerism , that 's beyond my scope right now ) .
I think that 's something valuable to keep in mind , " Who benefits ? " ) This is my real problem with the overuse of the word " hype " .
What do I mean by it ?
I do n't mean that people are using a word incorrectly and the English language is suffering ( if she has survived the sling and arrows of the recent past , she 'll continue doing just fine ) .
What I mean is that calling something " hyped " is an accusation .
The word has clear negative connotations .
When people use it they are implying that something is not as good as its reputation , that its reputation is fluffed up by the hype .
It 's also accusing the people who have praised it of either being taken in by the hype ( and thus being unsavvy saps ) or of actively fueling the hype , and thus being pawns ( or worse , hypers ) .
Lest you think I 'm being paranoid or overly sensitive here , I 'm not .
I do n't actually give two shits if someone accuses me of hyping something .
If they do , I 'll explain why I 'm not , but I 'm not particularly insulted by it .
This is n't a personal quest because I 'm just a Sally - sensitive .
Those effects are real and they are poisonous to sensible discourse .
It means that people are forced to defend not only their opinion of the thing , but also their motives for holding that opinion .
It removes the benefit of the doubt ..
Maintaining the benefit of the doubt and assuming good intentions are critical to having a reasonable , respectful discourse , especially over text , where tone and visual cues are missing .
That 's my biggest problem with the over -use of the word hype .
It creates a situation where accusations are flying , people are put on the defensive , motives are constantly questioned , and communication degrades .
So , what would I like to replace the word " hype " with ?
Most of the time you can sub in " praise " without any issues .
One use of " hype " where that does n't work is the " hype train " effect , where beer forums ( especially trading forums ) are inundated with discussion ( usually ISO / FT posts or discussion thereof ) of the new beer .
This is corrosive in the same way , implying that the beer ( and those trading it ) are not worth the attention .
Honestly , I think that this should just vanish from our discourse .
Human beings like trends , everyone knows this , beer is no exception .
That the forums are populated by posts about a flavor of the month for a few days every few weeks is n't surprising in the least , nor is it bad in any meaningful way .
Even though I earlier used the word " inundated " these posts are rarely the majority of posts on a board .
It might be a bit hard to ignore , but it 's not like there 's nothing else going on .
I 'd like to see people accept this , move on , and bury the phrase " hype train " .
One thing that I 'd still like to discuss is why this use of " hype " is so prevalent .
My belief is that it comes from sports discussions .
The difference there is that because of themedia presence , things really are frequently hyped .
Tim Tebow is hyped .
RG3 is hyped .
As much as the Stanford fan in me hates to say this , as of now Andrew Luck is hyped .
It 's true that these guys generate discussion on forums in the same way beer does ( although on a much bigger scale for sports ) , but the presence of media actively fueling the fire is what sets sports discussion apart .
Hype sells for them in a way it just does n't for craft beer .
Hype gets eyes on ESPN , readers on the various news websites , listeners on the radio .
Those things bring advertising dollars .
The hype machine directly benefits the people doing the hyping .
Since there 's a pretty large overlap between people who are into sports and people who are into beer , the language translates .
The problem is that when you have a lot of people talking about a beer , you 're not in the same situation as when you have a lot of people talking about an athlete .
In the latter case the media is driving the discussion , and they 're doing it to get your attention and therefore money .
In the former case it 's just a bunch of dudes who are passionate about something .
But the fact that they 're so superficially similar ( ie " Everyone 's talking about Tim Tebow " and " Everyone 's talking about Heady Topper " ) makes the comparison easy .
But it 's also lazy , and it 's wrong .
That 's the end of my rant about hype .
Most of us have heard of the American fashion for asking : " What would Jesus do ? "
You may be more surprised to learn that a book was recently published entitled What Would Bill Hicks Say ? , featuring contributions from , among others , Rob Newman , AL Kennedy and Radiohead 's Thom Yorke .
Are we to infer that the late US stand - up , who died in 1994 aged 32 , is comedy 's Christ ?
He has certainly risen again at this year 's Edinburgh .
The hit Fringe show Bill Hicks : Slight Return , in which Hicks is brought back to life in 2006 by writer and actor Chas Early , is back at the Pleasance .
At the Dome , Hicks 's childhood friend and one - time comedy partner Dwight Slade is staging three seminars , entitled Bill & Dwight , in which he reminisces about their relationship .
And the runaway favourite for this year 's if .comeddies award , the brilliant American stand - up Doug Stanhope , is forever being compared to Hicks .
Which tees him off , for several reasons .
" That guy would be so against us idolising him , " he says .
" Stop turning him into a cult , man .
He was a good comic , that 's all . "
This posthumous popularity would amuse Hicks , who struggled for years .
Before his death , his stock was fast rising in the UK , where his gigs at the 2,000 - seat Dominion Theatre were broadcast by Channel 4 .
His US reputation lagged far behind , but a breakthrough was within his grasp : the critic John Lahr had penned a rhapsodic profile for the New Yorker after Hicks became the first act to be censored on the David Letterman show .
( The offending jokes attacked the anti-abortion lobby .
" Pro-life ! "
Hicks sneered .
" Boy , they look it , do n't they ?
They just exude joie de vivre ... " )
There was no time left for Hicks to salvage his TV career - six months later he died of pancreatic cancer .
But in the years since , he has become more popular than ever .
It helps that the subjects of his most excoriating comedy - a Bush in the White House , a war in Iraq - remain bizarrely apposite .
Books , DVDs and CDs of his work are released on a regular basis ; the latest , Sane Man ( " the first full - length Bill Hicks performance ever filmed ! " ) , hit stores last year .
His name has become a byword for free - thinking , outspoken , savagely funny and socially conscious comedy , and his legacy casts a long shadow .
For personal reasons alone , Slade finds the phenomenon strange .
" I do n't listen to his CDs .
I did n't read the books .
Because I do n't want to relate to Bill as the icon and forget what he was as my friend . "
But he understands the blossoming reputation .
" What happens when you die young , " says Slade , " is that you freeze - frame this really energetic , wonderful life - this idealistic , uncompromising voice . "
Hicks has become an icon , says Slade , " for a generation that does n't really have anybody .
The 1960s and 1970s had the Beatles and Joplin , Hendrix and Andy Kaufman .
But the 1980s and 90s were these empty areas of American idealism , until Bill took that role . "
" It 's become easy to turn him into a saint , " says Early , despite there being " elements of his comedy that were difficult and in many cases unappealing " .
Some audiences inevitably felt hectored by Hicks 's vehemence , and the fainthearted struggled with the more lurid sexual content .
But his merits outshone his flaws .
Above all , he was technically supremely gifted .
The energy was unflagging , the jokes brilliantly honed and the stage presence mesmerising .
He was also a brilliant physical comedian .
Slade 's Bill & Dwight show features grainy home videos of the two adolescents rehearsing slapstick routines in a California baseball park , proving that Hicks knew Chaplin 's oeuvre inside out .
But the key to Hicks 's longevity is his idealism ; the fact that his comedy was underpinned by a passion for saving the world .
Loud - mouthed controversialists are 10 - a - penny in stand - up , but with Hicks , the drugs and porn shtick formed part of a libertarian , humanist , spiritual ( although not religious ) worldview .
The tension in his work , says Slade , was that " he had a great love of people , and a great disdain for people " .
But he was journeying ever closer towards the former .
His final testament , quoted in the 2004 collection , Love All the People , reads : " I left in love , in laughter and in truth , and wherever truth , love and laughter reside , I am there in spirit . "
Hicks detested hypocrisy and intellectual laziness , and believed they could be conquered through comedy .
" There is a real underlying wish in his work , " says Early , " for humanity to improve and see its flaws .
There is a witch - doctor element : ' Come on , people , together we can change the world . ' "
In this , there are echoes of Hicks 's southern Baptist upbringing in Texas .
" His mum once said to him , ' You 're just two steps away from being a preacher , ' " says Early .
" And he said , ' That 's exactly what I 'm doing .
I 'm trying to get people to believe . ' "
Of course , it 's easy to be principled when you die young .
" I 've compromised myself to fucking oblivion , " says Slade , now aged 45 .
Maybe Hicks , too , would have lowered his standards .
( In a set brimming with filth and horror , Stanhope 's most shocking joke imagines Bill surviving to star in a hit TV show called Everyone Loves Hicks . )
But Hicks 's routines on the subject remain perhaps the most satisfying expression ever of the wound inflicted on society when good people ( Jay Leno , in Hicks 's example ) sell out .
" Here 's the deal , folks , " he ranted .
" You do a commercial , you 're off the artistic roll - call forever .
End of story .
You 're another corporate shill , you 're another whore at the capitalist gang - bang .
And if you do a commercial , there 's a price on your head , everything you say is suspect and every word that comes out of your mouth is like a turd falling into my drink . "
Given this provocateur persona , would n't Hicks have been dismayed by the cult that now surrounds him ?
Early 's play asks that very question .
" And I think he 'd say , ' What is it with dead comedians ?
Have n't you got enough live ones to go around ?
Why is n't anyone moving the story on ? '
I think he would be annoyed . "
Slade disagrees .
" Bill was a guy who was in tune with his own voice , and who was able to amplify it into something very funny and inspirational and meaty .
But there are comics all over the place who do that now .
Bill raised the bar and comedy has followed .
And I think Bill would be thrilled that comics are really digging deep and coming up with very interesting stuff . "
To honour Hicks 's legacy , says Slade , is n't to get onstage in black leather , angry and wreathed in smoke .
It 's to tell one 's own truth , as honestly and fearlessly as possible .
" Give me something that is different and unique and yourself .
There 's nothing more refreshing than that . "
For any Hicks fan , Slade 's intimate photographs and films of the young Bill - goofing around in their apartment , hijacking Dwight 's wedding dressed as a mafia enforcer - will be as poignant as they are fascinating .
But we must n't be too sad , says Slade .
" When we were kids , Bill and I would spend every weekend putting on Aerosmith and Kiss and pretending we were rock stars .
Bill loved that , because he wanted to be a rock star .
And he would be thrilled by the fact that he has become one . "
100 Years of Turbulence
A century ago today , the Wright brothers took turns steering one of the first powered heavier - than - air aircraft on a series of controlled flights , the longest of which lasted fifty - seven seconds .
I say " one of the first " because there is a bit of controversy about who was first to fly , depending on how Clintonian you want to get about the meaning of " flight " .
If simply getting airborne is the criterion , honors have to go to the New Zealand eccentric Richard Pearse , who in 1902 built a giant flying table that enabled him to reach an altitude of several dozen feet and crash into gorse hedges .
If powered flight without a pilot on board qualifies , then credit is due to Charles Parson 's powered glider ( 1883 ) and Alexander Mozhaiski 's steam - powered [!] monoplane ( 1884 ) .
If reaching an altitude of eight inches counts as flying , then put your hands together for Clement Ader , who made the first manned flight in 1890 - also using steam power - and then improved his aircraft so much that it could not get off the ground at all .
If you believe that a qualifying flight has to be sustained and controlled , but you have lenient standards of proof , then you should consider the claims of Gustave Whitehead , who built a plane that modern science shows to be stable and controllable , but neglected to bring a camera or logbook along on his maiden voyage .
If you are very demanding and insist that the plane not only stay in the air under its own power , but land at the same point it took off , to demonstrate full control , then you 'll be wanting to congratulate the Wright brothers .
In 1904 , they rolled up their sleeves , built an improved version of their flyer , and on October 20 made a circular flight a little less than a mile long .
Not even a year later , Orville was able to fly for more than 24 miles , staying airborne for 39 minutes .
That 's true flight by anybody 's criteria except the Brazilians , who insist on the tortured prerequisite of takeoff from a dead stop in still air , just so they can cheer the Brazilian scion and one - man freak show Alberto Santos - Dumont .
Dumont made waves in Paris by flying a giant powered box kite for several hundred yards in October 1906 , gradually perfecting his technology until it could ' easily cover 200 meters of ground ' .
From there , it was a direct line to the Embraer jet .
The bickering about who was first in the air obscures the real accomplishment of the Wright brothers , which was the careful and scientific approach they took to the problem of aircraft design .
The Wrights were the first to do wind - tunnel tests , correcting longstanding errors in aeronautical theory , and they systematically applied their experimental results in designing each subsequent version of their gliders and aircraft .
Unlike most of the other pioneers of aviation , they actually understood what they were doing .
And they were superb craftsmen , who could turn abstract design principles into a handsomely assembled machine .
Unfortunately , like countless engineers before and after them , the Wright brothers were also dour , stubborn , and completely lacking in basic social skills .
They wanted nothing more than to sell out and be free to pursue their aeronautical research , but alienated all potential buyers by refusing to demo the flyer until a contract had been signed .
This stubbornness grew partly out of their obsession with having the invention stolen .
After proving to themselves and the world that powered flight was possible , they basically locked the airplane away and said to each other ' let 's litigate !'.
Having just invented the airplane , the Wrights stopped flying for two and a half years .
Of course , just because you 're paranoid does n't mean they 're not out to get you .
Almost as soon as the news of the first flight got out , the brothers received a threatening letter from the nefarious glider pilot and charlatan Augustus Herring , who had rushed to patent parts of the Wright brothers ' own design after a visit to Kitty Hawk , and wanted in on the action ( the patent would be denied ; Herring went on to a storied career as an aviation con artist ) .
The Wright brothers ' first priority was to patent their airplane , and they duly received their patent in 1904 .
It did n't just cover their specific design , but the whole concept of three - axis control - being able to independently steer the aircraft in pitch , roll , and yaw - that was critical to powered flight .
This patent became a mighty weapon that the Wright brothers used for the next thirteen years to sue the bejesus out of anyone else who tried to fly an airplane .
It may not have been a problem if the Wrights themselves had kept working on aircraft design , or if the original flyer had been good enough to license .
But neither was the case - the Wrights became so consumed with their lawsuits that they had no time or energy left for further work , essentially becoming the SCO of the early aviation age .
And their airplane design , while innovative , was mostly innovative in the wrong ways .
One major problem the flyer had was instability .
If you take almost any modern airplane and deflect its nose or tip its wings in flight , it will gradually return to its equilibrium position - one reason why planes stay aloft even in severe turbulence .
The plane is said to exhibit positive dynamic stability .
The Wright flyer had negative stability - if you perturbed it , it would get further out of whack until the pilot corrected the motion , or until the plane returned to the ground " without further attention on the part of the aeronaut " .
A second problem was the idiosyncratic technique the Wrights used to turn the plane .
On modern planes , a pilot banks the wings by moving small control surfaces on the trailing edge of the wing called ailerons .
The Wrights rejected ailerons in favor of wing warping , where the actual wing shape would be changed by the judicious pulling of wires .
This technique was as elegant as it was ultimately ineffective .
Steering in general was a problem - there was n't a lot keeping the flyer pointed in a steady direction .
The forward ' rudder ' ( what we now call a canard wing ) made things worse , because the plane naturally wanted to weather - vane around .
The plane layout we 're all used to ( long fuselage with a tail and horizontal stabilizer behind the wing ) actually predated the Wright 's design by almost a century , but the Wrights had rejected it in favor of a canard wing , so that they could get the maximum amount of lift possible from their awful engine .
This engine was terribly underpowered , even by the standards of the day .
The Wright brothers knew how to build airframes , not engines , and the only reason they were able to get their flyer airborne in the first place was because their brilliant propeller design and high - lift wing made up for the great crappiness of the power plant .
A fellow aviator , Glenn Curtiss , knew how to build quite wonderful lightweight engines , and in one of the great ' what - ifs ' of aviation history offered to go into partnership with the Wrights in 1906 .
But the brothers turned him down , and subsequently worked hard to sue Curtiss out of the airplane business .
In the years to come , the Curtiss - Wright rivalry would become the most bitter of the many legal disputes surrounding the brothers .
Curtiss , backed by Alexander Graham Bell , scurried to build new airplanes faster than the Wrights could win court cases against him , going to great lengths to try to establish prior art or at least narrow the scope of the patent ruling .
Despite the many innovations in the Curtiss design ( ailerons , empennage , a new engine ) the court took the broadest possible view of the Wright patent .
Curtiss was n't a thief - his designs were themselves revolutionary improvements , and he was motivated by a passion for aviation at least as great as the Wright brothers ' - but the rivalry was so bitter that the brothers would not license to him .
For the Wright brothers , the patent struggle was a series of Pyrrhic victories .
They wanted justice and credit , and ideally the freedom to pursue their research further .
Instead they found themselves consumed by litigation , and forced to watch others catch up with and overtake their technical lead , particularly in Europe , where areonautical research had strong state support .
The endless legal battle over the airplane patent may even have contributed to Wilbur Wright 's early death - he came down with typhoid at an especially rough patch in the legal proceedings , and died at age 45 .
His brother Orville lived long enough to see the Wright company taken over by Curtiss in 1929 , in the most bitter of ironies .
Neither brother made any substantive contribution to aviation after 1908 .
The United States government finally put an end to the patent strife in 1917 .
Mindful of the impending war , it insisted that the rival parties form a patent pool - in effect , removing patent barriers to creating new airplane designs .
Together with the war , the patent pool inspired a golden age of American aviation .
The pool stayed in effect until 1975 ; companies who wanted to preserve a competitive advantage did so using trade secrets ( such as Boeing 's secret recipe for hanging jet engines under an airliner wing ) .
I believe that the Wright patent story drives home the intellectual bankruptcy of our patent system .
The whole point of patents is supposed to be to encourage innovation , reward entrepreneurship , and make sure useful inventions get widely disseminated .
But in this case ( and in countless others , in other fields ) , the practical effect of patents turned out to be to hinder innovation - a patent war erupts , and ends up hamstringing truly innovative technologies , all without doing much for the inventors , who were n't motivated by money in the first place .
It 's illuminating to point out that all three transformative technologies of the twentieth century - aviation , the automobile , and the digital computer - started off in patent battles and required a voluntary suspension of hostilities ( a collective decision to ignore patents ) before the technology could truly take hold .
The Wright brothers won every patent case they fought , and it did them absolutely no good .
The prospect of a fortune was n't what motivated them to build an airplane , but ironically enough they could have made a fortune had they just passed on the litigation .
In 1905 , the Wrights were five years ahead of any potential competitor , and posessed a priceless body of practical knowledge .
Their trade secrets and accumulated experience alone would have made them the leaders in the field , especially if they had teamed up with Curtiss .
Instead , they got to watch heavily government - subsidized programs in Europe take the technical lead in airplane design as American aviation stagnated .
If you are someone who believes that the Internet and computer software are a transformative technology on a par with aviation , you may find it interesting to note that there is now a patent cease - fire in effect in the world of software , the occasional high - profile infringement case notwithstanding .
The reason for the cease - fire is simple : if companies like IBM , Xerox , and Sun were to begin fully enforcing their patent portfolios , it would mean an apocalypse of litigation for all software developers .
Everyone understands that the health and growth of the Internet are contingent on ignoring the patent system as much as possible .
At the same time , more patents are being granted than ever before , for broader claims , and with an almost complete disregard for prior art .
Entire companies - and not just legal firms - are basing business models on extracting money from the patent system without actually creating any products .
And the boundaries of patent law are expanding .
For the first time in history , it 's possible to patent pure mathematical ideas ( in the form of software patents ) , or even biological entities .
The SARS virus was patented shortly after being isolated for the first time .
But if the patent system does n't even work for the archetypal example - two inventors , working alone , who singlehandedly invent a major new technology - why do we keep it at all ?
Who really benefits , and who pays ?
If this topic interests you , read Bruce Perens ' wonderful essay on software patents , which states the case more articulately and cogently than I ever could .
And please join me in drinking a toast to those prickly Wright brothers , who for all their foibles did something amazing on this day , and deserve all the credit and respect they so clearly craved .
Iraqis  especially the majority Shi’ites  are increasingly angry and frustrated about their situation and impatient for U.S. troops to leave , but most do not believe their country will fall apart , according to a major new poll [ . pdf ] released here Wednesday by the University of Maryland ’s Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) .
Seventy - one percent of the 1,150 randomly selected respondents interviewed for the survey in early September said they wanted all U.S. and coalition forces to leave Iraq within the next year , with more than half of them calling for the withdrawal to be completed within six months .
Moreover , nearly four in five respondents said they believed that the U.S. military in Iraq is " provoking more conflict than it is preventing , " while nearly 61 percent said they approved of attacks on U.S. - led forces , an increase of 14 percent compared to the last PIPA survey of Iraqi public opinion eight months ago .
Among the three main communal groups 
Shia , Sunnis , and Kurds  the biggest jump in negative opinion toward U.S. forces came from the Shi’ites , who comprise roughly 60 percent of the Iraq ’s population .
Nearly two of every three Shi’ites said they approved of attacks on U.S. - led forces , compared to 41 percent last January , just after a coalition of Shi’ite parties swept to victory in parliamentary elections .
At that time , only 22 percent of Shia respondents favored a U.S. withdrawal within six months .
The percentage has now risen to 36 percent , according to the PIPA poll .
The new survey , which to some extent mirrors the reported findings of a State Department - commissioned poll leaked to the Washington Post Wednesday , comes amid intensifying debate between most Democrats who favor setting a timeline for withdrawing forces and President George W. Bush and Republican loyalists who say that such a strategy would invite disaster .
That debate has been fueled in recent days by the disclosure of a classified National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE )  the consensus position of Washington ’s 16 national intelligence agencies .
Among other conclusions , it found that the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq have become a " cause celebre " for jihadists worldwide and fueled the growth and spread of terrorism and Islamic radicalism .
The administration , which was forced to declassify parts of the NIE under pressure from Democrats Tuesday , has also acknowledged that another NIE on Iraq  a draft version of which was described as " grim " by one source  is under preparation .
But the White House said it is not scheduled for completion until January , a timetable that has provoked protests from Democrats who believe that its conclusions are almost certain to stoke public anger here with the Iraq war and , if released before the elections , help them win control of at least one house of Congress .
The State Department poll , which was conducted from late June to early July , reportedly found that majorities of respondents in all regions of Iraq , except Kurdistan , said that the withdrawal of U.S. - led forces would " make them feel safer and decrease violence " and that nearly two out of three respondents favored an immediate departure .
The 71 percent majority who told PIPA they want a withdrawal within one year underlined a " growing sense of urgency " on the part of Iraqis , according to PIPA director Steven Kull , who noted that last January , 70 percent of respondents said they favored withdrawal within two years .
The only group that shows less eagerness for the military to leave are Sunnis , who comprise about 20 percent of the total population and have been most resistant to the U.S. occupation and unhappy with the Shia - dominated government .
The percentage of Sunnis who favor withdrawal within six months has dropped from 83 percent to 57 percent , although nine in 10 Sunnis still say they want U.S. troops out within a year .
Four out of five Iraqis  including 96 percent of Sunnis and 87 percent of Shi’ites  say that the U.S. is having a negative influence on the situation in Iraq , according to the poll , which found that Kurds still believe Washington ’s influence is positive by a 48 - 34 percent margin .
If , as most Democrats have urged , the U.S. made a commitment to withdraw from Iraq according to a specific timeline , 53 percent of respondents said they believed that would strengthen the Iraqi government , as opposed to only 23 percent who said they though it have the opposite effect .
" Basically , because U.S. forces are there , the Iraqi government does n’t really have the legitimacy it might have , " suggested Kull , who noted growing confidence , particularly on the part of Shi’ites , that Iraqi security forces will have become strong enough within the next six months to handle security challenges on their own .
Growing impatience with the U.S. military presence was also reflected in the strong approval among both Sunnis and Shi’ites for attacks on U.S. - led forces , which Kull called " the most disturbing finding " of the new survey .
If , however , the U.S. made a commitment to withdraw its troops according to a timetable , support for attacks would diminish , the poll found .
Nearly half of Sunnis and Shi’ites who said they support attacks said they would feel less supportive if such a commitment were made .
A major problem , however , is nearly four in five Iraqis believe that Washington wo n’t withdraw its troops because it plans to have permanent military bases in Iraq .
The same percentage also believes that even if the Iraqi government demanded that U.S. forces withdraw , Washington would not comply .
( Coincidentally and largely at the initiative of Democratic lawmakers , Congress is expected to approve a ban this week on the expenditure of any money appropriated for next year ’s defense budget for the purpose of building permanent bases in Iraq . )
Kull suggested that Iraqi skepticism about U.S. intentions may be behind the overwhelming approval among both Sunnis and Shi’ites for attacks on U.S. forces .
The poll uncovered no evidence , he said , for an ideological or related motive .
Indeed , the survey found that views of al - Qaeda and Osama bin Laden were remarkably negative .
While nearly 100 percent of Shi’ite and Kurdish respondents expressed unfavorable views of both , three out of four Sunnis agreed with them .
Nonetheless , disillusionment and anger with the situation in Iraq has clearly grown , according to the survey .
Fifty - two percent of all respondents now believe that the country is going in the " wrong direction "  up from 35 percent as recently as last June .
Among Shi’ites , a majority of 59 percent still believe it is going in the " right direction , " but that is down from 84 percent in January .
While the decline in optimism among Kurds has not been quite as sharp , Sunnis remain as deeply pessimistic as in January when 93 percent said the country was headed in the " wrong direction . "
" The trend is a very poor one , " said Kenneth Pollack , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
" There is no question that Iraqis are ever more frustrated and angry with the United States . "

Picasa for Linux available !
Google has indeed been working on Picasa , and it 's finally available for download at http://labs.google.com/
For the curious , here are a few tidbits about how it came to be .
When Google wanted to port Picasa to Linux , they faced a problem : the Picasa team was busy working on new projects , and having them also do a native port would have taken a while .
As an experiment , Google decided to give Wine a try .
A quick look showed that much of Picasa already worked , but key features were missing : the IWebBrowser API , SSL , scanner / camera support , removable media notification ( so you can insert a flash drive and have Windows notice it right away ) , and change notification ( so Windows can notify apps when new files are created ) , among others .
Fortunately , Wine was already halfway to having an implementation of IWebBrowser thanks to Jacek Caban 's Summer of Code 2005 project .
And all that other stuff could n't be * that * hard , right ? :-)
So Google engaged Codeweavers to add those features and fix any other bugs .
This resulted in tons of improvements to Wine ( see the list at code.google.com/wine.html ) , all of which are now in the public tree at winehq.org .
Many people assume that when porting a Windows app to Linux using Wine , the best thing to do is link Winelib into the application to create a native Linux application .
Not so !
It 's just as effective , and a heck of a lot easier , to run the same binary on both Windows and Wine .
So that 's what the Picasa team did .
Picasa for Linux uses slightly different text messages , but the .exe file is identical for both Windows and Linux .
Toward the very end , everything was looking great except that the initial assumption that most cameras emulate storage devices turned out to be wrong .
Fortunately , Marcus Meissner just happened to decide to implement libgphoto support ; his patch appeared at the perfect moment , and now Picasa supports both common flavors of cameras .
Two features left out of the Linux version were CD - ROM burning ( the driver Picasa uses is hard to support under Wine ) and movie playback ( Wine does n't have the necessary codecs ) .
Both are potentially fixable in a future version , but were beyond the scope of this first port .
One interesting challenge when shipping commercial apps for Linux is packaging -- do you choose RPM or Debian packages , or do you use a WIndows - style installer ?
The Picasa for Linux team chose all three , in hopes of pleasing everybody .
( Let 's see how well * that * works :-)
The Windows - style installer was implemented using the open - source Loki installer , and a few patches were contributed back for that , too .
The Picasa for Linux team had a blast .
It 's not often you get to pour resources into a vital open source project to help ship a commercial application !
We hope we get to do it again sometime soon , and we hope the results are good enough to encourage other companies to give Wine a try .
Thanks to the Wine community for a very capable platform ! -
Dan
VIEWPOINT
Matt Prescott
Governments are wrestling with problems of rising energy demands , rising costs and the spectre of climate change .
In this week 's Green Room , Dr Matt Prescott argues there is an easy first step to dealing with all three issues - banning the traditional light bulb .
They waste so much energy that if they were invented today , it is highly unlikely they would be allowed onto the market
Matt Prescott
Not so ; and it certainly cannot solve the coming climate crisis .
After turning off unnecessary pieces of equipment , improved energy efficiency is the cheapest way for developing countries to maximise their use of limited energy supplies , and for developed countries to achieve cuts in their carbon dioxide emissions .
One quick and simple option for improving energy efficiency would be to make greater use of compact fluorescent light bulbs .
Each one of these bulbs produces the same amount of light as an incandescent light bulb whilst being responsible for the emission of 70 % less carbon dioxide .
It also saves money ; about £ 7 ( $ 12 ) per year in the UK , more or less in other countries depending on electricity prices .
So why not just ban incandescent bulbs - why not make them illegal ?
They waste so much energy that if they were invented today , it is highly unlikely they would be allowed onto the market .
Nobody would suffer ; every energy - saving bulb would save money and help to curb climate change .
It is truly a win -win solution .
Cost benefit
With lighting contributing 5 - 10 % towards the typical electricity bill in the developed world , and even more in the developing world , the savings could really mount up .
Low - energy light bulbs would be a first step to curbing climate change
Given that investing $ 450 m could save $ 1.8bn , it is hard to understand why anyone would still choose incandescent bulbs .
In reality , few people seem to be prepared to pay the higher upfront cost of an energy - saving bulb , even though they have much lower running costs ; while many seem to feel they are entitled to pollute the Earth 's atmosphere without worrying about the consequences .
I have launched banthebulb.org because I feel that the time has come for the world 's governments to intervene in the market , and to remove the purchase price advantage that traditional light bulbs have enjoyed .
Simply forcing prices to include the full environmental costs of carbon emissions and pollution would be a good start .
This could be done through a tax on bulbs according to their energy use .
The tax level would vary between countries ; in the UK , a rate of one penny per watt , or £ 1 ( $ 1.77 ) per bulb , should suffice .
The resulting revenues could then be used to subsidise the price of energy - saving bulbs , and to promote greater energy efficiency generally .
Declaring plans to phase out , and eventually ban , traditional light bulbs by a deadline would help to ensure that profligate waste was not tolerated forever , and to kick - start an energy - efficiency revolution .
Bulbs for all
Given the huge subsidies awarded to the nuclear industry , it is clear that the funds certainly exist
In 2002 , the UK government spent £ 410 m on bailing out its near - bankrupt nuclear sector .
That would be more than enough to supply every household in Britain with three energy - saving light bulbs .
As former US President Bill Clinton pointed out at the UN climate negotiations in Montreal , helping the environment does not have to harm the economy .
In fact , a well planned , regulated and enforced energy - efficiency campaign could reduce waste and pollution , save money , create new jobs and stimulate innovation .
Successfully ditching incandescent light bulbs could even encourage us to aim higher when it came to cutting greenhouse gas emissions ; to increase efficiency in hot water systems , to insulate homes , to invest in combined heat and power schemes .
If we cannot deny ourselves incandescent light bulbs , which would require minimal sacrifice , how are we ever going to do the really difficult things such as cutting our reliance on fossil fuels , buying smaller cars or reducing our use of finite natural resources ?
Ending the life of this inefficient and obsolete technology is not enough to prevent damaging climate change ; but it is an easy first step , and one the world should not hesitate to take .
Dr Matt Prescott is director of banthebulb.org , an online campaign encouraging greater energy - efficiency .
He is also organiser of the Oxford Earth Summit , and writes the environmental weblog Earth - Info.net
The Green Room is a new series of environmental opinion articles running weekly on the BBC News website .
