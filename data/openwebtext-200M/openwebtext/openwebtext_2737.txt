Key Changes in the Proposed Financial Regulatory Reform Plan
By now , you have likely heard the buzz surrounding sweeping new regulations for the financial markets .
The Obama Administration has asked Congress to accept its suggestions and make them law .
( This may take some time , though , as Congress is wrestling with health care bill as well . )
But what are the proposed changes in the new Financial Regulatory Reform Plan ?
Here is an overview of the main points of the regulatory reform :
Federal Reserve to receive expanded powers
Under the new regulations the Federal Reserve would have the ability to supervise institutions considered “ too big to fail . ”
While this includes financial institutions , it also includes holding companies and any other companies that might be considered essential parts of the U.S. financial system and economy .
The Federal Reserve would be responsible for regulating and supervising such companies in an effort to prevent the development of a situation where the only options are bailout or fail .
The Federal Reserve will also have emergency powers to act in the event of financial emergency .
Timothy Geithner defended this action by pointing out , in his testimony to Congress , that “ You do n’t convene a committee to put out a fire . ”
A Financial Services Oversight Council would be formed to bring regulatory agencies together to figure out where to plug holes in the regulatory system and resolve disputes .
Additionally , the Council would be charged with identifying possible risks .
The Council would be separate from the Federal Reserve , and would not have authority over the Federal Reserve .
This increase in power offered to the Fed creates unease in many .
It is felt , in some circles , that the Federal Reserve already has too much influence and not enough accountability .
This increase of power for the Federal Reserve is troubling to some politicians , especially since efforts to audit the body have not made much headway .
Geithner and others assert that the increased authority of the Federal Reserve in the area of supervising large institutions will be balanced by a decrease in authority in the area of consumer matters and protection .
New Consumer Financial Protection Agency to be created
Currently , a variety of agencies — state and federal — regulate consumer financial products and services .
The Federal Reserve is one of these .
However , no agency has , as its primary purpose , the job of protecting consumers in financial ( especially debt - related ) transactions .
The establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency would change all of that .
It would regulate consumer transactions in matters of :
Savings
Payment
Debt
Credit
Other financial products and services
The main focuses , however , are expected to be on credit and debt .
The agency would be able to draft regulations demanding transparency , and forcing financial institutions to offer products and services that are simpler and more transparent .
Geithner refers to “ plain vanilla ” financial products — specifically mortgages — with straightforward pricing and terms as services that have long been missing from the markets .
New regulations offered by the agency could also conceivably require mortgage brokers to recommend the best loans for borrowers , and verify that they can afford the mortgages that they do choose .
Other powers that the consumer protection agency would like have include changes to overdraft loan policies , prepayment policies for loans , and perhaps even cap interest rates .
Current fair lending laws might even be enforced in a way that they are not right now .
The creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency would also result in the dismantling or absorption of other regulating agencies rendered redundant by the new body .
The Office of Thrift Supervision would be the first to go , with federal thrifts eliminated .
( These are financial institutions with a special charter .
Although they were originally intended to help with mortgages and savings , they offer a number of financial products and services and operate almost like regular banks , but with different rules . )
Consumer advocates applaud the creation of increased consumer protection .
Opponents worry that it will limit products and services currently offered , stifling future financial development , innovation and growth .
However , Geithner addressed these concerns in his testimony , pointing out that products considered too dangerous by some would still be allowed .
Indeed , there are those who feel that the reform does n’t go far enough .
Risky investments and “ weapons of financial mass destruction ” will now be closely regulated
Rather than getting rid of credit default swaps and derivatives , the new regulations will require … regulation .
Prior to the financial crisis , these types of investment products were virtually without regulation .
Unregulated derivatives trading was a key cause of the fall of some of the venerable financial institutions such as AIG , Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns .
Other risky financial products , such as adjustable - rate mortgages and loans made to those with bad credit , will still be allowed .
But lenders will be required to encourage borrowers to choose safer products .
Additionally , more transparency would be required for loans that go through the securitization process .
In addition to making sure that such investments are regulated , the reforms would also require private money pools to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Hedge funds would have to register with the SEC , and provide more information to regulators .
The idea behind these reforms — which are more sweeping than anything seen since the Great Depression — is to create a more stable financial system without completely squashing innovation .
These reforms are also aimed at creating a financial system that offers products and services that are understandable to the rest of us ordinary folks , providing consumers with the knowledge they need to ( hopefully ) make better financial decisions .
Of course , these are high - minded and admirable goals .
The real question is this :
Do you think the government can pull it off ?

Intro
With the Iranian election results disputed ( a dispute that the incumbent will likely win ) , I think it ’s important to revisit the American conventional wisdom about the Iran and its president .
Suspicious sources and a lazy media echo - chamber have instilled many misconceptions into the American public ’s mind about Iran .
This is worrisome because such misconceptions leave the American public vulnerable for the type of hawkish manipulations that led us into the Iraq war , and so for that reason US attitudes towards Iran need reexamining .
Nuclear Weapons Program
Top among the controversies surrounding Iran is the issue of their nuclear development .
One goal of Iran ’s energy policy is to use nuclear energy for domestic energy needs so that more of Iran ’s oil supplies can be diverted for foreign sale .
In developing their domestic nuclear energy program Iran has often skirted certain IAEA regulations , with the ostensible reason being that strict adherence to the rules has allowed the US to sabotage nuclear development contracts forged between Iran and other countries .
This evasion of IAEA directives has been the primary basis on which Iran has been accused of having a nuclear weapons program .
However , in 2007 , part of a United States National Intelligence Estimate was leaked that concluded that Iran had not worked on a nuclear weapons program since 1993 .
Ironically , Iran ’s first nuclear weapons programs was facilitated by America in the 1950s .
“ Vanish from the page of time ” vs. “ wiped from the map ”
Since he was elected in 2005 , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has received much criticism on his comments regarding Israel .
The most famous of these was given in a speech called “ A World Without Zionism ” in which he quoted a line from Ayatollah Khomeini .
An improper English translation painted him as calling for Israel to be “ wiped from the map . ”
When word got out there was an international uproar .
As it happens , in Persian there is no such idiom .
More accurate translations read “ The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem must [ vanish from ] the page of time . ”
The focus of the speech was a hopeful vision of a world free from Western oppression of Muslims , and , in context , it is clear that this is not policy — much less a military threat .
In fact , Iran has never made a military threat against Israel .
Israel has against Iran , though — many , many times .
Holocaust Denial
Ahmadinejad has also met sharp international criticism over his comments on the Holocaust .
The widespread and misleading allegation is that he denies that the Holocaust ever occurred .
It is undoubtedly true that Ahmadinejad has raised some uncomfortable questions about the Holocaust .
Indeed , in December 2006 , he even convened a conference to explore historical evidence for the Holocaust , and he also occasionally referred to people making “ a myth ” of the Holocaust .
However , as Iran Specialist Professor Shiraz Dossa states , while Ahmadinejad ’s “ rhetoric has been excessive and provocative , ” he “ has not denied the Holocaust or proposed Israel ’s liquidation .
What Ahmadinejad has questioned is the mythologizing , the sacralization , of the Holocaust . ”
Ahmadinejad ’s inflammatory statements are all in the context of the Palestinian struggle .
The questions are put in terms of skepticism towards the Holocaust ’s use in justifying Zionist colonialism in Palestine .
The intellectual exploration , undoubtedly born of a deep , sometimes justified , mistrust for the West , has never crossed the line into outright denial of the Holocaust .
When such statements have been conflated with anti-Semitism , Ahmadinejad has repeatedly clarified his position with statements like “ creating an objection against the Zionists does n’t mean that there are objections against the Jewish . ”
Conclusion
Undoubtedly , the recent election dispute in Iran leaves one questioning the democratic scruples of the country ’s leadership .
Ahmadinejad ’s Iran is far from the idyllic liberal democracy .
But , however great the fervor for Ahmadinejad ’s opponent , one need be careful not to lose sight of how unfairly Western caricatures of Iran have influenced attitudes toward the incumbent worldwide — a habit long in the making and likely slow to change .
In an interview with Register Hardware , Chinese handset maker ZTE revealed that the company plan to launch their first Android powered handset during Q2 2010 .
ZTE Sales Director Wu Sa , also hinted that the Android handset “ could be solar - powered ” too .
Back in March of this year , the company unveiled their first low - cost solar powered handset , the ZTE Coral 200 Solar .
With a price tag of just $ 40 , the phone ’s solar panels situated on the rear of the handset can provide upto 15 minutes of talk time for every hour in the sun .
However , Wu Sa was keen to add that the company will need to look carefully at how the Android platform ( and solar panel power ) would affect the handset ’s features and capabilities before production could go ahead .

Homosexual behavior seems pointedly un-Darwinian .
An animal that does n't pass along genes by mating with the opposite sex at every , well , conceivable opportunity , seems to be at an evolutionary disadvantage .
So what ’s in it for the 450 - plus species that go for same - sex sex ?
Two evolutionary biologists from University of California , Riverside , set out to answer that question in a paper published today in Trends in Ecology and Evolution .
" It 's been observed a lot , " says Nathan Bailey , a post - doctoral researcher at U.C. Riverside and lead study author , of same - sex sexual behavior in animals .
" But it took people a long time to put it in an evolutionary context . "
After studying dozens of published articles on the topic , Bailey and his colleague Marlene Zuk concluded that , in addition to being an adaptational strategy , " these behaviors can be a force , " Bailey said .
" They create a context in which selection can occur [ differently ] within a population . "
In the Laysan albatross , for example , previous research has shown that a third of all bonded pairs in a Hawaii colony are two females .
This behavior helps the birds , whose colony has far more females than males , by allowing them to share parenting responsibilities .
It also gives more stability to the offspring of males , already bonded to a female , who mate opportunistically with females in a same - sex couple .
Such a dynamic , then may force gradual changes in behavior and even physical appearance of the birds , the authors note .
Other researchers , however , are n't convinced that everything must fit into the evolutionary , adaptive rubric .
" You have to think outside of that , " says Paul Vasey , who studies Japanese macaque monkeys as an associate professor at the University of Lethbridge in Canada .
His work has shown that in female macaque monkeys at least , same - sex sexual behavior does n't seem to have any adaptational advantage , which " does n't jibe with how people want to think about it , " he says .
But , he concludes , " You ca n't impose your perspective on the species you 're studying .
Attempt to understand the world on its own terms . "
What does all this mean for discussions about human homosexuality ?
To be sure , says Bailey , " there can be crosstalk " between the disciplines of human and animal study , and both arenas promise to be fertile ground for further research .
Methods &
Tools is the sponsor of a large number of software development conferences , but I cannot find the time and budget to visit them .
This year I managed to find some time after the publication of my summer issue to visit Wednesday the Jazoon , an important Java event located in Zurich .
Besides the global morning keynote , the conference has five parallel tracks , so the first thing in the morning is to make your choice between 30 presentations .
This is easier for me , because I am not a Java specialist and so I focused on talks with content that could reach outside the Java community .
After James
Gosling the previous day , the Wednesday keynote was given by Danny Coward , Chief Architect of Sun ’s Client Software , which means Java SE , Java ME and JavaFX .
The topic of his talk was the top five points of both JDK 7 and JavaFX 1.2 .
For the upcoming JDK 7 , the main improvement will be on modularity ; multiple languages ( Groovy , JRuby ) performance support on the virtual machine ; some language addition like multiple exception handling ; more I/O API ; a new garbage collector .
For the new version 1.2 of JavaFX released in June , the top five points are : release on new platforms like Linux and some mobile phones ; more UI components ; layouts ; improvement of performance ; better ways to use data with RSS / atom feed support and a simple asynchronous framework .
He announced that another release of JavaFX is scheduled for the end of the year .
The keynote was completed with some nice demonstrations of the JavaFX capabilities .
Refactoring of Large Software Systems
My first choice in the technical session was ” Refactoring of Large Software Systems ” by Sibylle Peter and Sven Ehrke of Canoo Engineering .
The talk presented the refactoring of the architecture for an investment banking system .
After four years , the system architecture had become decayed , the original developers were no longer around and there were only few automated functional tests available .
Important evolutions were postponed , as modifications often created bad side effects .
However the application was very important for the bank and they wanted to keep using it for some more years .
The first activity was to analyze the 1800 Java classes and their dependencies .
The strategy was then to restructure the class content to separate clearly the services and the presentation functions using a service oriented architecture .
The project , that has already consumed 10 men / years and is still on going , is run on an agile mode .
Pair programming was an essential tool to ensure that refactoring practices where consistent across the team .
The main customer engineer served as a “ product owner ” .
This was fundamental for the Canoo team , as they needed somebody able to take decisions and knowing also the impact of the existing application on other systems .
Another important success factor was doing the refactoring without modifying the functionalities .
This allowed running tests comparing the results of the refactored application with the original system .
Trust is an essential component of the project , as the users have to let an external team restructure their critical system … without breaking it .
However as refactoring progressed , a team of the bank was also able to start evolving the system again .
When release dates were different between the two team , a “ branch and merge ” configuration management solution was adopted .
Some other lessons learned during the first phase were to have a large investment in automated testing and continuous integration , have an increased communication between the external refactoring team and the bank developers to synchronize architecture vision and transfer knowledge .
It is also important not to underestimate the time needed to learn the system functionalities ( where do you functionally test your technical refactoring ) and test the final results .
After the presentation , I talked with Sibylle and Sven to transform their presentation in an article for Methods & Tools .
They agree on the principle , so stay tuned to get a comprehensive written presentation of their experience .
The Power of Value – Domain Driven Design and Value Objects
The next presentation was ” The Power of Value – Domain Driven Design and Value Objects ” by Dan Bergh Johnsson of Omegapoint .
Although I was initially a little bit afraid that this presentation contains too much code , Dan truly achieved its goal : showing how to refactor code to make it more understandable , even for domain experts without programming knowledge ….
and doing it in a lively and funny way , which is important when you get up early to assist to a conference and the caffeine effect starts to diminish .
His definition of a value object is “ an object with data and behavior that has conceptual value ” .
His conclusions are that value objects help to decrease complexity ( and compound value objects are even better ) , that entities relieved complexity and value objects add extensibility , testability and evolution .
In the second part of the talk , he took the example of a part of code dedicated to charging a credit card and completely refactored it according the principles presented previously .
JavaServer Faces
The last presentation I saw was ” A complete Tour of JSF 2.0 ″ by Ed Burns of Sun and Martin Marinschek of IRIAN Solutions .
They presented of the new release of JavaServer Faces that had its specifications approved at the end of May .
Ed Burns recognized the criticism of the first version of JSF and announced that they have adopted a lot of innovations created in the community to integrate them in version 2.0 .
The new release is not a revolution , but a strong evolution .
Among the improvement , he cited composite components ; AJAX support , either declarative or programmatic ; partial state saving that will improve performance ; more system events ; better resources management : full “ library ” concept , support for versioning and internationalization ; the replacement of JSP by Facelets ; the possibility to have bookmarkable pages .
For the presenters , JSF is a real open source project ( that is not a “ just Sun ” project ) with a lot of different contributors .
The new version is more much easier to use and well worth a second look .
To complete this presentation , I talked with Micha Kiener of mimmacom which distributes IceFaces in Europe .
Micha is also a committer to JavaServer Faces and his point of view is interesting , even if he suggested that it could be biased due to his position ;o )
He also thinks that the community around JSF is strong and that the technology would continue to evolve even in the case where Oracle , that just bought Sun , decided to withdraw its financial support .
He does n’t see JavaFX as a direct competitor to JSF .
His view on the market is that some products ( JavaFX , Flex , Silverlight ) target more the mashup , media , gaming or mobile market .
On the other hand , JSF , GWT and their Ajax frameworks competitors are more used to develop applications with a “ traditional ” user interface , like on - line banking for instance .
That is how JSF is used by some major Swiss corporations .
He made also interesting remarks on the open source market and the commercial companies that try to monetize these technologies .
He sees some products , like user interface or programming frameworks , more as “ contributors ” to the software development infrastructure .
You can make some money in training and support as companies adopt them , but this stops when the company has its own competencies .
Other technologies , like databases or web servers , are applications that run the everyday software infrastructure .
In this case it is easier to sign long term support contracts .
I also had the chance met some of the Jazoon organizers , Christian Frei and Andreas Knobel , of Keynode .
They were very kind with me and happy with the fact that the conference audience was higher than last year .
There registered this year 1000 participants , around 50 % of them coming from outside Switzerland .
Videos of some of the conference talks should be available in July on Parleys the excellent conferences video web site .
You can also stay tuned on our Java videos and tutorial directory where the will be listed .

The New Jersey Nets have traded Vince Carter and Ryan Anderson to the Orlando Magic for Rafer Alston , Tony Battie and Courtney Lee .
" Vince [ Carter ] gives us a veteran , go - to scoring presence , especially at the end of games , " Magic general manager Otis Smith said in a statement .
" Our goal remains the same -- to win a championship .
Any time you can add an All - Star to help you reach your goals , you have to do it .
Vince has been a bonafide scorer in this league for 11 seasons and we are excited to add both him and Ryan [ Anderson ] to our team .
We thank Rafer , Tony and Courtney for their efforts and wish them success in the future . "
Carter found out about the trade at his basketball camp , adding he thought it was a joke at first .
" Every player hopes for an opportunity like this , to just once compete for an NBA championship , " Carter said .
" This a dream come true for me .
Now I have a chance to win a championship . "
An eight - time NBA All - Star , Carter grew up in Daytona Beach and lives in Orlando .
The trade gives the Magic even more star power on their quest to win an NBA championship .
The addition of Carter , 32 , to a lineup that already consists of All - Star players Dwight Howard , Rashard Lewis and Jameer Nelson would make Orlando the favorite to win the Eastern Conference title next year if the franchise also finds a way to bring back Hedo Turkoglu , who already has notified the team that he is opting out of his contract this summer .
Orlando is hoping Carter will provide center Howard with a perimeter scorer who can create his own shot -- something the Magic lacked in losing the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers .

It 's not the first time Microsoft has tried to wrestle away market share from free software using shady tactics .
Suddenly , Microsoft seems to have discovered that education is strategic for their enterprise and they are pouring resources into cornering the market ... at least in areas where Linux has the lead .
In Spain , Linux had a very good standing in government as well as in education , for example , in Extremadura , Andalucia , and other autonomous regions .
A couple of weeks ago , Microsoft focused on education in Catalonia , partially succeeded , and is now bent on taking over education in the whole country .
At the Microsoft Leaders Forum in Berlin in January , Spanish Secretary of State of Education , Eva Almunia , presented four students working with Tablet PCs , using Microsoft .
At that time , Almunia was the counsellor for culture , education , and sport in Arágon , and she told the media that Bill Gates was excited about the students ' performance with the " useful tool " in education .
According to a press release from HispaLinux , Spain 's national Linux association , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero 's government is finalizing a plan that would supply all children who attend state schools with personal computers with touch - screens so to " promote awareness within families of the usefulness of information and communication technologies and encourage their use . "
Specifically , we 're talking about Microsoft technologies .
Despite the enormous load this plan would have on the budget of each autonomous region ( which would have to foot the bill ) , and hence , on the taxpayer , not a cent would find it 's way back to any Spanish company .
The Spanish Ministry of Education has not considered any other vendor apart form Microsoft , there has n't been a public contest , and the media and other vendors were not informed about the pilot program until it was over .
Furthermore , no other alternative has been considered .
If the plan gets the green light , it would have dire consequences for the communities of Andalucía , Castilla - La Mancha , Extremadura , Valencia , and all the other autonomous regions that already have a Linux - based IT infrastructures , which have already been paid for and are in use , in place within their school systems .
Hamburgers frying on grills opposite LCBO headquarters today signalled a readiness by union workers to hit the picket line tomorrow night at midnight .
A trend toward part - time and casual jobs , and a management proposal to be able to issue 90 - day layoff notices at any time — to any employee — remain the top two bones of contention , union leaders said .
" This is about workers being poorly treated — part - time and casual workers , " union vice - president and treasurer Patty Rout told reporters near a parked trailer ready to become a strike command centre .
" Twenty years ago , all the jobs were full - time , " she said .
" Now , 60 per cent are part - time or casual , people making $ 10 to $ 17 an hour , making less than $ 20,000 a year . "
Earlier in negotiations , LCBO managers asked for the freedom to lay off an employee for 90 days and then call the person back again , said Ontario Public Service Employees Union representative Craig Hadley .
" So even full - time jobs are not secure , " he said .
A blackout on news from collective bargaining talks prevented union representatives from saying how close or far apart the parties are on an agreement .
Inside the trailer , parked half a block east of Yonge St. near the waterfront , picket signs reading " Half a Job is Not Enough " and " Ontario Needs Good Jobs " were piled high as though ready for use .
" This is n't a money thing , " Hadley said when asked what wage demands the union is making .
" Going in , we were looking to match inflation , " he said .
" Where that 's gone , I do n't know . "
The timing of the strike deadline for provincial liquor store workers and the strike by Toronto city workers is purely coincidental , she said .

When asked about online privacy , most people say they want more information about how they are being tracked and more control over how their personal information is used .
Those consumer expectations are rarely in line with the data collection practices of Internet companies , which often collect information about their users not only on their own sites , but also when those users visit other sites across the Web .
Those are some of the central findings of a new privacy study conducted by a group of graduate students at the University of California , Berkeley , which was released late Monday .
The students at the School of Information — Joshua Gomez , Travis Pinnick and Ashkan Soltani — studied consumer expectations by looking at sources like complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission and data collected by the state of California and a privacy group .
They analyzed company practices using Ghostery , a browser plug - in that detects cookies , Web beacons and other types of trackers that allow third parties to gather information about Web site visitors , often without their knowledge .
Google showed up as the most conspicuous tracker on third - party sites .
Google Analytics , a free product that allows online publishers to gather statistics about visitors to their sites , was used on 81 of the top 100 sites .
Cookies from the advertising company DoubleClick , which is owned by Google , were present on 70 of those sites .
When combining trackers from those two services , Google had a presence on 92 of the top 100 sites .
Others were n’t far behind .
Cookies from Atlas , Microsoft ’s DoubleClick rival , appeared on 60 sites , and trackers from two other analytics companies , Quantcast and Omniture , showed up on 54 sites .
The findings roughly line up with those in other studies of third - party tracking on the Web .
Researchers from AT&T Labs and Worcester Polytechnic Institute , for instance , looked at a much larger sample of 1,200 popular Web sites and found Google trackers on 61 percent of them .
Omniture ’s tracker was on 34 percent and Microsoft ’s on 24 percent .
What is striking in the Berkeley students ’ report is that in a sample of nearly 400,000 Web domains , Google ’s presence remained high , at 88 percent , while those of other companies declined sharply .
The second most frequent tracker in that sample was from an analytics company called StatCounter , which appeared on only 7 percent of domains .
Assuming the data is accurate , it is a testimony to the widespread popularity of Google ’s services like Analytics , DoubleClick and AdSense , the company ’s contextual advertising network , which is used by a large percentage of Web sites small and large .
“ I do n’t know that anyone has identified the scope and depth of the coverage that Google has across the Web in terms of tracking , ” Mr. Soltani said .
“ Our data shows that even if you are not going to Google , if you are browsing the Web they are collecting data about you . ”
The implications of the study , however , are not exactly clear .
“ We are not claiming that Google aggregates information from each of these trackers into a central database , though it does possess the capability to do so , ” the researchers wrote .
But Google disputes even that .
For instance , it said that the cookies used by its analytics service are different on each Web site , so they do not allow the company to track a user from site to site .
“ It does n’t enable any cross - site tracking , ” said Mike Yang , managing counsel at Google .
Mr. Yang also said Google ’s contracts with customers do not allow it to merge data from various services like DoubleClick and AdSense , or to link that data to personal information that Google collects when users sign up for its other services .
What ’s more , the data from the Berkeley study , which reports the presence of trackers by domain , can overstate the amount of tracking that is taking place .
Many large domains like MySpace can include multiple sites with thousands of pages , if not tens or hundreds of thousands of pages .
The presence of a tracker on one site or page does n’t mean users are tracked across the entire domain .
Still , the numbers are eye - catching .
And as important as the numbers themselves is what the study says about the disconnect between how Americans conceive of privacy , company practices and the government ’s approach to regulation of those practices , said Chris Hoofnagle , director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology ’s information privacy programs , who helped advise the students .
“ Consumers were complaining to the F.T.C. about a lack of control over personal information , ” Mr. Hoofnagle said .
“ That is very different from how the F.T.C. has framed the issue , ” he said , noting that under the Bush administration , the agency frowned on privacy practices only if they caused harm to consumers .
Mr. Hoofnagle added : “ We have a new F.T.C. now .
They may scrap the ‘ harm ’ approach and look at some other method for balancing rights and responsibilities . ”

According to the Guardian and the Independent , experts are hard at work collecting over 10,000 inscriptions that nobody has translated in over 500 years since Ferdinand and Isabel evicted the Moors from their mighty fortress .
Using the high - tech gear , they 've managed to translate about half of the job so far , and have compiled over 3,000 in a DVD .
The work continues , and an updated DVD , possibly complete , will come out in 2010 .
Too bad nobody bothered to show the 3D laser scanner itself in action , because I assume it 's a pretty cool — if painstaking — process .
I 've been all over the Alhambra myself — it'd be a pretty amazing place to " work . "
What do the inscriptions say ?
Mostly the Nasrid motto : " There is no victor but Allah . "
But in accordance with that particularly fruitful time in Arabic culture , there are an awful lot of other things written on the walls , from poetry to aphorisms , such as " Be sparing with words and you will go in peace . "
Funny since that 's one bit of advice the artists did n't heed themselves .

Kim Jong-il is shown at the opening session of North Korea 's parliament in April 2009 .
He appeared considerably thinner and older than photos from 2008 .
( ( KRT / Associated Press ) )
North Korea criticized the United States Monday for positioning missile defence systems around Hawaii , calling it a plot to attack the reclusive regime .
" Through the U.S. forces ' clamorous movements , it has been brought to light that the U.S. attempt to launch a pre-emptive strike on our republic has become a brutal fact , " the North 's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary .
U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates has said he ordered the ground - based , mobile missile intercept system and radar system to Hawaii over concerns the North would launch a long - range missile towards the state .
Rodong Sinmun also accused the U.S. of deploying an aircraft carrier and two submarines armed with nuclear warheads to the waters near the Korean Peninsula .
The deployment proves " the U.S. pre-emptive nuclear war " on the North is imminent and that Pyongyang will bolster its nuclear arsenal in response , said the report .
U.S. officials would not confirm the ship 's location , but it is based in Yokosuka , Japan .
Earlier this month , a Japanese newspaper reported North Korea could carry out a long - range missile test toward Hawaii by early July .
Believed to be a long - range Taepodong - 2 with a range of up to 6,500 kilometres , the missile would be launched from the Dongchang - ni site between July 4 and 8 , said the Yomiuri daily .
The missile was n't expected to be able to reach Hawaii 's main islands , which are about 7,200 kilometres from the Korean Peninsula .
Kim Jong - il photos likely doctored : report
Also Monday , South Korean media reported a photo of North Korean leader Kim Jong - il that appeared on June 14 was likely a doctored photo of an earlier one published in April .
The photo , which appeared on state television , shows Kim visiting an army unit , said the Chosun Ilbo newspaper .
It is almost identical to an April 25 photo of Kim , according to an assessment of South Korean intelligence agencies , said the report .
In both photos , which the newspaper published , Kim stands with a group of soldiers with the same ceiling lights above them and a banner calling for loyalty to the leader behind them .
The positioning of many of people in the photos is largely the same — except for a dozen figures who do not appear in the later image .
Citing unidentified South Korean security officials , the newspaper said there was a " high possibility " the image was recycled .
The reclusive North Korean leader 's health has been the focus of keen attention since he reportedly suffered a stroke last August without publicly naming a successor .
He looked gaunt in an April appearance in North Korea 's parliament .
Earlier this month , North Korea named Kim's 26 - year - old son , Jong Un , as the country 's next leader .

Here comes the latest in the wonderful series of profiles from our guest writer , Utkarsh Joshi .
This is the story of Padmashree Dr. Anil Joshi , who learnt early in life that in order to develop the hill community where he worked as a lecturer , he would have to focus on rural advancement and making the best use of local resources .
Read on to know how he brought about this revolution .
To the people of the hills in the upper reaches of India he is no less than a messiah and what he has achieved is no less than a miracle .
Padmashree Dr. Anil Joshi , or “ Sir ” as the local populace refers to him , has made it his life ’s mission to make the villagers in the hills more self reliant – by promoting the local economy through local means and by upgrading generational hand - me - down wisdom .
Dr. Anil Joshi was born in 1955 in Kotdwara – a small town on the edge of Uttrakhand , at the foothills of the Shivalik range of the Himalayas .
A bright student , he did well through school and college and after completing his PhD. in environmental science he eventually joined the Kotdwara government college as a lecturer .
But being a man of the hills , he wanted to do more for the mountain community than just research .
With inaccessibility , a lack of infrastructure , and most of the men folk either working in urban centers or foot soldiers in the army – these communities were getting increasingly dependent on urban centers and products for their livelihood .
The answer as per the young Dr. Joshi was rural development and one which needed to employ local resources and make the villagers self reliant .
That was the initial thought with which he tried to break ice with the locals , telling them that he was a social worker .
But most of the villagers he first approached shunned him , telling him that since he was not staying with them , he would not know enough to help !
When he remarked he was a social worker – they asked why he did n’t think of roads or schools .
But he remained patient and slowly worked on building his relationship with the hill community .
It ’s a relationship which has prospered in the intervening 29 years and brought about a silent revolution in the way these communities exist today .
He began alone , but decided to give a more formal name and face to his approach , and thus Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organization or HESCO was formed in 1981 .
Some of his students and colleagues joined him as well .
Based on their fundamental principles of participatory research and with a combination of science and tradition , they have gone to villages and enlisted local people to help them with their research .
Doing this , they have developed new things while at the same time upgrading their hand - me - down knowledge to make them more relevant in today ’s age .
For instance , the hills were overrun with ‘ Kurri ’ a wild shrub which was identified by the HESCO team as a weed .
They identified uses for the shrub in order to control its growth .
The sticks were strong enough to be used for furniture , the flowers and leaves could be used for incense sticks and the leftovers as fodder for goats !
This has provided employment as well as monetization .
HESCO has also worked on upgrading the local water mill used to grind grain or the ‘ gharat ’ – to make it an effective tool for power generation and provided indigenous electricity to these villages .
According to Dr. Joshi , if all the traditional ‘ gharats ’ are modernized in the same way , local employment can mushroom while at the same time the hills can produce up to 2500 MW of power for the country at practically no cost !
Stopping landslides and soil erosion using biological methods ; creating a social platform for women to generate employment and marketing opportunities ; advocating forest fire prevention and disaster management methods ; circulating a local children ’s newspaper ; using local development as a tool to wean away youth from anti social activities in border states – these are just some of the activities that HESCO and Dr. Joshi have been tirelessly working on to bring about a change .
His highly educated team gets paid between Rs 2000 and Rs 6000 per month but their motivation keeps them going .
Promotion
The government and the international community have also taken note of the stellar work that is being done by Dr. Joshi and team .
Dr. Joshi was awarded the Padamshree in 2006 and HESCO works closely with government organizations like the Department of Science and Technology , Department of Bio-Technology , BSF , ITBP , CRPF , the Social Security Board – to name a few .
Dr Joshi ’s role model is Mahatma Gandhi , and he believes that to help the common people , one needs to stay with them and stay like them .
Thus he leads a simple and austere life with the villagers and knows that his work is far from done .
But he can sit back and be satisfied as an agent of change for his first love – the hills .
It is not everyone who has the satisfaction of doing something which impacts close to 5 lakh villagers , in more than 10,000 villages , spread across 9 mountain states of the Himalayas .
The mountain man has truly lived up to his name .

Ok , this stuff is really just getting too outrageous to put into words .
A shocking new report reveals that our troops have been forced to steal water because defense contractors such as Halliburton have either not provided enough water to meet their basic needs or provided them with water loaded with contaminants .
CBS affiliate KHOU - TV in Houston has discovered that some soldiers were forced to ration water , perhaps as little as 2 - 3 liters per day , because there was never enough .
It is less than the one gallon minimum a day that an Army manual says is necessary just to survive in a desert environment .
In fact , an Army training document on preventing heat casualties states that water losses in the desert can reach 15 liters ( about four gallons ) a day per soldier .
Army Staff Sgt. Dustin Robey told KHOU correspondent Jeremy Rogalski that soldiers would throw up or pass out from dehydration .
Chronic dehydration can lead to such problems as kidney stones , urinary infection , rectal afflictions and skin problems , and can have long - term health problems , including kidney injury .
Robey said in 2003 his company would run out of water on missions , forcing them to improvise , like drinking water from whatever taps they found .
Unfortunately , the often - untreated Iraqi water can cause intestinal illnesses .
Robey said 50 to 60 members of his company got dysentery .
Desperate , Robey said he and his commander were reduced to stealing water from supplies stored at Baghdad International Airport .
Virtual Production Can Be Real for Everybody .
Here ’s How .
The production line from development to post can be costly in part because of the timescales and in part because of the inability to truly iterate at the point of creativity .
A virtual production model breaks down these silos and brings color correction , animation , and editorial closer to camera .
With more than million searches each day NowTorrents is one of the larger torrent search engines on the Internet .
The site has grown steadily during recent months , and everything was looking great until a few hours ago , when the owner lost its domain .
The domain was hijacked and parked on an account at the popular registrar GoDaddy .
With a few million visitors a month most of the larger torrent sites make lucrative targets for scammers and hackers wanting to cash in on these traffic magnets .
In November 2008 , someone used a forged CA driver ’s license to take over Torrentz.com , and put some of his own ads on the site .
Luckily , the hijack took less than a day to bring to an end and things were back to normal before most users even noticed that something was wrong .
But Torrentz is not the only torrent site to interest hackers .
NowTorrents , a torrent meta - search engine that recently acquired a spot among the 10 most visited torrent sites on the Internet , is facing a similar problem .
This morning , the admin of the site noticed that he was no longer in control of the domain name as it was transferred to a new registrar , GoDaddy .
Coincidentally , the admin also had two of his email accounts hacked , which could very well be the cause of the domain troubles .
He told Torrent Freak that he is doing all he can to resolve the issues .
Google has reinstated one of his email accounts after some emails back and forth .
GoDaddy , where the domain was transferred after it was hijacked , is currently looking into the case .
It can usually take up to a week before the domain gets transferred back to the rightful owner , the admin said .
However , by putting in some calls to a supervisor at GoDaddy he hoped to speed up this process a little .
How the ‘ hacker ’ gained access to the domains remains a mystery for now .
The email password was secure and not really guessable , and all signs currently point to a keylogger .
It would n’t be the first time that this has happened to an admin of a torrent site .
Nevertheless , the admin of NowTorrents is confident that he will soon regain access to his site .
Meanwhile its users will have to be patient and look for alternatives until the site comes back .
Update : the site is coming back slowly , waiting for the DNS to propagate .
But it was unclear whether Mr Mousavi would agree to a recount on these terms .
His supporters believe this offer may simply be a ploy to buy time and defuse the street protests .
Mr Mousavi did not appear at his supporters ' rally and , at first , advised people to stay away to avoid bloodshed .
But tens of thousands still gathered in the early evening , staging a largely silent protest march which streamed past the headquarters of state television .

Is this a legitimate attraction , or does it strike you as just a little bit…off ?
A few days ago , NPR reported on one of the world ’s newest tourist attractions … in one of the world ’s most unlikely places .
That ’s right — one of Saddam Hussein ’s many palaces , this one located near the site of ancient Babylon and the modern city of Hilla , is now open to the public .
A quick tour goes for around a buck , while a night in one of the complex ’s swanky guesthouses will run you $ 180 .
Reactions
Iraqis have so far exhibited mixed reactions to their country ’s newest tourist draw .
For some , setting foot in the palace , which still features murals depicting the ex-dictator , conjures up too many bad memories .
Others , though , relish the symbolism : Saddam is gone , and his once - exclusive realm is now open to ordinary Iraqis .
It ’s unclear how many international visitors will be lured by the opening of the palace .
Apart from the poorly preserved ruins of Babylon , the region does n’t offer much in the way of tourist infrastructure .
Oh yeah , and there ’s still a war going on .
Yet , some folks are set on making the journey to Iraq to see the situation for themselves .
If you ’re one of them , make sure to check out today ’s companion piece , “ How To Travel To Iraq Without Getting Killed . ”
Community Connection :
I ’d love to hear what any Iraqis think of this development .
Would you visit Saddam ’s Babylon palace ?
What about the rest of you ?
Is this a legitimate attraction , or does it strike you as just a little bit…off ?
Twitter launched the first phase of its Verified Accounts program moments ago , meaning that celebrities , musicians , athletes , actors , public officials and public agencies on the service can now display a " verified account " button on their Twitter pages .
For instance , visiting Twitter.com / mashable , you 'll see that I am indeed the real Pete Cashmore .
Likewise , Twitter celebrities like Ashton Kutcher and Oprah now carry the button .
Those wishing to apply for verified status can visit the verified accounts help page , which explains :
With this feature , you can easily see which accounts we know are ' real ' and authentic .
That means we 've been in contact with the person or entity the account is representing and verified that it is approved .
( This does not mean we have verified who , exactly , is writing the tweets . )
This also does not mean that accounts without the ' Verified Account ' badge are fake .
The vast majority of accounts on the system are not impersonators , and we do n't have the ability to check 100 % of them .
For now , we 've only verified a handful of accounts to help with cases of mistaken identity or impersonation .
The feature has been a long time coming , and many celebrities will jump on the opportunity to prove their legitimacy .
It 'll also solve the entrenched problem of celebrity impersonations , which are confusing for users and unwelcome by those being impersonated .
Businesses , however , will have to wait : the feature has not been rolled out to corporate entities yet .
Who is Verified on Twitter ?

Who is verified and who is not , you ask ?
At first glance it would appear that only celebrities and those with large followings are included - please do post the names of verified users in the comments and we 'll compile a collaborative list .
Candlelight protests in Seoul , June 10 , 2008 .
By George Katsiaficas
May 25 , 2009 --
The suicide of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun on May 23 , 2009 , left South Korea in shock .
All over the country , tens of thousands of tearful people sought to eulogise and memorialise Roh — to find ways to express their grief and anger .
Conservative government politicians were blocked by local residents from joining tens of thousands people who made the journey to Roh ’s small hometown the day he died .
Not only were they refused admittance , many people splashed them with water and chanted that they should get out — shaming them into leaving .
Opposition party spokesperson Kim Yu-jeong expressed what is in many people ’s hearts when he blamed Roh ’s tragic death on the conservative government ’s relentless and disrespectful offensive against him :
“ The people and history know what made the former president do something so tragic . ”
Police form a cordon around the Deoksugung Palace on May 23 , 2009 , where a spontaneous memorial for Roh was erected .
During his presidency Roh had often compared himself to Abraham Lincoln .
Both men owed their education to diligent home schooling and sought to bring new progressive policies to their countries .
While Lincoln ’s life was taken by an assassin ’s bullet , Roh ’s tragic fate is being seen as no less tied to vengeful attackers .
A former aide declared , “ The late President Roh had appeared to be exhausted from the prosecutors ’ investigation . ”
Despite many people ’s outrage with the conservative Lee Myung - bak government ’s stranglehold on the nation ’s democracy , police buses encircled a memorial site in Seoul for former president Roh , and riot squads refused to open their cordon of buses , compelling thousands of people bringing incense and prayers to line up through subway stations .
Nearly 1000 police were deployed in front of the memorial at Deoksugung Palace ; altogether over 8000 police were sent into the streets for crowd control . [ 1 ]
Trade union leader Park Jong - tae committed suicide on May 3 , 2009 .
In 2008 , South Korea 's suicide rate was already counted as the highest among OECD members , but Roh ’s suicide is the second in recent weeks believed to have resulted directly from Lee Myung - bak ’s pursuit of all who do not march in lockstep with his programs and policies .
On May 3 , union leader Park Jong - tae , head of Korea Cargo Transport Workers ’ Union ( KCTWU ) in Kwangju , killed himself to protest the unilateral firing without discussion of 78 delivery drivers for the Kwangju branch of Korea Express ( which has the largest number of labour union members in Korea Express ) .
Labour Minister Lee Young - hee publicly ridiculed Park ’s suicide , saying at a press conference that he did not think the labour conflict was significant enough to end one ’s life over . [ 2 ]
Despite his status as labour minister , Lee has refused to agree to engage in dialogue with the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the KCTWU .
Adding that holding talks with groups engaging in “ illegal acts ” like demonstrations , Lee ’s remarks were echoed by President Lee Myung - Bak ’s similar refusal to agree to speak directly with trade union leaders .
On the contrary , police announced that they have applied for the arrest warrants for seven union leaders who led the memorial rallies for Park Jong - tae in Daejeon on May 6 .
Ten days later , at least 457 workers were arrested at a demonstration there when 15,000 union members gathered to mourn Park and demand reinstatement of the fired delivery drivers .
According to the legal director of the KCTWU , after police recklessly attacked the dispersing demonstrators , they arrested even people who were eating dinner or on their way home . [ 3 ]
The new Lee Myung - bak administration has wasted little time in seeking to roll back the clock of progressive democratic reforms won by South Koreans through decades of arduous struggles .
Ten years of progressive administrations under Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo -hyun resulted not only in more liberties but also in higher standards of living for many people .
Although progressive presidents embraced neoliberal policies , turning more than 50 % of all Korean workers into part - timers and thereby creating a widening division between rich and poor , they also legalised autonomous trade unions , worked out a tripartite system ( of business , labour , and government ) to manage industrial relations , and permitted a wide range of protests .
The Lee Myung - bak administration seeks to undo many of the policies of its progressive predecessors .
Fifteen days after the inauguration of the Lee Myung - bak administration in January 2008 , government officials forcibly removed members of a part - time workers ’ union from an ongoing sit -in demonstration .
The new Lee Myung - bak government released leaders of chaebol ( the giant corporations that control much of the South Korean economy ) convicted of corruption and imprisoned under President Roh Moo-hyun , stepped up prosecution of immigrant workers who overstayed their visas , and designed a new Seoul police unit of 1700 specially trained riot police .
President Lee plans to replace the 40,000 strong police force filled with military conscripts with a more streamlined version — to which he will add 14,000 more elite men .
For many people , this policy , like many others of the Lee Myung - bak government , resembles those of disgraced former dictator ( and Lee Myung - bak ’s friend ) Chun Doo-hwan .
( In this case , Lee ’s plan resembles the Baekgoldan — white skull corps — established by Chun . )
Under Roh Moo -hyun ’s leadership , enormous strides were made investigating tens of thousands of state - sanctioned murders during the Cold War .
On the island of Jeju , for example , where more than 30,000 people were massacred beginning in 1948 under the auspices of a US military government , Roh twice apologised and named Jeju a “ peace island . ”
The Lee Myung - bak government has reopened the wounds on Jeju by insisting some of the victims were , in fact , communists — and presumably should have been killed then .
Lee Myung - bak abolished the official commission investigating Korean collaborators during Japanese colonial rule and marginalised others looking into human rights abuses by past dictators .
In August 2008 , the government announced its decision to build 11 more nuclear power plants by 2030 and proposed a Grand Canal to cut across the peninsula — both of which have been termed ecological nightmares .
When popular protests against his canal scheme forced him publicly to promise not to build it , he nonetheless continues to scheme the project ’s continuation through a revised “ four rivers plan . ”
Lee Myung - bak criminalised organisers of peaceful candlelight protests , and ordered his police to search for them even in the car of a high - ranking Buddhist leader in Seoul , leading to protests by more than 200,000 Buddhists .
[ 4 ]
He has so brainlessly pursued his own misplaced agenda that high school girls who led months of candlelight protests against his agreement to import US beef without restriction dubbed him “ 2MB ” — the slowest operating speed of a modern computer , as well as a play on his family name , which also means two .
Of all the troubling initiatives undertaken by the Lee Myung - bak government , none is more unsettling than its offensive against the media .
In July 2008 , MBC television producers were taken to court for alleged exaggerations in a documentary on US beef imports , and when they refused to show up , over the next ten months , they were arrested one by one as they went about their daily lives ( including a bride - to - be planning her wedding ) .
In August , the KBS president was forced to resign — even briefly detained — and replaced with Lee ’s crony .
A friend of the president was named to head Arirang English channel .
The 24 - hour all - news cable station YTN was sent a new president .
When union leaders and members sought to block him from coming to work , police intervened .
Union leaders were repeatedly summoned for questioning .
Even though they complied four times , they were arrested .
The internet also came under close scrutiny .
On July 24 , Google Korea came under pressure from the government , confirming it had been pressured to delete two pieces of video footage showing the brother of National Police Commissioner managing a hotel that allowed prostitution .
[ 5 ]
Minerva , a blogger who had correctly reported on the global crisis and embarrassed the government by revealing its incompetent handling of the economy , was tracked down and prosecuted ( although subsequently exonerated ) .
After the government implemented new restrictive requirements for internet postings , in early May 2009 , internet writer and poet Yang Hyung - ku was arrested on charges of violating the National Security Law .
Yang had posted hundreds of articles , including a few dozen advocating a federation model for Korean unification and Juche thought . [ 6 ]
The president and his cronies may be free to pressure the media , but when ordinary citizens do so , it is evidently a crime .
A citizens ’ boycott against the country ’s conservative newspapers ( Chosun Ilbo , JoongAng Ilbo and Dong - A Ilbo ) was declared illegal , and charges filed against its internet organisers .
Their passports were seized .
The government 's attempt to control the media is so intense that it has criminalised even citizens who hold press conferences .
“ New Right ” ideologues are delighted .
Fashioning themselves after US neoconservatives , they revised newly rewritten textbooks that broke ground by denying the role of the democracy movement in the country ’s progress .
The New Right helped produce an “ updated ” government history video , distributed widely to school teachers , which did not include mention of the Kwangju Uprising as part of South Korean democratisation .
Ahead of a formal investigation , Lee Myung - bak ’s New Right supporters have already labelled the entire 1948 Jeju Uprising communist as part of their more general campaign to revive the “ red complex ” .
One reason for the Lee Myung - bak government ’s attacks on media and revision of history is to cover their new closeness with Japan .
For ten years , progressive administrations cultivated ties with China — now South Korea ’s main trading partner .
Lee Myung - bak seeks to undo that legacy and reorient the country closer to Japan — following in the footsteps of both Park Chung - hee and Chun Doo-hwan .
Born in Japan where he used the name Akihiro Tsukiyama , Lee Myung - bak has personally met every month with the Japanese prime minister .
He refuses to tolerate even mild - mannered protests against his Japanese friends .
On December 10 , 2008 , the 60th anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights , his government sent six buses of riot police to dismantle a peaceful protest by former “ comfort women ” and their supporters in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul .
Although the weekly one - hour vigils have gone on since 1992 , the government declared the rally illegal because no one had applied for a permit .
Furthermore , the police now insist no demonstration can come within 300 metres of the Japanese embassy .
On January 12 , 2009 , at his monthly summit with Japanese Prime Minister Aso , Lee announced that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , a Japanese company which has ignored demands of hundreds of Korean women to be paid for forced labour during the period of Japanese colonisation , was selected to launch a South Korean satellite in 2011 .
Although South Korea ’s trade deficit with Japan is expected to be above US $ 32 billion in 2008 and Mitsubishi rejected technology transfer as part of its offer , Lee personally ordered the change in the contract from a Russian company , which had included technology transfer .
Lee was reported to be in favour of “ strengthening South Korea ’s economic relationship with Japan to shake off its blow from the global financial crisis ” . [ 7 ]
At a time when China is the region ’s rising economic powerhouse and Japan has been mired in economic doldrums for a decade , Lee Myung - bak rivals Inspector Cousteau in finding clues on how to carry the South Korean economy forward .
Of course , he is not alone in his adulation of Japan .
Others see in South Korea a “ facsimile ” of Japan , “ a superior , homogeneous nation uniquely fit among Asians to the tasks of the modern world ” .
[ 8 ]
Cooperating with Japan against North Korea is a shameful action for any Korean patriot , but the president makes no apologies — leading many people to question his loyalties .
Clearly , Lee Myung - bak admires former US president George W. Bush .
On April 19 , 2008 , only a few months after he became president , he visited Bush at Camp David .
After driving the presidential golf cart around the compound , Lee promised that evening to lift Seoul ’s five - year ban on US beef — setting off months of candlelight vigils that compelled him subsequently to modify his capitulation to US demands for unlimited exports .
“ What he did was little different from an ancient Korean king offering tribute to a Chinese emperor , ” commented homemaker Kim Sook - yi .
“ This time we give tribute to Washington ? ” [ 9 ]
Lee Myung - bak continues to emulate Bush - era policies , even though they have been disastrous for the US and the world economy .
After Lee Myung - bak ’s first minister of economics was compelled to resign for his incompetence , his replacement has been even more forceful in pushing tax cuts for the rich , privatising the public sector ( including in education and health care ) , expanding labour market “ flexibility ” ( i.e. part - time work with no benefits ) , and relaxing business and financial regulations .
“ MB - nomics ” [ Lee Myung - bak is commonly referred to as ``MB ’’ ] has slashed wages for new employees and seeks to extend the two - year cap for temporary workers as well to shrink current restrictions on hiring of part - time employees .
Not only has the Lee Myung - bak administraion alienated North Korea ( which recently nullified the contract for the Kaesong Industrial Complex and accelerated its nuclear program ) , but Lee Myung - bak ’s stubborn imposition of his cronies in high positions has also opened a wide split within the conservative party .
True to his nickname , “ the bulldozer ” , Lee Myung - bak refuses to compromise with any of his critics — even within his own party .
Instead he and the New Right are opening a new era in South Korean politics , in which forceful implementation of unpopular and questionable policies runs roughshod over dissent and chews up anyone standing in its path .
On May 20 , 2009 , during a press conference presided over by Prime Minster Han Seung - soo , the government announced its unilateral decision to discontinue permits for large demonstrations in cities and empowered police to arrest anyone committing the now - illegal act of meeting in public .
In Prime Minister Han ’s words , “ The government intends to counter illegal strikes and violent demonstrations that could have negative effects on the nation ’s economy .
To reach the level of an advanced nation , it is necessary to correct the backwardness of our demonstration culture . ” [ 10 ]
The threat posed by Lee Myung - bak to South Korea ’s economic wellbeing , political progress and democratic liberties is grave .
With little or no opposition in the National Assembly , extra- parliamentary forces will continue to mobilise against him no matter how much he seeks to criminalise even the mildest forms of public dissent .

Choe Sang - hun , “ Protests in Seoul Galvanize Koreans , ” International Herald - Tribune , June 12 , 2008 , p. 4 .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Almost 4 out of 10 ( 38 % ) Republicans and Republican - leaning independents have an unfavorable opinion of their own party , while just 7 % of Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents have an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party .
Additionally , a May 29 - 31 USA Today / Gallup poll shows that the top - of - mind images of the Republican Party among Republicans are considerably more negative than are the images of the Democratic Party among Democrats .
Although it is generally well known that the Republican Party has an image problem today ( after all , the Democrats have control of the White House and both houses of Congress ) , these findings reinforce the depth of that problem by pointing out the degree to which Republicans themselves have a lower opinion of their party than Democrats do of their party , as noted above .
The only saving grace , perhaps , is the finding that Democrats are slightly more positive in their opinions of the Republican Party than is the case the other way around .
Among all Americans , the poll shows a 19 - point advantage for the Democratic Party over the Republican Party when it comes to the two parties ' respective favorable images -- a finding little changed from last November , when Gallup last updated the parties ' images .
Fifty - three percent of Americans today have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party , compared to just 34 % who have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party .
The Republican Party 's image deficit is further evidenced by the examination of responses given to open - ended questions asking Americans what comes to mind they think about the Republican Party and , separately , the Democratic Party .
( Answers were recorded verbatim and coded into categories . )
The data make it clear that Republicans are more likely to have negative images of their own party than are Democrats of their party .
Among Republicans , two of the top five categories of responses about the GOP 's image are categorized by Gallup coders as a general " unfavorable " response ( given by 19 % of Republicans ) and that the GOP has lost its direction ( 9 % ) .
None of the top five categories of responses about the image of the Democratic Party among Democrats is negative .
In fact , one of the starkest contrasts is between the percentage of Democrats whose responses are broadly " unfavorable " ( 2 % ) compared to the percentage of Republicans who say the same about their party ( 19 % ) .
Not surprisingly , both Republicans and Democrats have negative things to say about the other party .
For Republicans , the top images associated with the Democratic Party are " liberal , " " big spending , " " unfavorable , " " self - centered / out for themselves , " and ( tied ) " big government " and " socially conscious / progressive . "
For Democrats , the top images associated with the Republican party are " unfavorable , " " conservative , " " cater to the rich , " " George Bush , " and " lost their direction . "
Images of the Parties Among All Americans
For the entire U.S. population , the top four categories of images that come to mind first when Americans think about the Republican Party are :
Unfavorable
Conservative
Favorable
( Tie ) Lost their way and Caters to the rich
The top four categories of images of the Democratic Party are :
Liberal
Favorable
For the people / working , middle , lower class
Socially conscious / Progressive
Other than the generic positive and negative responses given by the partisans and opponents of each party , the data reinforce the basic images that generally are associated with the parties ; i.e. , the Republican Party as conservative and more for the rich , and the Democratic party as liberal and more for the working , middle , and lower classes .
All in all , as suggested by the partisan breakout of responses discussed above , the Republican Party has more negative images associated with it than does the Democratic Party .
The same open - ended questions were asked twice before -- in September 2001 ( just prior to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks ) and in 2005 .
Since the 2001 poll , the percentage of all Americans who say " unfavorable " when asked about the Republican Party has increased significantly , to 25 % today , from 13 % in 2001 and 11 % in 2005 .
And while 6 % say today that the Republican Party has " lost its way , " or " has no direction , " no one volunteered this response in either of the two previous surveys .
( On the other hand , the percentage who say the GOP caters to the rich and to big business is down from previous surveys . )
There have been a number of changes in the responses to the Democratic open - ended question , but many of these represent fluctuations across the surveys rather than a consistent pattern .
Still , the percentage who say the Democratic Party is " for the people " is down some since 2001 , as is the percentage whose image of the party is classified broadly as " unfavorable , " while the percentages saying " socially conscious " and " big spending " are up .
Implications
All of these data taken together underscore the challenges facing the Republican Party today .
Not only are Americans ' basic opinions of the GOP significantly more negative than are their opinions of the Democratic Party , but the top - of - mind images of the Republican Party also include more negative categories than is the case for the Democrats .
Perhaps most worrisome to the Republicans is the fact that a substantial minority of Americans who identify with or lean toward the Republican Party also have negative views of the party .
Almost 4 out of 10 Republicans say their opinions of the party are unfavorable , and a number of Republicans volunteer that the first thing that comes to mind when they think about the GOP is " unfavorable " or " lost its direction . "
Taken together with Gallup Poll evidence showing that almost half of Republicans cannot name an individual who speaks for the party , the results reinforce what Republican leaders already know -- that there are significant challenges ahead as the party gears up for the important 2010 midterm elections and the 2012 presidential election that follows .

Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,015 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted May 29 - 31 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Study : Adults with mental illness up to twice as likely to die from COVID - 19
1 hour ago ago
Sept. 30 ( UPI ) --
Older adults with mental health disorders are up to twice as likely to die from severe COVID - 19 than those without the conditions , a study published Wednesday by JAMA Network Open found .
The court announced the impending decision today in lawsuits by same - sex couples and local governments , led by San Francisco , seeking to overturn the measure that 52 percent of California voters approved in November .
If the court upholds the measure , it must also decide how the proposition affects the marriages of about 18,000 same - sex couples who wed before the Nov. 4 election .
... Plaintiffs in the California lawsuits argue that Prop. 8 made such fundamental changes to the rights guaranteed by the state Constitution that it amounted to a constitutional revision , not merely an amendment .
A revision requires approval by two - thirds of the Legislature or by delegates to a new state constitutional convention to reach the ballot .
Attorney General Jerry Brown , who ordinarily defends state laws in the courts , joined the opponents of Prop. 8 and argued that the voters lack the power to eliminate " inalienable rights . "
· Employee Health Benefits
· Family , medical and emergency leave
· Retirement and disability
· Group life insurance
· Long - term care insurance
· Death and disability benefits
· Compensation for work injuries
· Relocation , travel and related expenses
Late yesterday afternoon it was reported that California 's Supreme Court will be announcing its ruling on the challenge to Prop. 8 on Tuesday .
I 'm sure lots of people will be sitting on needles and pins between now and then -- not just here in California but everywhere with big concentrations of the bigoted Mormons who financed the hate - filled proposition that wrecked marriage equality -- not in Utah where 72 % of the population is in the LDS cult or Idaho ( 27 % ) or Nevada ( 7 % ) .
Only 2 % of Californians are Mormons .
It seems likely that the Court will not overturn the amendment -- and leave that for voters to do in the future -- but will leave the 18,000 couples who married while it was legal to remain married .
We 'll see .
On Thursday , however , a new bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) that promotes equality for all federal employees .
Twenty - two senators , all Democrats , immediately signed on as co-sponsors -- Dan Akaka ( HI ) , Barbara Boxer ( CA ) , Sherrod Brown ( OH ) , Maria Cantwell ( WA ) , Ben Cardin ( MD ) , Bob Casey ( PA ) , Chris Dodd ( CT ) , Dick Durbin ( IL ) , Russ Feingold ( WI ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( NY ) , Ted Kennedy ( MA ) , John Kerry ( MA ) , Frank Lautenberg ( NJ ) , Patrick Leahy ( VT ) , Carl Levin ( MI ) , Jeff Merkley ( OR ) , Barbara Mikulski ( MD ) , Patty Murray ( WA ) , Bernie Sanders ( VT ) , Chuck Schumer ( NY ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( RI ) , and Ron Wyden ( OR ) .
The Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations
Act would entitle all federal employees , no matter their sexual orientation , to the same employment and health care benefits as married couples .
The areas covered by the law :
In explaining his participation to his constituents , Senator Merkley pointed out that Oregon and 15 other states already have identical laws on the books and that most of the Fortune 500 companies are already offering domestic partner benefits to their employees .
“ It is plain wrong that some federal employees are not currently entitled to equal health and employment benefits , ” said Merkley .
“ This legislation will ensure that all federal employees , regardless of their sexual orientation , have access to employee health benefits , family and medical leave , compensation for work injuries , and the retirement and disability plans that are vital to the financial security of families ...
This bill is a step in the right direction to make sure that all Americans are compensated equally under the law .
It is time for the federal government to stand up for fairness and ensure that all federal employees and their loved ones are treated the same .
” If your senator is n't on the list of co-sponsors , you might want to make a call .
This is exactly the kind of bill the watch the response to .
Members who should be on the list but who are n't : Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) Roland Burris ( D - IL ) Bob Menendez ( D - NJ ) Jack Reed ( D - RI ) Jeanne Shaheen ( D - NH ) Tom Udall ( D - NM ) Susan Collins ( R- ME ) Lisa Murkowski ( R - AK ) John Tester ( D - MT ) Mark Warner ( D - VA ) Jim Webb ( D - VA ) Kay Hagan ( D - NC ) Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) Harry Reid ( D - NV ) Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) Mark Udall ( D - CO ) Mark Begich ( D - AK ) Herb Kohl ( WI ) Ted Kaufman ( DE ) Mary Landrieu ( LA ) Debbie Stabenow ( MI ) Most the the GOP is expected to follow the lead of their closet queen leader , Mitch McConnell , and oppose the bill .
It 'll be interesting to see if Lindsey Graham 's voice squeaks when he says " Nay . "

Barack Obama 's strict ban on lobbyist contributions will limit the haul from Thursday night 's fundraising dinner for congressional Democrats .

Dems dodge ban on $ $ from lobbyists
President Barack Obama ’s strict ban on lobbyist contributions will limit the haul from Thursday night ’s fundraising dinner for congressional Democrats , but organizers have found a way around it : a morning - after event at the same hotel where lobbyists — and their money — will be welcomed with open arms .
Invitations for the $ 5,000 - per-person Issues Conference do n’t say it ’s an effort to skirt Obama ’s lobbying ban , but they walk right up to the edge .

“ Please note that the Friday Issues Conference is NOT subject to lobbyist restrictions , though the event is intended for personal contributions only , ” a finance official from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wrote in an e-mail sent to lobbyists Tuesday and obtained by POLITICO , bolding the entire sentence to underscore the clarification .
“ The Issues Conference is separate from the DSCC / DCCC events with President Obama . ”
One prominent Democratic lobbyist unhappy with the situation described it vividly : “ It ’s almost like the ugly girl that you want to call late at night — but do n’t want to be seen with on a date . ”
Obama refuses to appear at fundraising events where lobbyists are allowed to contribute money , so the Democrats ca n’t collect lobbyists ’ cash at Thursday night ’s dinner .
But since the president wo n’t be at the morning - after event , congressional Democrats will be free to collect the lobbying dollars then that they could n’t take the night before .
The morning - long session – which features House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) and top committee chairmen from both chambers — may not comply with the spirit of Obama ’s lobbying ban , but some Democrats say the White House has only itself to blame .
. . . .

“ They ’re asleep at the switch , ” said a former Democratic leadership aide who glanced at the spreadsheet for the dinner and panned it as “ pathetic . ”
“ They ’re not really thinking about how these things look for other people . ”
Democrats say that Obama and his top aides have done almost nothing to promote the DSCC / DCCC dinner — the campaign committees ’ primary annual money - raiser — and that the president ’s lobbying ban has only made matters worse .
The dinner , to be held at the tony Mandarin Oriental Hotel , is expected to bring in about $ 3 million — about one - fifth of what the Republicans brought in at this month ’s joint dinner for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Democrats reject comparisons between the two fundraisers , noting that the Republicans count everything that they raised in the two months prior to the event as going toward their dinner — and that the GOP committees sell “ membership ” packages that include tickets to the event , among other perks .
Still , the Democrats are using the Republicans ’ big haul as a way to encourage contributions to their own dinner .
“ Do n’t believe what you ’ve heard about a GOP in disarray , ” DSCC Executive Director J.B. Poersch wrote in an e-mail to donors Tuesday .
“ They ’re mad , they ’re organized and they ’re determined to return to what they see as their rightful place : ruling the halls of Congress .
How do I know ?
$ 14.4 million .
That ’s how much Newt Gingrich raised during a fundraising dinner last week for Republican House and Senate committees . ”
And Democrats are suggesting privately that they ’d be raising more if the White House had played a more active role .
“ They did n’t even send out a surrogate e-mail , ” said a prominent Democrat involved with the dinner .
This source noted that Obama ’s political organization had sent out messages to its expansive e-mail list this week promoting health care reform and even the Democratic nominee in the Virginia governor ’s race , but there was nothing about what is always a closely watched event , interpreted in the political community as an indication of the party ’s strength .
The former Democratic leadership aide said Obama ’s high command needed to take a lesson from the “ Clinton model ” with regard to Cabinet officials raising cash .
“ They need to explain to these surrogates that they ’ve got a night job , too , ” said the Democrat , alluding to after - hours fundraising .
There are some signs that the word may be getting out .
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel raised money for a handful of Senate Democratic incumbents and hopefuls earlier this week in Chicago , and POLITICO has learned that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is slated to join Pelosi next week in San Francisco for an “ ultimate women ’s power lunch ” to benefit the DCCC .
Asked for comment about the griping , the White House directed an inquiry to the Democratic National Committee , which declined to address the complaints .
In the off - year especially , when fewer individuals are paying close attention to politics , lobbyist contributions are key for fundraising — and Democrats say Obama ’s no-lobbyist ban is making their work harder .
“ It ’s kind of like going to Los Angeles and then excluding the entertainment industry , ” said a senior Democrat .
“ Well , then you ’re going to have a lame event . ”
“ The whole Obama anti-lobbyist thing is having an effect on lobbyists giving personal money , ” said one well - known Democratic lobbyist , who said party officials are “ making it worse ” by then going to lengths to make clear that their money is welcome when the president is not in the room .
One official familiar with the events sought to put the best face on the situation , arguing that Obama is bringing new money to the dinner that would n’t be there otherwise — and that the K Street cash will still come through at the morning - after event .
“ We ’ll still get the lobbyist money , ” said this official .
With this morning ’s news that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been re-elected , there ’s no time like now to turn our attention to Iran .
Ryan Van Lenning reports .

There are a lot of words Westerners associate with Iran , but citizen diplomacy is probably not among them .
Your typical news report on anything dealing with Iran might mention nuclear ambitions , sanctions , or Ahmadinejad ’s latest display of rhetoric .
But these phrases have little connection to the experiences of Rebecca Griffin , who recently returned from Iran , where she carried messages of peace from American citizens .
Griffin is political director of Peace Action West , and I sat down with her to hear about her experiences first hand .
Griffin with an Iranian woman who asked , “ Were n’t you scared to come here because of the media ? ”
In a climate where 35 % of Americans named Iran as the number one threat to America , citizen diplomacy might be far from many people ’s minds .
Rebecca Griffin thinks that just means pundits and fear - mongering media are doing their job well .
She believes that is even more reason to engage in diplomacy .
Griffin ’s organization , Peace Action West , recently launched a campaign called Citizen Diplomat , which put out an appeal :
“ Politicians and pundits in both the United States and Iran build support for an approach to the world based on force and aggression by dehumanizing the ‘ enemy ’ and exploiting people ’s worst fears .
But regular people like you and me can take their power away by putting a human face on the US and Iran and showing that ordinary people in both countries support each other and want to build a strong , respectful and peaceful relationship .
By demonstrating that Americans and Iranians are more alike than we are different .
Share your personal hopes for peace with Iran in a recorded message , and I will make sure Iranians see them .
It is much harder to advocate for sanctions when you know a child who will go hungry , or bombings when you know families who could be killed .
Thank you for sharing your positive hopes and vision for friendship with Iran . ”
That appeal went viral online and Americans from all parts of the country sent in written statements and recorded audio and video of themselves addressing Iranians with messages of peace and good will .
” The responses were very positive and encouraging on all sides , ” Griffin said .
Griffin gave CDs of the various messages to people and groups she met in Iran .
She found Iranians she met to be very welcoming .
For some , she was the first American they had ever met in person .
Griffin interviews Ashkan using a Flip camera .
Griffin said she was motivated because “ there is a new window of opportunity ” and a new mood in the country .
Add to that new media technologies that make it easier to communicate globally .
Her goals were to show Iranians that the average American wants peace , to show both Americans and Iranians another side of each other , and to mobilize citizens to pressure politicians to back away from confrontation and engage in diplomacy .
While in Iran , Rebecca met with American Studies students at Tehran University and with members of a group called Miles for Peace , a group of Iranian citizens who bicycled through Europe carrying their own brand of citizen diplomacy .
Griffin with members of Miles for Peace
They traveled for 70 days through 18 cities and met with European mayors and citizens .
Griffin noted that both she and members of Miles For Peace found it uplifting that ordinary citizens of both nations were educating and advocating for peace and mutual respect .
I asked her about President Obama , who just returned from his own tour of the region .
“ Obama ’s speech is significant , ” Griffin says , “ especially when [ compared ] with any previous administration . ”
Obama highlighted diplomacy without preconditions and a new path forward , as well as Iran ’s right to peaceful nuclear energy , while warning about a nuclear arms race in the region .
Griffin said that it is a step in the right direction with regard to healing relationships with Muslim countries .
“ But , ” she continues , “ the people of the region want to see action , not only talk .
They are waiting to see . ”
There is a lot of mistrust between the two nations .
Iranians remember our activities in the region , as Griffin was continuously reminded .
For example , while many Americans are probably unaware of the CIA ’s ( and the British ) role in the 1953 coup that overthrew elected Prime Minister Mosaddeq , this information is part of standard history lessons for Iranians .
School girls in Iran .
Iranians also remember the United States ’ role in the Iran - Iraq war , a bloody 8 - year conflict that injured over a million people and is not far from the minds of even young people , who were just children at the time .
The United States played each country off one another , but heavily aided Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein , giving him the green light to attack over Iran ’s border .
The United States not only gave billions of dollars in aid , but also intelligence , weapons , chemicals , technology , agricultural credits , and special forces training .
“ All of this still feels very present to them , ” Griffin told me .
She also told me a story of a taxi- cab driver who told her group he wants peaceful relations with the United States , and even wants different political leadership .
But he added that he would pick up a gun to defend his country , who he called “ mother , ” if threatened or attacked by the United States .
Griffin said this belies the claim that if we just pressure Iran enough through sanctions , its citizens will turn against its government .
The United States has often used the strategy of sanctions as punishment against countries , from Cuba to Iraq , in an attempt to make conditions worse for both the government and the people until — so the theory goes — the people will rise up to force a change of regime or change of behavior on the part of its political leaders .
“ Regular people like you and me can … put a human face on the US and Iran and show that ordinary people in both countries support each other and want to build a strong , respectful and peaceful relationship . ”
The path to trust and a healthier relationship between the United States and Iran is an uphill one .
There are many obstacles to normalizing relations with Iran .
Alongside Ahmadinejad ’s and Supreme Leader Khameini ’s provocative statements and the fact that U.S. bases , troops , and naval warships are surrounding Iran , Congress is sending the wrong message , sometimes at odds with Obama’s .
At the same time , Obama is making diplomatic gestures and trying to change the tone , Congress is talking about harsher sanctions and drafting bills to punish companies that sell to Iran , actions Griffin sees as counter - productive .
Peace Action
West and its members are pressuring their representatives to support diplomacy and take advantage of an opportunity to move away from confrontation .
When I asked her how she responds to those who would say she should leave diplomacy to the diplomats , Griffin says , “ Of course there has to be high - level diplomacy .
But speaking as citizens is a lot less loaded of an interaction .
When you speak person - to - person , ” she notes , “ you realize how similar you are . ”
It may not be the solution , but it is part of the solution .
Whatever Obama ’s administration does with regard to Iran , Griffin stressed the need to get past the one - sided narrow version of each other that each country has , mostly gained through the mainstream media and the government .
Especially in the age of blogging , alternative media , and global travel , Griffin counsels citizens of both nations to “ learn more about each other and to facilitate communication . ”
If only the pundits and politicians would get out of the way .

Solubility Testing
Introduction :
Most people think that Peeps are primarily sugar .
We all know that sugar dissolves in water .
This means that Peeps should dissolve in water , right ??
Wrong !
To the left you may witness the paradigm - shattering discovery which led to the following battery of tests .
As you can see , this Peep is floating quite comfortably in a beaker of water .
In fact , we have seen Peeps float for hours on end with no noticeable difficulty .
Of course , floating in room temperature water is one thing , and floating in hot water is another .
Following our room temperature tests , we tried heating up the water to see if that would increase Peep solubility .
( Note , hot water looks just like cold water .
Please look again at the image above and pretend that if you were to touch the beaker you would burn yourself .
Thanks . )
Alas , Peeps are as resistant to hot water as they are cold .
Disappointed that we were unable to dissolve Peeps in pure water , we knew we'd have to explore this topic further .
Materials & Methods :
We assembled four Peeps , four 600 mL beakers , and four solutions .
The solutions are ( as seen below from left to right ) : water , acetone , sulfuric acid , and sodium hydroxide .
One Peep subject was gently plunked into each solution and we recorded our observations over the next hour .
For details on the chemical properties of each solution and a close - up photo of the results of each of these tests , please click on the solution of choice below :
[ Water ] [ Acetone ] [ Sulfuric Acid ] [ Sodium Hydroxide ]
Results Summary :
Essentially , we found that Peeps are not soluble in water ( a polar liquid ) , acetone ( a non-polar liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( a strong acid ) , or sodium hydroxide ( a strong base ) .
In fact , with the exception of the acetone turning purple as some of the sugar did dissolve off the surface of the Peep , there was no noticeable reaction of any kind .
For specific descriptions of the solutions tested and their effects , click on the links above .
Preliminary Conclusion :
Lesser scientists may have been discouraged by such an apparent failure , however we looked at this as a challenge .
Perhaps Peeps have a protective outer coating which is resistant to all the above solutions .
To evaluate this theory , known as the Natural Outer Resistance Against Dissolving ( NORAD ) defense system , follow - up experiment one was carried out .
Follow - up Experiment Number One :
To test NORAD , we needed some way to get our solutions past the potential defense system .
A 30 cc syringe seemed a natural choice .
We were running low on test subjects at this point , so we decided to test only the solution with which we expected the greatest reaction .
Sulfuric acid was chosen as the test condition .
At this point , I should admit that we really did n't expect that the Peep would dissolve in the sulfuric acid , but we were hoping that the acid would react with some of the sugar in the Peep causing rapid oxidation and turning the Peep into a large mass of blackened goo .
Alas , we were disappointed as the subcutaneous injection produced no greater reaction than immersion in the acid .
It seems that the NORAD defense hypothesis had been refuted .
Soon the NORAD hypothesis was rejected , and the " Nastier Solvent " approach was adopted .
Follow - up experiment number two describes our progress .
Follow - up Experiment Two : Nastier Solvent
If Peeps are n't composed of sugar , what are they ?
Protein ( gelatin ) seemed the only other choice .
Phenol seemed , then , to be our best choice of solvent ( phenol is used in labs specifically to dissolve proteins ) .
To give you an idea for how icky this stuff really is , here is what the Merck index says about Phenol :
Ingestion of even small amounts may cause nausea , vomiting , circulatory collapse , tachypnea , paralysis , convulsions , coma , greenish or smoky - colored urine , necrosis of mouth and G.I. tract , icterus , death from respiratory failure , sometimes from cardiac arrest .
Average fatal dose is 15g , but death from as little as one gram has been reported .
Fatal poisoning may also occur by skin absorption ...
Results :
The results are best illustrated by the following series of photos .
Time = 0
The Peep was prepared for immersion in approximately 100 mL of Phenol .
Time = 5 Min A change was evident almost immediately , as the Peep appeared to absorb the Phenol ( note the dark area near the base of the Peep ) .
Time = 35 Min
Our persistence was rewarded as we noticed the outer portions of the Peep dissolving away .
Time = 50 Min Very little of our subject remained at this point .
The general Peepish shape is still visible to the left .
Time = 65 Min Quite unexpected ( and disturbing ) results became evident after a little more than one hour of solubility testing .
As can be seen to the right , although the Peep body was dissolved by phenol , the eyes were not .
In fact , Peep eyes were insoluble in all the solutions which were tested .
Conclusion :
Given enough time , the proper resources , and access to some really toxic stuff , one can probably dissolve just about anything except Peep eyes .

Nintendo announced not one , but two new Mario games and the return of Metroid and still came a distant third in the battle of the big three 's keynotes at this year 's wonderful E3 .
The entire exhibition has been in a self - imposed doldrum for a couple of years , but E3 2009 has been a fabulous return to form , with both Sony and Microsoft raising the roof , and the game , with their blockbusting turns on the stage .
Nintendo's conference was actually fine ; the New Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Galaxy 2 alone made it a great event for the fans , and yet the company was blown out of the water by its next gen rivals .
Beatles and PSP Go
First up Microsoft , opening with the two living Beatles giving their backing to Beatles Rock Band and closed with Project Natal – a motion capture , voice recognition sensor that could revolutionise gaming by doing away with the controller altogether .
And although Sony 's snippy commentary through its own Motion Control demo seemed a little churlish , it did the right thing by focusing more on its gaming line - up , and keeping gamers across the globe glued to live streams and the live audience in the palm of its hand .
Nintendo showed off Wii Motion Plus – but unfortunately it had shown it off a year ago , Microsoft and Sony both managed to bring key hardware announcements to the table .
Not content with Natal and a ball and stick ( or Sony motion controller prototype to give it its full title ) , Sony and Microsoft had more – Sony's PSP
Go may have been leaked beforehand , but it certainly looked good with Gran Turismo running on it , and if Microsoft can get 1080 p VOD streaming then it could be a massive boon for a console that is quickly becoming more than a gaming machine .
Mario X2
Nintendo brought Mario and more Mario , topped off with a little Metroid for good measure and there is not a true gaming fan in the world who wo n't have been delighted to see Super Mario Bros re-energised .
And yet , with Sony showing off Assassin 's Creed 2 , Gran Turismo 5 and Uncharted 2 and their stunning visuals and the Xbox providing a new Halo , Left4 Dead 2 and Forza 3 it is becoming clear that however powerful Nintendo 's franchises , its rivals are beginning to gain some traction with their own .
Let 's put this in perspective , Mario will always reign supreme – but Nintendo has been back to that particular well many , many times now and judging by the disappointing sales of Super Mario Galaxy , fondness is not translating to market share in quite the same way now that the Wii is about lifestyle more than core gamers .
Nintendo tried hard to insist that those core gamers could play alongside its new family market , but in constantly repeating that message it perhaps missed out on a great opportunity to bring the WOW that its rivals managed .
There will be much talk about Sony and Microsoft 's keynotes – and which was better , I do n't think many people will be arguing that Nintendo's had the same impact .

I have n't posted for a while in the Ubuntu Newbie Guide but I just did n't know what else to post so if you have a suggestion , please let me know .
In today 's Ubuntu Newbie Guide part I 'm going to tell you about running the Metacity Compositing Manager instead of Compiz Fusion .
Why you would want to do that ?
Because it uses less resources and it may run better for old or incompatible video cards ( including Intel ) .
You do n’t even need accelerated graphics to run Metacity with compositing and it even works well inside VirtualBox .
This will be enough for running applications that require a compositing manager , such as Avant Window Navigator ( for which I posted installation instructions a while ago ) , Screenlets and probably the new Cairo Dock v2 too ( although I only tested Metacity Compositing Manager with Avant Window Navigator ) .
In addition , you get shadows , max / minimize animations , and shaded Alt - Tab effects .
First if you ’re already using Compiz desktop effects , you ’ll need to turn them off to switch to Metacity .

DALLAS  Mavericks president Donnie Nelson loved the convenience of having an NBA Development League team in Fort Worth .
In less than an hour , he could get from his desk to watching his team 's top prospects in action while also scouting other up - and - comers .
The privilege lasted only two seasons , though , ending in 2007 .
Nelson has been looking to bring the D - League closer to home ever since -- and , boy , did he succeed .
The reigning NBDL champion Colorado 14ers are moving to an arena in the north Dallas suburb of Frisco , about a half - hour drive from Mavericks headquarters and only a few minutes from Nelson 's house .
Nelson wo n't only be a neighbor .
He 's also the principal owner and operator of the club .
" I drive past it every day , so it 's a natural fit , " Nelson said Thursday .
" It 'll make our jobs a little bit easier . "
The only catch is the club will skip the upcoming season , then debut in 2010 - 11 .
It is well worth the wait for Nelson , who actually has been trying to get a D - League team in the area for about five years , before Fort Worth even had it 's ill - fated franchise .
" When Fort Worth left , it ripped something out of my heart , " Nelson said .
" It was a terrific asset for the Mavericks . "
The 14ers were affiliated with the Denver Nuggets and New Jersey Nets .
The D - League will remain at 16 teams this upcoming season because of an expansion into Portland , Maine .
The Mavs ' affiliate is currently in Albuquerque .
Technically , they must wait until next summer to be connected to the Frisco club , but it should be a slam - dunk decision .
Frisco is a booming area connected to downtown Dallas by a toll road that ends practically in front of the Mavericks ' arena .
The suburb 's population already has cracked 100,000 and is still growing rapidly .
Sports are part of that growth , with Frisco already home to FC Dallas of MLS ; the Frisco RoughRiders of the Texas League ( they are the Texas Rangers ' Class AA affiliate ) ; and the headquarters and practice facility for the NHL's Dallas Stars .
The D - League team will play in a newly renovated arena next to the Stars ' facility .
The team will carry the name Texas , instead of Frisco .
The nickname will be selected through a contest , the first of many ways the team plans to become part of its new community .
Nelson thanked Mavericks owner Mark Cuban for allowing him to pursue this opportunity .
His main partner is Evan Wyly , the chairman of Green Mountain Energy , with Colorado 14ers owner Tim Wiens keeping a minority stake .
D- League commissioner Dan Reed said he was willing to give the Dallas area another chance despite the Fort Worth fiasco because of the combination of Nelson 's ownership group , their practically new arena and the demographics of Frisco .
" We really think we have the right recipe for success , " Reed said .

What happened to Jim Cramer ?
CNBC 's Mad Money host screams stock - market tips with alpha male abandon , but he looked like he was going to wet himself in his Daily Show grudge match tonight .
Having been slammed repeatedly by host Jon Stewart over the past few days for one - sided journalism , Cramer fled any real direct confrontation in his lengthy interview and instead went contrite — absurdly contrite .
His voice went high and cracked , his thoughts fragmented as they left his mouth .
In the process , he did n't do anything to help CNBC 's image , battered on Stewart 's show in recent days .
On the other hand , he did n't do much to hurt it , either ; with Cramer seemingly apologizing for everything CNBC has ever aired , Stewart could n't uppercut CNBC the way he did CNN and its Crossfire co-host Tucker Carlson a few years ago .
He was left to deliver ( still very good ! ) packaged lines and videos and counter whatever coherent arguments he could distill from Cramer 's sputtering .
( One of the more dramatic interview moments is excerpted in the clip above . )
Stewart is , perhaps , handicapped in studio Daily Show interviews by his own good manners :
He 's always seemed reluctant to truly torpedo his own guests the way , say , Fox News shouting head Bill O'Reilly does .
He was able to truly nail Carlson only when he himself was the guest , on Carlson 's Crossfire .
It would be interesting to watch the full interview , which was edited down for the show , to see if Cramer sharpened his argument ( he looked much more relaxed and sounded much more coherent at the close of the segment than at the start ) .
The Daily Show told viewers to look for the full clip on its website , but it has yet to be posted .
We 'll embed it below when it becomes available .
UPDATE 1 : Better than the Cramer interview was the Daily Show 's meta-opening mocking the hype surrounding the CNBC - Daily Show feud :

June 18 , 2009 Admin
Happy to hand the megaphone today to Guest Agitator Janice Christensen , for her thoughts on the powerful mobilizing — and through that , fundraising — role of Twitter .
Janice is the former Director of Campaigns of Amnesty International USA , a board member of the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition ( TASSC ) and a principal in DonorTrends .
Here ’s Janice :
Not Just for Revolutions Anymore
" Having watched with interest the recent debate and discussion on the value and usefulness of Twitter by Agitator readers , I find events of the past two days in Iran as proof enough to silence doubters .
Organizers and activists have known for years what communication means to the success of any strategy .
For the past two days in Iran , opposition organizers have used Twitter to deliver rapid information about strategy , tactics and police whereabouts to thousands of protestors and supporters .
So much so that the White House asked Twitter not to take down their site for maintenance Tuesday night .
Twittervision allowed users to follow San Francisco protestors during the Olympic torch relay in April last year .
Protestors were outwitting police with Twitter , text and online mapping tools moving their supporters quickly and efficiently to the ever - changing torch route .
And even in the world ’s most closed society , the Burmese government was unable to shut down communication to the outside world when monks engaged in the largest protest in Burma for over two decades in 2008 .
In a recent Agitator survey 34 % of Agitator readers stated that Twitter would only have marginal use for donors and activists .
I wonder if that number would change if fundraisers could envision using these tools to literally show donors the movement behind the organization in action – as it is happening ?
In my experience , there is often a disconnect between the ‘ program ’ and ‘ fundraising ’ departments .
Even if a donor is not inclined to march in the streets , there must be great value to offering them the ability to follow along and watch while it happens .
If over 1,000,000 people Twitter to find out what Ashton Kutcher and Ellen DeGeneres are having for lunch , why not give donors the ability to follow your organization ’s workers in the field , protestors on the street or advocates lobbying on the Hill ? "
Thanks for that , Janice … especially for drawing the connection between using this medium to truly bring supporters inside an organization and the potential fundraising reward from that more intimate engagement .
Here from the TED conference and here from New Zealand are two other commentaries on the potency of Twitter .
Tom
So these reporters decided to go to CNN , or MSNBC , NBC .
ABC , CBS , etc. and pass on all this information to them so they could expose Monsanto , and , I am sure , to discredit FOX ?
The video does n't mention such efforts .
So instead we watch a youtube video ?
It 's a hit piece directed at FOX .
Do n't take this the wrong way , I am in no way suggesting that FOX is innocent of being controlled by government or advertisers .
But I am suggesting they are just another brick in the wall that the mainstream media has built to try to keep us uniformed .
Meanwhile , I have known about these hormones for years and the dangers associated with them .
This is n't news .
It 's common knowledge for those that pay any bit of attention to what is going on around them .
On a personal level , I wrote an OPINION piece for the local newspaper concerning what was quite obviously an act of extortion by the local police department .
Even my 8 year old granddaughter said , about the police actions , " that is n't right . "
But I was told I had to make changes to the piece for it to be published , due to " insurance " reasons for the newspaper .
I refused , but guess what ?
The piece was altered and printed .
Nothing I could do about that , because once I submitted the piece it was " owned " by the newspaper and they could do with it as they saw fit .
And a rebuttal letter to the editor written by me was not printed .
So much for freedom of the press .
Slumdog child star ’s home demolished
The home of the Slumdog Millionaire child star was demolished by Mumbai authorities on Thursday , May 15 , as part of the demolition of shanties in a Mumbai slum .
Azharuddin Mohammad Ismail , one of the film ’s main character , was asleep when a police officer woke him up and smacked him with a bamboo stick .
His co-star , Rubina Ali , was also one of the residents who lost their homes .
“ We are homeless , we have nowhere to go , ” Azharuddin said .
The Ismail family claimed that they were not informed about the planned demolition .
Uma Shankar Mistry , an official of Bombay Municipal Corporation , said that this was part of a pre-monsoon demolition drive and only illegally owned shanties were bulldozed .
A local housing authority promised a government - built housing for the residents who have lived in the shanty town for more than 15 years .
Shameem Ismail , Azharuddin ’s mother , told the BBC news ,
“ Our house has been broken down by officials .
We have not been given any alternate accommodation .
Earlier the authorities had said they would give us a house .
But I do n’t think that will happen any more , ”
The Slumdog Millionaire ’s film makers have donated to a charity to help slum kids in Mumbai .
They ’ve also set up a trust , Jai Ho , to ensure the children get proper homes and a good education .

The Celtic Tiger 's confidence has taken a battering from the recession - and the crisis might draw the Republic of Ireland closer to the EU again , the BBC's Jonny Dymond reports .
JONNY DYMOND
I 'm Jonny Dymond and I 've said goodbye to the BBC Brussels bureau for the next few weeks .
I 'll be taking the temperature in nine EU member states before the European Parliament elections on 4 - 7 June .
I 'm going to ask voters what they think of the EU and what their priorities are .
Join me on the trip !

Your comments
There is something about Ireland today that makes you want to weep .
Just 12 months ago this was still a country in great shape .
It had over the preceding decade escaped from the shadow of Britain .
It had reversed centuries of emigration , each departure an indictment of a failing economy .
It had become a successful , self - confident country , sucking in investment and labour , sending out its best , not as economic refugees but as advertisements for a vibrant modern country that had - shock , horror - outpaced its neighbour and one - time master .
It had even delighted in derailing the EU 's best - laid plans , rejecting the Lisbon Treaty by a healthy margin on a decent turnout .
Now , as they did almost a year ago in that treaty referendum , placards battle for voters ' attention on lampposts across the land .
Walter Cullen sees the Waterford Crystal tradition disappearing
But the economic bubble has burst with a vengeance ; construction is at a standstill , house prices have slumped , unemployment is at 11.4 % and rising very fast and once again citizens are looking abroad for work .
So if anyone is looking for any debate about anything other than the economy as European elections draw near , look elsewhere .
And the debate - such as it is - about the relationship with Europe is completely overshadowed by anguished discussion of the Lisbon Treaty .
Shattered crystal Rachel , 37 , a Dubliner strolling the streets of the south - eastern city of Waterford on a sunny evening , summed up much of the national mood .
" I voted ' No ' in the last referendum on the treaty , " she says , " because I wanted to give [ the governing party ]
Fianna Fail a kick in the arse , and no - one explained it to me .
" But the world has fallen apart since then and I want to live in Ireland , not Iceland . "
Two of three elderly ladies out for a walk voted " No " last time .
In the next referendum , widely expected to come in October , they 'll vote " Yes " .
" The way things are , we have to , " one says .
To see " the way things are " drive five minutes out of town .
What was once a factory producing world - famous Waterford Crystal stands silent .
Brave Jonnie 's owner has changed his mind about the EU treaty The visitors ' centre , which used to draw more than a quarter of a million tourists a year to the town , now has a pathetic trickle going in and out , a good number of them wondering what happened to the factory tour they were promised .
Walter Cullen worked in the factory until the mid-1980s , before becoming a trade union official .
Like many on the left , he opposes the Lisbon Treaty - a complex document aimed at streamlining EU institutions .
But Walter can see which way the wind is blowing .
" I think that the next referendum will be about frightening people into voting for the treaty , because [ they 'll be told ] if they do n't vote for the treaty things will get worse for Ireland . "
Walter stresses that he is still opposed to the treaty .
But when pushed , he accepts that the economic weather has turned hard against him .
Brave Jonnie
The truth is that the government probably wo n't have to break sweat to " frighten " people into voting for the treaty .
The crashing economy has already put the fear of God into them .
In a bid to escape the gloom I drove to Clonmel races , north of Waterford .
I went in search of my namesake Brave Jonnie , running in the 1845 .
His owner , farmer Damian Cassidy , voted " No " last time .
Next time will be different .
" We were n't prepared for [ the treaty ] , and that 's why I went for a ' No ' .
This time I 'm told that if I do n't vote ' Yes ' Ireland will be left behind .
So I 'm changing my vote so that I will vote ' Yes ' . "
In June last year , just as the Irish government was preparing to announce the conditions under which it would put the treaty again to the people , I asked a government official why he thought they could get a " Yes " second time around .
Clonmel races : Rain clouds match the gloomy economic conditions " Because , " he said , with cool cynicism , " by then we will have revealed the treaty 's opponents for the crackpots that they are and the recession will have terrified everyone into voting ' Yes ' . "
And so every jump in unemployment , every step backwards the Irish economy takes , must gladden the hearts of those who would drive the treaty through .
It 's this strange take on democracy that makes you want to weep .
I put 10 euros on Brave Jonnie .
The trainer assured me he was a winner .
He trailed in fifth , under heavy clouds that swiftly turned to rain .
I always make lousy bets - which is which why I normally avoid the bookies .
But I 'd put very good money on a " Yes " to the treaty , come the next referendum .
In search of Europe : France 4 May - France 8 May - Ireland 12 May - UK 16 May - Sweden 21 May - Latvia 25 May - Poland 29 May - Austria 2 June - Italy 5 June - Germany
Click to return Jonny 's response to your comments :
First to the much commented - upon Mark in the Netherlands yes , Ireland got a lot , and as I whizzed around the place on lovely smooth roads I pondered back to the time in the 1980s when much of the road network seemed to be a spray of gravel and a prayer .
But give the Irish some credit ; the workforce was and is young , well - educated , motivated and English - speaking .
The country is well - located to bridge the US and the EU ; the tax regime has lured in multinationals ; and the centuries - old links with the diaspora worked wonders .
Dan in Dublin ( and many others around Europe ) criticises the Irish government for sending the Lisbon Treaty back for another go , which it is expected to do in October .
I know this looks pretty shameful .
But I was in Ireland at the time of the first referendum ; there was a lot of talk then , from both " No " organisers and " No " voters about sending the treaty back to Brussels and trying to get a better deal .
And the Nice Treaty ( which also had two referendums in Ireland , and which was twitched second time around to accommodate Irish concerns ) was specifically cited by some .
Now everyone will have their own opinions about the deal that Ireland gets , expected to be sorted out a summit in June or July in Brussels .
But it seems a bit much to lay into the Irish government or the Eurocrats for asking the Irish people to think again on the treaty , when a fair number of people wanted a better treaty when they walked in and out of the polling booths .
Finally , Nick in Chester : it 's really interesting what you say about the Celtic Tiger hunting for survival by itself , because a number people in Ireland mentioned exactly this to me - that things were not going to be so sweet for Ireland over the next few years as funding switched to the new central and eastern members .
In fact , one or two suggested that Ireland , now it 's taken the money , should flee the EU
It was very much a minority opinion , but the Tiger clearly has teeth !
Thanks for your time and thoughts .
Next stop , the UK .
Here are some of your responses to Jonny 's feature :
The last time Europe faced problems like this we ended up fighting the most destructive war ever , which some countries are still paying for .
I think it 's time to put down our meaningless national pride and give each other a big fat hug , and vote yes .
That goes for the UK joining the Euro as well .
A Hewitt , Dover England Ireland 's banks did not engage in risky , sub - prime mortgages like those in the US .
They engaged in reckless commercial lending to property developers .
Both are two sides of the same coin .
Unfortunately for Ireland , they are not the magnet for talent and investment that the US is .
Many non-Irish ( myself included ) have already left or are leaving shortly , as are thousands of Irish of all skill levels and ages who do not see a future here .
While it is true the economic slowdown is not Ireland 's doing , its myopic government have brought it to the brink of collapse .
Instead , had government finances been kept in check and the banking sector even moderately regulated , Ireland would instead be poised to capitalize on the eventual economic recovery ( like , say , Canada is ) instead of barely staying afloat .
Brendan , Dublin , Ireland To Mark , Netherlands .
Ireland 's interpretation of the role Europe has played in the complete turnaround of a country that , 25 years ago , looked like the Netherlands of 100 years ago , may indeed be clouded to say the least .
They have had opportunity and huge investment and , in part , have turned the corner , with almost a half - decent road infrastructure and some production outlets other than agriculture .
Let us now see proportional European funding being redirected to our Eastern neighbours after years of them being left out in the cold .
Ireland has had the lion 's share for long enough .
Let 's see the Celtic Tiger hunt for its own survival .
Nick , Chester Amazed your trip takes you direct from Poland to Austria .
You miss 2 great opportunities ... a. 1 hour from Vienna , Bratislava in Slovakia - they adopted the Euro on January 1st , and are bursting with pride at the progress they 're making .
b. 2 hours from Vienna , Budapest in Hungary - wondering where it all went wrong , and when they 'll need a helping hand from the IMF ( again ) .
You 'd learn a lot more about the state , the future , of the EU from a comparison of these two countries than you ever will by visiting Austria ( with apologies to Austria ! ) .
Alan , Budapest , Hungary Although I voted yes in the last referendum , I will not be voting in the next one even if it means it does n't pass .
The Irish people were asked in the last referendum to decide and we made our choice - FULL STOP !!
All I can say is thank you to Éamon de Valera and those who wrote the Bunreacht na hÉireann ( Irish Constitution ) , who foresaw the potential abuse of democracy from our elected officials ( ignoring the French referendum for example ) that we have witnessed in Europe in the past 5 years .
If it was n't for this our politicians would be signing treaties that effectively change our countries ' ability to pass laws and operate as a whole without the consent of the people .
Dan , Dublin Ireland has always been very positive about being a member of the EU and has been particularly pro-Euro too .
The boom and the current recession have very little to do with the previous rejection and future expected acceptance of the Lisbon Treaty .
Just because the Irish voted no to the Treaty before does n't mean it was an anti-EU message .
The reason why it was rejected is that it was too vague a Treaty and was n't fully understood .
Why vote yes to something when it has n't been explained properly and has been written in opaque language so as to make it indecipherable ?
Although I voted ' yes ' myself , I can understand why many did n't .
The current recession is not just a reflection of the general worldwide downturn , but also a result of an inept government who have n't planned for things well and who have simply taken their eye off the ball .
When Ireland votes ' yes ' next time to Lisbon , it will make very little difference to Ireland 's economic state and will just mostly serve to pander to the egos of the eurocrats in Brussels .
Conor , Dublin I think it was sad that the Irish voted ' No ' last time as it would have made things a lot better .
A sad fact is that the recession is probably the best thing to happen to Ireland , as the country and its citizens were living in a bubble for the past 10 years .
The cost of living went up for no proper reason and there was too much speculation .
People were actually happier in the early 1990s before the boom .
Mark , Venice , Italy I have to reply to Mark from the Netherlands .
Fair enough we did get a lot of EU grants , but they did n't cause the boom .
We joined the EU in 1973 and our Celtic Tiger boom started 20 years later , mainly due to attracting American companies with incentives such as low corporation tax .
I am sick of some of our EU partners claiming their handouts caused our boom .
Listen , it worked both ways , Ireland has 25 % of the EU 's ocean shelf , and thus 25 % of its fish stock , yet we are only allowed 3 % of the entire EU quota , which means we have a right to only 1/8 of fish in our waters .
Where is the other 88 % going ?
That 's right - to our neighbours in Britain , France and especially Spain , whose trawlers have plundered our waters for the last 30 years .
Why do you think Norway wo n't join the EU ?
Because they fear the same thing with their fish stock .
Shell to Sea , Dublin .
Paul , Dublin I feel very sorry for Ireland at the moment .
It is a shame that the pro-Lisbon elite seem to be intentionally capitalising on the country 's economic woes to suit their own anti-democratic agenda .
I can't believe people do n't seem to notice the audacity of putting it to a vote a second time , surely once was enough , the EU seem to love using this patronisingly coercive technique on the Irish .
Remember Nice ?
All I can say is I hope the Irish show their characteristic resilience in the face of hardships and say no to Lisbon again .
Adam , Leeds , Great Britain
It is a myth that Ireland was ever distanced from the EU .
Surveys have consistently shown high support for the EU among Irish people .
It was the Lisbon Treaty that was rejected , not the EU .
Part of the unpopularity of the Lisbon Treaty was the perception that all the governments had carefully bypassed the democratic will of their populations by refusing to allow referenda on the issue .
The Irish government was constitutionally obliged to put the Treaty to a referendum .
Therefore , in 100 % of the countries where the Lisbon Treaty was voted on in direct democracy , it was rejected .
I have little doubt that it would have been rejected in other EU countries too , had the people been given that option .
But none of this implies a dislike of the EU itself , only the Lisbon Treaty .
Shane , Mayo , Ireland Ireland has been affected by the global recession and additionally by a badly managed home housing market .
America lead the way with poor sub - prime and financial mistakes ; so I do n't feel particularly guilty .
We have a smart workforce and still lead the world in technology , alongside Silicon Valley and Bangalore .
The Celtic tigers is far from dead .
It is merely distracted .
Fergal Breen , IFSC , Dublin , Ireland I too weep for the death of democracy Jonny .
Even though polls have shown that the Germans , Austrians and Brits would vote NO , and the Dutch and French already have in essence .... the Treaty is to be rammed down Europeans throats regardless .
The un-elected commission will then crow it was done with due `democratic process ´.. and they have the audacity to encourage us to vote in June !
Johanes , Berlin , Germany
It 's a shame a recession had to happen to wake up the Irish voters but it seems like a little bit of payback .
The great Irish economic boom grew from the roots of EU grants , structure and investments .
Once they were all rich and prosperous they then turned and bit the hand that had fed them just when the EU needed to introduce badly needed reforms that would help intergrate other countries and give them the same chance to blossom as Ireland .
Mark , Netherlands
Worry not brave Irish people , whether you vote yes or no to the Lisbon treaty wo n't make any difference to Ireland 's economical woes .
The EU and in particular the Eurozone is in a very bad shape too .
The so - called EU constitution can't help that .
I even wonder if it can help anything .
I also voted NO in the French referendum but the new president Sarkozy passed it by force through Parliament , disregarding the democratic vote .

The next time you fly British Airways , I would n't expect service with a smile .
The member of the cabin crew pouring your drink may have just been asked to work for free and forgo his or her benefits .
For last week , BA emerged as the latest company to try and weather the economic downturn by inviting staff to accept wage cuts .
BA , its staff now say , stands for " Bugger All " .
But the airline is not alone .
According to campaigners from Keep Britain Working , almost half the workforce has had a pay cut , a reduction in working hours or worked for fewer benefits .
It is tough out there .
BA says it is only inviting its 40,000 staff to consider working for no pay for up to a month .
CEO Willie
Walsh is trying to lead by example , voluntarily surrendering his salary for July of £ 61,000 .
Meanwhile , the airline pilots ' union , Balpa , has negotiated a 3 % salary cut for 3,200 BA pilots for 2009 and a wage freeze for 2010 .
General secretary Jim McAuslan declares that the company is not bluffing when it says its very survival is at stake - half of BA 's revenue comes from the 14 % of its business class passengers who have almost disappeared .
The airline 's cash is haemorrhaging .
Faced with the choice of no job or a job with a small wage cut , most workers will reluctantly go along with the latter .
They have less industrial muscle and are readier to accept the laws of supply and demand .
Lady
Thatcher 's strictures about not being able to buck the market have entered the nation 's soul .
It is also rational for employers .
Laying people off is expensive and demoralising for the survivors and when the business improves , it is doubly expensive to replace those who have gone .
Newcomers have to be recruited , screened , inducted and trained ; it can take years before they are as useful as the workers just laid off .
BT , innovatively seeking to lease out some of its workforce to other companies in order to share up to half the wage cost , is thus husbanding good workers for the upturn and saving on redundancy .
It all makes perfect sense - as long as it can be pulled off .
Economists have long argued for this flexibility in pay over the economic cycle - remuneration going down when times are hard and going up when times are good .
Pay takes the strain rather than jobs .
The difficulty has been persuading workers to accept that cuts in their pay are fair .
Willie Walsh knows his only chance of getting voluntary pay holidays is if he leads by example ; he hopes to persuade his entire board to follow suit .
The pain must be spread fairly , even if it is obvious that a month 's pay holiday for Walsh is far easier for him than for cabin crew on £ 30,000 a year .
Professor Daniel Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Prize for economics for explaining why fairness counts for workers .
We all use the past as a benchmark to what is reasonable , carrying an idea of a reference wage to which we compare our actual wage .
If an employer tries to lower the wage below the reference wage , we think it unfair and resist .
But a new company offering the lower wage would not be considered unfair ; there is no reference wage established by custom and practice for comparison .
The only chance of winning acceptance is if the company can show that what it is doing is fair .
That its own profits are diving below its reference level for profits , that everyone is in the same boat , that everyone will share the pain and that everyone will share in any future prosperity .
British companies are suddenly discovering a truth that was buried in the New Labour boom years and which was cravenly neglected by New Labour 's economic policy makers ... that fairness matters - and the structures through which to deliver it are very weak indeed .
There were two clinchers in the BA deal .
The first was that when the union says the company is not bluffing , the pilots believe it .
The union , far from an obstacle to management , offers something that money can't buy - trust .
In a crisis which calls for wage cuts , the best chance is if the company can convince the union which , in turn , has the best chance of convincing workers .
The second clincher was that the pilots have long wanted respect from BA , to be regarded as important and as high status as any senior manager .
The quid pro quo for their lost earnings is to be given £ 13 m of BA shares that cannot be sold before 2014 .
This is not just a long - term incentive - it is turning the pilots into stakeholders who stand to benefit from their collective sacrifice .
Companies would have a much better chance of getting wage flexibility over the entire economic cycle if they committed to fairness .
Over the last 30 years , the ratio of average CEO pay to average pay has trebled for no discernible improvement in corporate performance .
Workers are suspicious of their boss 's intentions and how the gains will be shared .
Directors stand to make millions ; the ordinary worker may or may not keep their job .
After all , if a predator takes over the company , the new owner can declare that all the promises guaranteeing jobs and sharing future profits are off .
They were made by the old management .
The new management is about to sack you .
Efficiency , fairness and committed ownership go hand in hand .
British capitalism needs be organised around stable , long - term owners who commit to the company 's purpose , managers with incentives to deliver long - term growth and workers represented by trade unions similarly committed to the long - term goals of the company - and at best have shares in it .
New Labour has dipped its toe in the water , offering tax incentives for companies to give shares to workers .
A Treasury study last year showed that those who had worker shareholders performed noticeably better than those which did not .
But no New Labour minister cared to spread the message ; it may be construed as anti-business .
Work is where we spend much of our lives , a place where we not only earn our living , but gain meaning and satisfaction .
People are now fearful and concerned about their job and their wage , but the best British companies are doing all they can to secure jobs with fair wage cuts .
The problem is that they do it in a hostile climate , with too many ideological unions , companies in thrall to hungry , footloose shareholders and managers looking for City - style fast money .
New Labour had its opportunity for reform .
It did too little .
Companies are now pioneering on their own .
BA should try offering shares to every worker who takes a pay holiday .
The cabin crew too .
Then the smiles we are offered as we step on board would be genuine .

Cheney Comes Out for Gay Marriage , State - by - State
By Dan Eggen
Former vice president Richard Cheney waded into another simmering public debate today , suggesting he supports legalizing gay marriage as long as the issue is decided by the states rather than the federal government .
Cheney , whose youngest daughter is a lesbian with a longtime partner , said during an appearance at the National Press Club that " people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish , any kind of arrangement they wish . "
He said he does not support federal action allowing gay marriages , however .
" Historically the way marriage has been regulated is at the state level , " Cheney said .
" It has always been a state issue and I think that is the way it ought to be handled , on a state - by - state basis . "
Cheney has long departed from conservative orthodoxy on the issue of gay marriage , saying during the 2000 presidential campaign that the matter should be left to the states .
He also prompted an uproar during the 2004 race when he appeared to distance himself from a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage , which was strongly supported by his boss , George W. Bush .
But his endorsement of state - sanctioned marriage for gays and lesbians appears to put him to the left of President Obama , who has said he supports civil unions rather than marriage for same - sex couples .
" With the respect to the question of relationships , my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone , " Cheney said at a 2004 campaign stop in Davenport , Iowa , using language nearly identical to his remarks today .
" People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to . "
As he has in the past , Cheney specifically cited his family 's experience during his comments in Washington today .
" As many of you know , one of my daughters is gay and it is something we have lived with for a long time in our family , " Cheney said .
Cheney 's youngest daughter , Mary , and her longtime partner , Heather Poe , have a son , Samuel , who was born to Mary Cheney in 2007 .
Both Mary and her older sister , Elizabeth , have been prominent supporters of their father and Republican causes , although Mary has said in interviews that she considered quitting the Bush re-election effort in 2004 because of the gay marriage issue .

Jane Souter , who has a son at the school and is chair of the Parents Teachers and Friends Association , said : " It is a shame but that is the way it is all going now , you are not allowed to do a lot of things because of rules and regulations .
Some guys followed us around all day and ended up with this video doc thing : Making of A Softer World ( Yeah , we hang out with Ryan North in the park all day .
Every day . ) The best book I bought at TCAF was the DAR collection by Erika Moen .
It is awesome and a bit dirty .
And by a bit dirty , I mean that she sent it to a company to have it printed , and they refused , because the content was too explicit .
So she sent it somewhere else , and they also refused .
In the end , she had to have it printed in Canada !
( We 'll print anything . )
But , for a book that they refused to print because it is filth , it is surprisingly sweet , which you already know if you read Dar online .

A MUCH -TRUMPETED plan for limitless supplies of free energy has been dashed by the revelation that something cannot be produced from nothing .
An Irish company had promised it could deliver non-polluting , virtually cost - free power but an international jury said yesterday it did not work .
However the verdict has not deterred the company , Steorn Ltd , from continuing to develop a magnetism - based technology it calls “ Orbo ” .
“ It is a disappointment , but we had seen this coming for quite a while , ” chief executive Seán McCarthy said yesterday .
“ The jury has n’t found they support the claims .
We would dispute that . ”
Based in Dublin ’s Docklands near the O2 and employing 22 people , Steorn made international headlines almost three years ago when it claimed to have discovered a way to get more energy out of a gizmo than it put in .
The excess , they said , could be used to power a mobile phone , run a fridge or make an MP3 player go .
Scientists doubted the claims and , when the company resisted calls to release precise details of how Orbo worked , it asked an international panel of experts to adjudicate on the device .
Steorn organised a panel of 22 independent scientists and engineers from Europe and North America chaired by Ian MacDonald , emeritus professor of electrical engineering at the University of Alberta .
“ The situation was we had engaged them in February 2007 and went through a process with them , ” Mr McCarthy said .
Two years have passed however and the jury clearly decided that enough was enough .
It posted an announcement on its website http://stjury.ning.com that it was disbanding .
“ The unanimous verdict of the jury is that Steorn ’s attempts to demonstrate the claim have not shown the production of energy , ” it stated .
“ The jury is therefore ceasing work . ”
The dream lives on , however , as Steorn prepares to begin licensing its Orbo technology “ definitely before the end of the year ” , Mr McCarthy said .
The company is inviting 300 engineering companies to sign a developer licence agreement , giving them free access to the technology .
The call represents a final test of the system , according to the company ’s website .
The Impossible Wind Turbine Design That Just Might Work
January 27th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Adam Fuller has dedicated his life — and his life savings — to disproving the wind industry ’s claim that vertical turbines are ineffective .
Last week , I had a chance to talk to the Racine , Wisconsin inventor about his 12 foot diameter , 36 foot tall patent - pending wind turbine .
Fuller ’s design consists of 8 turbines that each have 4 structural steel wind scoops .
There are multiple points of impact for the wind to hit , so even the slightest breeze will spin the blades .
So far , the prototype has worked flawlessly .
While nobody has ever made an ultra- large scale vertical turbine before , Fuller thinks his design is an excellent candidate .
“ I ’ve been able to demonstrate that for every 10 feet of baffle , there ’s a 300 percent increase of output with the rotor .
So my thought is that a 40 foot baffle will increase output by 1200 percent .
If the 40 foot baffle system is successful , that means that 1 turbine and baffle system ( about $ 200,000 ) , would have the same amount of power as 12 turbines without baffles ( about $ 150,000 ) , so there ’s financial efficiency .
That ’s a big change , ” he explained .
Eventually , Fuller wants to build a 120 foot model of his turbine .
He estimates that it could produce 30,000 to 75,000 kWh each month — enough for 30 to 70 homes .
Whether Fuller ’s dreams of a large scale vertical turbine come to fruition depends on future funding for his project .
Fuller was previously funded by an investor who lost most of his money in the current economic crisis .
Now he hopes to get money from a government grant .
Once Fuller has some cash in his pocket , he believes his design can go straight to commercial production .
“ After our organization achieves some credibility , it wo n’t be difficult to find R&D money , especially with so much evidence that the turbine works .
This thing is ready to go to market . “
The Walworth County News posted a video of Fuller explaining his design here :

Rising oil prices — the great villain of 2008 — are back , but this time markets are cheering .
Oil futures jumped over $ 71 a barrel this morning , boosting shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron — and the Dow overall — as investors looked towards the rally in recent months as a bullish sign that demand is returning to an ailing global economy .
Or is it ?
Separately today , the Paris - based International Energy Agency slashed its forecast for world oil demand over the next five years , saying that by 2013 global demand will average 87.9 million barrels a day , 3.7 % fewer than it expected in December and 7 % fewer than it expected last July .
The group predicts oil consumption will fall by 3 % this year , the sharpest decline in a quarter - century , after averaging about 2 % growth annually over the previous decade .
Why all the fuss over oil demand ?
Because it ’s critical to know what ’s behind rising oil prices .
If it ’s demand — if nations like the U.S. , China and India are consuming more oil because they ’re building infrastructure and powering factories — then indeed higher prices are a bullish sign for global economic growth , even if it means some grumbles at the pump .
But if it ’s not demand at play , as the IEA ’s outlook seems to suggest , then rising oil prices start to look a lot more sinister — especially because higher oil prices take a chunk out of consumers ’ pocketbooks and companies ’ earnings , a scenario that unfolded to much dismay last summer , when prices topped out in July at over $ 145 a barrel .
One possibility is that supply could be too tight ; that producers have slashed their output too much .
But if that ’s the case , it would seem they ’d now be eager to pump more oil through their pipelines and cash in on the higher prices ( which then helps to stabilize prices at that elusive “ equilibrium ” ) .
Or , it could be speculation .
It does seem a little odd that global supply and demand would have gyrated enough over the past year to send prices soaring last summer ; then crashing ; and now rebounding swiftly even as the world economy navigates its worst downturn since the Great Depression .
Last summer , Richard S. Eckaus , a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , published a short , easy - to - read paper with the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research titled “ The Oil Price Really Is A Speculative Bubble ” .
He writes that “ there seems to be a preference for the claim that the price increases are the result of basic economic forces : rapid growth in consumption , pushed particularly by the oil appetites of China and India , the depreciation of the U.S. dollar , real supply limitations , current and prospective and the risks of supply disruption , especially in the Middle East . ”
He briefly explores — and debunks — each of those possibilities , writes that the price of oil is behaving much like any other speculative bubble , and encourages efforts to “ break the bubble ” given its adverse effect on the economy .
The latter suggestion makes for an interesting debate : if oil price fluctuations are being driven by trading activity rather than supply and demand , should such activity be regulated , prohibited even ?
Only one thing is certain : the faster and higher prices go , the more plausible the idea will become .

ISLAMABAD : The United States has said that Afghan drug trade was not a major source of funding for militancy and extremism in Pakistan .
The financing came from extremists ’ patrons in Gulf countries — an aspect now being scrutinised , the statement added .
‘ Private individuals who support extremists bring money in through illegal means … hawala system and the area focussed is the Gulf Cooperation Council countries , ’ US Special Envoy … Richard Holbrooke told a media briefing at the American Embassy .
Mr Holbrooke … said it was ‘ a very big issue ’ and ‘ the most troubling aspect of the entire situation . ’
The US , he said , had started looking into the source of financing for the extremists and would be devoting more time to investigate it .
He admitted that not much work was done in the past to explore this aspect .
However , he said the much - touted drug trade was not the main financing source for extremism .
‘ Even if the drug trade stops it wo n’t have any significant impact . ’
A significant difference in public analysis by the U.S. government .
No doubt the Bush administration did little to analyze funding for the Taliban in either Afghanistan or Pakistan .
Especially if there was any hint that his buddies in the Persian Gulf were involved .
Holbrooke is being careful , precise enough in his choice of words to confine his statement to “ private individuals ” being responsible for the flow of gold to the insurgency .
Though , I doubt that any significant traffic through the wahala banking system goes unscrutinized by Saudi royals or UAE sheikhs .
Regardless – this extends the range of potentially “ official ” enemies to reactionary thugs in Gulf oil country .
to boldly stay …
The agency that sent humans to another world is now mired in its own red tape .
You make one short , revealing video that lets managers and bureaucrats see just how closed minded to new ideas they can be and everybody makes a big deal out of it .
The short video in question , Law & Order at the JSC , shows the trials of an engineer with a new spacecraft design being continuously prevented from taking her idea beyond the sketch phase because it ’s “ different from what the project office is doing . ”
What the video really shows is what ’s known as the not - invented - here mentality of large corporations and its a huge problem for any organization with too many managers , too many layers and a focus on dollars and cents rather than core competencies , growth and innovation .
Another word for all this is groupthink .
When a large organization exists for a long time , it has a procedure for pretty much anything set in stone or as close to it as possible .
Managers rose to their positions by closely following these procedures and maintaining the status quo .
Now , a young upstart who has n’t been there for a few decades wants to change things ?
What , how the organization does things is n’t good enough ?
Is she questioning fifty years of experience ?
Who does she think she is ?
Does she assume the whole world revolves around her idea and we ’ll just jump on it because it ’s new and different ?
It ’s not a requirement , we ’re not obliged to do it and maybe we do n’t need this troublemaker around here anymore …
It happens every day .
Employees with new ideas or who want to change things get kicked out of companies and government offices because risk averse managers are incensed that someone wants them to change the way they do things .
They use every means possible to crush change from the bottom - up .
For all the talk about democratizing media and engaging in open dialogue with employees , changes at big companies and in government organizations can only happen from the top down and only when the boss is serious about change and does n’t hesitate to use his powers on bureaucrats who stand in the way of anything new solely on principle .
So when a NASA spokesperson says that it will take us centuries to start flying around our solar system or build lunar outposts , add another few hundred years on top of that .
With this mindset , we may as well give up on being a space faring species .
This is why everyone in the space community is turning to the likes of Virgin Galactic and XCOR when it comes to the future of space travel .
While NASA bosses send engineers with good ideas on wild goose chases from office to office , saying that if it worked on Apollo , it will work on any other new mission , private companies will be boldly going where NASA is too scared to go .
And while they ’re at it , they ’ll be hiring the bright young engineers with new ideas and designs .
So it seems that a one time global innovation leader is careening towards becoming a laggard .
If you run a business , take heed .
Groupthink and bureaucracy kill progress .

Dr. Leroy Carhart , a medical doctor who provides abortions , and who is most well known for his lead role in fighting bans on " partial birth abortion , " will take over Dr. Tiller 's Kansas clinic to ensure women receive the care they need .
Dr. Leroy Carhart , a physician who provides abortions for women in need and who for many years provided later term abortions in his home state of Nebraska , will temporarily take over Dr. Tiller ’s medical practice in Kansas .
Dr. Carhart , still a practicing provider , is most well known for his involvement in two Supreme Court cases , Stenberg v. Carhart and Gonzales v. Carhart , which challenged and then upheld the ban on the politically termed " Partial Birth Abortion . "
As no doubt readers of Rewire know , Dr. Tiller was slain inside his church yesterday .
Reports the Omaha World - Herald ,
After Sunday ’s fatal shooting , Tiller ’s chief nurse called Carhart .
Carhart made arrangements to keep his Bellevue clinic open while he is gone .
When contacted Sunday , he said he was en route to Wichita to run Tiller ’s clinic for at least the next week .
Dr. Carhart calls the murderer of his beloved colleague a " terrorist " saying his friend ’s death is " a declaration of war " on the part of radical anti-abortion activists whom he calls " fundamentalist terrorists . . . no different from al - Qaida , the Taliban or any of them . "

It is not hard to understand why Dr. Carhart is as enraged as he is .
Carhart has been the target of anti-choice / " pro-life " forces for years .
His clinic in Nebraska was the site of many violent and more peaceful pro-life protests over the years .
In 1991 , his home and farm were burned to the ground , causing the death of numerous animals .
Though no one was ever prosecuted for the crime , an anonoymous note claimed that the murder of his animals was just like the murdering of children .
I remember meeting Dr. Carhart at a fundraiser for the non-profit health center for which I worked .
What struck me first , as a newly initiated reproductive health advocate , was a large button on the lapel of his suit .
It simply said , " Trust Women . "
The simplicity of the statement almost brought me to tears .
Dr. Carhart was n’t advocating for a particular procedure , he was n’t stating his opposition to anything .
His message was uplifting , positive and based in respect for women as human beings .
Now , Dr. Carhart ’s message of trusting women has transformed , at least for awhile .
He considers Dr. Tiller ’s murder " deeply personal , " according to the Omaha newspaper , and he is " filled with rage
at the level of violence directed toward abortion providers . "
But he will continue to ensure that women receive the medical care they need :
Carhart said that neither Tiller ’s clinic nor his own would close because of the killing , saying he would do everything he could to assist women who needed his services : " We have to do everything we can to help women not get pregnant when they are n’t able to care for the child .
And when that ’s not possible , we have to continue providing the option for abortion services that are safe and healthy for women . "
It ’s a circle of care and compassion that continues .
Dr. George Tiller , I ’m sure , could not be more proud of his friend and colleague , Leroy Carhart .
And though access is one of the greatest challenges for women in need of a late term abortion , at least for now this option will remain .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. solar energy industry expanded in 2008 , but the recession has cut demand for some solar installations , according to a solar trade group .

REUTERS / Tim Shaffer
Solar capacity in the United States rose about 9 percent , or 1,265 megawatts , to 8,775 megawatts last year , the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a summary of an annual report to be released on Thursday .
Solar panel capacity rose 78 percent from 2007 , as solar water heater installations increased 50 percent .
But the housing crisis led to a 3 percent decline in shipments of solar pool heating systems -- the largest segment of the sector by capacity .
The recession has brought financing problems to some solar companies , the association said .
“ Many companies report that although consumers continue to express interest in solar , concerns about personal finances and tight credit have reduced sales , ” the association said .
A grant program established by stimulus package passed this year will allow some solar customers to receive a cash payment covering 30 percent of the cost of installing solar equipment .
The stimulus law also authorizes the U.S. government to guarantee loans for solar and other renewable energy projects .
“ This should help alleviate recent constraints on project financing , ” the association said .
SEIA President Rhone Resch said the first quarter of 2009 has been “ brutal ” for the solar industry , although he could not provide any specific numbers for the sector .
President Barack Obama has pledged to double renewable energy production in three years .
Resch said the solar industry can “ absolutely ” meet this mandate , but only if Congress takes action .
“ That is going require a substantial ramp up in the use of solar and that does n’t just happen organically , ” Resch told reporters at a briefing on the report .
In addition to the tax credits and stimulus measures , Resch said lawmakers must establish a renewable energy portfolio that requires electricity providers to generate a certain amount of power from renewable sources .
Resch said such a standard should include provisions that support solar energy use .
No solar power plants came on line in 2008 and Resch said he expects only two or three to be built in the next three years .
Much of the short - term growth for solar energy capacity will come from solar panel installations , he said .
Nurse Margaret Haywood was struck off the register with immediate effect today after secretly filming for a BBC Panorama programme exposing neglect of elderly patients in a hospital .
Ms Haywood , 58 , recorded appalling conditions at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton for a BBC documentary screened in July 2005 .
She said : " I was convinced that it was the right thing to do at the time as , in fact , I had reported the issues and nothing had been done .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I felt I owed it to the people on the ward . "
Ms Haywood , of Liverpool , was found guilty of misconduct yesterday at a hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council in central London .
The panel said that given the seriousness of her misconduct , " it would not be in the public interest for her to be able to practise as a nurse " .
Linda Read , chair of the panel , said : " In the view of the panel , this was a major breach of the code of conduct .
A patient should be able to trust a nurse with his / her physical condition and psychological wellbeing without that confidential information being disclosed to others .
" Although the conditions on the ward were dreadful , it was not necessary to breach confidentiality to seek to improve them by the method chosen .
" The panel is of the view that the misconduct found is fundamentally incompatible with being a nurse .
" The registrant embarked upon filming many vulnerable , elderly patients in the last stages of their lives , knowing that it was unlikely that they would be able to give any meaningful consent to that process , in circumstances where their dignity was most compromised .
" The registrant could have attempted to address shortcomings by other means .
But this was never a course of action which she fully considered . "
Ms Haywood , who had worked as a nurse for more than 20 years , told the hearing earlier she would be " devastated " if she was prevented from continuing to work as a nurse .
Dr Karen Johnson , representing Ms Haywood , told the tribunal that the documentary had " immense " impact .
She said : " It is through programmes like Panorama that awareness is raised .
" The results were local and throughout the country , and there has since been an ongoing campaign to improve the conditions
She was an exceedingly good nurse who always put patients first and filming second . "
After the hearing , Ms Haywood said : " I am absolutely devastated and upset by it all .
" I think I have been treated very harshly .
It is a serious issue and I knew it was a risk I was taking but I thought the filming was justified and it was in the public interest .
" I always made it clear to the BBC that patients would come first at all times .
I did voice my concerns through my immediate line manager and I also went to my ward manager but nothing was really taken on board .
There was no other way of getting the full picture . "
Asked about what the result meant for other whistleblowers within the NHS , Ms Haywood said the procedure needed to be reviewed .
She said : " Clearly , looking at recent things that have been happening , especially with the South Staffordshire hospital , nurses are afraid to speak out about what is happening and the whole process needs to be reviewed so nurses can make it easier to voice their concerns . "
The recent announcement Jamis Buck is ending development of Capistrano has left many wondering the future of this deployment tool .
The release of Vlad 1.3 gives others hope as an alternative .
Vlad 1.3 Released
On March 4th , Vlad the Deployer 1.3 was released and announced on the Polishing Ruby weblog .
Vlad is touted as being like Capistrano but 1/10th the complexity and integrates with Rake .
The recent release adds 9 new features including :
Git Support
Merb Support
Passenger and Lighttpd Support
Added darcs support
Added / merged god , nginx , thin , and maintenance tasks
Allow set to specify that a proc value is : per_thread
Apply Mercurial SCM support patch
remote_task now supports args and supplies task
Along with these new features there are also 19 minor updates and 11 bug fixes .
Please see the release announcement for a complete list of fixes and update .
Vlad can be installed with the usual :
gem install vlad
Find out more information about Vlad the Deployer on the project web site .
Capistrano Maintenance Handover
After the recent release of Capistrano 2.5.5 , Jamis Buck announced he was stepping away from the Capistrano project and would not be doing any more development or support .
I ’m ceasing development on SQLite / Ruby , SQLite3 / Ruby , Net: : SSH ( and related libs , Net : : SFTP , Net : : SCP , etc. ) and Capistrano .
I will no longer be accepting patches , bug reports , support requests , feature requests , or general emails related to any of these projects .
For Capistrano , I will continue to follow the mailing list , and might appear in the #capistrano irc channel from time to time , but I am no longer the maintainer of these projects .
This left many users of Capistrano wondering about the future of many developer 's favorite Ruby deployment tool .
Well , Lee Hambley , a developer for the company SetFire :
We ’re proud to announce that as of today one of our developers , Lee Hambley has taken over maintenance of capify.org .
For many people involved in Ruby on Rails development , Capistrano is a vital tool , making the whole process of maintaining production environments that much simpler , by automating and combining many of the more laborious and repetitive tasks involved .
He will be hosting and maintaining the Capify.org site , as well as consolidating and hopefully coordinating new developments to the gem when a new code maintainer is selected .
There has been some interested parties who have identified themselves on the Capistrano Google Group .
Jonathan Weiss and Mathias Meyer of the Webistrano and Macistrano projects respectively have spoken up expressed a desire to maintain the Capistrano code base :
Mathias Meyer and I are quite familiar with the Capistrano code base ( we wrote Webistrano , Macistrano , and a couple of smaller extensions ) .
We can see ourselves taking over maintainership for Capistrano and Net : : S* .
Things are certainly looking positive for the future development and support of Capistrano .
I ’ve been watching with interest the latest tactical lunacy emanating from the right .
These guys may be crazy ( well there ’s not much ‘ may be ’ to it ) but they are clever ... in a sneaky underhanded mad scientist sort of way .
One of the ways they try to destroy something they fear is to turn it into an object of ridicule , as they did with impeachment .
Having crapped all over the process , they rendered it useless ... apparently .
I believe they are attempting the same tactic with the subject of revolution .
Fearing that one is coming , they are making a deliberate effort to render the subject radioactive by inflaming their pet nutcases via Glenn Beck , Michelle Malkin , et al .
At the risk of getting a lot of innocent people killed ( and yes , there have been actual deaths ) , they have created quite a stir in the lunatic fringe .
In the process they have managed to spotlight the idiocy of armed insurrection against a powerful police state armed to the teeth with the most modern and horrific weapons imaginable .
In that sense their tactic has succeeded .
Even the would be revolutionaries on the left ( like me ) can see how silly it all is .
The howling nutters on the right have shown just how crazy it would be to rise up against the might and power of the United States government with shotguns and peashooters .
The brains ( so to speak ) behind the rightwing sleaze machine have de-fanged revolution .
But armed insurrection is not what they should fear because no one with more than one brain cell to rub together is going to advocate any such thing .
That is not to say that there is no way to fight back , because there is .
There always will be .
When ’ more and better democrats ’ turns out to be not enough , there are always protest and civil disobedience .
Some very smart people are organizing on the left to resist the oppression by the oligarchs .
In fact , a mass nationwide demonstration is scheduled for this Saturday , April 11 , 2009 .

Any bank that 's " too big to fail " means that it 's too big for a free market to function .
The financial corporations that caused this mess must be broken up and sold back to the private market with strong , new regulatory and antitrust rules in place -- new banks , managed by new people .
An independent regulatory body must protect consumers from predatory practices .
As Wall St. corporations grew bigger and bigger until they were " too big to fail , " they also became so politically powerful that they led to distorted and unfair policies that served companies , not citizens .
Its not enough to try to patch up the current system .
We demand serious reform that fixes the root problems in our political and economic system : excessive influence of banks , dangerous compensation systems , and massive consolidation .
And we demand that the reform happen in an open and transparent manner .
A New Way Forward
Get out there and do something real people .
Let ’s show the rightwing how intelligent people resist tyranny – with peace , non-violence , sanity and dignity .
Viele meinen , die Piratenpartei sei eine Protestpartei ohne Substanz .
Das war die SPD auch einmal .
Immerhin sind die Sozialdemokraten heute keine Protestpartei mehr .
Der 1863 gegründete Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein ( ADAV ) von Ferdinand Lassalle war , wie die Piratenpartei heute , eine Protestgruppe mit einem minimalistischen Programm , ganz auf die Interessen einer gesellschaftlichen Gruppe zugeschnitten , die von den herrschenden Schichten nicht wahrgenommen wurde , und für die sich niemand einsetzte .
Die Arbeiter .
Es ging um das Wahlrecht und Unternehmen in Arbeiterhand .
Die Forderungen waren selbst im eigenen politischen Umfeld der gerade entstehenden Arbeiterbewegung umstritten und stießen beispielsweise bei Karl Marx auf offene Ablehnung .
Später wurde aus diesem kleinen Verein die SPD .

Später wurde aus diesem kleinen Verein die SPD .
Lassalle selbst war eine schillernde Figur , die für Aufmerksamkeit sorgte , selbst von Bismarck empfangen wurde und ein Jahr nach Gründung des ADAVs bei einem Duell um die Gunst von Helene von Dönniges starb .
Er versuchte , bei einem Shootout den Vater von Dönniges zu töten , der gegen eine Heirat der beiden war – und verlor .
Der ADAV wurde 1863 kaum ernster genommen als die Piratenpartei heute .
Wenn die Piratenpartei heute als naive Protestpartei ohne klare Antworten zur Lösung der Probleme zwischen Netizens und Restgesellschaft beschrieben wird , erinnert das etwas an die damalige Kritik an Lassalle und seinem Programm .
Wie Christian Stöcker in seinem Spiegel - Online Beitrag " Die Generation C64 schlägt zurück " beschrieben hat , gibt es längst eine Gruppe , die sich selbst stark in der digitalen Welt verortet .
Ihr Kommen hat sich über Jahrzehnte angekündigt : Sie wurde von Sherry Turkle in „ Die Wunschmaschine “ ( Org. 1984 ) ebenso beschrieben wie in „ Leben im Netz “ ( Org. 1995 ) und bekam von Matthias Horx 1984 ( damals noch kein „ Zukunftsforscher “ sondern Journalist ) den Namen Chip Generation verpasst – unter dem Titel veröffentlichte
Horx damals einen „ Trip durch die Computerszene “ .
Und wie so häufig , wurde dieses Kommen von der Politik und ihren Beratern komplett ignoriert .
Das Internet ist für sie vor allem eine Möglichkeit über Twitter , Facebook und Blogs billig PR zu verbreiten – als zumindest partieller Lebensraum von immer mehr Menschen , wird es nicht wahrgenommen .
Die Bewohner des Netzes sind in den vergangenen Monaten von der Politik nicht nur ignoriert – was den meisten von uns wahrscheinlich ziemlich egal gewesen wäre – sondern offen attackiert worden : Netzsperren , das absurde Verbot von „ Killerspielen “ und die Ankündigung von Wiefelspütz , weitere Online - Inhalte zu sperren , wird von vielen als genau das empfunden : Ein Angriff auf ihre Art zu leben und das initiiert von Menschen , die schlicht nichts anderes als digitale Analphabeten sind .
Nicht wenige der Netizens werden morgen vielleicht die Piraten wählen .
Die romantische Unabhängigkeitserklärung des Cyberspaces , von John Perry Barlow 1996 verfasst , scheint so aktuell wie nie .
Es gibt das Argument gegen die Piraten , dass es sich nicht lohnt eine kleine Partei zu wählen , sondern dass es sinnvoller ist , die Inhalte , die einem wichtig sind , in die großen Parteien einzubringen .
Das Argument hat einen langen Bart und wurde schon immer von den Anhängern etablierter Parteien vorgebracht .
Und es ist falsch .
Es hat sich für die Arbeiter gelohnt , im 19 .
und 20 .
Jahrhundert die SPD zu wählen , um die eigenen Interessen voran zu treiben , und es war für die Ökos der 80er richtig , für die Grünen zu stimmen und nicht darauf zu setzen , dass SPD , CDU und FDP sich irgendwann einmal des Themas Umwelt annehmen .
Wer glaubt , eine Partei von innen verändern zu können , ist wahlweise naiv oder dumm : Gerade bei den großen Parteien findet Politik auf Ortsvereinsebene , da , wo das Neumitglied sich engagieren kann , kaum statt .
Ein Freund von mir bezeichnet die Treffen seines SPD - Ortsvereines als „ Rentnerbespaßung “ und meidet sie längst .
Bei der CDU sieht es kaum anders aus .
Wer da etwas bewegen will , muss bereit sein , große Teile seiner Lebensenergie zu verschwenden – aus guten Gründen will das kaum jemand , weswegen die Parteien unter Mitgliederschwund und Überalterung leiden .
Die Wahl der Piratenpartei kann die Interessen der Netizens , der Generation C64 , vorantreiben .
Wenn morgen die Piratenpartei via Schweden in das Europaparlament einzieht und in Deutschland ein Ergebnis jenseits der 0,5 Prozent erreicht , sind die Forderungen einer Gruppe auf dem Tisch , um die sich die Altparteien bislang kaum gekümmert haben .
Wenn dann Vertreter der Piratenpartei in Talkshows auf Figuren wie Wiefelspütz treffen , die nicht die geringste Ahnung haben , wovon sie überhaupt reden , werden die ihr blaues Wunder erleben : Die Spitze der Piratenpartei besteht aus IT - Fachleuten , Naturwissenschaftlern und Ingenieuren die wissen , wovon sie reden .
In der Politik eher die Ausnahme als die Regel .
Klar , das Programm der Piratenpartei ist noch nicht dazu angetan , sie den Kanzler stellen zu lassen – aber es gibt im Europawahlprogramm klare Aussagen zur Verfassung der EU , zur Militärpolitik und zum öffentlichen Nahverkehr .
Für nahezu alle Fragen rund um die Digitalisierung der Gesellschaft haben hingegen die Altparteien kaum Antworten – und die hat gerade erst begonnen .
Die Piratenpartei kann zu einem
Muster für eine offene Kommunikation werden und sich , wenn genug Leute mitmachen , noch gut entwickeln .
Parteien sind langfristige Projekte , deren großer Erfolg sich oft erst in Jahrzehnten einstellt .
Die Piratenpartei ist ein spannendes Projekt – vielleicht floppt sie , vielleicht wird sie ein Erfolg .
Aber eines ist heute schon klar :
Wer morgen die Piraten wählt , wirft seine Stimme nicht weg .
Nach all den Berichten über diese Partei wird auch der kleinste Erfolg medial große Wirkungen haben und die anderen Parteien zwingen , sich zur Digitalisierung und zum Netz zu positionieren .
Das wäre doch schon mal was – und die Europawahl ist dazu eine gute Gelegenheit :
Wir wählen bei der Europawahl ein Parlament , das kein Initiativrecht hat und über weite Teile des EU - Haushaltes noch nicht einmal mitreden darf .
Und in das die Parteien ihre zweite und dritte Garde schicken – also kann man mit seiner Stimme experimentieren .
Viel zu verlieren haben wir dabei nicht .
Skokie police drew their guns and surrounded a Bank of America Monday morning because two " suspicious " men wanted to open an account .
Oops .
The men who were targeted by police called it “ racial profiling ” and a police over - reaction .
The two were apparently trying to open an account , but employees thought they appeared suspicious and called police .
A bank employee said there is no security at the branch , which is across from the Old Orchard Mall .
After police surrounded the bank , both men surrendered .
One man left the bank with his arms up , while the other sat on the sidewalk with two officers pointing machine guns at him .
The men had no weapons .
After checking out the men ’s story , Skokie police shook hands with them and let them go on their way .
The two men actually returned into the bank to complete their business , but said they do n't think they 'll be back .
Skokie police defended their actions , issuing the following statement about what happened :
On Monday , June 8 , 2009 , at approximately 10:00 a.m. , at 10000 Skokie Blvd. , the Bank of America manager contacted the Skokie Police Department regarding two suspicious males walking around inside the bank .
The manager stated that upon entry , one male told the other male to tap him three times when he was ready ; one male also had what appeared to be an object in his waistband .
Skokie police officers responded and established a perimeter around the bank .
The suspicious persons exited the bank without incident .
They were identified and released without charges .
It was determined that no crime had been committed .
About six weeks ago there was a robbery at a nail salon across the street from the bank , where the robbers literally stole ladies ’ wallets while they were getting manicures .
That may have added to the bank employees ’ nervousness .
Chicagoland has seen over 200 bank robberies in each of the past four years .
Ms Redding said the Supreme Court hearing was " pretty overwhelming "
The US Supreme Court has been considering whether a school acted illegally in subjecting a 13 - year old girl to a strip - search .
Officials at Safford Middle School , Arizona , say they were acting on a tip - off that Savana Redding was hiding prescription - strength painkillers .
Ms Redding 's lawyers argue that the teachers needed " location - specific " information to carry out the search .
The US constitution outlaws what it terms unreasonable searches .
' Invasion ' Ms Redding , who is now 19 years old and in her first year of college , described the Supreme Court hearing as " pretty overwhelming " .
The incident took place when she was attending middle school in her home town of Safford , Arizona .
After a fellow pupil accused her of giving her ibuprofen pills , the school 's Vice Principal Kerry Wilson took Ms Redding into his office to search her bag .
When no pills were found in the bag , Mr Wilson ordered Ms Redding to go to a nurse 's office , where she says she was told to remove her shirt and trousers .
There needs to be suspicion that the object is under the clothes
Adam Wolf
Lawyer for Savana Redding
She says she was then asked to move her bra to one side and stretch her underwear waistband , exposing her breasts and pelvic area .
No pills were found .
A lawsuit brought by Ms Redding and her mother was dismissed by a federal magistrate , and that judgment was upheld by a federal appeals panel .
But in July 2008 , the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the search was " an invasion of constitutional rights , " setting the stage for a legal showdown in America 's highest court .
The Supreme Court justices considering the case expressed concern that schools should not be barred from searching pupils who could be carrying dangerous substances .
" My thought process is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip search ... than to have some other kids dead because the stuff is distributed at lunchtime , " said Justice David Souter .
But he also warned against setting a precedent that could expose pupils to even more intrusive searches , like body - cavity searches .
" There would be no legal basis in saying that was out of bounds , " he said .
Lawyer Adam Wolf , acting for Ms Redding , argued that unless school authorities had specific information about the location of prohibited items , then strip - searches contravened the Fourth Amendment of the US constitution .
" There needs to be suspicion that the object is under the clothes , " he said .
The court is expected to rule on the case by the end of June .

Dear Reader ,
" Blogger was the beginning , now it 's moved out of the basement , it 's called www.zerohedge.com "
Today we officially launch our new website ( www.zerohedge.com), which will serve as the scaffold for much additional expansion in the months ahead .
Blogger has been useful , however it has reached its limitations and it is time to move on .
This is especially true as daily traffic has grown to a level far beyond what was envisioned possible when Zero Hedge was started .
As part of the transition you will see many changes , and a format much more reminiscent of a " real " website .
Due to bandwidth limitations , the index page will be more streamlined and cohesive , at least initially - we hope to give readers the option of designing their layout shortly .
More importantly , we have moved our physical servers and domains offshore , partly to be independent and never be held hostage by any major provider , partly to avoid what has become widespread abuse of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act to silence whistleblowers and force the pre-emptive removal of content without due process of any kind .
Most importantly , over the next month , once we are comfortable that the website is fully functioning and bug free , we will launch several major expansions that we believe will provide a substantial service to readers and investors and address " unmet market needs " in banker parlance .
Last but not least , the new website is now fully open to reader input with numerous forums covering extensive and broad topics , and will also stream real time news content from RAN Squawk : one of the best headline news scraping services available .
Over the next few days , a contributors section will also be up and running , providing a venue for a select few of Zero Hedge 's closest and most erudite collaborators to engage and syndicate their best ideas .
Which brings me to another point - Zero Hedge is going global .
To address demands for a broader event focus , and to provide what will be almost constant news coverage , we are close to finalizing exclusive relationships with a European and Asian contributor .
The ongoing economic drama is not American , it is worldwide .
In the meantime we will cross post on the old blogger website ( http://zerohedge.blogspot.com) as we iron out all kinks .
We apologize in advance for dropping Disqus in the new version , however it is with a specific purpose in mind , which will be made evident over the next month .
Also , for all beta testers , thanks for your work - unfortunately you will need to reregister once again .
Needless to say , we are very excited at all that it unfolding for Zero Hedge , and it is all geared to providing the best possible independent and informative environment for you , dear reader .
We welcome all constructive input : much more than anything , Zero Hedge is an evolving experiment in author - reader interaction .
When you speak , we listen .
- Your Zero Hedge Team
P.S. Please register to the website .

If a picture 's worth 1000 words , how much of a picture can you fit in 140 characters ?
Note :
That 's it folks !
Bounty deadline is here , and after some tough deliberation , I have decided that Boojum 's entry just barely edged out Sam Hocevar's .
I will post more detailed notes once I 've had a chance to write them up .
Of course , everyone should feel free to continue to submit solutions and improve solutions for people to vote on .
Thank you to everyone who submitted and entry ; I enjoyed all of them .
This has been a lot of fun for me to run , and I hope it 's been fun for both the entrants and the spectators .
I came across this interesting post about trying to compress images into a Twitter comment , and lots of people in that thread ( and a thread on Reddit ) had suggestions about different ways you could do it .
So , I figure it would make a good coding challenge ; let people put their money where their mouth is , and show how their ideas about encoding can lead to more detail in the limited space that you have available .
I challenge you to come up with a general purpose system for encoding images into 140 character Twitter messages , and decoding them into an image again .
You can use Unicode characters , so you get more than 8 bits per character .
Even allowing for Unicode characters , however , you will need to compress images into a very small amount of space ; this will certainly be a lossy compression , and so there will have to be subjective judgements about how good each result looks .
Here is the result that the original author , Quasimondo , got from his encoding ( image is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial license ) :
Can you do better ?
Rules
Your program must have two modes : encoding and decoding .
When encoding : Your program must take as input a graphic in any reasonable raster graphic format of your choice .
We 'll say that any raster format supported by ImageMagick counts as reasonable .
Your program must output a message which can be represented in 140 or fewer Unicode code points ; 140 code points in the range U+0000 – U+10 FFFF , excluding non-characters ( U+FFFE , U+FFFF , U+ n FFFE , U+ n FFFF where n is 1 – 10 hexadecimal , and the range U+FDD0 – U+FDEF ) and surrogate code points ( U+D800 – U+DFFF ) .
It may be output in any reasonable encoding of your choice ; any encoding supported by GNU iconv will be considered reasonable , and your platform native encoding or locale encoding would likely be a good choice .
See Unicode notes below for more details .
When decoding : Your program should take as input the output of your encoding mode .
Your program must output an image in any reasonable format of your choice , as defined above , though for output vector formats are OK as well .
The image output should be an approximation of the input image ; the closer you can get to the input image , the better .
The decoding process may have no access to any other output of the encoding process other than the output specified above ; that is , you can't upload the image somewhere and output the URL for the decoding process to download , or anything silly like that .
For the sake of consistency in user interface , your program must behave as follows :
Your program must be a script that can be set to executable on a platform with the appropriate interpreter , or a program that can be compiled into an executable .
Your program must take as its first argument either encode or decode to set the mode .
Your program must take input in one or more of the following ways ( if you implement the one that takes file names , you may also read and write from stdin and stdout if file names are missing ) :
Take input from standard in and produce output on standard out .
my - program encode < input.png > output.
txt my - program decode < output.
txt >output.png
Take input from a file named in the second argument , and produce output in the file named in the third .
my - program encode input.png output .
txt my - program decode output.
txt output.png
For your solution , please post :
Your code , in full , and / or a link to it hosted elsewhere ( if it 's very long , or requires many files to compile , or something ) .
An explanation of how it works , if it 's not immediately obvious from the code or if the code is long and people will be interested in a summary .
An example image , with the original image , the text it compresses down to , and the decoded image .
If you are building on an idea that someone else had , please attribute them .
It 's OK to try to do a refinement of someone else 's idea , but you must attribute them .
Guidelines
These are basically rules that may be broken , suggestions , or scoring criteria :
Aesthetics are important .
I 'll be judging , and suggest that other people judge , based on : How good the output image looks , and how much it looks like the original .
How nice the text looks .
Completely random gobbledigook is OK if you have a really clever compression scheme , but I also want to see answers that turn images into mutli-lingual poems , or something clever like that .
Note that the author of the original solution decided to use only Chinese characters , since it looked nicer that way .
Interesting code and clever algorithms are always good .
I like short , to the point , and clear code , but really clever complicated algorithms are OK too as long as they produce good results .
Speed is also important , though not as important as how good a job compressing the image you do .
I 'd rather have a program that can convert an image in a tenth of a second than something that will be running genetic algorithms for days on end .
I will prefer shorter solutions to longer ones , as long as they are reasonably comparable in quality ; conciseness is a virtue .
Your program should be implemented in a language that has a freely - available implementation on Mac OS X , Linux , or Windows .
I 'd like to be able to run the programs , but if you have a great solution that only runs under MATLAB or something , that 's fine .
Your program should be as general as possible ; it should work for as many different images as possible , though some may produce better results than others .
In particular : Having a few images built into the program that it matches and writes a reference to , and then produces the matching image upon decoding , is fairly lame and will only cover a few images .
A program that can take images of simple , flat , geometric shapes and decompose them into some vector primitive is pretty nifty , but if it fails on images beyond a certain complexity it is probably insufficiently general .
A program that can only take images of a particular fixed aspect ratio but does a good job with them would also be OK , but not ideal .
You may find that a black and white image can get more information into a smaller space than a color image .
On the other hand , that may limit the types of image it 's applicable to ; faces come out fine in black and white , but abstract designs may not fare so well .
It is perfectly fine if the output image is smaller than the input , while being roughly the same proportion .
It 's OK if you have to scale the image up to compare it to the original ; what 's important is how it looks .
Your program should produce output that could actually go through Twitter and come out unscathed .
This is only a guideline rather than a rule , since I could n't find any documentation on the precise set of characters supported , but you should probably avoid control characters , funky invisible combining characters , private use characters , and the like .
Scoring rubric
As a general guide to how I will be ranking solutions when choosing my accepted solution , lets say that I 'll probably be evaluating solutions on a 25 point scale ( this is very rough , and I wo n't be scoring anything directly , just using this as a basic guideline ) :
15 points for how well the encoding scheme reproduces a wide range of input images .
This is a subjective , aesthetic judgement 0 means that it does n't work at all , it gives the same image back every time , or something 5 means that it can encode a few images , though the decoded version looks ugly and it may not work at all on more complicated images 10 means that it works on a wide range of images , and produces pleasant looking images which may occasionally be distinguishable 15 means that it produces perfect replicas of some images , and even for larger and more complex images , gives something that is recognizable .
Or , perhaps it does not make images that are quite recognizable , but produces beautiful images that are clearly derived from the original .
for how well the encoding scheme reproduces a wide range of input images .
This is a subjective , aesthetic judgement 3 points for clever use of the Unicode character set 0 points for simply using the entire set of allowed characters 1 point for using a limited set of characters that are safe for transfer over Twitter or in a wider variety of situations 2 points for using a thematic subset of characters , such as only Han ideographs or only right - to - left characters 3 points for doing something really neat , like generating readable text or using characters that look like the image in question
for clever use of the Unicode character set 3 points for clever algorithmic approaches and code style 0 points for something that is 1000 lines of code only to scale the image down , treat it as 1 bit per pixel , and base64 encode that 1 point for something that uses a standard encoding technique and is well written and brief 2 points for something that introduces a relatively novel encoding technique , or that is surprisingly short and clean 3 points for a one liner that actually produces good results , or something that breaks new ground in graphics encoding ( if this seems like a low number of points for breaking new ground , remember that a result this good will likely have a high score for aesthetics as well )
for clever algorithmic approaches and code style 2 points for speed .
All else being equal , faster is better , but the above criteria are all more important than speed
for speed .
All else being equal , faster is better , but the above criteria are all more important than speed 1 point for running on free ( open source ) software , because I prefer free software ( note that C# will still be eligible for this point as long as it runs on Mono , likewise MATLAB code would be eligible if it runs on GNU Octave )
for running on free ( open source ) software , because I prefer free software ( note that C# will still be eligible for this point as long as it runs on Mono , likewise MATLAB code would be eligible if it runs on GNU Octave ) 1 point for actually following all of the rules .
These rules have gotten a bit big and complicated , so I 'll probably accept otherwise good answers that get one small detail wrong , but I will give an extra point to any solution that does actually follow all of the rules
Reference images
Some folks have asked for some reference images .
Here are a few reference images that you can try ; smaller versions are embedded here , they all link to larger versions of the image if you need those :
Prize
I am offering a 500 rep bounty ( plus the 50 that StackOverflow kicks in ) for the solution that I like the best , based on the above criteria .
Of course , I encourage everyone else to vote on their favorite solutions here as well .
Note on deadline
This contest will run until the bounty runs out , about 6 PM on Saturday , May 30 .
I can't say the precise time it will end ; it may be anywhere from 5 to 7 PM .
I will guarantee that I 'll look at all entries submitted by 2 PM , and I will do my best to look at all entries submitted by 4 PM ; if solutions are submitted after that , I may not have a chance to give them a fair look before I have to make my decision .
Also , the earlier you submit , the more chance you will have for voting to be able to help me pick the best solution , so try and submit earlier rather than right at the deadline .
Unicode notes
There has also been some confusion on exactly what Unicode characters are allowed .
The range of possible Unicode code points is U+0000 to U+10 FFFF .
There are some code points which are never valid to use as Unicode characters in any open interchange of data ; these are the noncharacters and the surrogate code points .
Noncharacters are defined in the Unidode Standard 5.1.0 section 16.7 as the values U+FFFE , U+FFFF , U+ n FFFE , U+ n FFFF where n is 1 – 10 hexadecimal , and the range U+FDD0 – U+FDEF .
These values are intended to be used for application - specific internal usage , and conforming applications may strip these characters out of text processed by them .
Surrogate code points , defined in the Unicode Standard 5.1.0 section 3.8 as U+D800 – U+DFFF , are used for encoding characters beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane in UTF - 16 ; thus , it is impossible to represent these code points directly in the UTF - 16 encoding , and it is invalid to encode them in any other encoding .
Thus , for the purpose of this contest , I will allow any program which encodes images into a sequence of no more than 140 Unicode code points from the range U+0000 – U+10 FFFF , excluding all noncharacters and surrogate pairs as defined above .
I will prefer solutions that use only assigned characters , and even better ones that use clever subsets of assigned characters or do something interesting with the character set they use .
For a list of assigned characters , see the Unicode Character Database ; note that some characters are listed directly , while some are listed only as the start and end of a range .
Also note that surrogate code points are listed in the database , but forbidden as mentioned above .
If you would like to take advantage of certain properties of characters for making the text you output more interesting , there are a variety of databases of character information available , such as a list of named code blocks and various character properties .
Since Twitter does not specify the exact character set they support , I will be lenient about solutions which do not actually work with Twitter because certain characters count extra or certain characters are stripped .
It is preferred but not required that all encoded outputs should be able to be transferred unharmed via Twitter or another microblogging service such as identi.ca .
I have seen some documentation stating that Twitter entity - encodes < , > , and & , and thus counts those as 4 , 4 , and 5 characters respectively , but I have not tested that out myself , and their JavaScript character counter does n't seem to count them that way .

Google I / O 2009 レポート
開発チームが明かす 、Google Waveの実装概要
グーグルが発表した新しいコミュニケーションプラットフォームの「
Google Wave」が大きな反響を呼んでいる。技術的な詳細がかなり明らかにされているので、何が可能かはだいたい予想ができそうだが（だからこそ発表時に会場を埋めていた4000人あまりの聴衆は興奮のあまり立ち上がって喝采を送ったのだが）、誰も想像できなかったようなキラーアプリケーションが登場するのかどうか、あるいはWave自体がキラーアプリケーションなのか、それはまだ誰にも分からない。
レポート記事（【詳報 】Google Waveとは何なのか？）への反響を見ると、さまざまな疑問を感じている人がいる。そこでここでは、直接Waveのプロジェクトリーダーに話を聞いたり、別セッションで開発チームが行った説明、およびオンラインドキュメントから読み取れたことなど、いくつか追加情報をまとめたい。ちなみに、Google I/Oの参加者にはWaveアカウントが発行されることになっているが、これを書いているいま、まだ案内は届いていない。
Wave はリアルタイム／同期通信だけか？
まず、 「リアルタイム」という点。ミリ秒単位の遅延しか感じられないチャットやゲームをHTMLページで行うというデモンストレーションに驚かされたために、レポート記事ではこの点を強調しすぎたようだ。Waveが「リアルタイム通信、同期通信だけのもの」という印象を受けた人もいた。それは誤解だ。
Wave ではメール同様の非同期通信も可能だ。つまり、あなたが新規にWaveを作り、誰かに宛てたWave（メッセージ）を書けば、それはまずサーバに送られる。受信側（Wave参加者）は、その時点でオンラインでもオフラインでも構わない。オンラインであれば、すぐにそのWaveを開いて読むことができるが、オフラインであれば、メールのインボックスのように（おそらく最終更新時刻の時間順で）、自分が関与しているWave一覧が表示される。非同期のメッセージ交換が可能だからこそ、「今度の映画、何を見る？」というような投票を複数人の間で行える。同期通信だけであれば、とてもではないが投票は使い物にならない。
Wave はグーグルだけのサービスになるのか？
Wave プロジェクトの創始者でプロジェクトリーダーのラース・ラスムセン（Lars Rasmussen）氏
Wave を見て、私はも うSMTPは不要ではないかと思った。それで、「 Wave はSMTPやIMAPを置き換えるプロトコルになると考えているか」とWaveプロジェクトの創始者、ラース・ラスムセン氏に聞いてみた。それまで陽気に応対してくれていたラスムセン氏だが、この質問には肩をすくめて渋い顔をしたまま、「それは分からない」とだけ答えた。つまらない答えだが、聞いた私が軽率で、答えたラスムセン氏が慎重だっただけだろう。どう見てもWaveはSMTPやIMAP/POPを置き換えるポテンシャルを持っているし、それ以上の何物かだ。メールシステムを作り直すとしたらどうやるかという問題意識でスタートしたと語っているのだから、質問自体がおかしかった。
質問はこうあるべきだった 。「 Wave がSMTPよりいいのは自明だ。では、SMTPを置き換えるような大きなシフトが起こるために必要なことは何だろうか？」。残念ながら、短時間のインタビューではそれを聞きそびれたが、私なりに考えたことをまとめたい。
Wave が広く普及するかどうかのカギの1つは、グーグル以外の大手ISPなどがWaveサービスを立ち上げるかにかかっているだろう。遅延を最小限に抑える最適化を徹底しているとはいえ、ネットワークの遅延という壁はソフトウェア技術だけでは越えられない。光の速度は結構速く、太平洋を往復しても60msしかかからない。人間が電話で遅延を面倒に感じるのは300msと言われてるので、実はたいしたことはない（だから国際電話もSkypeもオッケーなわけだが）。問題は経由するスイッチの数、ホップ数だ。
そう考えると 、Waveサーバは多ければ多いほどよく、メジャーなISPがすべてWaveサーバを持つのが理想だろう。政治的、業界バランス的にいってもグーグルしかWaveサーバを立てないとしたら成功はおぼつかないだろう。
もう1つ、Waveが広まるのに欠かせないのは、HTML
5対応ブラウザの普及だ。クライアント側のWaveでオフライン編集機能を使うには、HTML
5のアプリケーションキャッシュ、ローカルストレージの機能が欠かせない。Waveでは手元の端末にあるファイルを操作して、その差分をオンラインになった時点でサーバに送り付ける形になる。こうしたことは、HTML 5だからこそできることだ。
SMTPが置き換わることなどあり得ないと思う人もいるかもしれない。なぜなら、こうしたシステムでは、全員と言わないまでも多数の人が移行しないと意味がない場合が多いからだ。しかし、メールプロキシのボットがあればどうだろうか。もしあなたがWaveを気に入れば、あなたはWaveをメール、ブログおよびコメント、Twitterなどのアグリゲータとして使えるかもしれない。Wave側からポストすることもできるだろう。つまり、利用者が少ないから利用価値が上がらず、利用価値がないから利用者が増えないという、いわゆる「ニワトリとタマゴの問題」が起こらないシナリオも考えられる。
もう1つ、レポート記事の初出時に私が誤解していたことがある。既存のブログサービスなどをWave対応とするのに特別に何かを実装する必要があるかのように書いたが、これは誤りだった。WaveはWebページへの埋め込み用のAPIを最初から用意しているため、既存WebページでのWave対応は簡単だ。
となると 、Waveは一種のCMSとしても機能する。自分のWebサイトをWave対応としてしまえば、テキストの書き換えや追加（つまりブログエントリの投稿のようなこと）は、Wave経由でできることになる。この使い方であれば、たった1人であってもWaveを使い始めるメリットがある。
Wave という名前が暗示するように
、Waveが徐々にインターネットに波のように広がっていく可能性は十分にあるだろう。
文字は全部見えちゃうの？
リアルタイムということに絡んで、もう1つ、レポート記事で書かなかったために招いた誤解がある。タイプ中の文字が全部見えるのは気味が悪い、という指摘だ。
これはもっともな指摘で、メールやIMでタイプするときには、バックスペースキーを叩いて行きつ戻りつするのが普通だろう。いちいち全部見えたのでは困ることも多い。
この点について、ラスムセン氏は講演の中で言及していた。タイプ中の文字をすべて出すのをデフォルトとしているが、どうもそれはやりすぎで、それがいいのかどうか分からないという話だ。Waveは早期プレビュー版なので、この辺のモデルはいくらでも変わりうる。完全リアルタイム、準リアルタイム（リターンキーをトリガーにしてサーバと通信するなど）と、モードを分けるのがいいかもしれない。逆にモードの概念を導入するのは、いたずらに複雑さを増すだけだという議論もあり得るだろう。
もう1つ、メッセージが全部見えてしまうのかという点。レポート記事では書き漏らしたが、同じWave上にいる参加者の中で、特定の誰かとだけプライベートな会話をすることもできる。アーキテクチャ上はWaveの中にWaveletと呼ぶ会話スレッドの管理単位があって、Wavelet単位で参加者の読み書きのパーミッションを管理することになるようだ。
Wave のデータモデル。 各Wave に はWaveletと呼ぶ会話スレッドが含まれていて、そのそれぞれの参加者が紐付いている。このため、同一Wave上でもプライベートメッセージのやり取りなどは可能
サーバはどうなってるの？
Wave は 「 マッシュアップ」的に見える。Waveのプレゼンテーションが始まってからしばらくは、会場にいた聴衆の間には「これのどこがすごいんだ？」という白けた空気が漂っていたのではないかと思う。少なくとも私はそうだった。これから大きな発表があるのだとか、これからお見せするデモンストレーションがすべてHTMLページだということを決して忘れないでくださいなどとバイス・プレジデントが大げさに言うので期待したのに、「なんだマッシュアップ？
プロダクティビティ・コラボレーション・ライブ・リアルタイム・タイムライン・ウィキ・スイート、えっと何それ？」という軽い落胆だ。
しかし、デモンストレーションが進むにつれて、だんだんWaveのインフラや設計がよく練られていることに、否応なく誰もが気付かされた。
さらに 、Waveの内部アーキテクチャがどうなっているかを概説するセッションに参加して、私はそれが単なる既存ソフトウェアモジュールの寄せ集めやマッシュアップと呼べるようなものではないことを、ようやく理解した。
Google App Engine は 「 Jetty 」というライトウェイトなOSSのHTTPサーバ、アプリケーションサーバを使っている。てっきり私はWaveもそうなのかと思ったのだが、ラスムセン氏に聞いたところ、Waveのサーバは完全にスクラッチから書き起こしたものだという。デモンストレーションでApp Engineで動いていたのはボットだけだった。
考えてみれば 、WaveサーバはHTTPサーバというだけでなく、ほかのWaveサーバと接続するためにXMPPもしゃべらなくてはいけないし、何より、Waveオブジェクトを多人数編集環境でバージョン管理するために最適化されていないければならない。Cometを使うと同時接続数が多くなるので、スケーラビリティの確保も大きな技術的チャレンジだ。ラスムセン氏に聞いたところ、例えばWaveサーバでは独自にノンブロッキングI/Oを実装していて、同時接続数が増えたときにも遅延なくWaveオブジェクトの読み書きができるようにしているという。ミリ秒単位でリアルタイム性を追求しようと思ったら、Apacheなど既存HTTPサーバ向けにWaveモジュールを書くのではなく、フルスクラッチで書く必要があったというのは道理だ。
ナイーブな実装ではスケールせず、ドキュメントが壊れる可能性も
同時編集環境におけるバージョン管理も、マッシュアップというような簡単な問題ではない。予測できない時間間隔を置いて接続、切断を繰り返す複数のクライアント・サーバ間で、同一オブジェクトに対して編集を行うのは、単純な話ではない。Waveを発表した午前の基調講演に続いて行われた午後のセッション「
Google Wave :
Under the hood 」 で開発チームメンバーが 、Wave を支える実装の概要について説明を行った。
冒頭で 、Wave開発チームの1人、アレックス・マー氏はまず、「ABCDE」という文字列をクライアント側、サーバ側（多くの場合、実際にはもう1つ別のクライアントだろう）でそれぞれ編集する例を挙げた。ナイーブな実装（深く考えずに素朴に問題に当たるという意味）だと、クライアント側とサーバ側で結果が「ACE」と一致すべきところ、編集タイミングの問題で一方が「ACE」、他方が「 ACD」と食い違うことになりかねない。なぜなら、「n文字目を消去する」という操作では、操作対象が変化する前と後とでnの値が変わらなければならないからだ（下図参照）。
ナイーブな実装だと、リアルタイム共同編集では簡単に不整合が起こる
正しく動作させるには、サーバ側に送られた操作を適宜変換する必要がある
つまり、あるクライアント で「 ABCDE 」 の「 D」（4文字目）を消すという操作は、サーバ上では必ずしも同じ操作となるわけではないということだ。ほかのクライアントから受け入れた操作によって「ABCDE」の状態が「 ACDE」に変わっている可能性がある。もし「D」を消すつもりで4文字目を消すと「ACD」となってしまう。こうした矛盾が起こらないようにするため、Waveでは各操作を変換する「オペレーション変換」を実装しているという。
サーバ側の状態、クライアント側の状態は時間とともに変化する。このため、オフライン状態が長時間続いて一連の操作がサーバ・クライアントの双方で蓄積していくと、サーバ側で必要となる操作変換の計算量は、サーバ側の操作の数をn、クライアント側の操作の数をmとすると、n×mのオーダーで増えていってしまう。これでは処理時間が掛かりすぎて、リアルタイム性を確保できない。
このた めWaveでは、任意の2つの操作を1つの操作に合成する合成関数を実装したという。例えばユーザーが長期間ログインせず、複数の操作履歴が蓄積している場合でも、クライアント側に送る操作の数は、合成後の操作だけで済むことになる。参加者の数が多くなった場合、他ユーザーがサーバに送る操作もまとめて受け取ることができるだろう。
クライアント側とサーバ側の双方で編集作業をすると、それぞれでバージョンが進んでいく
こ の2つの操作の行 う「 Operation Composer」（操作合成器）は、関数型プログラミング言語にあるzip系の関数のように働くという。任意の2本の操作ストリームをこの合成器に流し込むと、合成後の1本の操作ストリームが出てくる。この合成器、操作ストリーミングというモデルは、マルチコアCPU環境、あるいはデータセンターで非常によくスケールしそうだ。
合成を行う合成器は2つの操作ストリームを入力とし、1本の操作ストリームとして吐き出す
2段階の編集履歴を1つの操作にまとめる例。オレンジが要素の削除、グリーンが追加を表している。この例では合成の結果、「K」が省略されているのが分かる
も う1つ、操作の合成に関して興味深いのは編集履歴の蓄積から任意のバージョンを引き出すときに最小限の計算量で済ませるために、「 Composition tree」（合成ツリー）と呼ぶデータ構造を採用したという話だ。
合成ツリーのデータ構造。任意のバージョン間の変換は、log(n)回の処理で完了する
上図の「 Op4、Op5、Op6、、、」とあるのは1つ1つの操作に対応する。一連の操作は編集履歴だ。こうした履歴があるときに、例えばOp3の状態からOp14の状態に移行するには、素朴にやると11個の操作を適用する必要がある。事前に合成しておけばよさそうなものだが、すべての状態の組み合わせで合成後の操作を保持するのは計算量でもメモリ効率の点でも非現実的だ。
そこでノード当たり2つの子ノードを持つツリーを構成し、n個の操作適用処理が必要な場面で、O(n)ではなくO(log(n ) )の計算量で済むように工夫しているという。上図の例だと、Op3からOp14へは、
「 Op5〜Op8 」を合成した操 作
「 Op9〜Op12」を合成した操 作
「 Op13、Op14」を合成した操 作
という3つの操作で済ませることできる（これらの操作は事前に合成しておくのだろうが、合成後のデータ量もlog(n)で済む）。13個の操作が3個になると聞いてもピンと来ないかもしれないが、1万個の操作が13個、10万個の操作が16個で済むといえば、効率のいいデータ構造とアルゴリズムを考えることの重要さが分かるだろう。
クライアント・サーバ間 のWaveプロトコルで、もう1つ興味深いのは、クライアントから操作（差分）を送るときにサーバから明示的に送信許可（ACK）を受け取る必要があるということだ。クライアントがサーバに連続して操作を送れるのは1度に1つに制限しているという。サーバは送られてきた操作を、確実にサーバ上のドキュメントに適用してから、次の差分をクライアントから受け取るようにする。こうすることで、サーバは単一の状態を保持しておくだけで済む。もし、こうしたACKのやり取りがなければ、サーバ上には、各サーバ・クライアントのペアについて、それぞれでドキュメントの状態を保持する必要があるうえに、状態を管理するアルゴリズムも複雑になってしまうのだという。
ただし、クライアントは操作を送り出してからACKを待つものの、ユーザー自身は待つ必要はない。ユーザーがタイプするキー操作など各種操作はローカルにキャッシュされ、サーバからACKが来るとそれらの操作をまとめて送るからだ。
操作の合成や合成器、合成ツリーなどは、おそらくどれも「真っ当なエンジニアリング」というべきもので、グーグルにしかできないことだとは思わない。実際、「 Operational Transformation」という研究分野には10年以上の蓄積があり、グーグルが参考文献に上げているXeroxの論文は1995年のものだ（論文のPSファイル）。
ただ、こうした1つ1つでヘマをしないこと、また、一般的に知られているアルゴリズムやフレームワークであっても、それを現実の問題に適用して最適化していること、その積み重ねがWaveの驚くべきリアルタイム性に結実しているのは間違いないだろう。O(log(n ))で済むアルゴリズムが存在しているのに、O(n)
やO(n^2)といった、非常にまずい実装のために、不必要に「重たい」アプリケーションというのは世の中にあふれている。例えば、メールボックスなどに対する操作などでデータ量が増えるにつれて、1分とか2分、あるいは耐えきれないほど延々と待たされた経験はないだろうか。本当は1秒で済むアルゴリズムが存在していることをプラグラマが知らない、あるいは思いつかないだけということはあり得る。グーグルの凄みは、マッシュアップ的に見えるWaveのようなWebアプリケーションでも、その内部の最適化を徹底していること、あるいは徹底できる人材を集めていることだ。
最適化という意味では、一見Waveとは関係がないように見えるWebブラウザのGoogle Chromeも無関係ではない。Chromeに搭載されているJavaScriptエンジン「V8」のチームでは現在、DOM関連の操作の高速化を模索しているという。これは、innerHTMLなどでHTMLツリーにノードを追加するような処理、つまりまさにWaveクライアントがやっているようなダイナミックにHTMLページを書き換えるような処理に対する高速化を意味する。V8チームのマッズ・エイジャー（Mads Ager）氏の説明によれば、V8ではガベージコレクション（使用済みメモリの回収）に「世代別ガベージコレクタ」を採用していて、ほとんどのサイクルは1、2ミリ秒で終わるという。Webブラウザに限らず、ガベージコレクションは一般的にアプリケーションが一瞬固まるようなユーザー体験につながる。普通のWebサイトを見ているような場合は問題にならないが、Waveのようなリアルタイム性の高いアプリケーションではユーザー体験を大きく左右するだろう。
いずれにしても、履歴付き構造化ドキュメントというオブジェクトを同期／非同期環境で複数人で共有し、それをWebブラウザ越しにリアルタイムで同時編集する環境を提供する、というのは決して単純な話ではない。これまでにもオンライン共同編集ツールやCometを使ったリアルタイムコミュニケーションツールはあったが、リアルタイムに1文字単位、しかもドキュメントのどこにでも変更が加えられるというものはなかった。
Google Docsは、実はリアルタイム性がそれほど高くなく、相手の打った文字が見えるまでに何秒か掛かる。Gtalkはリアルタイム性は高いが、互いのメッセージを書き換えることはできないし、追記のみだから、Waveに比べればだいぶ単純だ。Google Spreadsheetsでもセルごとに排他ロックをかけて、同じ場所を複数人が同時に編集できないように制限している。同時編集に付きまとうコンフリクトという難しい問題を回避するためだろう。
2007 年初頭にスタートしたというWaveプロジェクトは当初5人のチームだったが、現在は約50人にまで膨らんでいるという（プロジェクトリーダーを含め、そのほとんどはオーストラリアのグーグル社員だそうだ）。年内にもエンドユーザー向けサービスが開始するというGoogle Wave。どんなユーザーインターフェイスで登場するのか、実際のインターネット環境でどれぐらいリアルタイム性とスケーラビリティを持つことになるのか、いまからその登場が楽しみだ。

Not content to root only for the failure of President Obama , on his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh declared America a failure because Obama is succeeding .
Rush said , “ Ladies and gentleman this country is failing because Obama is succeeding . ”
Rush claimed that the economy is hopeless , and that we are all doomed .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Rush said , “ Ladies and gentleman this country is failing because Obama is succeeding .
I do n’t care how you choose to measure it .
There is no hope on the horizon for a job .
There is no hope on the horizon for renewed prosperity .
There is no hope on the horizon for economic growth … President Obama ’s policies will not fail in one regard .
They will not fail in impoverishing and enslaving more and more Americans the longer his policies succeed . ”
Limbaugh went on to blame Obama for unemployment , home foreclosures , the auto industry , Wall Street , and the bankruptcy of the state of California .
Rush also claimed that he was misquoted , “ This is the exact kind of success I wanted to fail and everybody who heard me knew exactly what I meant .
It is being used by people on our side of the aisle who are scared to death of conservatives .
It is being used by them to say that I am driving moderates away .
It is being used by people on the left to say that I want America to fail , when everybody in their brain knows exactly what I meant . ”
Obviously , Rush has decided that the economy was just fine before Obama took office .
He is ignoring the fact that the recession started in December 2007 .
The National Association for Business Economics released a survey yesterday that projected that the recession will end in the second half of this year .
The recession grew under the Republicans , but Rush is deeming Obama a failure for not fixing it in 3 months .
NABE President Chris Varvares said , “ While the overall tone remains soft , there are emerging signs that the economy is stabilizing .
The survey found that business economists look for the recession to end soon , but that the economic recovery is likely to be considerably more moderate than those typically experienced following steep declines . ”
Things are n’t going to be easy , but they are getting better at a slow pace .
This is just one of many projections that say that the economy is stabilizing , but that recovery is going to be slow .
Blaming Obama for the decades long problems in the state of California and the auto industry is insane .
Blaming Obama for stock markets that are up is delusional .
Limbaugh ’s cheering against his own country has grown tiresome .
He is this close to going down the Bachmann path , by encouraging armed revolution against Obama .
As you may already know , there will be nationwide protests on April 15th , Tax Day , to protest spending and tax hikes by the Obama Administration .
These protests , referred to as Tea Parties , have taken place nearly every week since Friday , February 27th ( yours truly attended the Atlanta Tea Party and was interviewed by Neil Cavuto on Fox News about the events ) and have been gaining notoriety and slowly more people are attending .
The protest here in Atlanta had around 300 people , not bad for a cold , rainy day .
Other cities have seen as many as a few thousand people show up .
These protests serve do a purpose , despite what pseudo - libertarian talk show host , Neal Boortz , says or believes .
They show that everyday Americans want less spending , less government and personal responsibility .
However , they are at risk of being co-opted by Republicans who either stood silently or only gave passive criticism to the spending spree of George W. Bush .
Republicans do not realize the serious credibility problems they have when it comes to criticizing the economic policies of Barck Obama .
According to a recent study from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University , George W. Bush was the biggest spender in the last 30 years .
The table to the right shows the massive increases in non-defense discretionary spending .
Sean Hannity , who will be attending the Atlanta Tea Party on April 15th , says he has criticized Republicans on spending .
He has been more vocal of late about Republicans getting back to the supposed small government roots , but even he was only passive while the gross expansion of government was taking place .
Newt Gingrich and his group , American Solutions , recently announced that they were endorsing and supporting the protests .
Gingrich has supported and lobbied for a $ 9 trillion expansion of Medicare and more recently , the Trouble Asset Relief Program ( TARP or Wall Street bailout ) , which has resulted in trillions of taxpayers dollar being put at risk by a completely incompetent government .
This is exactly the sort of spending that these protests are against .
An argument can also be made , after reading Buck Wild : How Republicans Broke the Bank and Became the Party of Big Government , that Republicans began to lose whatever principles they claimed to have while Gingrich was Speaker of the House , something can be verified by the table above by looking at the growth in spending in the second term of Bill Clinton .
The involvement of politically polarizing figures will ruin and destroy the credibility of a good movement .
Accusations of astroturfing surfaced immediately after the events on February 27th .
This makes those accusations have substance .
Despite all this , concerned taxpayers should show up to these events to voice their disapproval at these economic policies that have lead us down an unsustainable path .
There are several of these protests lined up on April 15th across Georgia .
You can find a list here .

And then there ’s Rush Limbaugh .
His rants today are n’t very different from his rants in 1993 .
But he occupies a different position in the scheme of things .
Remember , during the Bush years Mr. Limbaugh became very much a political insider .
Indeed , according to a recent Gallup survey , 10 percent of Republicans now consider him the “ main person who speaks for the Republican Party today , ” putting him in a three - way tie with Dick Cheney and Newt Gingrich .
So when Mr. Limbaugh peddles conspiracy theories  suggesting , for example , that fears over swine flu were being hyped “ to get people to respond to government orders ”  that ’s a case of the conservative media establishment joining hands with the lunatic fringe .
It ’s not surprising , then , that politicians are doing the same thing .
The R.N.C. says that “ the Democratic Party is dedicated to restructuring American society along socialist ideals . ”
And when Jon Voight , the actor , told the audience at a Republican fund - raiser this week that the president is a “ false prophet ” and that “ we and we alone are the right frame of mind to free this nation from this Obama oppression , ” Mitch McConnell , the Senate minority leader , thanked him , saying that he “ really enjoyed ” the remarks .
Credit where credit is due .
Some figures in the conservative media have refused to go along with the big hate  people like Fox ’s Shepard Smith and Catherine Herridge , who debunked the attacks on that Homeland Security report two months ago .
But this does n’t change the broad picture , which is that supposedly respectable news organizations and political figures are giving aid and comfort to dangerous extremism .
What will the consequences be ?
Nobody knows , of course , although the analysts at Homeland Security fretted that things may turn out even worse than in the 1990s  that thanks , in part , to the election of an African - American president , “ the threat posed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years . ”
And that ’s a threat to take seriously .
Yes , the worst terrorist attack in our history was perpetrated by a foreign conspiracy .
But the second worst , the Oklahoma City bombing , was perpetrated by an all - American lunatic .
Politicians and media organizations wind up such people at their , and our , peril .
Liquid flea and tick treatments for dogs and cats have been on the market for more than a decade .
But following a recent increase in reports of adverse reactions among pets , the Environmental Protection Agency has intensified its scrutiny of the products , warning pet owners that the treatments may have serious , even fatal , side effects .
Spot - on flea and tick treatments are applied topically , usually between the animal ’s shoulder blades or along the spine .
There have been no recalls of the products , and the agency said in May that there is no reason to avoid them .
But the E.P.A. is investigating a large number of anecdotal reports involving both cats and dogs who received spot - on treatments and suffered problems like skin irritations , hair loss and tremors , according to agency spokesman Dale Kemery .
The initial reports were not verified by veterinarians .
The agency now is evaluating all available data on the pesticides , including reports of adverse reactions , the clarity of the directions and label warnings , and the pre-market safety data submitted in support of the products .

On this quiet Friday afternoon before the May Day bank holiday , I 've found myself musing on what exactly is meant by " meme " .
That 's because a link is circulating to a rather wonderful chart / website / mashup , which chronicles internet memes .
The timeline on the chart runs from 1976 right up to today , and it lists all kinds of web crazes , fads and phenomena .
So in 1993 there is the Cambridge University computer laboratory coffee - pot , supposedly the inspiration for the first webcam .
( By the way , I was disappointed when visting the lab recently at its new site to be told that the coffee - pot had been sold on eBay some years before . )
Spool to 1997 and there 's the chess match between Gary Kasparov and the IBM Big Blue computer - which , according to the chart , was the biggest web event to date .
1999 brings the Blair Witch Project , described as a " breakthrough use of the web to promote a low - budget indie thriller " .
It 's illustrated with a YouTube clip - but the video - sharing service was n't born until 2005 , which set me wondering just how we used to share video online a decade ago .
More recently , there 's an entry on " I Can Has Cheezburger ? " ( ICHC for short ) and lolcats , a web phenomenon that I have never understood .
And after reading that " ICHC was instrumental in bringing animal - based image macros and lolspeak into mainstream usage " I am really none the wiser .
And coming right up to date , the most recent meme listed on the chart is Susan Boyle 's audition on Britain 's Got Talent which , as the world surely knows , became a huge hit on YouTube .
But after enjoying clicking my way along the timeline , I 'm not entirely clear how the entries were chosen - or what we mean by a meme .
How does it differ , for instance from a " viral " , as in " viral video " ?
You may remember a few weeks back we had a discussion here about the Today Programme 's viral video - and whether it was the genuine article .
In fact , the very first entry on the internet memes chart is meme , linked to the publication of Richard Dawkins " The Selfish Gene " and there is this Wikipedia definition :
" The word ' meme ' is a neologism coined in 1976 by Richard Dawkins occuring in ' The Selfish Gene ' to describe how one might extend Darwinian principles to explain the spread of cultural phenomena .
He gave as examples melodies , catch - phrases , beliefs ( notably religious belief , clothing / fashion , and the technology of building arches ) . "
Some people have told me there is clear difference - a viral is something that is deliberately spread , a meme is an almost biological phenomenon , that just spreads by itself .
But that seems to take us back to the viral video argument , where some people were adamant that anything that was promoted by the mainstream media could not be deemed truly viral .
What is clear is that the web is making some ideas - serious and trivial - spread around the globe at an ever faster pace .
If the world 's online population , in its collective wisdom , decides something is important , we will all know about it pretty quickly .
As anyone who has been online this week will know , fears , facts and fantasies can make their way from Mexico to Manchester faster than a flu virus .
Whatever we mean by meme , the internet is a democratising force for ideas .
Though , as the internet memes chart shows , an awful lot of those ideas are plain daft .
The Senate approved a former technology executive , Julius Genachowski , on Thursday as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission .
Senators also approved Robert M. McDowell to serve a second term on the commission , which regulates telephone , cable and broadcast companies .
Both nominees were confirmed by unanimous consent .
The White House said it had sent to the Senate the nominations of Meredith Attwell Baker , a former telecommunications official , and Mignon L. Clyburn , a South Carolina regulator , to serve on the commission .
The two would bring the F.C.C. to its full complement of five members for the first time during the administration of President Obama .
In translation , Globovision 's report includes :
In La Paz this Saturday , former U.S. President and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Jimmy Carter accepted an invitation from Bolivian ruler and coca grower Evo Morales to harvest coca leaves on the Andean ruler 's rural property in the El Chapare region ( Central Bolivia ) .
" I hope that my next visit I will be able to go to El Chapare , where he ( Morales ) is going to take me to harvest coca leaves , " thus affirmed the former head of state , with the help of an interpreter , during a press conference together with the Bolivian head of state , after a private meeting at the Government Palace .
Morales , leader of the coca harvesters of Bolivia , first fielded the invitation , amidst smiles and a pleasant press statement , assuring that there has been a long friendship with the Nobel Peace Laureate , who even invited him once to harvest peanuts on his lands near Atlanta ( Georgia , Southeast U.S. ) .
...
The former U.S. head of state , already into his presentation , accepted the invitation .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) -
If it were in a position to do so , Al Qaeda would use Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons in its fight against the United States , a top leader of the group said in remarks aired on Sunday .
A video grab from an undated footage from the Internet shows Al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan Mustafa abu al - Yazid making statements from an unknown location .
REUTERS / REUTERS TV
Pakistan has been battling al Qaeda ’s Taliban allies in the Swat Valley since April after their thrust into a district 100 km ( 60 miles ) northwest of the capital raised fears the nuclear - armed country could slowly slip into militant hands .
“ God willing , the nuclear weapons will not fall into the hands of the Americans and the mujahideen would take them and use them against the Americans , ” Mustafa Abu al - Yazid , the leader of al Qaeda ’s in Afghanistan , said in an interview with Al Jazeera television .
Abu al - Yazid was responding to a question about U.S. safeguards to seize control over Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons in case Islamist fighters came close to doing so .
“ We expect that the Pakistani army would be defeated ( in Swat ) ... and that would be its end everywhere , God willing . ”
Asked about the group ’s plans , the Egyptian militant leader said : “ The strategy of the ( al Qaeda ) organisation in the coming period is the same as in the previous period : to hit the head of the snake , the head of tyranny -- the United States .
“ That can be achieved through continued work on the open fronts and also by opening new fronts in a manner that achieves the interests of Islam and Muslims and by increasing military operations that drain the enemy financially . ”
The militant leader suggested that naming a new leader for the group ’s unit in the Arabian Peninsula , Abu Basir al - Wahayshi , could revive its campaign in Saudi Arabia , the world ’s top oil exporter .
“ Our goals have been the Americans ... and the oil targets which they are stealing to gain power to strike the mujahideen and Muslims . ”
“ There was a setback in work there for reasons that there is no room to state now , but as of late , efforts have been united and there is unity around a single leader . ”
Abu al - Yazid , also known as Abu Saeed al - Masri , said al Qaeda will continue “ with large scale operations against the enemy ” -- by which he meant the United States .
“ We have demanded and we demand that all branches of al Qaeda carry out such operations , ” he said , referring to attacks against U.S. - led forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The militant leader said al Qaeda would be willing to accept a truce of about 10 years ’ duration with the United States if Washington agreed to withdraw its troops from Muslim countries and stopped backing Israel and the pro-Western governments of Muslim nations .
Asked about the whereabouts of al Qaeda ’s top leaders , he said : “ Praise God , sheikh Osama ( bin Laden ) and sheikh Ayman al - Zawahri are safe from the reach of the enemies , but we would not say where they are ; moreover , we do not know where they are , but we ’re in continuous contact with them . ”
WASHINGTON -- Washington Nationals fans may not be able to outdraw Red Sox fans at their own stadium , but they can make little nicks in Red Sox Nation .
In the best use of a Nats message board we 've ever seen , a Red Sox fan looking for good sports bars around Nationals Park to check out during a visit to D.C. for the Sox - Nats series this week was directed to a gay bar .
Ever since the Sox broke their curse by winning the World Series in 2004 , Red Sox hats have been the trendiest article of clothing since North Face jackets .
( C'mon Sox " fans , " do n't deny your bandwagoneering .
The rise in Sox hats spotted on public transportation , in sports bars and on local sidewalks increased astronomically immediately after the team 's historic come - from - behind American League Championship Series defeat of the Yankees that year , and the majority of them were shiny and new . )
With D.C. 's outpost of the Red Sox army joined by the same legions of Bostonians that torture Orioles fans at Camden Yards every year , this series has become unbearable .
One out - of - towner even had the gall to get on the Nats ' message board Sunday and ask for sports bar recommendations .
risoxfan74 : Hi Everyone , I 'm coming in this week for the Sox series .
Are there any decent sportsbars near the ballpark ?
Thanks again !
PowerBoater69 replied with a country and western nightclub that tends to draw a gay clientele .
PowerBoater69 : There 's only a beer garden next to the park , you 're better off up the street on Capitol Hill , Remingtons ( 639 Pennsylvania Ave SE ) is a NE Patriots bar so they 'll probably have a large Red Sox crowd this week .
A fat , luscious worm on the hook .
Brilliant .
PowerBoater69 went a step further , trying to steer risoxfan 74 away from the Bullpen -- while taking a shot at the way Bostonians talk .
PowerBoater69 : As a bonus this week the Bullpen will be filled with ugly women who can't dance and have grating accents .
Another person almost blew the prank with a post for PowerBoater69 .
richmindc : you are evil LOL
Another Sox fan took the bait .
professorx : I am also coming to the 3 game series for the Sox .
I think its great that other cities have bars for Sox / Pats fans .
And another Sox hater cast a second line , recommending a lesbian bar .
Angelossux :
There is a bar on 8th street , on Barracks Row , not far from the stadium , which I think all Boston fans will feel very comfortable in .
It 's called Phase 1 and is very nice .
Professorx extended an invite to all Red Sox and Nationals fans to meet for drinks before Tuesday 's game and dutifully reported back this afternoon , also trying to take a shot at a couple of Nats stars , but his face was too thick with egg .
professorx : You Nationals fans are pretty funny .
I went to Remington 's yesterday only to find out that it is a bar only for guys if you catch my drift .
I pounded my drink and got out as fast as I could .
On the way out I was fortunate enough to get Adam Dunn 's and Ryan Zimmermans autograph a they were there getting something to eat for the game .
lol ( last part is obviously false )
Good luck in the next two games .
oh and by the way Phases bar is no better
Well played , PowerBoater69 .
We doff our Red Sox caps in your direction .
BETH DITTO was livid .
Topshop , the fast - fashion chain , had approached Ms. Ditto , the outsize lead singer with the punk band Gossip , and a favorite mascot of the fashion world , to perform at its flagship store in London .
Blowups of her heart - shaped face and rotund form would be on display .
But Ms. Ditto , who happily flaunts what the British like to call her “ wobbly bits , ” was having none of it .
“ I do n’t think it ’s fair to put my face somewhere where they would never let me in there to wear their clothes , ” she complained on a blog .
If the chain hoped to capitalize on her grooviness , she wrote , why not accord her the same status it does Kate Moss , and let her create a “ big girl ” line for Topshop .

Bash Pitfalls
This page is a compilation of common mistakes made by bash users .
Each example is flawed in some way .
1. for f in $ ( ls *.mp3 )
One of the most common mistakes BASH programmers make is to write a loop like this :
for f in $ ( ls *.mp3 ) ; do # Wrong !
some command $f # Wrong !
done for f in $ ( ls ) # Wrong ! for f in `ls` # Wrong ! for f in $ ( find . - type f ) # Wrong ! for f in `find .
- type f` # Wrong ! files =( $ ( find . - type f ) ) # Wrong ! for f in $ { files [@ ] } # Wrong !
Yes , it would be great if you could just treat the output of ls or find as a list of filenames and iterate over it .
But you cannot .
This entire approach is fatally flawed , and there is no trick that can make it work .
You must use an entirely different approach .
There are at least 6 problems with this :
If a filename contains whitespace , it undergoes WordSplitting .
Assuming we have a file named
01 - Do n't Eat the Yellow Snow.mp3 in the current directory , the for loop will iterate over each word in the resulting file name : 01 , - , Don't , Eat , etc .
If a filename contains glob characters , it undergoes filename expansion ( " globbing " ) .
If ls produces any output containing a * character , the word containing it will become recognized as a pattern and substituted with a list of all filenames that match it .
If the command substitution returns multiple filenames , there is no way to tell where the first one ends and the second one begins .
Pathnames may contain any character except NUL .
Yes , this includes newlines .
The ls utility may mangle filenames .
Depending on which platform you 're on , which arguments you used ( or did n't use ) , and whether its standard output is pointing to a terminal or not , ls may randomly decide to replace certain characters in a filename with " ? " , or simply not print them at all .
Never try to parse the output of ls. ls is just plain unnecessary .
It 's an external command whose output is intended specifically to be read by a human , not parsed by a script .
The CommandSubstitution strips all trailing newline characters from its output .
That may seem desirable since ls adds a newline , but if the last filename in the list ends with a newline , `...` or $ ( ) will remove that one also .
In the ls examples , if the first filename starts with a hyphen , it may lead to pitfall # 3 .
You can't simply double - quote the substitution either :
for f in " $ ( ls *.mp3 ) " ; do # Wrong !
This causes the entire output of ls to be treated as a single word .
Instead of iterating over each file name , the loop will only execute once , assigning to f a string with all the filenames rammed together .
Nor can you simply change IFS to a newline .
Filenames can also contain newlines .
Another variation on this theme is abusing word splitting and a for loop to ( incorrectly ) read lines of a file .
For example :
IFS= $ '
' for line in $ ( cat file ) ; do ... # Wrong !
This does n't work !
Especially if those lines are filenames .
Bash ( or any other Bourne family shell ) just does n't work this way .
So , what 's the right way to do it ?
There are several ways , primarily depending on whether you need a recursive expansion or not .
If you do n't need recursion , you can use a simple glob .
Instead of ls :
for file in ./*.mp3 ; do # Better ! and ... some command " $ file " # ... always double - quote expansions !
done
POSIX shells such as Bash have the globbing feature specifically for this purpose -- to allow the shell to expand patterns into a list of matching filenames .
There is no need to interpret the results of an external utility .
Because globbing is the very last expansion step , each match of the ./*.mp3 pattern correctly expands to a separate word , and is n't subject to the effects of an unquoted expansion .
Question :
What happens if there are no *.m p3 - files in the current directory ?
Then the for loop is executed once , with file= " ./*.mp3 " , which is not the expected behavior !
The workaround is to test whether there is a matching file :
# POSIX for file in ./*.mp3 ; do [ -e " $ file " ] || continue some command " $ file " done
Another solution is to use Bash 's shopt -s nullglob feature , though this should only be done after reading the documentation and carefully considering the effect of this setting on all other globs in the script .
If you need recursion , the standard solution is find .
When using find , be sure you use it properly .
For POSIX sh portability , use the -exec option :
find .
- type f - name '*.mp3 ' - exec some command {} \ ; #
Or , if the command accepts multiple input filenames : find .
- type f - name '*.mp3 ' - exec some command {} +
If you 're using bash , then you have two additional options .
One is to use GNU or BSD find 's - print0 option , together with bash 's read -d '' option and a ProcessSubstitution :
while IFS= read -r -d '' file ; do some command " $ file " done < <( find .
- type f - name '*.mp3 ' - print0 )
The advantage here is that " some command " ( indeed , the entire while loop body ) is executed in the current shell .
You can set variables and have them persist after the loop ends .
The other option , available in Bash 4.0 and higher , is globstar , which permits a glob to be expanded recursively :
shopt -s globstar for file in ./**/*.mp3 ; do some command " $ file " done
Note the double quotes around $ file in the examples above .
This leads to our second pitfall :
2. cp $ file $ target
What 's wrong with the command shown above ?
Well , nothing , if you happen to know in advance that $ file and $ target have no white space or wildcards in them .
However , the results of the expansions are still subject to WordSplitting and pathname expansion .
Always double - quote parameter expansions .
cp -- " $ file " " $ target "
Without the double quotes , you 'll get a command like cp 01 - Do n't Eat the Yellow Snow .mp3 / mnt/usb , which will result in errors like cp : can not stat `01 ' :
No such file or directory .
If $ file has wildcards in it (* or ? or [ ) , they will be expanded if there are files that match them .
With the double quotes , all 's well , unless " $ file " happens to start with a - , in which case cp thinks you 're trying to feed it command line options ( See pitfall # 3 below . )
Even in the somewhat uncommon circumstance that you can guarantee the variable contents , it is conventional and good practice to quote parameter expansions , especially if they contain file names .
Experienced script writers will always use quotes except perhaps for a small number of cases in which it is absolutely obvious from the immediate code context that a parameter contains a guaranteed safe value .
Experts will most likely consider the cp command in the title always wrong .
You should too .
3 . Filenames with leading dashes
Filenames with leading dashes can cause many problems .
Globs like *.mp3 are sorted into an expanded list ( according to your current locale ) , and - sorts before letters in most locales .
The list is then passed to some command , which may incorrectly interpret the - filename as an option .
There are two major solutions to this .
One solution is to insert -- between the command ( like cp ) and its arguments .
That tells it to stop scanning for options , and all is well :
cp -- " $ file " " $ target "
There are potential problems with this approach .
You have to be sure to insert -- for every usage of the parameter in a context where it might possibly be interpreted as an option -- which is easy to miss and may involve a lot of redundancy .
Most well - written option parsing libraries understand this , and the programs that use them correctly should inherit that feature for free .
However , still be aware that it is ultimately up to the application to recognize end of options .
Some programs that manually parse options , or do it incorrectly , or use poor 3rd - party libraries may not recognize it .
Standard utilities should , with a few exceptions that are specified by POSIX .
echo is one example .
Another option is to ensure that your filenames always begin with a directory by using relative or absolute pathnames .
for i in ./*.mp3 ; do cp " $ i " / target ... done
In this case , even if we have a file whose name begins with - , the glob will ensure that the variable always contains something like ./- foo.mp3 , which is perfectly safe as far as cp is concerned .
Finally , if you can guarantee that all results will have the same prefix , and are only using the variable a few times within a loop body , you can simply concatenate the prefix with the expansion .
This gives a theoretical savings in generating and storing a few extra characters for each word .
for i in *.mp3 ; do cp " ./ $ i " / target ... done
4. [ $ foo = " bar " ]
This is very similar to the issue in pitfall # 2 , but I repeat it because it 's so important .
In the example above , the quotes are in the wrong place .
You do not need to quote a string literal in bash ( unless it contains metacharacters or pattern characters ) .
But you should quote your variables if you are n't sure whether they could contain white space or wildcards .
This example can break for several reasons :
If a variable referenced in [ does n't exist , or is blank , then the [ command would end up looking like :
[ = " bar " ] # Wrong !
... and will throw the error : unary operator expected .
( The = operator is binary , not unary , so the [ command is rather shocked to see it there . )
If the variable contains internal whitespace , then it gets split into separate words before the [ command sees it .
Thus :
[ multiple words here = " bar " ]
While that may look OK to you , it 's a syntax error as far as [ is concerned .
The correct way to write this is :
# POSIX [ " $ foo " = bar ] # Right !
This works fine on POSIX - conformant implementations even if $ foo begins with a - , because POSIX [ determines its action depending on the number of arguments passed to it .
Only very ancient shells have a problem with this , and you should n't worry about them when writing new code ( see the x " $ foo " workaround below ) .
In Bash and many other ksh - like shells , there is a superior alternative which uses the [ [ keyword .
# Bash / Ksh [ [ $ foo == bar ] ] # Right !
You do n't need to quote variable references on the left - hand side of = in [ [ ] ] because they do n't undergo word splitting or globbing , and even blank variables will be handled correctly .
On the other hand , quoting them wo n't hurt anything either .
Unlike [ and test , you may also use the identical == .
Do note however that comparisons using [ [ perform pattern matching against the string on the right hand side , not just a plain string comparison .
To make the string on the right literal , you must quote it if any characters that have special meaning in pattern matching contexts are used .
# Bash / Ksh match=b*r [ [ $ foo == " $ match " ] ]
# Good !
Unquoted would also match against the pattern b*r .
You may have seen code like this :
# POSIX / Bourne [ x " $ foo " = xbar ] #
Ok , but usually unnecessary .
The x " $ foo " hack is required for code that must run on very ancient shells which lack [ [ , and have a more primitive [ , which gets confused if $ foo begins with a - .
On said older systems , [ still does n't care whether the token on the right hand side of the = begins with a - .
It just uses it literally .
It 's just the left - hand side that needs extra caution .
Note that shells that require this workaround are not POSIX - conforming .
Even the Heirloom Bourne shell does n't require this ( probably the non-POSIX Bourne shell clone that 's still most widely in use as a system shell ) .
Such extreme portability is rarely a requirement and makes your code less readable ( and uglier ) .
5. cd $ ( dirname " $f " )
This is yet another quoting error .
As with a variable expansion , the result of a CommandSubstitution undergoes WordSplitting and pathname expansion .
So you should quote it :
cd - P -- " $( dirname -- " $ f " ) "
What 's not obvious here is how the quotes nest .
A C programmer reading this would expect the first and second double - quotes to be grouped together ; and then the third and fourth .
But that 's not the case in Bash .
Bash treats the double - quotes inside the command substitution as one pair , and the double - quotes outside the substitution as another pair .
Another way of writing this : the parser treats the command substitution as a " nesting level " , and the quotes inside it are separate from the quotes outside it .
6. [ " $ foo " = bar && " $ bar " = foo ]
You can't use && inside the old test ( or [ ) command .
The Bash parser sees && outside of [ [ ] ] or ( ( ) ) and breaks your command into two commands , before and after the && .
Use one of these instead :
[ bar = " $ foo " ] && [ foo = " $ bar " ] # Right ! ( POSIX ) [ [ $ foo = bar && $ bar = foo ] ] #
Also right !
( Bash / Ksh )
( Note that we reversed the constant and the variable inside [ for the legacy reasons discussed in pitfall # 4 .
We could also have reversed the [ [ case , but the expansions would require quoting to prevent interpretation as a pattern . )
The same thing applies to || .
Either use [ [ instead , or use two [ commands .
Avoid this :
[ bar = " $ foo " - a foo = " $ bar " ] # Not portable .
The binary - a and - o , and ( / ) ( grouping ) operators are XSI extensions to the POSIX standard .
All are marked as obsolescent in POSIX - 2008 .
They should not be used in new code .
One of the practical problems with [ A = B -a C = D ] ( or - o ) is that POSIX does not specify the results of a test or [ command with more than 4 arguments .
It probably works in most shells , but you can't count on it .
If you have to write for POSIX shells , then you should use two test or [ commands separated by a && operator instead .
7. [ [ $ foo > 7 ] ]
There are multiple issues here .
First , the [ [ command should not be used solely for evaluating arithmetic expressions .
It should be used for test expressions involving one of the supported test operators .
Though technically you can do math using some of [ [ 's operators , it only makes sense to do so in conjunction with one of the non-math test operators somewhere in the expression .
If you just want to do a numeric comparison ( or any other shell arithmetic ) , it is much better to just use ( ( ) ) instead :
# Bash / Ksh ( ( foo > 7 ) ) # Right ! [ [ foo - gt 7 ] ]
#
Works , but is pointless .
Most will consider it wrong .
Use ( (... ) ) or let instead .
If you use the > operator inside [ [ ] ] , it 's treated as a string comparison ( test for collation order by locale ) , not an integer comparison .
This may work sometimes , but it will fail when you least expect it .
If you use > inside [ ] , it 's even worse : it 's an output redirection .
You 'll get a file named 7 in your directory , and the test will succeed as long as $ foo is not empty .
If strict POSIX - conformance is a requirement , and ( ( is not available , then the correct alternative using old - style [ is
# POSIX [ " $ foo " - gt 7 ] #
Also right ! [ $ (( foo > 7 ) ) - ne 0 ] # POSIX - compatible equivalent to ( ( , for more general math operations .
Note that the test ... - gt command will fail in interesting ways if $ foo is not an integer .
Therefore , there 's not much point in quoting it properly other than for performance and to confine the arguments to a single word to reduce the likelihood of obscure side - effects possible in some shells .
If the input to any arithmetic context ( including (( or let ) , or [ test expression involving numeric comparisons can't be guaranteed then you must always validate your input before evaluating the expression .
# POSIX case $ foo in *[![ : digit : ] ]*) printf '$ foo expanded to a non -digit : %s
' " $ foo " >&2 exit 1 ; ; *) [ $ foo - gt 7 ] esac
8. grep foo bar | while read - r ; do ( ( count + + ) ) ; done
The code above looks OK at first glance , does n't it ?
Sure , it 's just a poor implementation of grep - c , but it 's intended as a simplistic example .
Changes to count wo n't propagate outside the while loop because each command in a pipeline is executed in a separate SubShell .
This surprises almost every Bash beginner at some point .
POSIX does n't specify whether or not the last element of a pipeline is evaluated in a subshell .
Some shells such as ksh93 and Bash >= 4.2 with shopt -s lastpipe enabled will run the while loop in this example in the original shell process , allowing any side - effects within to take effect .
Therefore , portable scripts must be written in such a way as to not depend upon either behavior .
For workarounds for this and similar issues , please see Bash FAQ # 24 .
It 's a bit too long to fit here .
9. if [ grep foo myfile ]
Many beginners have an incorrect intuition about if statements brought about by seeing the very common pattern of an if keyword followed immediately by a [ or [ [ .
This convinces people that the [ is somehow part of the if statement 's syntax , just like parentheses used in C's if statement .
This is not the case !
if takes a command .
[ is a command , not a syntax marker for the if statement .
It 's equivalent to the test command , except that the final argument must be a ] .
For example :
# POSIX if [ false ] ; then echo " HELP " ; fi if test false ; then echo " HELP " ; fi
are equivalent -- both checking that the argument " false " is non-empty .
In both cases HELP will always be printed , to the surprise of programmers from other languages guessing about shell syntax .
The syntax of an if statement is :
if COMMANDS then < COMMANDS > elif < COMMANDS > # optional then < COMMANDS > else < COMMANDS > # optional fi # required
Once again , [ is a command .
It takes arguments like any other regular simple command .
if is a compound command which contains other commands -- and there is no [ in its syntax !
While bash has a builtin command [ and thus knows about [ it has nothing special to do with ] .
Bash only passes ] as argument to the [ command , which requires ] to be the last argument only to make scripts look better .
There may be zero or more optional elif sections , and one optional else section .
The if compound command is made up of two or more sections containing lists of commands , each delimited by a then , elif , or else keyword , and is terminated by the fi keyword .
The exit status of the final command of the first section and each subsequent elif section determines whether each corresponding then section is evaluated .
Another elif is evaluated until one of the then sections is executed .
If no then section is evaluated , then the else branch is taken , or if no else is given , the if block is complete and the overall if command returns 0 ( true ) .
If you want to make a decision based on the output of a grep command , you do not want to enclose it in parentheses , brackets , backticks , or any other syntax !
Just use grep as the COMMANDS after the if , like this :
if grep -q fooregex myfile ; then ... fi
If the grep matches a line from myfile , then the exit code will be 0 ( true ) , and the then part will be executed .
Otherwise , if there are no matches , grep will return non-zero and the overall if command will be zero .

10 . if [ bar= " $ foo " ] ; then ...
[ bar= " $ foo " ] # Wrong ! [ bar= " $ foo " ] # Still wrong !
[ bar = " $ foo " ] #
Also wrong ! [ [ bar= " $ foo " ] ]
# Wrong again ! [ [ bar= " $ foo " ] ]
#
Guess what ?
Wrong ! [ [ bar = " $ foo " ] ]
#
Do I really need to say it ....
As explained in the previous example , [ is a command ( which can be proven with type -t [ or whence - v [ ) .
Just like with any other simple command , Bash expects the command to be followed by a space , then the first argument , then another space , etc .
You can't just run things all together without putting the spaces in !
Here are the correct ways :
if [ bar = " $ foo " ] ; then ... if [ [ bar = " $ foo " ] ] ; then ...
In the first form , [ is the command name , and bar , = , the expansion of " $ foo " , and ] are separate arguments to it .
There must be whitespace between each pair of arguments , so the shell knows where each argument begins and ends .
The second form is similar , except that [ [ is a special keyword , which is terminated by the ] ] .
For more details on the difference between the two , see Bash FAQ 31 .
11 . if [ [ a = b ] && [ c = d ] ] ; then ...
Here we go again . [ is a command .
It is not a syntactic marker that sits between if and some sort of C - like " condition " .
Nor is it used for grouping .
You cannot take C - like if commands and translate them into Bash commands just by replacing parentheses with square brackets !
If you want to express a compound conditional , do this :
if [ a = b ] && [ c = d ] ; then ...
Note that here we have two commands after the if , joined by an && ( logical AND , shortcut evaluation ) operator .
It 's precisely the same as :
if test a = b && test c = d ; then ...
If the first test command returns false , the body of the if statement is not entered .
If it returns true , then the second test command is run ; and if that also one returns true , then the body of the if statement will be entered .
( C programmers are already familiar with && .
Bash uses the same short - circuit evaluation .
Likewise || does short - circuit evaluation for the OR operation . )
The [ [ keyword does permit the use of && , so it could also be written this way :
if [ [ a = b && c = d ] ] ; then ...
See pitfall # 6 for a pitfall related to tests combined with conditional operators .
12 . read $ foo
You do n't use a $ before the variable name in a read command .
If you want to put data into the variable named foo , you do it like this :
read foo
Or more safely :
IFS= read -r foo
read $ foo would read a line of input and put it in the variable (s ) whose name (s ) are in $ foo .
This might be useful if you actually intended foo to be a reference to some other variable ; but in the majority of cases , this is simply a bug .
13 . cat file | sed s / foo / bar / > file
You cannot read from a file and write to it in the same pipeline .
Depending on what your pipeline does , the file may be clobbered ( to 0 bytes , or possibly to a number of bytes equal to the size of your operating system 's pipeline buffer ) , or it may grow until it fills the available disk space , or reaches your operating system 's file size limitation , or your quota , etc .
If you want to make a change to a file safely , other than appending to the end of it , use a text editor .
printf %s \
' , s/ foo / bar / g ' w q | ed -s file
If you are doing something that cannot be done with a text editor there must be a temporary file created at some point ( * ) .
For example , the following is completely portable :
sed 's / foo / bar/g ' file > tmpfile && mv tmpfile file
The following will only work on GNU sed 4.x :
sed - i 's / foo / bar/g ' file(s )
Note that this also creates a temporary file , and does the same sort of renaming trickery -- it just handles it transparently .
And the following equivalent command requires perl 5.x :
perl - pi -e 's / foo/ bar/g ' file(s )
For more details on replacing contents of files , please see Bash FAQ # 21 .
(*) sponge from moreutils uses this example in its manual :
sed '...' file | grep '...' | sponge file
Rather than using a temporary file plus an atomic mv , this version " soaks up " ( the actual description in the manual ! ) all the data , before opening and writing to the file .
This version will cause data loss if the program or system crashes during the write operation , because there 's no copy of the original file on disk at that point .
Using a temporary file + mv still incurs a slight risk of data loss in case of a system crash / power loss ; to be 100 % certain that either the old or the new file will survive a power loss , you must use sync before the mv .
14 . echo $ foo
This relatively innocent - looking command causes massive confusion .
Because the $ foo is n't quoted , it will not only be subject to WordSplitting , but also file globbing .
This misleads Bash programmers into thinking their variables contain the wrong values , when in fact the variables are OK -- it 's just the word splitting or filename expansion that 's messing up their view of what 's happening .
msg =" Please enter a file name of the form * .zip " echo $ msg
This message is split into words and any globs are expanded , such as the *.zip .
What will your users think when they see this message :
Please enter a file name of the form freenfss .zip lw35nfss.zip
To demonstrate :
var= " *.zip " # var contains an asterisk , a period , and the word " zip " echo " $var " # writes *.zip echo $var # writes the list of files which end with .zip
In fact , the echo command cannot be used with absolute safety here .
If the variable contains -n for example , echo will consider that an option , rather than data to be printed .
The only absolutely sure way to print the value of a variable is using printf :
printf " %s
" " $ foo "
15 . $ foo=bar
No , you do n't assign a variable by putting a $ in front of the variable name .
This is n't perl .
16 . foo = bar
No , you can't put spaces around the = when assigning to a variable .
This is n't C .
When you write foo = bar the shell splits it into three words .
The first word , foo , is taken as the command name .
The second and third become the arguments to that command .
Likewise , the following are also wrong :
foo= bar # WRONG ! foo =bar # WRONG ! $ foo = bar ; # COMPLETELY WRONG !
foo=bar # Right. foo= " bar " # More Right .
17 . echo << EOF
A here document is a useful tool for embedding large blocks of textual data in a script .
It causes a redirection of the lines of text in the script to the standard input of a command .
Unfortunately , echo is not a command which reads from stdin .
# This is wrong : echo << EOF Hello world
How 's it going ?
EOF #
This is what you were trying to do : cat << EOF Hello world How 's it going ?
EOF #
Or , use quotes which can span multiple lines ( efficient , echo is built - in ) : echo " Hello world How 's it going ? "
Using quotes like that is fine -- it works great , in all shells -- but it does n't let you just drop a block of lines into the script .
There 's syntactic markup on the first and last line .
If you want to have your lines untouched by shell syntax , and do n't want to spawn a cat command , here 's another alternative :
# Or use printf ( also efficient , printf is built - in ) : printf %s " \ Hello world How 's it going ? "
In the printf example , the \ on the first line prevents an extra newline at the beginning of the text block .
There 's a literal newline at the end ( because the final quote is on a new line ) .
The lack of
in the printf format argument prevents printf adding an extra newline at the end .
The \ trick wo n't work in single quotes .
If you need / want single quotes around the block of text , you have two choices , both of which necessitate shell syntax " contaminating " your data :
printf %s \ ' Hello world ' printf %s ' Hello world '
18 . su -c ' some command '
This syntax is almost correct .
The problem is , on many platforms , su takes a -c argument , but it 's not the one you want .
For example , on OpenBSD :
$ su -c ' echo hello ' su : only the superuser may specify a login class
You want to pass - c ' some command ' to a shell , which means you need a username before the -c .
su root -c ' some command ' #
Now it 's right .
su assumes a username of root when you omit one , but this falls on its face when you want to pass a command to the shell afterward .
You must supply the username in this case .
19 . cd / foo ; bar
If you do n't check for errors from the cd command , you might end up executing bar in the wrong place .
This could be a major disaster , if for example bar happens to be rm -f * .
You must always check for errors from a cd command .
The simplest way to do that is :
cd / foo && bar
If there 's more than just one command after the cd , you might prefer this :
cd / foo || exit 1 bar baz bat ... #
Lots of commands .
cd will report the failure to change directories , with a stderr message such as " bash : cd : / foo : No such file or directory " .
If you want to add your own message in stdout , however , you could use command grouping :
cd / net || { echo > &2 " Ca n't read / net .
Make sure you 've logged in to the Samba network , and try again . " ; exit 1 ; } do_stuff more_stuff
Note there 's a required space between { and echo , and a required ; before the closing } .
You could also write a die function , if you prefer .
Some people also like to enable set -e to make their scripts abort on any command that returns non-zero , but this can be rather tricky to use correctly ( since many common commands may return a non- zero for a warning condition , which you may not want to treat as fatal ) .
By the way , if you 're changing directories a lot in a Bash script , be sure to read the Bash help on pushd , popd , and dirs .
Perhaps all that code you wrote to manage cd 's and pwd 's is completely unnecessary .
Speaking of which , compare this :
find ... - type d - print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' subdir ; do here =$ PWD cd " $ subdir " && whatever && ... cd " $ here " done
With this :
find ... - type d - print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' subdir ; do ( cd " $ subdir " || exit ; whatever ; ...) done
Forcing a SubShell here causes the cd to occur only in the subshell ; for the next iteration of the loop , we 're back to our normal location , regardless of whether the cd succeeded or failed .
We do n't have to change back manually , and we are n't stuck in a neverending string of ... && ... logic preventing the use of other conditionals .
The subshell version is simpler and cleaner ( albeit a tiny bit slower ) .
Another approach is to cd unconditionally to where we 're supposed to be , at the start of each loop iteration :
here =$ PWD find ... - type d - print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' subdir ; do cd " $ here " || continue cd " $ subdir " || continue whatever ... done
At least this way , we can continue to the next loop iteration and do n't have to string an indefinite series of && together to ensure that we reach the cd at the end of the loop body .
20 . [ bar == " $ foo " ]
The == operator is not valid for the POSIX [ command .
Use = or the [ [ keyword instead .
[ bar = " $ foo " ] && echo yes [ [ bar == $ foo ] ] && echo yes
In Bash , [ " $x " == y ] is accepted as an extension , which often leads Bash programmers to think it 's the correct syntax .
It 's not ; it 's a Bashism .
If you 're going to use Bashisms , you might as well just use [ [ instead .
21 . for i in { 1..10} ; do ./ something & ; done
You can not put a ; immediately after an & .
Just remove the extraneous ; entirely .
for i in { 1..10} ; do ./ something & done
Or :
for i in { 1..10} ; do ./ something & done
& already functions as a command terminator , just like ; does .
And you can not mix the two .
In general , a ; can be replaced by a newline , but not all newlines can be replaced by ; .
22. cmd1 && cmd2 || cmd3
Some people try to use && and || as a shortcut syntax for if ... then ... else ... fi , perhaps because they think they are being clever .
For instance ,
# WRONG ! [ [ -s $ errorlog ] ] && echo " Uh oh , there were some errors . " || echo " Successful . "
However , this construct is not completely equivalent to if ... fi in the general case .
The command that comes after the && also generates an exit status , and if that exit status is n't " true " ( 0 ) , then the command that comes after the || will also be invoked .
For example :
i=0 true && ( ( i++ ) ) || ((i--) ) # WRONG ! echo " $ i " # Prints 0
What happened here ?
It looks like i should be 1 , but it ends up 0 .
Why ?
Because both the i++ and the i-- were executed .
The ( ( i++ ) ) command has an exit status , and that exit status is derived from a C - like evaluation of the expression inside the parentheses .
That expression 's value happens to be 0 ( the initial value of i ) , and in C , an expression with an integer value of 0 is considered false .
So ( ( i++ ) ) ( when i is 0 ) has an exit status of 1 ( false ) , and therefore the ( ( i -- ) ) command is executed as well .
Another clever person thinks that we can fix it by using the pre-increment operator , since the exit status from ++i ( with i initially 0 ) is true :
i=0 true && ( ( ++i ) ) || (( -- i ) ) # STILL WRONG !
echo " $ i " # Prints 1 by dumb luck
But that 's missing the point of the example .
It just happens to work by coincidence , and you cannot rely on x && y || z if y has any chance of failure !
( This example still fails if we initialize i to - 1 instead of 0 . )
If you need safety , or if you simply are n't sure how this works , or if anything in the preceding paragraphs was n't completely clear , please just use the simple if ... fi syntax in your programs .
i=0 if true ; then ( ( i++ ) ) else ( ( i -- ) ) fi echo " $ i " # Prints 1
This section also applies to Bourne shell , here is the code that illustrates it :
# WRONG !
true && { echo true ; false ; } || { echo false ; true ; }
Output is two lines " true " and " false " , instead the single line " true " .
23 . echo " Hello World ! "
The problem here is that , in an interactive Bash shell ( in versions prior to 4.3 ) , you 'll see an error like :
bash : ! " : event not found
This is because , in the default settings for an interactive shell , Bash performs csh - style history expansion using the exclamation point .
This is not a problem in shell scripts ; only in interactive shells .
Unfortunately , the obvious attempt to " fix " this wo n't work :
$ echo " hi\ ! " hi\ !
The easiest solution is unsetting the histexpand option : this can be done with set +H or set +o histexpand
Question :
Why is playing with histexpand more apropriate than single quotes ?
I personally ran into this issue when I was manipulating song files , using commands like mp3info -t " Do n't Let It Show " ... mp3info -t " Ah! Leah ! " ...
Using single quotes is extremely inconvenient because of all the songs with apostrophes in their titles .
Using double quotes ran into the history expansion issue .
( And imagine a file that has both in its name .
The quoting would be atrocious . )
Since I never actually use history expansion , my personal preference was to turn it off in ~/.bashrc .
-- GreyCat
These solutions will work :
echo ' Hello World ! '
or
echo " Hello World " !
or
set +H echo " Hello World ! "
or
histchars=
Many people simply choose to put set +H or set +o histexpand in their ~/. bashrc to deactivate history expansion permanently .
This is a personal preference , though , and you should choose whatever works best for you .
Another solution is :
exmark= '!' echo " Hello , world $ exmark "
In Bash 4.3 and newer , a double quote following !
no longer triggers history expansion , but history expansion is still performed within double quotes , so while echo " Hello World ! " is OK , these will still be a problem :
echo " Hello , World ! ( and the rest of the Universe ) " echo " foo ! ' bar ' "
24 . for arg in $ *
Bash ( like all Bourne shells ) has a special syntax for referring to the list of positional parameters one at a time , and $* is n't it .
Neither is $ @ .
Both of those expand to the list of words in your script 's parameters , not to each parameter as a separate word .
The correct syntax is :
for arg in " $ @ " #
Or simply : for arg
Since looping over the positional parameters is such a common thing to do in scripts , for arg defaults to for arg in " $ @ " .
The double - quoted " $@ " is special magic that causes each parameter to be used as a single word ( or a single loop iteration ) .
It 's what you should be using at least 99 % of the time .
Here 's an example :
# Incorrect version for x in $ * ; do echo " parameter : ' $ x ' " done $ ./ myscript ' arg 1 ' arg2 arg3 parameter : ' arg ' parameter : ' 1 ' parameter : ' arg2 ' parameter : ' arg3 '
It should have been written :
# Correct version for x in " $@ " ; do echo " parameter : ' $ x ' " done # or better : for x do echo " parameter : ' $ x ' " done $ ./ myscript ' arg 1 ' arg2 arg3 parameter : ' arg 1 ' parameter : ' ar g2 ' parameter : ' arg3 '
25. function foo ( )
This works in some shells , but not in others .
You should never combine the keyword function with the parentheses ( ) when defining a function .
Bash ( at least some versions ) will allow you to mix the two .
Most of the shells wo n't accept that ( zsh 4.x and perhaps above will - for example ) .
Some shells will accept function foo , but for maximum portability , you should always use :
foo ( ) { ... }
26 . echo " ~ "
Tilde expansion only applies when ' ~ ' is unquoted .
In this example echo writes ' ~ ' to stdout , rather than the path of the user 's home directory .
Quoting path parameters that are expressed relative to a user 's home directory should be done using $ HOME rather than ' ~ ' .
For instance consider the situation where $ HOME is " / home / my photos " .
" ~/ dir with spaces " # expands to " ~/ dir with spaces " ~ " / dir with spaces " # expands to " ~/ dir with spaces " ~ /" dir with spaces " # expands to " / home / my photos / dir with spaces " " $ HOME / dir with spaces " # expands to " / home / my photos / dir with spaces "
27. local var =$ ( cmd )
When declaring a local variable in a function , the local acts as a command in its own right .
This can sometimes interact oddly with the rest of the line -- for example , if you wanted to capture the exit status ( $ ? ) of the CommandSubstitution , you can't do it .
local 's exit status masks it .
Another problem with this syntax is that in some shells ( like bash ) , local var = $ ( cmd ) is treated as an assignment , meaning the right hand side is given special treatment , just like var = $ ( cmd ) ; while in other shells ( like dash ) , local var = $ ( cmd ) is not treated as an assignment , and the right hand side will undergo word splitting ( because it is n't quoted ) .
Quoting the right hand side will work around the word splitting issue , but not the exit status masking issue .
For both reasons , it 's best to use separate commands for this :
local var var =$ ( cmd ) rc=$ ?
Both issues are also true of export .
The next pitfall describes another issue with this syntax :
28 . export foo= ~ / bar
Tilde expansion ( with or without a username ) is only guaranteed to occur when the tilde appears at the beginning of a word , either by itself or followed by a slash .
It is also guaranteed to occur when the tilde appears immediately after the = in an assignment .
However , the export and local commands do not necessarily constitute an assignment .
In some shells ( like Bash ) , export foo= ~ / bar will undergo tilde expansion ; in others ( like dash ) , it will not .
foo= ~ / bar ; export foo # Right ! export foo= " $ HOME / bar " # Right !
29 . sed 's /$ foo / good bye / '
In single quotes , bash parameter expansions like $ foo do not get expanded .
That is the purpose of single quotes , to protect characters like $ from the shell .
Change the quotes to double quotes :
foo= " hello " ; sed " s / $ foo / good bye / "
But keep in mind , if you use double quotes you might need to use more escapes .
See the Quotes page .
30 . tr [ A - Z ] [ a - z ]
There are ( at least ) three things wrong here .
The first problem is that [ A - Z ] and [ a - z ] are seen as globs by the shell .
If you do n't have any single - lettered filenames in your current directory , it 'll seem like the command is correct ; but if you do , things will go wrong .
Probably at 0300 hours on a weekend .
The second problem is that this is not really the correct notation for tr .
What this actually does is translate ' [ ' into ' [ ' ; anything in the range A - Z into a - z ; and ' ] ' into ' ] ' .
So you do n't even need those brackets , and the first problem goes away .
The third problem is that depending on the locale , A - Z or a -z may not give you the 26 ASCII characters you were expecting .
In fact , in some locales z is in the middle of the alphabet !
The solution to this depends on what you want to happen :
# Use this if you want to change the case of the 26 latin letters LC_COLLATE=C tr A - Z a-z # Use this if you want the case conversion to depend upon the locale , which might be more like what a user is expecting tr ' [ : upper : ] ' '[ : lower : ] '
The quotes are required on the second command , to avoid globbing .
31 . ps ax | grep gedit
The fundamental problem here is that the name of a running process is inherently unreliable .
There could be more than one legitimate gedit process .
There could be something else disguising itself as gedit ( changing the reported name of an executed command is trivial ) .
For real answers to this , see ProcessManagement .
The following is the quick and dirty stuff .
Searching for the PID of ( for example ) gedit , many people start with
$ ps ax | grep gedit 10530 ?
S 6:23 gedit 32118 pts/0 R+ 0:00 grep gedit
which , depending on a RaceCondition , often yields grep itself as a result .
To filter grep out :
ps ax | grep - v grep | grep gedit # will work , but ugly
An alternative to this is to use :
ps ax | grep ' [ g ] edit ' # quote to avoid shell GLOB
This will ignore the grep itself in the process table as that is [ g ] edit and grep is looking for gedit once evaluated .
On GNU / Linux , the parameter - C can be used instead to filter by commandname :
$ ps -C gedit PID TTY TIME CMD 10530 ?
00:06:23 gedit
But why bother when you could just use pgrep instead ?
$ pgrep gedit 10530
Now in a second step the PID is often extracted by awk or cut :
$ ps - C gedit | awk '{print $ 1} ' | tail -n1
but even that can be handled by some of the trillions of parameters for ps :
$ ps -C gedit - opid= 10530
If you 're stuck in 1992 and are n't using pgrep , you could use the ancient , obsolete , deprecated pidof ( GNU / Linux only ) instead :
$ pidof gedit 10530
and if you need the PID to kill the process , pkill might be interesting for you .
Note however that , for example , pgrep / pkill ssh would also find processes named sshd , and you would n't want to kill those .
Unfortunately some programs are n't started with their name , for example firefox is often started as firefox - bin , which you would need to find out with - well - ps ax | grep firefox .
Or , you can stick with pgrep by adding some parameters :
$ pgrep - fl firefox 3128 /usr/lib/ firefox / firefox 7120 /usr/lib/firefox/plugin-container
/usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so - greomni /usr/lib/firefox/omni.ja 3128 true plugin
Please read ProcessManagement .
Seriously .
32 . printf " $ foo "
This is n't wrong because of quotes , but because of a format string exploit .
If $ foo is not strictly under your control , then any \ or % characters in the variable may cause undesired behavior .
Always supply your own format string :
printf %s " $ foo " printf '%s
' " $ foo "
33 . for i in { 1..$n}
The BashParser performs BraceExpansion before any other expansions or substitutions .
So the brace expansion code sees the literal $n , which is not numeric , and therefore it does n't expand the curly braces into a list of numbers .
This makes it nearly impossible to use brace expansion to create lists whose size is only known at run-time .
Do this instead :
for ( ( i=1 ; i< =n ; i++ ) ) ; do ... done
In the case of simple iteration over integers , an arithmetic for loop should almost always be preferred over brace expansion to begin with , because brace expansion pre-expands every argument which can be slower and unnecessarily consumes memory .
34 . if [ [ $ foo = $ bar ] ] ( depending on intent )
When the right - hand side of an = operator inside [ [ is not quoted , bash does pattern matching against it , instead of treating it as a string .
So , in the code above , if bar contains * , the result will always be true .
If you want to check for equality of strings , the right - hand side should be quoted :
if [ [ $ foo = " $ bar " ] ]
If you want to do pattern matching , it might be wise to choose variable names that indicate the right - hand side contains a pattern .
Or use comments .
It 's also worth pointing out that if you quote the right - hand side of =~ it also forces a simple string comparison , rather than a regular expression matching .
This leads us to :
35 . if [ [ $ foo =~ ' some RE ' ] ]
The quotes around the right - hand side of the =~ operator cause it to become a string , rather than a RegularExpression .
If you want to use a long or complicated regular expression and avoid lots of backslash escaping , put it in a variable :
re= 'some RE ' if [ [ $ foo =~ $re ] ]
This also works around the difference in how =~ works across different versions of bash .
Using a variable avoids some nasty and subtle problems .
The same problem occurs with pattern matching inside [ [ :
[ [ $ foo = " *.glob " ] ]
# Wrong !
*. glob is treated as a literal string . [ [ $ foo = *.glob ] ] # Correct .
*. glob is treated as a glob - style pattern .
36 . [ -n $ foo ] or [ - z $ foo ]
When using the [ command , you must quote each substitution that you give it .
Otherwise , $ foo could expand to 0 words , or 42 words , or any number of words that is n't 1 , which breaks the syntax .
[ -n " $ foo " ] [ - z " $ foo " ] [ -n " $( some command with a " $ file " in it ) " ] # [ [ does n't perform word - splitting or glob expansion , so you could also use : [ [ -n $ foo ] ] [ [ - z $ foo ] ]
37 . [ [ -e " $ broken_symlink " ] ] returns 1 even though $ broken_symlink exists
Test follows symlinks , therefore if a symlink is broken , i.e. it points to a file that does n't exists or is in a directory you do n't have access to , test -e returns 1 for it even though it exists .
In order to work around it ( and prepare against it ) you should use :
# bash / ksh /zsh [ [ -e " $ broken_symlink " || - L " $broken_symlink " ] ]
# POSIX sh+test [ -e " $broken_symlink " ] || [ - L " $ broken_symlink " ]
38 . ed file <<<" g/d\{0,3\}/s//e/g " fails
The problem caused because ed does n't accept 0 for \{0,3\} .
You can check that the following do work :
ed file <<<" g/d\{1,3\}/s//e/g "
Note that this happens even though POSIX states that BRE ( which is the Regular Expression flavor used by ed ) should accept 0 as the minimum number of occurrences ( see section 5 ) .
39 . expr sub - string fails for " match "
This works reasonably well
most of the time
word=abcde expr " $ word " : " .\(.*\ ) " bcde
But WILL fail for the word " match "
word =match expr " $ word " : " .\(.*\ ) "
The problem is " match " is a keyword .
Solution ( GNU only ) is prefix with a '+'
word =match expr + " $ word " : " .\(.*\ ) " atch
Or , y'know , stop using expr .
You can do everything expr does by using Parameter Expansion .
What 's that thing up there trying to do ?
Remove the first letter of a word ?
That can be done in POSIX shells using PE or Substring Expansion :
$ word=match $ echo " $ {word # ? } " # PE atch $ echo " $ {word : 1} " # SE atch
Seriously , there 's no excuse for using expr unless you 're on Solaris with its non-POSIX - conforming / bin/sh .
It 's an external process , so it 's much slower than in - process string manipulation .
And since nobody uses it , nobody understands what it 's doing , so your code is obfuscated and hard to maintain .
40 . On UTF - 8 and Byte - Order Marks ( BOM )
In general : Unix UTF - 8 text does not use BOM .
The encoding of plain text is determined by the locale or by mime types or other metadata .
While the presence of a BOM would not normally damage a UTF - 8 document meant only for reading by humans , it is problematic ( often syntactically illegal ) in any text file meant to be interpreted by automated processes such as scripts , source code , configuration files , and so on .
Files starting with BOM should be considered equally foreign as those with MS - DOS linebreaks .
In shell scripting : ' Where UTF - 8 is used transparently in 8 - bit environments , the use of a BOM will interfere with any protocol or file format that expects specific ASCII characters at the beginning , such as the use of " # ! " of at the beginning of Unix shell scripts . '
http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#bom5
41. content=$ ( < file )
There is n't anything wrong with this expression , but you should be aware that command substitutions ( all forms : `...` , $ (... ) , $ ( < file ) , `< file` , and $ { ... ; } ( ksh ) ) remove any trailing newlines .
This is often inconsequential or even desirable , but if you must preserve the literal output including any possible trailing newlines , it gets tricky because you have no way of knowing whether the output had them or how many .
One ugly but usable workaround is to add a postfix inside the command substitution and remove it on the outside :
absolute_dir_path_x=$( readlink - fn -- " $ dir_path " ; printf x ) absolute_dir_path=${absolute_dir_path_x%x}
A less portable but arguably prettier solution is to use read with an empty delimiter .
# Ksh ( or bash 4.2+ with lastpipe enabled ) readlink - fn -- " $ dir_path " | IFS= read -rd '' absolute_dir_path
The downside to this method is that the read will always return false unless the command outputs a NUL byte causing only part of the stream to be read .
The only way to get the exit status of the command is through PIPESTATUS .
You could also intentionally output a NUL byte to force read to return true , and use pipefail .
set -o pipefail { readlink - fn -- " $ dir_path " && printf ' \0 ' ; } | IFS= read -rd '' absolute_dir_path set +o pipefail
This is somewhat of a portability mess , as Bash supports both pipefail and PIPESTATUS , ksh93 supports pipefail only , and only recent versions of mksh support pipefail , while earlier versions supported PIPESTATUS only .
Additionally , a bleeding - edge ksh93 version is required in order for read to stop at the NUL byte .
42 . for file in ./* ; do if [ [ $ file != *.* ] ]
One way to prevent programs from interpreting filenames passed to them as options is to use pathnames ( see pitfall # 3 above ) .
For files under the current directory , names may be prefixed with a relative pathname ./ .
In the case of a pattern like *.* however , problems can arise because it matches a string of the form ./ filename .
In a simple case , you can just use the glob directly to generate the desired matches .
If however a separate pattern - matching step is required ( e.g. the results have been preprocessed and stored in an array , and need to be filtered ) , it could be solved by taking the prefix into account in the pattern : [ [ $ file != ./*.* ] ] , or by stripping the pattern from the match .
# Bash shopt -s nullglob for path in ./* ; do [ [ $ {path ##*/} != *.* ] ] && rm " $ path " done #
Or even better for file in *; do [ [ $ file != *.* ]] && rm " ./$ file " done #
Or better still for file in *.* ; do rm " ./ $ file " done
Another possibility is to signal the end of options with a -- argument .
( Again , covered in # pf3 ) .
shopt -s nullglob for file in *; do [ [ $ file != *.* ] ] && rm -- " $ file " done
43 . somecmd 2>&1 >> logfile
This is by far the most common mistake involving redirections , typically performed by someone wanting to direct both stdout and stderr to a file or pipe will try this and not understand why stderr is still showing up on their terminal .
If you 're perplexed by this , you probably do n't understand how redirections or possibly file descriptors work to begin with .
Redirections are evaluated left - to - right before the command is executed .
This semantically incorrect code essentially means : " first redirect standard error to where standard out is currently pointing ( the tty ) , then redirect standard out to logfile " .
This is backwards .
Standard error is already going to the tty .
Use the following instead :
somecmd >> logfile 2>&1
See a more in - depth explanation , Copy descriptor explained , and BashGuide - redirection .
44 . cmd ; (( ! $ ? ) ) || die
$ ? is only required if you need to retrieve the exact status of the previous command .
If you only need to test for success or failure ( any non-zero status ) , just test the command directly .
e.g.:
if cmd ; then ... fi
Checking an exit status against a list of alternatives might follow a pattern like this :
cmd status= $ ?
case $ status in 0 ) echo success > &2 ;; 1 ) echo ' Must supply a parameter , exiting . ' >& 2 exit 1 ; ; *) echo " Unknown error $ status , exiting . " > &2 exit " $ status " esac
45 . y=$ (( array [ $x ] ) )
The code given to an arithmetic expansion or compound command undergoes a pass of expansions and substitutions prior to evaluation .
It is the text generated by these initial expansions that is ultimately evaluated as an arithmetic expression .
This must be handled correctly or unintended code execution can easily result .
Here , an expression is stitched together by expanding one code fragment into another .
$ x= '$ ( date > & 2 ) ' # redirection is just so we can see everything happen $ y=$ ( ( array [ " $x " ] ) )
# Quotes do n't help .
The array does n't even have to exist Mon Jun 2 10:49:08 EDT 2014
The arithmetic processor needs to get a reference to this array variable in bash 's internal symbol table , so it passes array [ $ ( date > & 2 ) ] to a lookup function ( just like e.g. read or printf - v do with variable names passed as arguments ) which in turn expands the command substitution to resolve the index .
( For numeric indexed arrays , the lookup function next evaluates the expanded text of the index as an arithmetic expression .
Consequently , mutually recursive variable lookups and arithmetic expansions can occur to any depth ( up to Bash 's defined limit ) , any of which can produce unintended side - effects . )
Most of the time , there is no need to use any kind of expansion within an arithmetic expansion .
Use variable names directly in the expression ( no $ ) wherever possible ( i.e. except for positional parameters and POSIX " special variables " ) .
If you validate variables before using them and guarantee that no expansion generates anything other than a numeric literal then most issues are automatically avoided .
Escape any expansions to pass them into the expression without expanding them first :
# Typical task reading some columns into an associative array .
typeset - A arr printf - v offset '% ( %s ) T ' - 1 while IFS= ' ' read -r x y ; do [ [ $ x $y == + ( [ 0 - 9 ] ) + ( [ 0 - 9 ] ) ] ]
# validate input ( see next pitfall ) ( ( arr [ \$ ( date -d " @$x " + %F ) ] = y - offset ) ) # Escaped substitution passes the entire expression literally .
done
Another option is to use let with single - quoted arguments .
( ( expr ) ) is equivalent to let " expr " ( double - quoted args ) .
46 . read num ; echo $ ( ( num+1 ) )
Always validate your input ( see BashFAQ /054 ) before using num in an arithmetic context as it allows code injection .
$ echo ' a [ $ ( echo injection > & 2 ) ] ' | bash - c ' read num ; echo $ ( ( num+1 ) ) ' injection 1
47 . IFS= , read - ra fields <<< " $ csv_line "
Unbelievable as it may seem , POSIX requires the treatment of IFS as a field terminator , rather than a field separator .
What this means in our example is that if there 's an empty field at the end of the input line , it will be discarded :
$ IFS= , read - ra fields < << " a , b , " $ declare - p fields declare - a fields = ' ( [ 0 ] = " a " [ 1 ] = " b " ) '
Where did the empty field go ?
It was eaten for historical reasons ( " because it 's always been that way " ) .
This behavior is not unique to bash ; all conformant shells do it .
A non-empty field is properly scanned :
$ IFS= , read - ra fields < << " a , b , c " $ declare - p fields declare - a fields = ' ( [ 0 ] = " a " [ 1 ] = " b " [ 2 ] = " c " ) '
So , how do we work around this nonsense ?
As it turns out , appending an IFS character to the end of the input string will force the scanning to work .
If there was a trailing empty field , the extra IFS character " terminates " it so that it gets scanned .
If there was a trailing non-empty field , the IFS character creates a new , empty field that gets dropped .
$ input= " a , b , " $ IFS= , read - ra fields < << " $ input , " $ declare - p fields declare - a fields = ' ( [ 0 ] = " a " [ 1 ] = " b " [ 2 ] = " " ) '
48 . export CDPATH=.:~/myProject
Do not export CDPATH .
Setting CDPATH in . bashrc is not an issue , but exporting it will cause any bash or sh script you run , that happen to use cd , to potentially change behaviour .
There are two problems .
A script that does the following :
cd some / dir || exit cmd to be run in some / dir
may change directory to ~/ myProject / some / dir instead of ./ some / dir , depending on what directories exist at the time .
So the cd may succeed and take the script to the wrong directory , with potentially harmful effects of the following commands which now run in a different directory than intended .
The second problem is when cd is run in a context where the output is captured :
output =$ ( cd some / dir && some command )
As a side - effect when CDPATH is set , cd will output something like / home / user / some / dir to stdout to indicate that it found a directory through CDPATH , which in turn will end up in the output variable along with the intended output of some command .
A script can make itself immune to a CDPATH inherited from the environment by always prepending ./ to relative paths , or run unset CDPATH at the start of the script , but do n't assume every scripter has taken this pitfall into account , so do n't export CDPATH .
49 . OIFS = " $ IFS " ; ... ; IFS = " $ OIFS "
Directly assigning a variable 's value to a temporary variable is n't alone enough to restore its state .
The assignment will always result in a set but empty temporary variable even if the initial variable was unset .
This is a particular problem for IFS because an empty IFS has a completely different meaning from an unset IFS , and setting IFS to a temporary value for a command or two is a common requirement .
An easy workaround is to designate a prefix to distinguish set from unset vars , then strip it when finished .
oIFS=$ {IFS +_$ {IFS}} IFS=/ ; echo " ${array [ * ] } "
$ {oIFS :+' false '} unset -v IFS || IFS=$ {oIFS#_}
A local variable is usually preferable when possible .
f ( ) { local IFS IFS= / ; echo " ${array [ * ] } " } f
Subshells are another possibility .
( IFS=/ ; echo " ${array [ * ] } " )
50 . hosts=( $ ( aws ... ) )
It is not safe to populate an array with a raw $ (...) CommandSubstitution .
The output of the command undergoes word splitting ( on all whitespace , even ones that are inside quotes ) and then globbing .
If there 's a word like * or eh? or [ abc ] in the result , it will be expanded based on filenames in the current working directory .
To select a replacement , you need to know whether the command writes its output on a single line , or multiple lines .
If it 's a single line :
read - ra hosts < <( aws ... )
If it 's multiple lines ( and you 're targeting bash 4.0 or later ) :
readarray -t hosts < <( aws ... )
If it 's multiple lines ( and you want compatibility with bash 3.x , or want your command 's exit status to be reflected in success or failure of the read operation without depending on behavior only available in bash 4.4 and newer ) :
IFS= $ '
' read -r -d '' - a hosts < <( aws ... && printf ' \0 ' )
This will prevent globbing .
It still wo n't help you if you needed to avoid splitting on quoted whitespace , but unfortunately nothing bash can do handles that case .
For generalized CSV ( comma - separated value ) file handling , you really need to switch to a language that has a dedicated CSV input library .
51 . Non-atomic writes with xargs -P
GNU xargs supports running multiple jobs in parallel .
- P n where n is the number of jobs to run in parallel .
seq 100 | xargs - n1 - P10 echo " $ a " | grep 5 seq 100 | xargs - n1 - P10 echo " $ a " > myoutput.txt
This will work fine for many situations but has a deceptive flaw :
If $ a contains more than 8192 characters ( the limit depends on platform and version ) , the echo may not be atomic ( it may be split into multiple write ( ) calls ) , and there is a risk that two lines will be mixed .
$ perl -e ' print " a" x10000 , "
" ' > foo $ strace -e write bash - c ' read -r foo < foo ; echo " $ foo " ' >/dev/null write ( 1 , " aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa " ... , 8192 ) = 8192 write ( 1 , " aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa " ... , 1809 ) = 1809 +++ exited with 0 +++
Obviously the same issue arises if there are multiple calls to echo or printf :
slowprint ( ) { printf ' Start - %s ' " $ 1 " sleep " $ 1 " printf '%s - End
' " $ 1 " } export -f slowprint seq 10 | xargs - n1 - I {} - P4 bash -c " slowprint {} " # Compare to no parallelization seq 10 | xargs - n1 - I {} bash -c " slowprint {} " #
Be sure to see the warnings in the next Pitfall !
Outputs from the parallel jobs are mixed together , because each job consists of two ( or more ) separate write ( ) calls .
If you need the outputs unmixed , it is therefore recommended to use a tool that guarantees output will be serialized ( such as GNU Parallel ) .
For further details see a demonstration of the mixing problem .
52 . find .
- exec sh -c ' echo {} ' \;
This command contains a CodeInjection vulnerability .
The filename that is found by find is injected into a shell command and parsed by sh .
If the filename contains shell metacharacters like ; or $ ( ... ) then the filename may be executed as code by `sh ' .
The " slowprint " example in the previous Pitfall would have been a CodeInjection bug if the input were n't guaranteed to be integers .
To be more precise , POSIX find does not specify whether an argument which contains more than just {} is expanded .
GNU find allows this CodeInjection to occur .
Other implementations choose a safer path :
# uname -a HP - UX imadev B.10.20 A 9000/785 2008897791 two -user license # find / dev / null - exec sh -c ' echo {} ' \ ; {}
The correct approach is to separate the filename argument from the script argument :
find .
- exec sh -c ' echo " $ 1 " ' x {} \ ;
53 . sudo mycmd > / myfile
Redirection is done before the command is executed .
Usually that does n't matter , but with sudo we have a command being executed as a different user than the redirection .
If the redirection must be executed with sudo - granted privileges , then you need a wrapper :
sudo sh -c ' mycmd > / myfile '
Instead of a wrapper you can use tee :
mycmd | sudo tee / myfile >/dev/null
This may be easier to write if mycmd has a lot of quoting .
54 . sudo ls / foo /*
This is very similar to the previous pitfall .
Globbing is also done before the command is executed .
If the directory is n't readable by your normal user privileges , then you may need the globbing to be done in a shell that has the sudo - granted privileges :
sudo sh -c 'ls / foo /*'
55 . myprogram 2 >&-
Do not close stdin , stdout or stderr as a " shorthand " for redirecting to / dev/null .
Write it out correctly .
myprogram 2>/dev/null
Why ?
Consider what happens when your program tries to write an error message to stderr .
If stderr has been redirected to / dev/null , the write succeeds , and your program is free to carry on , secure in the knowledge that it has diligently reported the error condition .
But if stderr has been closed , then the write will fail .
At that point , your program may do something unpredictable .
It may carry on and ignore the failure , or it may immediately exit , considering the execution environment so broken that it cannot safely continue .
Or whatever else the programmer decided the program should do when its world has become a dystopian hell .
All programs are assured that stdin , stdout and stderr will exist and will be readable / writable in an appropriate and reasonable manner .
By closing one of them , you have violated your promise to this program .
This is not acceptable .
Of course , an even better solution would be to actually log the errors somewhere , so you can go back and read them and figure out what 's wrong .
56 .
Using xargs without - 0
xargs splits on whitespace .
This is unfortunate because whitespace is allowed in filenames and commonly used by GUI users .
xargs also treats ' and " specially , which can also lead to problems :
touch Dad\'s\ \ " famous\ " \ 1 \ '\ pizza.txt touch Dad\'s\ 12 \ " \ records .
txt touch 2 \ " x1 \ '\ wood .
txt touch 2 \ " x4 \ " \ wood.txt
Here xargs warns :
# Do not do this $ find .
- type f | xargs wc xargs : unmatched single quote ; by default quotes are special to xargs unless you use the - 0 option
Here xargs does not warn at all :
# Do not do this echo * | xargs wc find * famous * - type f | xargs wc find * 4 * - type f | xargs wc
Instead use xargs - 0 :
# Do this instead printf '% s\0 ' * | xargs - 0 wc find .
- type f - name '* famous * ' - print0 | xargs - 0 wc find .
- type f - name '* 4 * ' - exec wc {} +
If using - 0 is not simple , an alternative is to use GNU Parallel , which splits on
.
And while
is also allowed in filenames they never occur unless your users are malicious .
In any case :
If you use xargs without - 0 put a comment in your code explaining why that is safe in your particular situation .
57 . unset a [ 0 ]
When passing an indexed array element to unset , it needs to be quoted .
Otherwise , it may be treated as a glob , and expanded against the files in the current directory .
If there happens to be a file named a0 then the glob is expanded to a0 and you end up executing unset a0 .
unset ' a [ 0 ] '
#
Always quote indexed array elements when unsetting .
Calling date multiple times is a bad idea .
Imagine what happens if the first call occurs a millisecond before midnight on April 30 , and the second call occurs a millisecond after midnight on May 1 .
You would end up with month=04 and day=01 .
It 's better to call date one time , retrieving all of the fields you want in a single invocation .
A common idiom for that :
eval " $( date +' month= % m day= %d year= %Y dayname= " %A " monthname= " % B " ' ) "
Or with bash 's ( 4.2 or above ) printf builtin :
printf -v d '% ( month= % m day= %d year= %Y dayname= " %A " monthname= " % B " ) T ' eval " $ d "
Remember things like month or day names are locale - dependent , hence the quotes around % A or % B to avoid problems in locales where day or month names contain spaces or other special characters for the shell .
Or , you may retrieve a timestamp in epoch format ( seconds since the start of 1970 ) , and then use that to generate human - readable date / time fields as needed .
# Requires bash 4.2 or above printf - v now '% ( %s ) T '
- 1 # Or now=$EPOCHSECONDS in bash 5.0 # - 1 may be omitted in 4.3 or above printf - v month '% ( % m ) T' " $ now " printf - v day '% ( %d ) T ' " $ now "
If your system 's strftime ( ) does n't support %s , you can get the epoch time with :
now= $ ( awk ' BEGIN{srand ( ) ; print srand ( ) } ' )
59 . i= $ (( 10 #$ i ) )
Forced base 10 interpretation only works with signless numbers .
As long as $ i contains a string of digits with no leading - or + , everything is fine .
But if $ i might be negative , this conversion could fail , either noisily ( with an error message ) , or even worse , silently ( simply yielding the wrong result ) .
If there 's any chance $ i could be negative , use this instead :
i=$ (( $ {i % %[!+-]*}10#${i#[-+]} ) )

60 . set -euo pipefail
There are many pitfalls to enabling these options at the start of a script .
60.1 . errexit
errexit ( set - e ) tries to abort the script when an error occurs , which sounds like a good idea at first , but it has very intricate rules regarding when to abort on error or not .
Some of the main problems with errexit are
It 's not actually possible for the shell to detect errors .
All it has to go on is a command 's exit status .
When commands fail , they normally return a non -zero exit status , but many commands also use the exit status to convey a true / false value .
Examples of such commands are test , [ , [ [ ... ] ] , ( (... ) ) , and grep .
When a command you test with if or && or || is a function , set -e ignores non -zero exit statuses of commands in that function .
Consider a function like # WRONG cleanup ( ) { cd " $ 1 " rm -f ./* }
If that cd command fails , you definitely do n't want that rm command to run , and with a simple use of the function when errexit is enabled , that happens to be the case : set -e cleanup ( ) { cd " $ 1 " printf ' Oops !
' } cleanup / no / longer / there # scriptname : cd : / no / longer / there :
No such file or directory
But then later you decide to add a custom error message cleanup / no / longer / there 2 >/ dev/ null || { printf >& 2 ' Cleanup failed
' exit 1 } # scriptname : cd : / no / longer / there :
No such file or directory # Oops !
cd is being run in a context where it 's tested , even though it 's not at all apparent inside the function definition where the line is located .
The correct way , with or without errexit , is to explicitly check if cd failed or not # Right cleanup ( ) { cd " $ 1 " || return rm -f ./* }
But then later you decide to add a custom error message Command substitution disables errexit .
Consider the following example function that mimics a realpath command : set -e realdir ( ) { cd " $ 1 " pwd - P } realdir / no / such / dir # scriptname : cd : /no/such / dir
It aborted on the failing cd command , but if you try to capture its output , then cd 's failure is ignored dir= $ ( realdir / no/such / dir ) # scriptname : cd : / no / such / dir printf ' dir is <%s >
' " $ dir " # dir is < /home / user >
The correct way is again to explicitly check if cd failed or not , regardless of whether you use errexit # Right realdir ( ) { cd " $ 1 " || return pwd - P }
See
Why does n't set -e ( or set -o errexit , or trap ERR ) do what I expected ?.
60.2 . pipefail
Normally , the exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command of that pipeline .
With pipefail , if any part of the pipeline returns non-zero , the whole pipeline returns non-zero .
This may sound like a good idea , but it 's actually normal for commands earlier in a pipeline to exit non-zero without it being an error .
Consider the following example
if some_command | grep -q foo ; then printf ' foo found
' else printf ' foo not found
' fi
If pipefail is enabled , the above will sometimes claim " foo not found " even when foo was found .
grep -q foo returns 0 to indicate that at least one line matches the pattern , else it returns 1 to indicate that no lines matched the pattern .
Since -q ( quiet ) causes grep to not output the matching lines , it does n't actually need to read the whole stream ; it 's enough to find at least one line that matches the pattern .
A typical grep implementation will thus exit with status 0 as soon as it found the first matching line .
The some_command on the other end of the pipeline will not know that .
It only sees its end of the pipe , it does not see what is on the other end .
When it tries to write the next chunk of data to the pipe , and the pipe is closed in the other end , the system will send some_command a SIGPIPE signal to tell it that it can no longer write to the pipe .
The default action to take when SIGPIPE is received is to exit with a non -zero status .
This means that the whole pipeline returns non-zero , and the else branch is executed , even though it successfully found a matching line .
If you know that each part of a pipeline beyond the first will consume all their input , pipefail is safe and often a good choice , but it should not be enabled globally , only enabled for pipelines where it makes sense , and disabled afterwards .
60.3 . nounset
nounset ( set - u ) is the least bad of the three options , but has its fair share of gotchas too .
If the goal is to catch typoed variable names , shellcheck does a better job at detecting those .
See
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using set -u ( or set -o nounset ) ?

Myths , half - truths and wives ’ tales persist in medicine .
Sometimes doctors and nurses believe things that are n’t true or at least are unproven .
That ’s the focus of a new book , “ Do n’t Swallow Your Gum !
Myths , Half - Truths and Outright Lies About Your Body and Health , ” by Dr. Aaron E. Carroll and Dr. Rachel C. Vreeman .
Dr. Carroll and Dr. Vreeman , both from the Indiana University School of Medicine , have written a lot about medical myths and misunderstandings .
In December 2007 , the pair published an article in the British Medical Journal about seven medical myths even doctors believe .
A year later , they identified six medical myths for the holiday season .
Now , “ Do n’t Swallow Your Gum ” offers a fun collection of numerous medical myths that are likely familiar to most of us .
The book is organized to focus on various types of myths , including myths about your body ( you should poop at least once a day ) , myths about disease and illness ( cold weather makes you sick ) , myths about sex and pregnancy ( twins skip a generation ) and myths about what we eat and drink ( gum stays in your stomach for seven years . )
It ’s a fun read , and chances are you will stumble across several medical myths you ’ve always believed .
Here are a few medical myths that may surprise you :
1 . Cold weather makes you sick .
In studies of cold transmission , people who are chilled are no more likely to get sick than those who were not .
It may be that cold weather keeps people indoors , where germs are more likely to catch up with you .
2. Green mucus indicates a sinus infection .
The importance of mucus color is a medical myth even doctors believe , the authors say .
“ There is no evidence … that antibiotics shorten the duration of an illness when green snot is a symptom , ” they write .
3 . You lose most of your body heat through your head .
There is nothing special about the head and heat loss .
You will lose heat through any uncovered body part .
4 . Milk makes you phlegmy .
In a study of 330 patients , nearly two out of three believed milk increases phlegm production .
But it ’s not true .
In one experiment , volunteers were infected with the cold virus , and some of them drank a lot of milk as well .
The weight of the nasal secretions did not increase in those who drank more milk , nor was it associated with cough or congestion .
5 . Cracking your knuckles will cause arthritis .
Knuckle - crackers are no more likely to have arthritis than those who do n’t make annoying popping sounds with their fingers .
6 . Birth control pills do n’t work as well with antibiotics .
A review of the literature concluded that common antibiotics do n’t affect birth control pills .
“ It is much more important to take your birth control pill every day at the same time than to spend time worrying about your antibiotics , ” the authors write .
7. Singles have better sex lives than married people .
You may think your bachelor friends are having all the fun , but single people also go through a lot of dry spells when they are n’t dating anyone .
The result — married people typically have more sex in a given year than single people .
In one survey , 43 percent of married men reported having sex two to three times per week , compared to only 26 percent of single men .
The numbers were slightly lower but similar for women .
Married people are also more likely to have orgasms and give and receive oral sex .
8. Sugar makes kids hyper .
Numerous studies show sugar does n’t affect behavior , but most parents do n’t believe this .
In one study , parents were told their kids had sugar and they were more likely to report problem behavior — but in reality , the kids had consumed a sugar - free drink .
9 . You should poop at least once a day .
A half - truth , say the authors .
Regular bowel movements prevent discomfort and constipation , but a perfectly healthy person may not move their bowels every day .
Constipation is defined as having fewer than three stools per week .
10 .
It ’s okay to double dip in the chip dip .
In one study , scientists took a bite of cracker and then dipped it into salsa , cheese dip , chocolate syrup and water .
They did the same test with a fresh , unbitten cracker .
Then they measured bacteria in the dips and the volunteers ’ mouths .
On average , three to six double dips transferred about 10,000 bacteria from the eater ’s mouth to the dip .
And each cracker picked up between one and two grams of dip .
Salsa picked up the most germs from double dipping .
11 . Food quickly picked up from the floor is safe to eat .
Scientists have put the commonly - cited five - second rule to the test .
They found that food that comes into contact with a tile or wood floor does pick up large amounts of bacteria .
Food does n’t pick up many germs when it hits carpet , but it does pick up carpet fuzz .
A Portland police officer placed sexually harassing calls on his bureau - issued cell phone to three female police officers and a number of other women , including a 16 - year - old girl he had encountered as a patrol officer , according to court documents .
Joseph E. Wild , 28 , a Portland Police Bureau veteran of four years , pleaded not guilty to 20 counts of telephonic harassment and 41 counts of official misconduct in a Multnomah County courtroom Monday afternoon .
Investigators said in an affidavit that on several occasions , Wild placed sexually explicit calls to three female Portland police officers who were in training at the state police academy in Salem .
He placed the calls on his cell phone during his regular patrol shifts , according to court documents .
The documents also allege Wild has harassed civilians he aided .
A 16 - year - old girl reported to police she received phone calls from a man she did not know , who claimed he had had sex with her March 24 .
The girl said she had been intoxicated that day and did n't remember any sexual contact .
Detectives traced the phone call to Wild 's cell phone and discovered the officer had taken the girl to a facility for missing juveniles after receiving a radio call about an intoxicated person .
While searching Wild 's cell phone records , they found 50 phone calls between February and April 2009 had been placed to a phone number belonging to a 14 - year - old girl .
When detectives interviewed her , the girl said she had received numerous phone calls from a man who had made sexual statements that frightened her and made her cry .
Nineteen of the 20 counts of harassment against Wild are for calls made to the 14 - year - old .
Wild 's phone records also brought detectives to a female victim of a domestic violence call that Wild had apparently responded to because he had written down information about the incident in his field notebook .
When detectives contacted the woman , she told them she had received phone calls from a man she did not know who threatened to " come to her house and rape her , " the court documents said .
In another phone call shortly after , the man told her he was in her basement .
The woman told police she was alone in the house with her daughter at the time and was extremely frightened .
According to the affidavit , Wild placed eight calls to the woman over 27 minutes .
All the victims reported that the phone calls were unwanted and sexual in nature .
During an interview between detectives and Wild on May 4 , he reportedly admitted to placing the phone calls to the female officers and to ignoring their requests to stop calling .
Wild was arrested Friday .
During the arraignment , Circuit Judge Julia Philbrook said she had reviewed the court documents and " would not be surprised " if more charges were brought against Wild .
On Monday , Wild was still an employee of the city of Portland , according to police spokeswoman Detective Mary Wheat ; he requested a court - appointed lawyer at the arraignment .
Scott Westerman , president of the Portland Police Association , was in attendance at the arraignment , but refused to comment about the case .
" We 're here to show Joey a friendly face , " Westerman said .
" But as far as the allegations are concerned , the union does not have a particular role in it at this time . "
Wild is being held in the Multnomah County Jail in lieu of $ 132,500 bail .
Wheat said despite the investigation into Wild , residents of Portland should not feel apprehensive about police officers .
" All organizations from time to time have issues with employees , " Wheat said .
" We want to make sure the public can feel safe with Portland police officers . "

Advertisement Bomb attacks in the capital Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq have killed at least 29 people and wounded 75 , police say .
In the latest attack , a roadside bomb killed four people in a marketplace in Baghdad 's Husseiniya district .
Other victims included three students on their way to sit exams and a child of four .
More than 70 people died in a truck bombing in Kirkuk on Saturday .
The attacks come days before US troops are scheduled to pull out of Iraq 's towns and cities .
With so many attacks in such a short space of time , it appears insurgents are determined to make things look as unstable as possible as the pull - out deadline approaches , the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki urged Iraqis on Saturday : " Do n't lose heart if a breach of security occurs here or there . "
He said the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq 's towns and cities by the end of this month would be a " great victory " .
Ending operations
Police reported at least half a dozen bomb explosions in different parts of Baghdad and outlying areas with the number of people killed in each ranging between two and seven , with many others injured .
Monday 's deadliest attack was caused by a suicide car bomb at municipal offices in Abu Ghraib , just west of Baghdad .
Seven people died and 13 were wounded , police said .
A roadside bomb tore through a minibus carrying students to sit their exams in Baghdad 's Shia neighbourhood of Sadr City .
Three students died and 12 others as well as the driver were wounded in the rush - hour attack .
Another roadside bomb killed three people and wounded 30 near a market in the Shaab district of north Baghdad .
A woman and a four - year - old child were among the dead , the AFP news agency reports .
Five people were killed and 20 wounded by a parked car bomb in central Baghdad 's Karrada district .
Gunmen killed at least four people in separate attacks in the northern city of Mosul .
Three soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in Diyala province , north - east of Iraq .
Most of the 133,000 US troops are due to have moved from Iraq 's cities and towns to military bases by 30 June .
The withdrawal is part of an agreement that will see combat operations across Iraq end by September 2010 and all US troops out of the country by the end of 2011 .

A suggestion by the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary that terrorists have routinely entered the United States through Canada — including the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks — caused a kerfuffle in Washington Tuesday .
Janet Napolitano made the comment in an interview Monday with CBC's Washington correspondent , Neil Macdonald .
In the interview , Macdonald asked Napolitano to clarify comments she made last month that the Canadian and Mexican borders must be treated equally .
" Yes , Canada is not Mexico .
It does n't have a drug war going on ; it did n't have 6,000 homicides that were drug - related last year , " Napolitano said .
" Nonetheless , to the extent that terrorists have come into our country or suspected or known terrorists have entered our country across a border , it 's been across the Canadian border .
There are real issues there . "
When Macdonald asked if she was referring to the 9/11 perpetrators , Napolitano answered : " Not just those but others as well . "
Wilson ' frustrated ' by comments
That prompted Michael Wilson , Canada 's ambassador to the United States , to set the record straight Tuesday .
Wilson told reporters at the Border Trade Alliance meeting in Washington , where he was keynote speaker , that he is " frustrated " that the 9/11 myth has surfaced yet again .
" Unfortunately , misconceptions arise on something as fundamental as where the 9/11 terrorists came from , " he said .
" As the 9/11 commission reported in 2004 , all of the 9/11 terrorists arrived in the United States from outside North America .
They flew to major U.S. airports .
They entered the U.S. with documents issued by the United States government , and no 9/11 terrorists came from Canada . "
Napolitano misunderstood question , handlers say
In response to Wilson , Napolitano 's handlers said she had misunderstood Macdonald 's question and was referring to Ahmed Ressam , the would - be bomber referred to as " the millennium bomber . "
Ressam was arrested in December 1999 at Port Angeles , Wash. , with homemade explosives in his rental car .
He was later convicted of plotting to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport .
Napolitano issued a statement later Tuesday to clarify her remarks .
While she knows no 9/11 terrorists entered the U.S. through Canada , she said , " there are other instances … when suspected terrorists have attempted to enter our country from Canada to the United States .
" Some of these are well known to the public , such as the millennium bomber , while others are not due to security reasons . "
Wilson said he was satisfied with the clarification but still wants a face - to - face meeting with Napolitano .
Napolitano digs deeper hole
But then , Napolitano appeared to make matters worse by explaining to the border conference Tuesday why the Canada and Mexico borders should be treated equally .
" The fact of the matter is that Canada allows people into its country that we do not allow into ours , " she said .
" That 's why you have to have a border , and you have to have border policies that make sense . "
Liberal MP John McKay , who was at the conference , said Napolitano 's comments alarmed him .
" If you are , in fact , negotiating a managed border , and your negotiating partner believes a set of mythology , then you have problems , " he said " You try to work on the basis of fact , not on the basis of myth . "
Saying Canada is lax about whom it allows into the country is " plain nonsense , " he added .
" I have a heavily immigrant riding , and I do visas all day every day , and one of the most difficult things I have to explain to my constituents is why is it that the United States granted a multiple - entry visa to the relatives but Canada won't , " said McKay , who represents the Toronto - area Scarborough - Guildwood riding .
In the past , other high - profile U.S. politicians have also suggested a link between terrorists and the Canadian border , including Napolitano 's predecessor , Michael Chertoff , who said last year that more than a dozen suspected extremists had been caught trying to enter the U.S. via Canada .
When she was senator , Hillary Clinton said tighter security was needed at the Canada - U.S. border because of 9/11 .
A six - year - old B.C. boy has died after spending more than an hour and a half in the icy waters near North Vancouver 's popular Lynn Valley Suspension Bridge .
The child was in cardiac arrest and showing signs of hypothermia when he was rescued from the water Sunday afternoon .
He was hiking with his stepmother when he fell into the fast - moving Lynn Creek near the ranger station in Lynn Headwaters Regional Park , north of the suspension bridge around 1:45 p.m .
He was only wearing beige pants when he was swept downstream towards the suspension bridge .
The RCMP , North Vancouver fire department and B.C. Ambulance all attended the scene , while crews scoured the water 's edge for any sign of the boy .
Tim Jones of North Shore Search and Rescue was flying over the area in a helicopter with a rescue team .
" We went low into the creek and on our first pass we spotted the boy , " Jones said .
" One of the rescuers in the helicopter with me was in a swift water suit .
We lowered him down right into the creek .
We jumped out and he grabbed the boy . "
The young boy was airlifted to B.C. Children 's Hospital in Vancouver , where he was initially listed in serious condition .
Police confirm he has since passed away .
About 80 people drown each year in B.C. , and the area around Lynn Valley is well known for its popular cliff diving spots and hiking trails .
A Flock of Fanatics Tweet Bill Barr is fond of blaming “ militant secularists ” for all of society ’s ills , which result from unbridled “ individual rapacity , ” and insisting on a faith - based “ natural law ” as the only way to control these instincts .
Fun fact : Did you know Bill Barr is worth $ 40 million ?
After serving in the first Bush administration , he went to work for Verizon ( then GTE ) , and when he retired , received a $ 17.1 million income deferral payment and a $ 10.4 million separation payment according to Forbes .
Is it just me , or do I detect a little unbridled individual rapacity ?

I almost missed this bit about FEC chair James Trainor III making some very unsettling remarks that sound suspiciously like , oh , a theocrat trying to establish a state religion .
Anyway , he ’s only in charge of the election — no biggie .
And for more on Judge Amy Coney Barrett , Ms. Magazine has a rundown , including the source of that quote .
The secretive sect she belongs to believes that women are spiritually inferior to men .
As one former member put it , “ [ Husband and wife ] cannot meet as equals , because the husband always has divine authority on his side . ”
Okay , then .

The Sorensen Monologues
Find the villains
One of the standard techniques of authoritarians is to invert the reality of who is doing the most harm in a given conflict .
Police who abuse their power are portrayed as restoring law and order in the face of chaotic mobs .
Scale is distorted ; actual cases of destructive protesters ( or bad actors trying to make protesters look bad ) are given constant attention , ignoring the overwhelming majority of peaceful activists .
Fox and Tucker Carlson and many other American right - wing figures are literally operating at the level of Belarusian authoritarianism , using the same arguments and distortions and defenses of indefensible police and vigilante violence .

Honest Headlines
News broke a week ago that the Trump campaign did , in fact , collude with Russia in 2016 .
You ’ll recall that when the Mueller Report came out , Bill Barr generated massive headlines with his false summary of the findings .
Now that we have damning evidence — from the Republican - led Senate , no less ! — no one cares .
It disappeared from the headlines within a day .
The top story on the NYT shortly afterwards was about blood plasma .
It goes without saying that a blockbuster report showing Hillary Clinton colluded with Russian intelligence to win a US election would not disappear so quickly .

Home of the grave The Vanity Fair article referenced in the last panel is here .
Key paragraphs : … the prospect of launching a large - scale national plan was losing favor , said one public health expert in frequent contact with the White House ’s official coronavirus task force .
Most troubling of all , perhaps , was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner ’s team expressed : that because the virus had hit blue states hardest , a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically .
“ The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states , that they could blame those governors , and that would be an effective political strategy , ” said the expert .
That logic may have swayed Kushner .
“ It was very clear that Jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [ plan ] was going to come out , ” the expert said .
That anyone on the White House pandemic team would suggest this is beyond scandalous .
And yet , how many people know about this story ?

Immunity Impunity According to Ian Millhiser on Vox , the Republican bill places a “ wide array of obstacles before workers and consumers who allege that they were infected due to a business ’s negligence — or even against plaintiffs who allege they were infected because of truly reckless behavior by a business . ”
It also , breathtakingly , “ allows businesses to sue — and collect damages and attorney ’s fees from — anyone who so much as writes a letter to a business demanding compensation for certain Covid - 19 - related legal violations , if the allegations in that letter are later deemed ‘ meritless . ’
And it allows the United States attorney general to sue law firms , unions , and other entities that are ‘ engaged in a pattern or practice ’ of seeking compensation for similar violations . ”
So if you merely try to hold a business accountable , they can sue your pants off .
Brilliant !
Now for the kicker :
Do you know what this bill is called ?
The SAFE TO WORK Act !
You ca n’t make this stuff up !
( Actually , you can , and George Orwell did . )

An amnesty for an estimated 618,000 ­illegal immigrants in Britain would provide a £ 3bn boost to the economy , ­according to a London School of Economics study commissioned by the London mayor , Boris Johnson .
The study , published last night by the London assembly , dismisses fears that an amnesty would trigger ­further large - scale illegal migration , arguing that ­Britain 's border controls would be an effective deterrent .
" So , far from a financial burden , as some suggest , this new research has found an amnesty could be worth up to £ 3bn a year to the country 's economy , " the study said .
Johnson welcomed the report , saying it had introduced some hard evidence and academic rigour into a debate dominated for too long by myth and anecdote .
The research estimated there are 618,000 illegal migrants in Britain , with more than two - thirds , 442,000 , in ­London .
But if their position was ­regularised , £ 846 m a year would be raised in taxes .
The short - term public sector costs of giving them indefinite leave to remain in Britain at about £ 410 m a year , according to the study , rising to a possible £ 1bn a year in the long term if they received welfare benefits and public sector housing .
The study found that about two - thirds of those living in Britain as illegal migrants would be eligible for an amnesty which granted legal status to those who have been resident for at least five years as part of a regularisation programme .
The detailed estimates suggest that regularisation could raise an individual 's earnings by 25 % and employment rates by 6 % , and imply an additional £ 3bn a year boost to national gross domestic product .
Johnson first called for an amnesty for long - term migrants last April .
It provoked accusations of naivety from Phil Woolas , the immigration minister , and claims that it would lead to more people - trafficking .
The study says amnesties and regularisation programmes have been common in many countries in recent years , including the US , France , Spain , Italy and Greece .
The LSE research came as a Commons public accounts committee report showed it would be at least another four years before the UK Border Agency reached its " optimum capacity " to remove failed ­asylum seekers .
Only 12,000 were removed last year .
The MPs ' report said Home Office staff on asylum cases are still using fax machines , paper files and handwritten interview notes and will not have a better IT system until 2013 .
It will also take four years to expand the availability of detention spaces to the 4,000 needed to step up the pace of removals .
The Home Office told the MPs that it was on track to finish working through the backlog of 400,000 to 450,000 cases , some of which date back years .
The backlog will finally be cleared by 2011 .
Edward Leigh , chairman of the public accounts committee , said : " The process of coming to decisions on whether to grant asylum is still too slow . "

Stacking Food on Animals , Freaky Video .
I wished I lived in Japan so this stuff would be on all day long .
what is going through the poor animals heads ?
Part of me thinks they are thinking “ LUNCH ! “ , the other part of me is thinking they are thinking “ Am I the only one who thinks this is crazy ? ”
It has n't always been this way .
Once upon a time , my living room was a sanctuary : a safe , peaceful place , a comforting cocoon that stood as a serene retreat at the end of the working day .
It was calm .
It was decorated in a simple , straightforward style .
It was a place I came to relax .
It was not a place I came to make use of an imitation Fender Stratocaster , 3D goggles , and an oversized red beanbag with integrated speakers .
But like millions of others , I have fallen victim to the cult of the video game accessory .
In the world of the gaming geek , life was simple : whether swinging a tennis racket or firing a gun , all you had to do was press a button .
These days , you have to swing a tennis racket or fire a gun .
The result ?
We 're knackered .
Our credit cards are close to melting .
And our homes look as if they 've been decorated by hyperactive four - year - olds given unfettered access to Piet Mondrian 's paintbox .
It 's all an awfully long way from Space Invaders .

" A lot of people 's living rooms are full up with a lot of crap , " admits Tim Ingham , editor of industry bible MCV .
" You can turn your console off , but you 've still got plastic drums , a plastic guitar , a dance mat , Wii Fit , a steering wheel .
You basically have to throw your sofa away to fit it all in . "
Not so long ago , it was quite possible to enjoy the full range of the console experience with nothing more than a nondescript grey box and a couple of sophisticated remote controls .
But over the last few years , the peripheral has become the games industry 's great cash cow .
In the US , sales of gaming accessories went from $ 1.4bn in 2006 to $ 2.57 bn last year .
On this side of the Atlantic , they have soared from £ 319 m in 2006 to £ 707 m last year .
We are a nation with a new addiction to plastic tat .
But teenage boys , loyal customers though they are , can't on their own account for that startling change .
The new gaming order has a lot more to do with their sisters , their little brothers – and even their mums and dads .
And with that broadening of the target audience has come an enormous increase in potential profit .
" It 's a market everyone 's trying to get into , " says Nick Gibson , an analyst at Games Investor Consulting .
" Most of the larger publishers are scrambling for a piece of it .
These peripherals that are n't based around the traditional joypad break down barriers for a whole new kind of user . "
This year , DJing and skateboarding will be added to the range of physical activities you never thought you 'd do on your own in your front room .
Tony Hawk : Ride and DJ
Hero are amongst the most eagerly - anticipated games of the year .
The appeal , of course , has little to do with either game 's internal mechanics .
There have been plenty of – well – pedestrian skateboarding games that no - one gave two hoots about , and the main reason no - one has made a DJing game before now is that , out of context , there is nothing at all fun about watching a little digital person put on a new song just because you told him to .
But introduce an actual board , or a set of decks , and all that changes .
Suddenly the game 's narrow conceit is retooled in a way that makes it possible , if you have a couple of drinks and engage your imagination and half - shut your eyes and close the curtains , to pretend you really are wowing the crowd with your kickflip or your scratching .
It 's far from a new concept – back in 1984 , the thoroughly underwhelming NES title Duck Hunt flew the flag for light - gun enthusiasts everywhere , and a Japanese title called Guitar Freaks tried to colonise the territory that later music titles made their own in 1989 .
The difference is , this time it 's cool .
The sleek design most accessories now bear is a million miles from the clunky light guns of yore ; and crucially , the songs you can play and the stars you can pretend to be are instantly credible .
" It 's about letting people know what kind of interaction they can have right away , " says Alex Wiltshire , online editor of Edge magazine .
" They know what the game is going to be about .
Guitar
Hero would n't be fun playing on a pad – it would just be abstract . "
Guitar
Hero is , of course , one of the two unmissable landmarks in this new epoch : the other is the Wii .
The remarkable thing is how entirely unheralded both concepts were .
Why , the gaming cognoscenti sneered , would anyone want to put their joypad buttons on the end of a silly little plastic guitar ?
And why would anyone give up the infinitely superior processing power of an Xbox 360 or a Playstation 3 in favour of waving their arms about in front of the technically limited Nintendo equivalent ?
The thing is , the gaming cognoscenti does not have a particularly strong overlap with the mainstream cognoscenti .
It 's that lack of intersection that goes a long way towards explaining how the perceived wisdom was so utterly wrong .
Thanks to people who did n't particularly like computer games , but did quite like having a laugh with their mates after a night at the pub , Guitar Hero has now sold an eye - popping $ 2bn worth of units worldwide ; and last year , Nintendo sold £ 481 m worth of Wiis , putting them £ 38 m ahead of Microsoft and £ 147 m ahead of Sony .
The commercial benefits to be gleaned from exploiting such a market are , of course , huge .
Swathes of coveted floorspace at shops like HMV and Game are now devoted to accessories , and their online competitors are scrambling to catch up .
" Gaming is definitely a very big area for us now , " says Claire Wood , PR manager at gadget retailer Firebox .
" It 's becoming such a lucrative industry , and there are more and more niche accessories becoming available . "
Niche is right .
In its range , Firebox includes a £ 250 gaming drum kit , some deeply geeky 3D video goggles , and a frankly terrifying vibrating vest , lest anyone should feel insufficiently traumatised by the violence of their favourite shoot - em - up .
Another online emporium , MadCatz , will sell you a range of wholly unnecessary plug-ins for Guitar Hero and Rock Band , from the aforementioned imitation Stratocaster to a microphone stand with special control pad attachments .
Nor are these gizmos at the extreme verge of gaming extras : you can get golf clubs , and special vibrating chairs , and windbreaks for that mic .
I promise I am not making any of this up .
" It reaches a point where it perplexes me , " says Tim Ingham .
" For the amount you 're spending on console extras you could be setting up a home studio and learning to play the guitar for real . "
It does n't take a genius to surmise the commercial logic behind this .
Besides opening up the games market to a whole new audience , such accoutrements also have the benefit of being , generally speaking , cheap to produce , and yet bafflingly expensive to the consumer , who does n't seem to have noticed the scam .
" All the consumer gets is a lump of plastic , " says Ingham .
" You might think , why are you paying 70 quid for this ?
But the fact is the player does n't view it that way . "
Ingham points to the UK release of Guitar Hero rival Rock Band , which sparked much dark muttering about a consumer revolt when EA sold it for significantly more here than it did in the US .
" But it turns out the general UK consumer is n't that desperate for a cheap product .
Core gamers are annoyed by the pricing , there 's no question .
They have always grumbled and they will continue to do so , but they will still be the bread and butter of the industry .
The only people any of the games publishers are worried about alienating are the new gamers . "
It 's depressing news for committed games players , then , who can look forward to being treated like mugs for the foreseeable future , and who have no one to blame but themselves .
There are consolations , of course : it should not be forgotten that plenty of these games are brilliant , and that this has as much to do with their success as the accoutrements do .
And no - one is obliged to buy any of this stuff , after all .
Already , the plug - in peripheral looks like it might be on the verge of being superseded .
The launch at industry fair E3 of Microsoft and Sony 's highly - sophisticated " Wii Killer " set - top cameras seem to promise a means of playing games without having to contend with any kind of gadget at all .
Looking around the detritus strewn across my living room , that certainly sounds like a blessing .
Still , for some of us , even that degree of freedom will be unwelcome .
For us , gaming will always , in the end , be primarily about sitting hunched over a glorified keyboard getting blisters from hammering away at the buttons slightly harder than necessary .
" The controller can still deliver gaming experiences that are vital and can't be taken over by other things , " says Alex Wiltshire .
" There 's something about a joystick that still works . "
What 's in Archie 's living room
Aviator Joystick
Ah , this is more like it .
Saitek 's good old - fashioned Aviator Joystick ( £ 39.99 ) lets you pretend you 're a real pilot .
Confusion awaits those who use it in a car racing game .
Imitation full - sized Fender Stratocaster
An imitation full - size Fender Stratocaster , available from Mad Catz , is , of course , a ridiculous indulgence at £ 68.50 .
But that 's the whole point , is n't it ?
What could be cooler ?
Apart from a real one that you could actually play , of course .
Slouchpod
Should your television be insufficiently noisy , try the Slouchpod , a beanbag with integrated speakers that makes the sounds of gunfire and guitars alike horribly close .
Not a total snip at £ 119 , but you can sit on it when the console 's off , too .
i Wear
Vuzix 's astonishing iWear plugs into your PC or console , and creates the impression of an enormous , 3D screen .
They start at £ 149.95 from Firebox , so maybe consider the red and green plastic alternative .
Mad Catz 's mic stand
If you find your musical experience is lacking something , you probably need one of Mad Catz 's mic stands , for £ 19.99 : silly as you might feel , it means you can warble to your heart 's content at the same time as strumming chords .

A game requiring sharp senses and a very steady hand .
Played by placing one hand flat on a surface such as a table with the fingers splayed widely , and then using the free hand to jab a knife in the empty spaces between the fingers on the table as quickly as possible .
Different patterns are acceptable , though most commonly done from one side of the hand to the other and back again .
Often played under circumstances of extreme drunkeness , boredom , or both .

In a move that is certain to fuel more controversy , the Obama administration has turned down former vice president Dick Cheney ’s request for the release of two memos that he believes will prove the effectiveness of harsh interrogation tactics .
CIA ’s Information and Privacy Coordinator , Delores M. Nelson denied Cheney ’s request because the memos are part of ongoing litigation , “ In researching the information in question , we have discovered that it is currently the subject of pending FOIA litigation ( Bloche v. Department of Defense , Amnesty International v. Central Intelligence Agency ) .
Therefore , the document is excluded from Mandatory Declassification Review . ”
Cheney has repeated made the claim that these magic memos will prove that torture works .
As he told Fox News , “ I have n’t talked about it , but I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw , that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country .
I ’ve now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was . ”

This decision is sure to set the right wing into full conspiracy mode , but the evidence is piling up against these memos .
The FBI interrogator Ali Soufan directly refuted Cheney ’s torture claims during congressional testimony yesterday .
I think that we all should be a little skeptical of these memos , because if they actually proved the effectiveness of the techniques , the Bush administration would have leaked them years ago .
The Bush / Cheney team constantly leaked any information that supported their position , so it is very hard to believe that somehow they managed to keep this one bit of information secret .
Over the past two days , it has become clear that the Obama administration is trying to bury the torture debate .
They ticked off the left with their reversal on the photos yesterday , and today they anger the right by not releasing these memos .
The motive behind their behavior in both cases is that they want to get past the torture debate .
What harm would there be in giving Roy Criner another trial ?
Interview with Judge Sharon Keller , Texas Court of Criminal Appeals .
She wrote the majority opinion in the Roy Criner case , ruling that new tests which showed DNA evidence in the rape and murder case was not Criner 's did n't warrant granting Criner a new trial A lot of things must be considered before giving someone another trial .
Finality of judgements is important .
. .
At best , DNA evidence establishes that someone else had sex with this girl , who was promiscuous .
That is simply not enough to overcome the compelling nature of his confessions to his friends that he picked up a girl and raped her .
He said he raped a girl .
The only question at trial was whether the victim in this case was the person that he raped .
The DNA test is not proof that he is innocent .
It 's negative evidence , instead of positive evidence .
A jury has determined that he 's guilty .
When you look at new evidence , you look at it to see whether it would have made a difference in their verdict .
If it would , he gets a new trial .
If it would n't , then he does n't .
But you 're not the jury .
He 's had a fair trial with 12 jurors deciding his guilt .
. .
This DNA test gives negative , not positive , evidence .
It would not have made a difference in the jury 's verdict .
. .
Nobody knows for sure .
But no state ever says , " I 'm not sure .
Let 's just give him a new trial . "
Before trial , it 's up to the state to prove that he 's guilty .
Now , it 's up to him to prove that he 's innocent .
That 's his burden under the law :
Has he unquestionably established that he 's innocent ?
You think not .
He had an opportunity at the writ hearing to say why he was confessing , and why he was telling people that he had raped a girl if he had n't .
He did n't offer any explanation about who he said he raped , if he raped someone , why he said it if he did n't rape someone , or if he took his victim to her grandmother 's house .
. .
It 's not up to me to believe him or not .
It 's up to the jury to believe .
And they believed he did what he said he did .
. .
He 's in jail for 99 years for aggravated sexual assault .
That 's the charge he was tried on and convicted of .
That 's what he said he did .
. .
Does n't the DNA evidence raise new questions ?
In Texas , the legal test to get relief after your conviction is final -- and after your direct appeal is through -- is : " Has he unquestionably established that he is innocent ? "
That 's what the appellate court looks at .
" Has he established clear and convincing evidence that no rational juror would have found him guilty ? "
I think the record shows that he has not .
. .
So the DNA evidence did n't sufficiently impress you ?
DNA evidence means different things in different contexts .
It 's like fingerprint evidence .
If someone 's fingerprints are at the scene of a crime , that means the person was there at some time or another .
But if his fingerprints are n't there , it does n't prove that he 's innocent of a crime committed at that scene , especially if he 's told people that he committed the crime .
. . Two days after he confessed to his friends , one friend brought Mr. Criner a newspaper and said , " This is an awful lot of coincidences . "
At that point , Mr. Criner said , " I did n't rape her .
I took her to her grandmother 's house in New Caney . "
The victim was going to her grandmother 's trailer house in New Caney , and she did n't get there .
She was murdered .
If that was not the girl that he picked up and raped , was it a coincidence that some other girl that he picked up hitchhiking was going to her grandmother 's trailer house in New Caney ?
That changed story was supposed to show his innocence .
But it made him look guilty .
. .
But now this can be weighed against the new DNA evidence .
I do n't think the jury 's verdict would have been any different , even if they 'd had the DNA evidence back then .
The state would have explained that the girl was promiscuous , and might have shown that she 'd had sex with different people .
. .
It 's important where the burden of proof lies .
It 's his burden to establish that he is innocent .
It 's not sufficient to show that he might be innocent .
He has to establish unquestionably that he is innocent , and he has n't done that .
Is the victim 's promiscuity the best explanation for the DNA test results ?
The state argued that [ Criner ] could have worn a condom , or he could have failed to ejaculate .
They mentioned a rape conviction where the rapist did not ejaculate .
Another possibility is a third person . . .
Do you believe in the possibility of the third person ?
Nothing in the record would particularly support that .
. .
Why would he wear a condom to cover up his action , and then , a few hours later , brag to his friends about having committed the crime ?
People who commit offenses do things that are very strange .
I do n't know whether he was wearing a condom or not .
That was just a theory by the state .
The fact that this man bragged about beating and raping a girl is very strange , whether he did it or not .
It 's something that a normal person would n't understand .
But criminals do things that normal people do n't understand .
. .
Did n't the DNA test refute the original blood evidence ?
The [ original serology ] evidence showed that the blood group substance found on the victim 's body could have been put there by anyone having Type O blood .
Something like 44 % of the population , or even the victim herself , could have deposited that blood group substance , including Mr. Criner .
. .
I think it 's clear the jury was not relying on this [ evidence ] when they decided that he committed the offense .
. . That 's not sufficient to support a conviction .
So it comes down to his statements to his friends ?
He had no explanation about why , on the night this girl was murdered , he told three people that he had picked up a girl and raped her .
And it was his burden to put on that kind of evidence .
The absence of physical evidence that Roy Criner raped this woman does n't prove his innocence .
Essentially , his confessions were the evidence against him .
. .
That was essentially what he was convicted on .
If a person confesses to a crime , the conviction should be affirmed on appeal if there 's corroborating evidence that the crime actually occurred .
So , yes , that 's sufficient evidence on appeal .
. .
How can Roy Criner establish his innocence ?
I do n't know . . .
Has justice been served in this case ?
Justice is served by allowing the criminal justice system to function by the rules that are in place to determine the truth .
That is the function of all our rules and standards .
I abide by those standards , because they are the surest way to determine the truth .
. .
As a judge , I look at what the law requires , which is that he unquestionably establish that he is actually innocent .
That was my focus in reviewing this case .
It 's the jury 's job to speculate about whether a person is actually innocent or actually guilty .
I review the propriety of the conviction by whatever legal standards are in place .
So it was a proper conviction even if it leaves open the question of his actual innocence ?
[ Roy Criner ] did not meet his burden to prove that he is actually innocent of this offense .
At best , he established that he might be innocent .
We can't give new trials to everyone who establishes , after conviction , that they might be innocent .
We would have no finality in the criminal justice system , and finality is important .
When witnesses testify , and when jurors return a verdict , they need to know that they can't come back later and change their minds .
. .
DNA evidence in this case did not prove that he did n't commit the offense .
That 's the standard we use , and he did n't prove it .
At best , he made some people think that he might be innocent .
But he did n't prove it .

5 Financial Lessons to Learn from Celebrity Deaths
Unless you ’ve been living under a rock without access to radio , TV , the internet , Twitter , or Facebook for the last week you know that several celebrities have passed away from various causes .
As a society we ’ve lost TV pitchman Billy Mays ( heart disease ) , entertainer Michael Jackson ( who knows ) , actress Farrah Fawcett ( cancer ) , entertainer Ed McMahon ( no formal reason given ) , and comedian Fred Travalena ( cancer ) .
Death is n’t a fun topic , but I think there are some lessons to be learned from these celebrity deaths .
Here ’s a list to start with .
5 Financial Lessons from Celebrity Deaths
1. Money is n’t everything .
All the money in the world does n’t matter .
All five of these celebrities made a ton of money during their lifetimes .
As nice of a lifestyle as they got to live using that money it still did not prevent death .
( Hint : nothing prevents death forever . )
The pursuit of money , in the end , is fruitless .
2 . If you do n’t have your health , you have nothing .
Of the five listed above only one , Ed McMahon , likely died of old age .
The rest died of some sort of medical issue .
Mays and Jackson were just 50 years old .
In theory they should have had many more years to live on this earth .
All the money in the world ca n’t stop cancer .
3 . Life insurance and health insurance are really important .
The likelihood of average folks like you and I having to worry about millions of dollars is slim - to - none .
But we may suffer from the same health issues that these celebrities did .
Heart disease in America ?
Check .
Cancer ?
Check .
Now imagine if you did n’t wake up from going to sleep last night .
Would your family be covered with a term - life insurance policy on you ?
If you were diagnosed with cancer today would you have health insurance to cover your treatments ?
Bottom line : skimping on insurance is not the way to go .
4 . Having an estate plan is key .
Again , imagine you did n’t wake up this morning .
Does your spouse know where the will is ?
( Do you have a will ? )
An estate plan maps out for the courts exactly how you want your estate — your belongings and money — handed out .
Do you want to give it all to your spouse ?
Do you want to leave some for the kids ?
Have you appointed a guardian for the kids ?
The Jackson case is a perfect example of this — his mother has won temporary custody of the children and control of the estate .
But is that what the will said to do ?
5 . Get your financial house in order .
You can be “ rich ” , but still severely in debt .
There is a significant difference between appearing wealthy and being wealthy .
Jackson was $ 400 million in debt when he died last week .
Ed McMahon was in the news a few months back for being on the brink of foreclosure on his mansion .
These are two individuals that made millions upon millions of dollars and still were in debt .
The Correct Financial Path
This blog is about teaching you how to get out of debt , stay out of debt , and build wealth .
Here ’s an idea : spend less than you earn .
These principles apply no matter your income level .
You hear stories of professional athletes that get paid millions of dollars in bonuses and salaries … and ten years later they are filing for bankruptcy .
Turn around and you hear stories of school teachers retiring on a healthy nest egg , then donating millions of dollars to their schools .
Use these deaths as a reminder that you ’re not going to live forever .
That today could be your last day living .
Use this knowledge to not only make the most of every day , but to get your finances straightened out now rather than later .
What other lessons should we learn from these celebrity deaths ?
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Abound Solar , a U.S. solar startup whose top rival is low - cost industry leader First Solar Inc , starts production at its first factory on Tuesday , promising that it will lead the way to making solar competitive with power from dirtier sources .
Abound , a private company that was known as AVA Solar until last month , will make cadmium telluride solar panels at its first full - scale plant in Longmont , Colorado , where it will eventually produce 200 megawatts of solar modules annually .
Using cadmium telluride as its key raw material puts Abound in direct competition with First Solar , the Wall Street darling whose low - cost technology has been snapping up solar power deals with U.S. utilities including Sempra Energy and Edison International .
Traditional solar panel makers use polysilicon as their main raw material , making the panels more efficient in transforming sunlight to electricity , but also more costly .
Abound Solar ’s management said it would easily compete with Tempe , Arizona - based First Solar , the solar equivalent of an industry behemoth .
“ We think we have a slight technological advantage over First Solar , ” Chief Executive Pascal Noronha said in an interview .
“ And by the way I think very highly of First Solar . ”
Abound ’s manufacturing process , Noronha said , is completely automated and continuous , allowing the company to convert sheets of glass into solar panels in less than two hours without human labor .
“ We have a manufacturing process that is about as continuous as making beer cans , and therefore makes us the lowest cost manufacturer of photovoltaic modules , ” Noronha said .
First Solar said in February that it had reduced its manufacturing costs to 98 cents a watt .
Fort Collins , Colorado - based Abound , Noronha said , would be producing at that level within three months , slashing costs further as production increases .
“ By cutting the cost , within a year or two I think we will be leading the race to grid parity , ” Noronha said .
By the end of this year , Abound ’s Colorado facility will reach a production capacity of about 65 MW .
It will reach 200 MW by the middle of next year .
Most of the company ’s solar panels will be sold to companies in Germany , initially , though Noronha said he expects the United States and India to be its two biggest markets starting fairly soon .
The new facility will ultimately employ about 300 people , and the company plans to build its second plant in the United States as well .
“ We really want to make an impact here in the U.S. , ” Noronha said .
Abound is currently applying for a U.S. Department of Energy loan “ in the few hundred million range , ” Noronha said .
Depending on market conditions , the company could weigh an initial public offering within the next year or so , though Noronha said Abound was not constrained when it comes to financing .

With the eyes of the world watching the mass marketing blitz of Microsoft 's latest search engine Bing , many have suggested the company filter out adult content to keep it away from children and those who simply do n't want to see it .
It is no secret that this kind of content continues to top the charts when ranking the most popular online material being sought out using an Internet search engine .
Subdomains : Microsoft's Answer to Online Porn Filtration
When Bing first launched , Microsoft expressed their desire to filter out porn content .
But many wondered how it would be able to pull off such a seemingly infinite task .
Microsoft has now apparently found a happy medium by categorically separating the search engine domains .
According to Bing general manager , Mike Nichols , adult - only images and video will now be served from a subdomain .
The subdomain ( explicit.bing.net ) is required so that this form of entertainment can be easily barred from Bing search results .

Explicit Subdomain Works Seamless with Filtering Software
The separation is almost invisible to the user , but it still makes for an easier way to block porn content .
Nichols also stated that information about which domain the explicit pictures or video are coming from will be served up in a manner that makes it more apparent to content filtering software .

The " Decision ( Search ) Engine "
Microsoft continues its struggle to distinguish Bing from rivals , claiming that their new search engine is actually a " Decision Engine " designed to help people plan trips , research health matters or find local establishments .
In focusing on more areas that answer the needs of a larger audience ( such as adult content filters ) , Microsoft could continue to broaden their user base , especially since the search engine is still a rather new and hot topic these days .
Finding effective ways to repair the shortcomings of rival services could just be the thing needed to give Bing a distinct advantage in the long run .
George Bush finally broke his self - imposed vow of silence on Barack Obama to attack him over the recession , health reform and Guantánamo .
In a speech to a business convention , Bush repeated several times the mantra that he would not criticise his successor before going on to do just that , the first time since leaving office on 20 January .
The former president , in an hourlong appearance in which he made a speech and took questions , argued healthcare should be left to private insurance companies .
" There are a lot of ways to remedy the situation without nationalising healthcare , " Bush said .
" I worry about encouraging the government to replace the private sector when it comes to providing insurance for healthcare . "
Obama is hoping to have legislation in place by October that will offer a federal insurance policy to rival private insurance .
The former president , though he did not directly name Obama , also rounded on his $ 775 bn ( £ 473 bn ) stimulus package , arguing that businesses were better placed to make judgments about spending than the White House .
" I know it 's going to be the private sector that leads this country out of the current economic times we 're in , " he said .
" You can spend your money better than the government can spend your money . "
The speech , in Erie , Pennsylvania last night , was only his fourth since leaving office in January , two of which were in Canada .
Bush 's silence until now was one of the reasons why his vice - president Dick Cheney has been giving interviews and speeches , defending the Bush administration record and criticising Obama , particularly the controversy over the interrogation techniques used at Guantánamo and CIA detention centres round the world .
Obama described the techniques approved by the Bush administration as torture and disputed that they produced valuable intelligence .
But Bush yesterday said he had decided to " use every technique and tool within the law to bring terrorists to justice before they strike " .
Bush also took a swipe at Obama over his planned closure of Guantánamo .
" I told you I 'm not going to criticise my successor , " he said .
" I 'll just tell you that there are people at Gitmo that will kill American people at a drop of a hat and I do n't believe that - persuasion is n't going to work .
Therapy is n't going to cause terrorists to change their mind . "

Marx Brothers fans will recall that the political philosophy of Rufus T. Firefly in “ Duck Soup ” boiled down to this :
“ If you think this country ’s bad off now , just wait ‘ til I get through with it . ”
I ’ve often considered that to be the secret slogan of Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s administration .
( Just substitute “ this state ” for “ this country . ” )
After Tuesday ’s election , it ’s no longer a secret .
Schwarzenegger had the kind of voter support in 2003 that would have allowed him to tell the voters the harsh but necessary truths about California governance and force real reforms down their throats .
Advertisement
Instead , he uttered the same lies about state government and proposed the same nostrums as many of his predecessors : Californians are overtaxed and underserved , the budget can be balanced by cutting waste , fraud and abuse , etc .
Like everyone else who has made these claims , he never delivered on his promise .
His cut in the car tax cost the state $ 3.6 billion per year , making him directly responsible for pretty much all of today ’s $ 21 - billion budget deficit .
He hoped he could avoid reaping the whirlwind sown by these cliches .
Unfortunately , Tuesday was Harvest Day .
Let ’s list a few of the lies he and our other political leaders have peddled about California ’s government and examine how they contributed to this week ’s debacle at the ballot box .
Advertisement
The most onerous lie is that Californians are burdened by the highest state taxes in the nation .
The truth , according to 2006 figures derived from the U.S. Census , is that as a percentage of all personal income , California ’s tax and fee schedule ranks 18th in the country .
Then there ’s the canard that we unfairly soak our rich .
This is supposedly a no - no , because the rich might flee , taking with them their sterling job - creating potential .
The dirty little secret , according to Citizens for Tax Justice , a left - leaning nonprofit group , is that California ’s wealthiest residents shoulder the lightest burden of any income group in the state .
The top 1 % of California income- earners ( average 2007 income : $ 2.3 million ) paid 7.4 % of their income in various state taxes last year , counting the federal deduction for state taxes .
The highest rate was paid by the poorest residents .
Those earning $ 20,000 or less , with average income of $ 12,600 , forked over 10.2 % of their earnings in sales , excise , property and other levies .
This year ’s budget deal increased the disparity , raising the effective rate on the rich to 7.8 % , but that on the poor to 11.1 % .
Advertisement
The theme of the ballot campaign was that the state ’s chronic budget gridlock could be solved by more gridlock and more borrowing .
All lies .
By no means does the governor deserve all the blame for the budget fiasco .
Democrats and Republicans alike have abandoned any claim to statesmanship in Sacramento .
And what of the business community ?
Big corporations , entrepreneurs and mom-and - pop stores all have a huge stake in functional state government .
Yet the state Chamber of Commerce traditionally has offered one nostrum for California ’s budget ills :
Cut taxes .
But since it also claims to support better education and improved infrastructure , its approach has simply amounted to throwing the hard challenges back into the laps of a nonfunctional political establishment .
Advertisement
The truth is that real solutions to the budget crisis are obvious .
One : Eliminate , or at least loosen substantially , the two - thirds legislative requirement to pass a budget or raise taxes .
This rule has allowed a small Republican minority to hold up all budget progress unless its reactionary program is incorporated in the deal .
If the supermajority were pared back even to 60 % , the minority lawmakers would be unable to block a budget unless they could enlist at least a few moderates in their cause .
The improvement in the tone of legislating would be immediate .
Two : Remove legislative term limits .
This ridiculous provision has reduced the Capitol to a nursery full of would - be legislators needing afternoon naps .
Worse , it has sapped legislative leadership of its vigor .
Advertisement
Since mid-1995 , there have been nine speakers of the Assembly .
Over the previous 20 years , there were two , including Willie Brown , the original target of the term - limit movement .
You want to tell me that government in Sacramento has improved since then ?
As long as term limits exist , we ’ll never have a 21st - century state government .
Three is the Big One : Revise Proposition 13 .
Prop 13 is often described as a tax - cutting measure , but that scarcely does justice to the damage it has caused .
By rendering the property tax useless as a revenue device , Prop 13 hit local governments especially hard .
Key budgeting authority devolved from cities and counties up to Sacramento , where they have to compete with the state government for money .
You want your streets paved or more teachers for your third grade ?
Stand in line behind the health department , or the corrections department , or Caltrans .
So city streets deteriorate and local schools get worse .
Police and firefighters are laid off .
All the places where the voters come into face - to - face contact with their governments crumble .
Advertisement
The result ?
Voters get more cynical , more convinced that government is expensive and useless .
It ’s a vicious circle -- the more government is unable to do the things voters want it to do , the less faith the voters have in government and the less they ’re willing to spend on it .
Which leaves it with less money to do the things voters want .
And on and on .
Reversing the worst effects of Proposition 13 does n’t take rocket science .
Commercial property should be subject to regular reassessment -- the “ split roll ” that , inexplicably , ca n’t gain traction in Sacramento .
Cash - strapped homeowners can be provisionally protected from the burden of higher residential assessments -- say by allowing some assessments to be deferred until the home is sold .
Plainly , local government needs to recover its authority to collect revenue directly .
That would help our political leadership make the case that , considering the quality of the services and institutions state and local government provide , Californians are n’t overtaxed but undertaxed -- and the wealthy are the most undertaxed of all .
If Tuesday ’s election proves anything , it ’s that California ’s political sacred cows all need to be herded into the abattoir and dismembered , once and for all .
Advertisement
Breaking the cycle that has brought us to this pass will take political courage and real statesmanship .
California ’s voters have been trained for too long to think they can have roads , schools , universities , clean air and other amenities without paying their true cost .
The task of our next generation of leaders will be to show that California is not ungovernable -- it ’s just been ungoverned .

Restaurants in China frequently seek exotic ways of preparing dishes
China 's health authorities are reported to be putting a stop to restaurants serving chickens which have been bitten to death by poisonous snakes .
The dish , which is served by a small number of restaurants in Guangdong and Chongqing , is billed as detoxing .
But it has generated a storm of controversy in the media and among bloggers after a video of its preparation was circulated online .
The video shows a cook holding a snake and forcing it to bite a live chicken .
A week of intense internet discussion has reached the near - unanimous decision that it is cruel to kill live chickens by forcing deadly snakes to bite them repeatedly .
Some voices noted , however , that they found the cooked dish delicious .
" It 's disgusting and really cruel , " read one post on the popular portal sina.com.cn .
" Not only is it cruel and blood - thirsty , but totally amoral , " the Chongqing Business Daily cited a neighbour to one of the restaurants as saying .
" Although nobody has been poisoned , this at the very least is an irregular way of slaughtering poultry , " the business newspaper quoted a local health official as saying .
According to Reuters news agency , health authorities in Guangdong have already told restaurants to stop serving " poisonous snake - bitten chicken " .
It said officials in Chongqing had joined the ban .
Restaurants in China have long specialised in exotic dishes which have provoked condemnation from animal rights activists and health watchdogs - such as monkey brains scooped from a live animal , civet cat and deer foetus soup .
After revelations that some American soldiers were given Bibles and encouraged to " hunt people for Jesus , " the Pentagon on Monday denied allegations that the U.S. military allows its personnel to seek the conversion of Afghans to Christianity .
But while the copies of the New Testament translated into Pashtun and jaw - dropping video from Bagram may seem like exceptions that prove the rule of American prohibition on proselytizing by the military , they are just the latest episodes in the disturbing rise in influence of Christian conservatives in the United States armed services .
As Jeremy Scahill detailed in the Huffington Post , the incidents first reported on Al Jazeera are an affront both to the U.S. military code of conduct and America 's Afghan allies :
The center of this evangelical operation is at the huge US base at Bagram , one of the main sites used by the US military to torture and indefinitely detain prisoners .
In a video obtained by Al Jazeera and broadcast Monday , Lieutenant - Colonel Gary Hensley , the chief of the US military chaplains in Afghanistan , is seen telling soldiers that as followers of Jesus Christ , they all have a responsibility " to be witnesses for him . "
" The special forces guys - they hunt men basically .
We do the same things as Christians , we hunt people for Jesus .
We do , we hunt them down , " he says .
" Get the hound of heaven after them , so we get them into the kingdom .
That 's what we do , that 's our business . "
As it turns out , that has indeed been the business of Christian conservatives in the U.S. armed services since 9/11 .
In word and deed , evangelicals in recent years have aggressively boosted their visibility and influence within the American military .
An early warning came in 2003 in the guise of Lt. General William Boykin .
Boykin , who later became a deputy under secretary of defense , claimed during speeches to prayer groups and breakfasts that militant Islamists sought to destroy America '' because we 're a Christian nation . ''
General Boykin also explained to evangelical audiences that Muslims worship an ' ' idol ' ' and not ''a real God . ''
While President Bush expressed his disagreement ( noting Boykin " '' did n't reflect my opinion " and " it just does n't reflect what the government thinks " ) , Boykin remained on the job .
The U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs has been a hotbed of evangelical activism - and controversy .
While cadets in 2004 distributed leaflets at dinner place settings for a screening of " The Passion of the Christ , football coach Fisher DeBerry displayed a sign in the team 's locker room proclaiming , " I am a Christian first and last .
I am a member of Team Jesus Christ . "
In May , 2005 , Lutheran minister and Captain MeLinda Morton was removed from her post after warning evangelical Christians were trying to " subvert the system " in trying to win converts among cadets at the Academy .
A June 2005 study at USAFA described other incidents of religious intolerance , insensitivity and inappropriate proselytizing , and concluded :
" Additionally , some faculty members and coaches consider it their duty to profess their faith and discuss this issue in their classrooms in furtherance of developing cadets ' spirituality . "
In the wake of the Brady report and complaints from Military Religious Freedom Foundation founder Mike Weinstein ( himself a graduate of the Academy ) , the Air Force in October 2005 moved to withdraw a " code of ethics " document which permitted chaplains to evangelize military personnel who were not affiliated with any faith .
( " I will not proselytize from other religious bodies , " it read , " but I retain the right to evangelize those who are not affiliated . " )
Still , even that minor restriction produced an avalanche of opposition from Focus on the Family , the Christian Coalition and other groups which protested that the new guidelines abridged " the constitutional right of military chaplains to pray according to their faith . "
Undaunted , the push to proselytize in the U.S. military continues .
In 2007 , an inspector general 's report highlighted ethics violations among current and former officers , including two major generals , for appearing in uniform for a promotional and fundraising video for the evangelical group Christian Embassy .
As the Washington Post noted , the report " offers a vivid picture of how inappropriately intertwined Christian Embassy had become with Pentagon operations by the time the video , with its extensive scenes inside the Pentagon , was filmed in 2004 . "
Nonetheless , the New York Times reported earlier this year that military personnel were shown videos featuring football 's Terry Bradshaw professing his Christian religion as part of an official military production dealing with depression , suicide and " the importance of faith . "
The aggressive campaign for military converts is producing a climate of fear and intimdation in the armed forces .
Specialist Jeremy
Hall sued the Army after a superior officer interrupted his meeting for atheists and free - thinkers by proclaiming , " People like you are not holding up the Constitution and are going against what the founding fathers , who were Christians , wanted for America ! "
In another case , Army Specialist and Iraq Purple Heart recipient Dustin Chalker filed a lawsuit after being subjected to a mandatory ceremony that began and ended with a Christian prayer .
As he put it :
" The Army enforces policies against racism and sexism , but does n't bat an eye at these kinds of religious discrimination .
Why is it acceptable that soldiers are unable to serve this nation without attending state - led religious practices they find offensive and false ? "
Of course , it is n't acceptable , not under Central Command 's General Order Number One and myriad other guidelines issued by the Pentagon before or since .
Tragically , as the United States wages a global struggle against terrorists espousing a virulent strain of Islamic fundamentalism , fundamentalists in the ranks of the American military are betraying its values - and jeopardizing its mission .

This Week 's Question : I 've been told I should exercise more , but I 'm afraid that at my age ( 73 ) I might damage something .
Am I safer as a couch potato ?
All the current scientific evidence shows that geezers should exercise , even though many older people think it could harm them .
Study after study demonstrates that seniors hurt their health a lot more by being sedentary .
If you 're inactive , you deteriorate .
Physical activity can help restore your capacity .
Most older adults , regardless of age or condition , will benefit from increasing physical activity to a moderate level .
Warning :
If you want to begin a new exercise program , you should consult your physician and request a list of exercises that are best for your age and physical condition .
Four types of exercise are important for your health .
These are exercises for strength , balance , stretching and endurance .
Strength exercises build muscle and raise your metabolism .
Doing these exercises will help to keep your weight down .
Balance exercises help prevent falls and , therefore , will keep you from breaking yourself and losing your independence .
Each year , U.S. hospitals have 300,000 admissions for broken hips ; many of them are the result of falls .
Stretching exercises give you more freedom of movement .
And endurance exercises raise your pulse and breathing .
Here are 10 tips to make any exercise program safe :
1. ) Do n't hold your breath during strength exercises .
This could affect your blood pressure .
2 . ) When lifting weights , use smooth , steady movements .
Breathe out as you lift or push a weight , and breathe in as you relax .
3 . ) Avoid jerking or thrusting movements .
4 . ) Avoid locking the joints of your arms and legs into a strained position .
5 . ) Some soreness and slight fatigue are normal after muscle - building exercises .
Exhaustion , sore joints , and painful muscle pulls are not normal .
6 . ) Always warm up before stretching exercises .
7 . ) Stretching should never cause pain , especially joint pain .
8 . ) Never bounce into a stretch ; make slow steady movements instead .
9 . ) To prevent injuries , use safety equipment such as helmets for biking .
10 . ) You should be able to talk during endurance exercises .
Measuring your progress can motivate you .
Test yourself before starting to exercise to get a baseline score .
Test and record your scores each month .
The following are some tests you can use , if your doctor approves .
For endurance , see how far you can walk in exactly six minutes .
For lower - body strength , time yourself as you walk up a flight of stairs as fast as you can safely .
For upper - body strength , record how much weight you lift and how many times you lift that weight .
For balance , time yourself as you stand on one foot , without support , for as long as possible .
Have someone stand near you in case you lose your balance .
Repeat the test while standing on the other foot .
Remember , above all , exercise should make you feel better .

The plant that pretends to be ill
Matt Walker
Editor , Earth News
A leaf damaged by mining moths ( left ) compared to one faking it ( right ) .
A plant that pretends to be ill has been found growing in the rainforests of Ecuador .
The plants feigns sickness to stop it being attacked by insect pests known as mining moths , which would otherwise eat its healthy leaves .
It is the first known example of a plant that mimics being ill , and could also explain a common pattern seen on plant leaves known as variegation .
The discovery is published in the journal Evolutionary Ecology .
Variegation is familiar to gardeners and affects many species of plant .
Variegated plants have different coloured patterns on the leaf surface , produced by a variety of causes .
One of the most common is when cells in the leaf lose chlorophyll and their ability to photosynthesise , appearing white .
In theory , plants with variegated leaves should be at a disadvantage , because of this restricted ability to photosynthesise .
But a chance discovery by a team of botanists suggests this may not be true after all .
Instead , some variegated plants may be mimicking illness to avoid being eaten , putting themselves at an advantage .
The fact that there are both plain green and variegated leaves in the population indicates to me that both are useful in the long - term success of the species
Botanist Sigrid Liede - Schumann Sigrid Liede - Schumann and colleagues Ulf Soltau and Stefan Dotterl of the University of Bayreuth in Germany were studying understory plants in the forest of southern Ecuador , when they noticed that the plain green leaves of a plant known as Caladium steudneriifolium were far more frequently damaged by mining moths than those of variegated leaves of the same species nearby .
Mining moths lay larvae into the leaves , and the caterpillars then munch through the leaf surface , leaving a white trail of damage behind .
" The similarity of the variegation patterns with the criss - cross munching traces of the larvae led to the idea that maybe they deter the mining moth from laying its eggs , " says Liede - Schumann .
To test the idea , the researchers used white correction fluid to mimic the appearance of variegation on hundreds of healthy leaves .
After three months , they then counted the number of leaves affected by the mining moth caterpillars , comparing green leaves , variegated leaves and those painted white to appear variegated .
A mining moth caterpillar leaves a trail of damage .
" The results were the same , " says Liede - Schumann .
" Visibly variegated leaves were significantly less frequently damaged by mining moth larvae than plain green ones . "
While moths infested almost 8 % of green leaves , they infested 1.6 % of variegated ones and just 0.4 % of those painted to look like they were variegated .
" I was quite surprised , " says Liede - Schumann .
She believes that the plant essentially fakes being ill , producing variegated leaves that mimic those that have already been damaged by mining moth larvae .
That deters the moths from laying any further larvae on the leaves , as the insects assume the previous caterpillars have already eaten most of the leaves ' nutrients .
" The fact that there are both plain green and variegated leaves in the population indicates to me that both are useful in the long - term success of the species , " says Liede - Schumann .
The reduction in a variegated leaf 's ability to photosynthesise is likely to be more than offset by the benefits of not being eaten , the researchers believe , suggesting that variegation survives in wild plants because it confers a selective advantage .

Police found the " bombs " were in fact carrots
A Swedish art project caused a bomb scare when people mistook carrot " explosives " for the real thing .
Artist Conny Blom set up The Bunny Project : Bombs , at 15 locations near the southern Swedish city of Orebro .
He taped bunches of carrots together with black tape and attached blue and red wires and a clock to them .
Police received worried calls from members of the public who thought they were real bombs .
Mr Blom was forced to remove his art - and may face charges .
' Inappropriate '
The carrot bombs had been placed around the city at the request of a local art gallery , as part of an open - air arts festival .
They had only been in place for an hour before police received their first call .
" We received a call ... from a person who said they saw two real bombs placed outside the public library , " Ronny Hoerman from the Orebro police force , was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
" It was hard to tell if they were real or not .
We find this inappropriate , " he said .
Mr Blom described it as a harmless stunt .
" After all , it is just carrots with an alarm clock and nothing else ... this is just a caricature of a bomb , " he said .
Illegal Recycling
Mosquitos are independent recycling collectors who roam around town in ramshackle pick up trucks collecting cardboard , often illegally .
The predominantly immigrant , under - the - table mosquito worker typically gets something in the area of $ 80 for a packed load of cardboard almost twice as tall as the truck itself .
Cities are increasingly cracking down on mosquitos for poaching a lucrative trade for the government sanctioned recycling contractors .
Big ups to Molly !!!
Swedish goalie Jonas Gustavsson is halfway through what is expected to be a tour of four NHL cities as he decides to make the jump to North America .
Gustavsson , 24 , has played with Farjestad in the Swedish Elite League the past two season .
The team won the league championship in April , and he went on to play for his country at the world championships the following month .
The netminder has visited Colorado and San Jose and is scheduled to be in Dallas on Wednesday .
It is believed he will be visiting Toronto later in the week .
Colorado utilized former star and fellow Swede Peter Forsbeg in their pitch , according to the Denver Post .
Gustavsson has some sort of connection with each club .
He is represented by Joe Resnick , who shares an agency with John Thornton , brother of San Jose star Joe Thornton .
The Dallas roster includes Fabian Brunnstrom , a former Farjestad teammate , while the Maple Leafs last week hired goaltending guru François Allaire , who has previously worked with Gustavsson .
Gustavsson went undrafted by the NHL and can be signed to a maximum salary of $ 875,000 US , not including bonuses .
Resnick has previously said that Gustavsson will take a few days to mull things over after his visit , with a decision possible before the June 26 draft .
WASHINGTON --
The Senate overwhelmingly passed historic legislation Thursday that puts the tobacco industry under the regulation of the Food and Drug Administration .
Companies are weighing the impact of the bill , which they say also puts severe , perhaps unconstitutional , restrictions on advertising and packaging .
Those limits , they worry , could undo business plans based on smokeless tobacco products , which they have been developing in anticipation of this day -- even as they were fighting to derail the legislation .

Neo -Nazis screaming ' Heil Hitler ' attack concentration camp survivors during memorial service for 345,000 dead
Survivors of a Nazi death camp were shot at and abused as they gathered to remember their liberation .
Masked neo -Nazi thugs screamed ' Heil Hitler ! ' and ' This way for the gas ! ' at ten elderly Italian men and women , who returned to the site of the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria .
The gang also fired air guns at a group of 15 French survivors , many dressed in the striped pyjama - style uniforms they wore as inmates .
One suffered a head wound while another was injured by a shot in the neck .
The four thugs managed to escape .
Jewish leaders in Austria were appalled by the weekend scenes that marred events marking the 64th anniversary of the camp ’s liberation by American troops .
Members of a delegation of Polish survivors arrive for a ceremony to commemorate the 64th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp of Mauthausen
An estimated 320,000 people were murdered or worked to death at Mauthausen and its outlying slave labour installations .
Jewish leaders condemned Saturday 's incidents , which marred events marking the 64th anniversary of the camp 's liberation by U.S. troops .
The attacks came near the Ebensee sub-camp of Mauthausen on Saturday in two separate incidents involving Italian and French survivors
The prisoners at Ebensee worked in underground factories which manufactured Messerschmitt airplanes .
' In the first instance a group of French survivors were attacked by four armed men clad in camouflage gear , ' said Willy Mernyi , head of the Mauthausen Committee of Austria .
' The attackers shot at the group of fifteen survivors with what police assume was plastic air gun pellets .
One person was hit in the head while another was injured by a shot in the neck .
' People come to remember the dead and pay their respects and are met with this kind of terror . '
The second incident happened a short time later when 10 Italian survivors who gathered nearby for a similar ceremony were attacked .
Survivors of the former Austrian Nazi concentration camp Mauthausen enter the camp before the neo -Nazis struck
The concentration camp was liberated by U.S. troops on May 5 , 1945
While they were not fired on , the neo - Nazis again hurled abuse and shouted Nazi slogans while giving the Hitler salute .
But the same spirit that kept them alive back then was still evident among the survivors who fought with the cowards who desecrated the memory of their dead comrades .
They even succeeded in ripping the mask from one of them and taking his picture with a mobile telephone camera .
Regional police chief Alois Lissl said the survivors and their families showed ' extreme courage ' in fighting back .
' Unfortunately , the men managed to escape but we know that they spoke in a local dialect , ' he said .
Ebensee mayor Herwat Loidl condemned the modern - day Nazis , declaring : ' They will not be allowed to gain a foothold in our community . '
He called on Austrians with information as to the identities of the thugs to turn them in .
Some 7,000 Mauthausen survivors and their families from 42 countries travelled to the Mauthausen complexes at the weekend for the remembrance services .
“ At least we set out to do what we wanted to – to honour the dead and remember the liberation , ” added Mernyi .
An estimated 320,000 people were murdered or worked to death at the camp .
A private investigator who pleaded guilty today to running an unlawful blacklisting service on building workers has been snooping on trade unionists and political activists for more than 30 years , the Guardian can reveal .
Ian Kerr , of Stoke Heath , in the West Midlands , faces an unlimited fine or prison term after he admitted at Macclesfield magistrates court that he had illegally run a secret database of 3,200 workers , in breach of privacy laws , through an agency known as the Consulting Association .
Building workers at the hearing applauded after the chairman of the bench , Adrian Long , passed the case up to the crown court because his sentencing powers under the Data Protection
Act were " woefully inadequate " .
The prosecution was brought by the information commissioner , Richard Thomas , after it emerged that Kerr , 66 , sold the data to businesses including Balfour Beatty , Sir Robert McAlpine , Laing O'Rourke and Costain , some of the UK 's largest construction companies .
As the Guardian revealed in March , the commissioner closed down Kerr 's business and sent warning letters to 40 companies because it suspected workers were being unfairly blacklisted .
Some of those firms now face prosecution .
A Guardian investigation suggests that Kerr began investigating trade unionists and leftwing activists in the 1970s for the Economic League , a secretive , rightwing vetting organisation set up in 1919 .
The league had files on as many as 45,000 people it considered to be " subversive " , " troublemakers " and " extreme leftwing " .
It was paid by more than 2,000 companies to vet potential employees against its list and weed out those it believed were active trade unionists or would be disruptive .
Michael Noar , the league 's director - general between 1986 and 1989 , said Kerr had worked for the organisation for a long time , infiltrating " a lot " of trade union and political meetings , recording who had said what and taking away documents such as attendance lists .
Noar said : " He was a key guy .
He was one of our most effective research people – his information was genuine and reliable . "
Kerr refused to discuss his involvement with the league or the source of his records , and did not appear in court today .
His solicitor , James Strong , told magistrates that Kerr was just a Consulting Association employee and " brought in effectively as a data controller " for an unnamed trade association .
Strong said Kerr took the court hearing " extremely seriously " , but said the public perception that Kerr was involved for " significant financial gain " was " simply not the case . "
Minutes from internal Economic League meetings in 1988 show that Kerr liaised with construction companies who were collectively known inside the league as the Service Group .
They got greater help with vetting and covert intelligence - gathering on union activists , allegedly leftwing employees and workers who complained about safety or rights at work .
The league had by the late 1980s begun to run into financial trouble as the media and campaigners exposed its controversial methods .
Companies stopped subscribing after it emerged it kept inaccurate files , based on hearsay , on individuals unfairly blocked from jobs .
The league minutes show Kerr put forward suggestions about how it could raise more money from the Services Group .
A confidential letter from the Costain construction firm to the Economic League in 1988 names Kerr as an important official in the organisation .
The league was wound up in 1993 and at about that time , the information commissioner believes , Kerr took the league files on construction workers and set up the Consulting Association .
For the next 15 years , he was paid by construction firms to run checks on individuals , until his agency was closed down by Thomas 's officials .
They seized Kerr 's entire database and found that some of the files were more than 30 years old ; many had been named by the league before it had collapsed .
One card with the letter " K " on it – a code used by the league to designate the building industry – records the trade union and political activities of Alan Ritchie , now general secretary of the Ucatt construction workers ' union .
It notes he was a " leading striker " at the Govan shipyard in Glasgow .
Other files used by Kerr that date back to the early 1970s , and seen by the Guardian , described one building worker in Liverpool as " politically unstable " and " extreme " , while another in Twickenham , London , was sacked after the league named him as a militant strike leader and said he was " identical " to an Irish communist .
A third in Wembley was named as a " political menace " because he supported " extreme elements " .
Mick Gorrill , an assistant information commissioner , welcomed the case 's transfer to the crown court .
" Ian Kerr colluded with construction firms for many years flouting the Data Protection Act and ignoring thousands of people 's privacy rights , " he said .
Best hybrid cars
Hybrid cars were introduced by various automotive industries as a result of the need for more efficient and environmentally sound cars .
Even though everyone has heard about hybrid cars , there still exists some confusion , for example , about how they operate and what are the components that they have or need to function properly .
When buyers look into upgrading to a hybrid they have to decide what to do with their gasoline fuel vehicle .
The options vary , but for a fast and reliable choice , there are charity car donations always available .
Not only do they ease the process , you wo n’t have to worry about the selling hassle and move on quicker to obtain a hybrid car .
Basically hybrid cars are operated by three main sources such as , a well performing battery , an electric motor and a gas engine .
Each of the sources is very important for the performance of the car .
The main benefit of using hybrid cars is that , it has been proven that it is less harmful when it comes to emission and it has better gas mileage .

I had to put aside my very pressing work on the biography of Edward C. Harwood to honor my subject 's great respect for the gold standard and sound commercial banking , when I saw an ad on the front page of Section 2 of the Financial Times today .
Unfortunately , I can't locate a link to the ad itself , but it says : " THE FAST TRACK OUT OF THE CRISISThe New Global Payment UnitTroy Ounce Fine Gold 999.9
Paper money or real gold ?
It 's your call .
" I immediately realized this was the handiwork of either a madman or a genius , or some combination of both , and so I set about finding out more about the fellow .
Indeed , he is both .
He is a Russian billionaire named German Sterligov , and he has come up with a new , yet age - old idea : Using gold in international exchange transactions .
He has ordered to be stamped under the label " ASCENT " ( Anticrisis Settlement & Commodity Centre ) 1.1 million
Troy ounces of gold , acceptable at any ASCENT office worldwide in international trade deals done through his offices .
This fits in with the rest of his business , which is international barter exchange , a transaction style dear to the Russian heart according to some of the information I found on his US website
On the European version , I found these two short videos featuring the madman - genius himself - - a most intriguing character .
Interview with CNBC on June 23 , 2009 Interview on Aljazzeera on May 4 , 2009 I think I could grow to like the guy .
He became rich in his twenties ; he lost the Russian Presidential election to Putin in 2004 ; and now he raises goats .
[ Thanks to Farmtoconsumer.org for the photo . ]
I assume he has squirreled his riches away somewhere ( and I bet I know where that is ) .
I agree with everything he says about gold , its historical use , and its potential to help rectify much that ails the world today .
On the other hand , I fear for his life , because for this system to become a reality , many central bankers and the politicians who use them will find the competition unbearable .
I will watch this with great interest .
Mr. Sterligov , please watch your back .
You are playing a game with potentially some very powerful and nasty opponents .
If you have any success at all , you will soon be challenged by all the armaments the current monetary authorities and legislators of the world can summon from their reading of the law , and from their judges and alphabet hit men .
After all , centralized government 's very survival depends upon the powers derived from fiat paper currency .
You could use some help from some small - government politician with the foresight to see the potential of your idea to get the forgotten men and women back to center stage , someone who has the guts and the personality to seize the moment and make a run for it .
More power to you and this rare politician , Mr. Sterligov .

At 47 , I lament how today 's America is far less free than the country of my youth .
Replacing it is not a 1984ish totalitarian dictatorship , but what Alexis de Tocqueville called the ' soft tyranny ' of what Mark Levin sees as a 21st century ' nanny state . '
We so feared a Stalin or Hitler that we ignored endless assaults on our liberty by idealistic home - grown statists and the seductive narcotic of ever more government goodies buying our acquiescence .
What makes Americans ' surrender to statism so shameful is that we freely chose this course in direct contravention of our founding principles .
Nowhere have we seen such an accelerating atrophy of our freedom as in K - 12 public schools , where recent decades have witnessed far more books banned , and not some print version of Debbie Does Dallas .
No , literary classics like J.D. Salinger 's Catcher in the Rye and Mark Twain 's Huck Finn are verboten -- required reading in those decadent days of my ' 70s high school .
But educrats with the backbone of a large worm now avoid anything controversial .
Students have far less choice of classes in high school , and often teachers can't make their own lessons since they must teach the test so schools can make ' adequate yearly progress . '
Only about 40 percent of my college students say they ever discussed any controversial issues in high school .
My high school classes reveled in such debate .
Similarly , so many high schools have become gated , closed campuses .
Mine was wide open .
' Zero tolerance ' for drugs and violence policies punish students carrying aspirin , cough drops , and Tweety - Bird key chains .
Now diligent do - gooders want to ban school Coke machines as well .
And to think at my high school we could even smoke !
Today political correctness constipates free speech at many schools ( as well as in much of the public and private sectors ) , and hysterical sexual harassment policies suspend children for hugging a classmate .
If you had predicted all this to my 1980 senior high class , we'd have laughed that you 'd smoked some mighty bad dope to conjure up such an Orwellian dystopia .
Young folks ' freedom has been lost off campus as well .
The drinking age has of course been raised , and now there 's a host of teen driving restrictions I never had to obey .
But we 've all lost so much liberty .
Look how government 's neurotic nannies have restricted us with a host of seatbelt , child seat , and helmet laws .
Likewise , so many cities and states ban smoking even in private restaurants and bars .
A WWII vet can't even light up in his own bar .
So many laws have eroded our Second Amendment gun rights that , as P.J. O'Rourke notes , if Massachusetts had the same gun laws in 1775 that it has now , we 'd all be Canadians .
Even political campaign speech is constricted .
The Obama administration argued at the U.S. Supreme Court that the McCain - Feingold Act can ban books about ongoing election campaigns .
Yet Justice Hugo Black warned that : " The freedoms of speech , press , petition , and assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment must be accorded to the ideas we hate , or sooner or later they will be denied to the ideas we cherish . "
Almost half of all U.S. income is taxed today , which means we 've lost about half our economic freedom .
With record government spending and soaring debt , we 're set to lose a lot more .
And to think the Boston Tea Party was waged over a three - cent - a - pound tax on tea .
Government regulations on business cost us well over $ 1 trillion a year in higher consumer prices , and there are exactly 26,911 government words policing the sale of a head of cabbage .
In recent years , obsessive - compulsive environmental regulations halted a Massachusetts town from using fireworks on Independence Day since an ' endangered ' bird 's nest was found near it .
News flash : on July 4 , we celebrate independence from a tyrannical government .
Yet George III never taxed , regulated , or policed us remotely as much as Washington , D.C. does today .
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says ' Every aspect of our lives must be subjected to an inventory . '
Everywhere rules and paperwork mushroom as nit-picking bureaucrats grow in numbers and power .
As a buddy bemoaned , the increasingly shrill message of the establishment is ' Sit down ' and shut up . '
No wonder so many Americans feel frustrated and impotent .
Why has our liberty eroded so badly ?
Statist public schools have long taught that equality ( of results ) and ' social justice ' trump freedom since liberty is the handmaiden of ' selfish ' individualists harming ' the community . '
As we 've grown affluent , there 's more desire to protect everyone from risk , and our burgeoning welfare state demands ever more of our economic liberty .
Plus , as societies get more secular , they become more socialist ( see Western Europe ) .
We also have endless media - savvy professional grievance groups contending that every erosion of freedom is imperative for our safety .
But , as Justice Louis Brandeis warned : " Experience teaches us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government 's purposes are beneficent .
Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil - minded rulers .
The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal , well - meaning but without understanding . "
Jefferson warned that ' The price of liberty is eternal vigilance . '
I pray Americans never forget that we are the heirs to the most libertarian , God-fearing revolutionaries in history .

America Closing Her Door to Freedom

SaveCalifornia.com is a pro-family , anti-gay group leading an effort to derail SB 572 which would institute an official Harvey Milk Day here in California .
Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to serve in political office , and was later gunned down by former city council member Dan White at San Francisco City Hall in 1978 .
SaveCalifornia.com is urging concerned parents to send an email to Governor Schwarzenegger which describes all the horrible things that will happen to their children if SB 572 is passed , including :
SB 572 pressures public schools — from kindergarten on up — to perform “ suitable commemorative exercises ” promoting what homosexual activist Harvey Milk believed in : the entire homosexual , bisexual , and transsexual agenda and anti-religious values .
If SB 572 becomes law , schoolchildren would have positively portrayed to them homosexual experimentation , homosexual “ marriages , ” sex - change operations , and anything else that ’s “ in the closet . ”
All doors of sexual experimentation MUST be opened : “ If a bullet should go through my head let that bullet go through every closet door . ”
SaveCalifornia.com is led by anti-gay bigot Randy Thomasson .
There ’s plenty of dirt on him over at goodasyou.com so I wo n’t repeat it here .
Milk screenwriter Lance Black testified in Sacramento today supporting SB 572 .
To counter SaveCalifornia.com , please sign this petition at Equality California urging the governor to support Harvey Milk Day .

If girls just want to have fun , as Cyndi Lauper belted out in 1983 , does that mean boys are serious stoics ?
Lauper probably was n't trying to make a sociological statement in her head - bopping anthem , but her lyrics point to a much - debated question about gender differences .
In studying the relative happiness of people across the globe , do men and women exhibit distinctive emotional characteristics ?
In short , is one sex generally happier than the other ?
It 's important to note that evaluating happiness is n't a highly precise scientific undertaking .
For one thing , happiness is a subjective term , and there 's no universal measurement for it .
Though someone smiles on the outside , it does n't mean that his or her apparent joy reflects internally .
Similarly , a lot of studies related to happiness rely on self - reporting .
One survey that economists from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania have used simply asks respondents to rate themselves on whether they are " very happy , " " pretty happy " or " not happy . "
The resulting statistics do n't take into account the nuances and background information of why and how people scored themselves .

Despite the potential pitfalls of empirical happiness studies , we can draw some conclusions about who the happiest sociological groups of people are .
Generally , older people are happier than younger ones .
Wealth and good health also give us something to smile about more often .
Yet when it comes to the happiness gender gap , things are n't so cut and dried .
The 2003 Pew Global Attitudes Project that surveyed 38,000 men and women across 44 countries lends insight into the disparities between male and female happiness .
Overall , women scored themselves as more satisfied with their lives than men [ source : Pew Research Center ] .
Moreover , women from certain countries , including Pakistan , Japan and Argentina , appeared significantly happier .
The differences between what affects men and women 's levels of happiness explains this slight gender gap .
Women , for instance , tend to focus on personal and domestic problems , while men concern themselves more with matters outside of the home .
This variation in values is also reflected in how the recent recession has affected people 's happiness .
According to a Nielson Happiness Survey conducted in 51 countries , men 's happiness has n't weathered the economic storm well since they attach more importance to financial success than women .
On the other hand , the women surveyed indicated they appreciated quality relationships above all [ source : Reuters ] .
But women should n't start celebrating the good news just yet .
It is no surprise that people tend to gamble more online in the winter time than they do in any other season .
With less sunlight available people like to spend more time indoors and keeping warm .
This means more computer hours logged .
During the Christmas season one thing is for certain is that any site whether online casino , poker , bingo , sportsbook or anything else , they are going to have some Christmas bonuses for you .
So if you are looking for value , you 'll find the best of it during the holiday season .
One easy way to get access to all of these promotions is to simply signup to as many sites as possible .
You will also want to check your spam box to make sure that some newsletters that end up in spam , you approve of it as not junk so you can make sure you get close to 100 % of the offers that come your way .
If you are wanting one place to check up on these bonuses is Christmas Slots a website that is about slots but they tend to list bonuses .
Last year I got some no deposit bonuses from them .
This site is focused on listing all of the Christmas slots you can play at different casinos but of course the Christmas bonuses make it all worth while .
Most of the time the bonuses do n't even apply to those slots and you can play many of the games as well .
It is not just casinos that get in on the Christmas spirit , you can find everything else from lottery tickets , poker rooms , places to bet on sports and another popular item is bingo .
Bingo and slots tend to go hand in hand for games that match up .
When you are waiting for your bingo game to start , you can simply place a few spins on a slot game while you are waiting to pass the time .
So this season if you are going to gamble , do it with a bonus or something special .
You will want to make your money go a long way and try to get the maximum value out of it .
There are many free bets , no deposit bonuses to start without making a deposit , then there are tournaments and contests where you can win new electronics !
Good luck !
Energy Secretary Steven Chu answers questions during the Reuters Energy Summit in Washington , June 1 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said on Monday he believes technology can solve environmental problems associated with Canada ’s oil sands and that the huge nearby resource contributes to U.S. energy security .
Chu told the Reuters Global Energy Summit that the balance between the environmental impact from the huge energy resource in northern Alberta and its importance to U.S. energy supply is a complicated one that will require solutions from the industry .
Environmental groups have mounted major campaigns to get the message out to Americans that the expansion of Canada ’s oil sands industry threatens to intensify global warming , deforestation and damage to water resources .
“ It ’s a complicated issue , because certainly Canada is a close and trusted neighbor and the oil from Canada has all sorts of good things .
But there is this environmental concern , so I think we ’re going to have to work our way through that , ” he said .
“ But I ’m a big believer in technology . ”
Canada is the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States and its oil sands represent the biggest deposits of crude outside the Middle East .
The Canadian and Alberta governments as well as the oil industry are going to great lengths to ensure that U.S. energy and environmental policies do not put oil sands - derived crude at a disadvantage in its most important market .
The resource is mined in open pits as well as produced in wells with the aide of steam pumped into the ground .
Then it must be processed by upgrading plants into light oil that can be fed into refineries .
There is concern about the large amount of energy required to produce oil sands , Chu said .
He said Canadian producers point out they are making strides in extracting the crude “ more cleanly . ”
Cutting the energy used to extract a barrel of oil sands crude would be “ economically good and it will be environmentally much better , ” he said .
Eurozone prices could be set to fall this summer
Prices in the eurozone stopped rising in May - with the annual inflation rate at 0.0 % - igniting concern that prices will fall in the months ahead .
This is the lowest inflation rate recorded since 1997 .
Inflation stood at 0.6 % in April , after hitting 4 % when energy prices hit record highs .
Many analysts now expect deflation to grip the 16 - nation zone this summer .
Separately , official figures showed an unexpected rise in retail sales in Germany in April .
The 0.5 % increase from the previous month has raised hopes that consumer spending could help to support the German economy - Europe 's largest - after its record slump in output in the first quarter of this year .
" So far , consumers have been the positive surprise during the recession .
Consumer confidence has been stable for several months .
Now , it looks as if consumers are finally putting their money where their mouth is , " said Carsten Brzeski at ING .
' Cold water '
There was less optimism among analysts for the wider eurozone .
" Today 's data poured some cold water on any nascent hopes of a recovery .
A slip into deflation in the next couple of months looks odds - on , " said Colin Ellis at Daiwa Securities .
Others were even more forthright .
" There seems little doubt that the eurozone will see deflation in June and that it will persist over the next few months at least , " said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight .
Deflation is considered damaging to an economy as consumers tend to delay making purchases until prices fall further .
Without consumer spending to stimulate growth , economic output falls .

This move proposed by the Ohio governor is just insane .
I 've avoided posting anything about it because
If I heard about it , I assume most of our readers did , We 're preaching to the choir here and I can't escape the feeling that this will be such an unpopular cut that the governor is expecting and planning for the backlash that 's occurred , and that this is a political move in which we 're all being manipulated , and I resent that more than a little .
But Bill and I wish all of you in Ohio the good luck you deserve and the money you need to continue to do the great things you do for your communites .
And whether this is a sincere proposal on the governor 's part or just politics , I hope , when elections come around again , your patrons make sure everyone who backed it will need to attend job hunting workshops in your libraries .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Carrie Prejean 's lawyer gave Miss California USA executive director Keith Lewis what he said was a final warning to retract statements made about the former beauty queen or face a defamation lawsuit .
The lawyer for former Miss California USA Carrie Prejean , says the ousted beauty queen 's good name is " tarnished . "
Prejean , stripped of the Miss California USA title last week , " suffered severe emotional distress " and her reputation was harmed by Lewis , Charles LiMandri said in a letter sent Thursday to Lewis ' lawyer .
LiMandri's letter also accused Lewis , whom he referred to as a " gay activist , " of setting Prejean up to be fired because of her statements opposing same - sex marriage .
When Prejean , 22 , was dethroned , Lewis said it was for " contract violations , " including missed public appearances .
He told CNN 's Larry King last week that it was n't one thing Prejean did , but " many , many , many things . "
" She came to us and said I 'm not interested in your input ; I 'll make my own decision what I 'm going to do , " Lewis said .
" You know , when you have a contract , when you 're working for someone , you have a responsibility to follow through on what that requirement is . "
Lewis told King it was clear " she was not interested in upholding the title or the responsibilities . "
" Carrie Prejean 's good name has been tarnished by your client 's false and defamatory accusations , " the letter from her lawyer to Lewis ' said .
" Please view this letter as a last opportunity for Mr. Lewis to retract the defamatory statements made against my client and to seek to restore her good name , " LiMandri said .
" If he does not comply , I will have no alternative but to recommend that Ms. Prejean proceed to do so through litigation . "
In response to the letter , Lewis issued a statement that said : " Mr. LiMandri obviously has never watched ' The Apprentice ' if he believes that Mr. Trump could be so easily fooled .
Facts are facts , and we stand by them . "
LiMandri denied any contract violations , saying it was a " complete and utter pretext " for her firing .
The list Lewis gave to reporters of Prejean 's missed appearances was " an outright fraud , " he said .
Prejean " did not refuse reasonable appearance requests " that could " be expected to promote and further the intended purposes of Miss California USA , " he said .
The beauty queen expected to be asked to attend " Rotary conventions and avocado festivals , " not events Lewis suggested , LiMandri said .
" She did not think it was appropriate for her to accept Mr. Lewis ' invitation to attend a gay documentary in Hollywood promoting same - sex marriage , " he said .
" It was not my client 's job , as Miss California , simply to help your client promote his personal or business interests as a Hollywood agent and producer , or gay activist . "
He accused Lewis of trying to make commissions off Prejean 's appearances .
" Your client was trying to wrongfully profit off of my client 's participation as Miss California , in violation of her contract , by taking 20 percent of any appearance fee she would earn , such as at the Las Vegas jewelers convention she attended at his request , " LiMandri 's letter said .
LiMandri cited a statement he said Lewis made during a May 15 conference call that " clearly shows that your client was trying to ' set - up ' our client for termination " by relaying an offer to appear semi-nude in Playboy .
Three people who worked for a public relations agency representing Prejean at the time heard it , he said .
" All three of those people distinctly remember Keith Lewis talking about sending Ms. Prejean an offer to do a Playboy photo shoot ' so when they take her title away , she does n't sue me , ' " he said .
LiMandri said Lewis -- and former co-executive director Shanna Moakler -- were " bound and determined to get her fired , and they have now finally gotten their way . "
Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump announced last month that Prejean could keep her title despite a controversy over topless photos , missed appearances and her statements against same - sex marriage .
Trump reversed himself last week .
" I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract with the Miss California USA organization , and I gave her the opportunity to do so , " Trump said .
" Unfortunately , it just does n't look like it is going to happen , and I offered Keith my full support in making this decision . "

On commence à en savoir un peu plus sur la deuxième loi Titanic HADOPI , pour combler les brèches ouvertes par le Conseil constitutionnel .
Le volet répressif est abandonné , dans le sens où la future HADOPI , et la Commission de Protection des Droits ( CPD ) qui est son prophète , n'auront aucun pouvoir de sanction propre .
Tout passera par le juge .
Se pose donc un nouveau problème .
La justice est engorgée et fonctionne à flux tendu .
Lui confier un contentieux de masse crée une menace d'asphyxie , ou suppose l'abandon de poursuites dans d'autres domaines , mais lesquels ?
Les violences conjugales , les vols de voiture , le trafic de stupéfiant ?
L'hypothèse de fournir à la justice les moyens dont elle a besoin étant naturellement exclue , rien n'étant plus nocif qu'un juge qui a les moyens de juger .
Reste donc la trousse de bricolage , aussi connue sous le nom de : “ ce n'est pas une question de moyens , c'est une question de méthode . ”
Et le gouvernement a trouvé la rustine idéale à ses yeux : l'ordonnance pénale .
Oui , amis juristes , esclaffez - vous à l'envi : on va juger des affaires de contrefaçon par voie électronique par ordonnance pénale .
Oui , amis mékéskidis , je vais vous expliquer .
L'ordonnance pénale , c'est la technocratie appliquée à la justice .
L'idée a d'abord été créée pour faire face aux contentieux de masse posant peu de problèmes de preuve , à savoir : les contraventions routières .
Ces contraventions sont matériellement simples ( feu rouge grillé , excès de vitesse constaté par un appareil ) et obéissent à des règles de preuve qui limitent considérablement les droits de la défense et pour lesquels un extrait du casier judiciaire est suffisant pour que le juge fixe une peine adéquate .
Le système est le suivant : le parquet présente le dossier avec ses preuves à un juge , qui soit va le rejeter , auquel cas libre au parquet de faire citer à une audience ordinaire ou de classer sans suite , soit le juge estime que les preuves sont réunies et va rendre une ordonnance pénale déclarant le prévenu qui en l'occurrence n'est pas prévenu qu'il est prévenu ( si vous me suivez … ) coupable et prononçant une peine .
L'ordonnance est ensuite notifiée au condamné qui peut alors au choix ne rien faire , auquel cas l'ordonnance devient définitive , l'amende est due et les points de permis perdus ( on peut être frappé de suspension de permis par ordonnance pénale ) soit faire opposition dans un délai de 15 jours auquel cas le condamné est convoqué à une audience , au cours de laquelle le juge réduit à néant l'ordonnance pénale ( c'est obligatoire ) et rejuge l'affaire .
Avec à la clef une peine plus forte si la culpabilité est établie , pour des raisons qui je l'avoue m'échappent : je ne vois pas en quoi une personne , fût - elle coupable ( toutes ne le sont pas , une grande partie ne peut prouver son innocence , tout simplement ) , qui souhaite exercer ses droits de la défense mérite une peine plus lourde .
Mais c'est un autre débat .
L'ordonnance pénale appliquée aux contraventions a donné des résultats satisfaisants .
Pour le ministère s'entend : augmentation , à budget constant , du nombre de condamnations .
Que cela se fasse au prix du sacrifice des droits de la défense n'est qu'un dommage collatéral non pris en compte dans les statistiques .
Du coup , la procédure a été élargie aux délits par la loi Perben I du 9 septembre 2002 .
Selon la technique habituelle de l'exception qui s'élargit discrètement , cette procédure , baptisée “ procédure simplifiée ” ( la simplification étant de se passer du prévenu et de son avocat … ) était réservée aux délits du code de la route , dont une bonne part sont d'anciennes contraventions devenues délits selon la technique dite “ néanderthal ” du législateur , qui pense que pour lutter contre un délit il suffit de taper plus fort .
Puis , peu à peu , on a ajouté des délits à la liste , qui figure à l'article 495 du Code de procédure pénale :
Peuvent être soumis à la procédure simplifiée prévue à la présente section :
1° Les délits prévus par le code de la route et les contraventions connexes prévues par ce code ;
2° Les délits en matière de réglementations relatives aux transports terrestres ;
3° Les délits prévus au titre IV du livre IV du code de commerce pour lesquels une peine d'emprisonnement n'est pas encourue ;
4° Le délit d'usage de produits stupéfiants prévu par le premier alinéa de l'article L. 3421 - 1 du code de la santé publique ;
5° Le délit prévu par l'article L. 126- 3 du code de la construction et de l'habitation ( le fameux délit d'occupation de hall d'immeuble ) .
La différence étant que le délai pour l'opposition passe de 15 à 45 jours en matière délictuelle et surtout qu'aucune peine de prison ne peut être prononcée par cette voie ( la contrefaçon est punie de jusqu'à cinq trois ans d'emprisonnement , et cinq en bande organisée , rappelons - le ) .
On voit donc l'idée de génie : le juge de l'ordonnance pénale fera le travail de la Commission de Protection des Droits .
Il ne reste qu'à ajouter une peine complémentaire de suspension de l'accès à internet et le tour est joué : on a un juge qui suspend l'accès à internet sans avoir à rallonger d'un centime le budget de la justice .
Si avec ça , la ministre n'est pas reconduite dans le prochain gouvernement !
Sauf que , vous vous en souvenez , je disais au début de l'article que le juriste s'esclaffe , alors que là , le mékéskidis reste placide , voire morose .
C'est parce que deux points font que cette idée est , pour le moins , très mauvaise .
Un point de fait et un point de droit .
Le point de fait est que cette procédure ne peut fonctionner que pour des délits très simples à établir .
Conduire sans permis , ou à plus de 180 km/h sur l'autoroute , avoir fumé du cannabis ( prouvé par une analyse sanguine ou d'urine ) , ê tre dans un hall d'immeuble … ) .
La contrefaçon , surtout par voie informatique , c'est autre chose .
Il faut que le parquet apporte la preuve : que l'œuvre téléchargée était protégée ( on peut télécharger plein d'œuvres libres de droits sur bittorrent ou eMule… ) , que le téléchargeur savait qu'il téléchargeait une œuvre protégée ( les noms de fichiers peuvent être trompeurs quant à leur contenu , et on ne peut savoir ce qu'il y a réellement dans un fichier avant qu'il n'ait été téléchargé ) , et tout simplement identifier le téléchargeur , ce que l'adresse IP ne suffit pas à établir .
Bref , il est à craindre que la plupart des ordonnances pénales demandées sur la base des dossiers montés par la CPD soient refusées par le juge pour preuve non rapportée .
Le parquet devra donc ouvrir une enquête de police , ce qui fait perdre tout l'intérêt simplificateur : la police étant le bras séculier du parquet , la faire enquêter sur des contrefaçons l'empêche d'enquêter sur d'autres affaires .
Le point de droit est que cette loi est contraire à l'intérêt des artistes , ce qui est un amusant paradoxe .
En effet , l'ordonnance pénale suppose que la victime ne demande pas de dommages - intérêts ( article 495 du CPP , al. 9 ) .
Donc les ayant droits ne pourront pas demander réparation de leur préjudice .
Ils doivent sacrifier leur rémunération à leur soif de répression .
Quand on sait que leur motivation dans ce combat est de lutter contre un manque à gagner , on constate qu'il y a pire ennemi des artistes que les pirates : c'est l'État qui veut les protéger .
Ajoutons que l'ordonnance pénale n'est pas applicable aux mineurs ( article 495 du CPP alinéa 8 ) et que lesdits mineurs forment une part non négligeable des équipages de pirates du web , mais que la CPD sera incapable de garantir que l'auteur du téléchargement illicite est majeur , et on sent que la loi HADOPI 2 promet de bons moments de rigolade .
Si elle entre en vigueur .
Car la Némésis d'Albanel , le Conseil constitutionnel , veille .
Et le Conseil a eu l'occasion de se prononcer sur la procédure simplifiée appliquée aux délits .
Voici ce qu'il en a dit à l'époque ( Décision n° 2002 - 461 DC du 29 août 2002 ) :
77 . Considérant que , si le législateur peut prévoir des règles de procédure différentes selon les faits , les situations et les personnes auxquelles elles s'appliquent , c'est à la condition que ces différences ne procèdent pas de discriminations injustifiées et que soient assurées aux justiciables des garanties égales , notamment quant au respect du principe des droits de la défense , qui implique en particulier l'existence d'une procédure juste et équitable ;
78 . Considérant , en premier lieu , qu'aux termes de l'article 495 du code de procédure pénale , le ministère public ne peut recourir à la procédure simplifiée que " lorsqu'il résulte de l'enquête de police judiciaire que les faits reprochés au prévenu sont établis et que les renseignements concernant la personnalité de celui-ci , et notamment ses charges et ses ressources , sont suffisants pour permettre la détermination de la peine " ;
Déjà , il n'y aura pas d'enquête de police judiciaire puisque c'est une autorité administrative qui réunira les preuves .
Ensuite , déjà qu'une adresse IP ne permet pas d'identifier l'utilisateur de l'ordinateur , je doute qu'elle permettre de connaître sa personnalité et ses ressources ( encore que : le pirate qui télécharge l'intégrale de Marilyn Manson est probablement une jeune fille mineure aux cheveux et ongles noirs , qui aime la mort et les poneys et n'a pas assez d'argent de poche ) .
79 .
Considérant , en deuxième lieu , que , si l'article 495 - 1 du même code donne au ministère public le pouvoir de choisir la procédure simplifiée , dans le respect des conditions fixées par l'article 495 , c'est en raison du fait que la charge de la poursuite et de la preuve lui incombe ;
80 . Considérant , en troisième lieu , que si le président du tribunal estime qu'un débat contradictoire est utile ou qu'une peine d'emprisonnement devrait être prononcée , il doit renvoyer le dossier au ministère public ;
81 . Considérant , en dernier lieu , que les dispositions des nouveaux articles 495 à 495 - 6 du code de procédure pénale apportent à la personne qui fait l'objet d'une ordonnance pénale , quant au respect des droits de la défense , des garanties équivalentes à celles dont elle aurait bénéficié si l'affaire avait été directement portée devant le tribunal correctionnel ; qu'en effet , l'ordonnance doit être motivée ; que le prévenu dispose d'un délai de quarante - cinq jours à compter de la notification de l'ordonnance pour former opposition ; que , dans cette hypothèse , l'affaire fait l'objet devant le tribunal correctionnel d'un débat contradictoire et public au cours duquel l'intéressé a droit à l'assistance d'un avocat ; qu'il doit être informé de ces règles ; que l'ensemble de ces dispositions garantit de façon suffisante l'existence d'un procès juste et équitable ;
Pour résumer : l'ordonnance pénale délictuelle est conforme à la constitution car le ministère public a le choix de recourir ou non à cette procédure , que le président peut refuser de condamner par cette voie , et que le prévenu peut toujours faire opposition , ces trois garanties assurant l'équité de la procédure pour le Conseil .
Il faudra donc que le texte qui sortira des débats parlementaires respectent ces principes .
Le problème est que l'idée centrale du projet HADOPI est justement de contourner tous ces principes constitutionnels , qui ne sont , pour le Gouvernement , que des obstacles .
Pourvu que Christine Albanel ne soit pas reconduite dans ses fonctions , pour lui éviter de gravir une troisième fois le golgotha .
Requiring prosecutors to reveal what they know about detainees and how they know it would cast light both on the interrogation techniques used against the men and the acts of terrorism for which they are facing death , said Denny LeBoeuf , an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who works on Guantánamo death penalty issues .
“ Do n’t we have an interest as a society , ” Ms. LeBoeuf asked , “ in a trial that examines the evidence and provides some reliable picture of what went on ? ”
I think we do have such an interest .
I do not believe putting on a trial when a person wishes to plead guilty is the way to get that information .
These detainees should have the right to plead guilty .
They have no duty to allow us to inform ourselves about the atrocities committed in our names .
Congress can do that .
A Truth Commission can do that .
The Justice Department can do that .
It is not KSM and his fellow terrorists ' responsibility to facilitate our own examination of our own monstrous actions .
Whether KSM and his cohorts feel remorse for their crimes against humanity is not for us to judge .
They want to plead guilty .
No more need be said .
This paradox provides one more reason to eliminate these ill advised and constitutionally questionable military commissions .
Why Obama is reluctant to do so is hard to understand .
Speaking for me only
The planet might have about the same girth as its star
A distant " sun " residing in the constellation Aquila has become the smallest star known to host a planet .
The discovery of a Jupiter - like " exoplanet " orbiting the star VB 10 is the first to be made using the astrometry method .
Astrometry is based on measuring small changes in a star 's position .
At one - twelfth the mass of the Sun , VB 10 is tiny ; though the star is more massive than its planet , it would have about the same girth , experts say .
Astrometry has long been proposed as a tool for finding other planets , but this is the method 's first " catch " .
The results are to be published in an upcoming edition of the Astrophysical Journal .
Using astrometry to find exoplanets involves measuring the precise motions of a star on the sky as an unseen planet tugs the star back and forth .
It is best suited to finding planets with large orbits around their parent stars .
But the method requires very precise measurements over long periods of time .
Gas giant
The newfound planet , VB 10 b , is a gas giant with a mass six times that of Jupiter that lies 20 light - years away .
Scientists think the planet 's own internal heat would give it an Earth - like temperature .
Lead author Steven Pravdo , from Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , US , commented : " We found a Jupiter - like planet at around the same relative place as our Jupiter , only around a much smaller star .
Researchers used an instrument attached to the Hale telescope " It 's possible this star also has inner rocky planets .
And since more than seven out of 10 stars are small like this one , this could mean planets are more common than we thought . "
If there are other planets there , this solar system could be a miniature , scaled - down version of our own .
The discovery was the outcome of meticulous , intermittent observations of 30 stars .
Two to six times a year , for the past 12 years , Dr Pravdo and Stuart Shaklan , also from JPL , have bolted their Stellar Planet Survey instrument on to the Palomar Observatory 's 5 m Hale telescope to search for planets .
Planet hunt
The instrument , which has a 16 - megapixel charge - coupled device ( CCD ) can detect minuscule changes in the positions of stars .
VB 10 b causes its star to wobble a small fraction of a degree .
Detecting this wobble is equivalent to measuring the width of a human hair from about 3 km away .
In wider use as planet - hunting techniques are the radial velocity and the transit methods .
Like astrometry , radial velocity detects the " wobble " of a star , but it measures Doppler shifts in the star 's light caused by its motion towards and away from us .
The transit method looks for dips in a star 's brightness as orbiting planets pass by and block the light .
Nasa 's Kepler space telescope , which was launched on 6 March , will use the transit method to search for Earth - like worlds around stars similar to the Sun .

They never say Colin Powell lied .
They do n’t say Condi lied .
In an article in Time Magazine , Donald Rumsfeld proves that not only is he incompetent and a liar ( lots of people have said that Powell and Rice lied ) , but that he is also a self - pitying coward whose main qualification to be Secretary of Defense is his defensiveness .

Technology.am ( June 28 , 2009 ) — Jakob Nielsen recently wrote a thought - provoking post suggests masking is hurting more than it helps , and that it ’s only being kept around out of habit .
Password masking – the practice of replacing the characters a user types into password entry field with bullets – has been widespread on the web for a long time .
There is opinion that masking makes users feel more secure .
It was said masking password to keep someone who might be reading over your shoulder from reading your password .
What if you ’re screensharing with a coworker or recording a screencast that happens to include your site ’s login process ?
But Jakob Nielsen said , “ Masking ruins the user experience .
When users ca n’t see what they ’re typing , they ’re likely to make mistakes and second - guess themselves such as did I forget my password , or did I just make a typo ?
After many login failures , they ’ll either stop using your site or call support .
Users also try to get around the problems of masking by entering a simple , insecure password , or by copying and pasting their passwords in .
Why are we continuing a practice that undermines user security and adds uncertainty to the user experience ?

This latest piece of personal work is all shot in one shot on 5 ×4 transparency .
I commissioned a model maker Ridley West to make a giant plate that we could attach to the wall and with the help of Jennie Webster who sourced some amazing balloons this shot was the result .
SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - Scientists searching for a planet like Earth said on Tuesday they have found the smallest planet ever detected outside the solar system , less than twice the size of our own .
The exoplanet , a planet that orbits a star beyond the solar system , is called Gliese 581e after the star it circles .
Because of its relatively small size it is likely rocky , like Earth , as opposed to gas giants such as Jupiter or Saturn , the astronomers said .
“ It is the lightest planet detected outside the solar system so far , ” Dr. Gaspare Lo Curto , an astronomer at the European Organization for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere , told a news conference .
“ We are not too far away from finding a planet like Earth , ” he added .
Gliese 581e orbits its star in just 3.15 days , but lies outside a so - called “ habitable zone ” and could not sustain life , Lo Curto said .
Its mass is just 1.9 times that of Earth , and it is 20.5 light years away .
But while the small planet is outside the habitable zone , the biggest of three other previously discovered planets in the same system appears to be inside this just - right zone .
“ The most outlying planet is inside what is defined as a habitable zone , which is a zone where there could be water in a liquid state on the surface of the planet , ” Lo Curto said .
The international team of researchers used a 3.6 meter telescope at the Paranal Observatory in La Silla , 370 miles north of Chile ’s capital Santiago .
Their findings are also being presented to an astronomical meeting this week in Britain .
Around 340 exoplanets have so far been found orbiting other stars besides the Earth ’s sun , most of them gas giants with characteristics similar to Jupiter and Neptune .
TEL AVIV , June 1 ( Reuters ) - Intel Corp INTC.O is interested in building another chip manufacturing plant in southern Israel by 2012 at a cost of $ 2.5 billion , the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported on Monday .
A spokesman for Intel in Israel declined to comment .
The newspaper said Intel executives had been holding meetings with Israeli government officials to determine whether the company would be eligible to receive grants for the plant .
Intel ’s $ 3.5 billion Fab 28 plant in the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Gat started mass production in February of 45 nanometre - wide processors .
It will reach full production capacity by the end of the year .
Intel received a state grant of $ 525 million for Fab 28 .
Late last year Intel closed its Fab 8 plant in Jerusalem and transferred Fab 18 , also in Kiryat Gat , to Numonyx , a flash memory joint venture that Intel owns with STMicroelectronics STM .
PA and Francisco Partners .
It is converting Fab 8 into a die preparation plant .
Intel , which also has four research and development centres in Israel , is one of the country ’s top exporters , with exports of $ 1.39 billion in 2008 .

Some comentators have suggested that the reason Western reporters were shocked when Ahmadinejad won was that they are based in opulent North Tehran , whereas the farmers and workers of Iran , the majority , are enthusiastic for Ahmadinejad .
That is , we fell victim once again to upper middle class reporting and expectations in a working class country of the global south .
While such dynamics may have existed , this analysis is flawed in the case of Iran because it pays too much attention to class and material factors and not enough to Iranian culture wars .
We have already seen , in 1997 and 2001 , that Iranian women and youth swung behind an obscure former minister of culture named Mohammad Khatami and his 2nd of Khordad movement , capturing not only the presidency but also , in 2000 , parliament .
Khatami received 70 percent of the vote in 1997 .
He then got 78 % of the vote in 2001 , despite a crowded field .
In 2000 , his reform movement captured 65 % of the seats in parliament .
He is a nice man , but you could n’t exactly categorize him as a union man or a special hit with farmers .
The evidence is that in the past little over a decade , Iran ’s voters had become especially interested in expanding personal liberties , in expanding women ’s rights , and in a wider field of legitimate expression for culture ( not just high culture but even just things like Iranian rock music ) .
The extreme puritanism of the hardliners grated on people .
The problem for the reformers of the late 1990s and early 2000s was that they did not actually control much , despite holding elected office .
Important government policy and regulation was in the hands of the unelected , clerical side of the government .
The hard line clerics just shut down reformist newspapers , struck down reformist legislation , and blocked social and economic reform .
The Bush administration was determined to hang Khatami out to dry , ensuring that the reformers could never bring home any tangible success in foreign policy or foreign investment .
Thus , in the 2004 parliamentary elections , literally thousands of reformers were simply struck off the ballot and not allowed to run .
This application of a hard line litmus test in deciding who could run for office produced a hard line parliament , naturally enough .
But in 2000 , it was clear that the hard liners only had about 20 % of the electorate on their side .
By 2005 , the hard liners had rolled back all the reforms and the reform camp was sullen and defeated .
They did not come out in large numbers for the reformist candidate , Karoubi , who only got 17 percent of the vote .
They nevertheless were able to force a run-off between hard line populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a pragmatic conservative billionaire .
Ahmadinejad won .
But Ahmadinejad ’s 2005 victory was made possible by the widespread boycott of the vote or just disillusionment in the reformist camp , meaning that fewer youth and women bothered to come out .
So to believe that the 20 % hard line support of 2001 has become 63 % in 2009 , we would have to posit that Iran is less urban , less literate and less interested in cultural issues today than 8 years ago .
We would have to posit that the reformist camp once again boycotted the election and stayed home in droves .
No , this is not a north Tehran / south Tehran issue .
Khatami won by big margins despite being favored by north Tehran .
So observers who want to lay a guilt trip on us about falling for Mousavi ’s smooth upper middle class schtick are simply ignoring the last 12 years of Iranian history .
It was about culture wars , not class .
It is simply not true that the typical Iranian voter votes conservative and religious when he or she gets the chance .
In fact , Mousavi is substantially more conservative than the typical winning politician in 2000 .
Given the enormous turnout of some 80 percent , and given the growth of Iran ’s urban sector , the spread of literacy , and the obvious yearning for ways around the puritanism of the hard liners , Mousavi should have won in the ongoing culture war .
And just because Ahmadinejad poses as a champion of the little people does not mean that his policies are actually good for workers or farmers or for working class women ( they are not , and many people in that social class know that they are not ) .
So let that be an end to the guilt trip .
The Second of Khordad Movement was a winning coalition for the better part of a decade .
Its supporters are 8 years older than the last time they won , but it was a young movement .
Did they all do a 180 and defect from Khatami to Ahmadinejad ?
Unlikely .
The Iranian women who voted in droves for Khatami have n’t gone anywhere , and they did not very likely much care for Ahmadinejad ’s stances on women ’s issues :
‘ In a BBC News interview , Mahbube Abbasqolizade , a member of the Iranian Women ’s Centre NGO , said , “ Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s policies are that women should return to their homes and that their priority should be the family . ”
* Ahmadinejad changed the name of the government organization the “ Centre for Women ’s Participation ” to the “ Centre for Women and Family Affairs ” .
* Ahmadinejad proposed a new law that would reintroduce a man ’s right to divorce his wife without informing her .
In addition , men would no longer be required to pay alimony .
In response , women ’s groups have initiated the Million Signatures campaign against these measures .
* Ahmadinejad ’s administration opposes the ratification of the UN protocol called CEDAW , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women .
This doctrine is essentially an international women ’s Bill of Rights .
* Ahmadinejad implemented the Social Safety program , which monitors women ’s clothing , requires the permission from a father or husband for a woman to attend school , and applies quotas limiting the number of women allowed to attend universities . ’
Mir Hosain Mousavi was a plausible candidate for the reformists .
They were electing people like him with 70 and 80 percent margins just a few years ago .
We have not been had by the business families of north Tehran .
We ’ve much more likely been had by a hard line constituency of at most 20 % of the country , who claim to be the only true heirs of the Iranian revolution , and who control which ballots see the light of day .

One of the goals of the Cisco VNI was to try to assess the effect of the economic downturn on network traffic .
" We were expecting more of an effect than we found , " Arielle Sumits , senior analyst for service provider marketing at Cisco , said during a Web cast discussing the VNI .
" We had a difference in the 2012 figures -- they did fall a little bit , and that was primarily due to a slight slowdown in the growth of fiber connections and advanced digital video services .
There is just a little bit of a slowdown in consumer demand for those . "
In 2008 , Cisco's VNI predicted 2012 IP traffic of 522 exabytes .
The new 2009 VNI forecast is now predicting 510 exabytes in 2012 .
Sumits added that other areas are picking up the demand slack .
Internet video growth and Web - based file sharing continue to grow rapidly .
The growth of file sharing is not linked to the economy , according to Sumits , but rather is a function of the growth of social networking .
File sharing in the form of peer - to - peer ( P2P ) traffic like BitTorrent is actually declining as a percentage of total IP traffic , according to Cisco .
At the end of 2008 , P2P traffic represented 50 percent of consumer Internet traffic .
By 2013 , Cisco is predicting that P2P will represent only 20 percent .
By 2013 , video will be the king of consumer IP traffic , accounting for 91 percent of global consumer traffic .
Mobile data traffic is also expected to be dominated by video , with nearly 64 percent of mobile data traffic becoming video .
Passive networking growth
While file sharing and video are big - ticket items for network growth , there is also growth in what Cisco is calling ' passive networking , ' which includes activities such as online backup , software updates , internet DVR , GPS tracking and security cams .
According to Cisco , passive networking currently adds an additional 15 minutes of network usage time per hour , which in total adds six more network hours to the day .
Cisco is forecasting that passive networking will grow to create a digital network day of 36 hours by 2013 .
The total digital network day is a combination of person - to - person , person - to - machine and machine - to - machine network utilization .
During the Web cast presentation , Cisco used the term ' hyper - connectivity , ' which was also used years ago by Nortel , to describe the new wave of network utilization .
Hyper - connectivity is that people will continue to be increasingly connected to networks in multiple formats and mediums .
" The most important thing is this notion of hyper - connectivity and understanding what is driving growth , " Thomas Barnett , senior manager of strategic messaging and communications , said on the Web cast .
" The growth of the network and the Internet is still strong , and we see that through the economic downturn , people still embrace technology . "
On Tuesday President Obama proposed that any increases in federal spending on anything useful , such as healthcare or retirement security , must be balanced by cuts and savings to something else useful , such as healthcare or retirement security .
" The pay - as - you - go rule is very simple , " Obama said .
" Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere . "
Except that it 's not so simple .
Obama would make an exception to allow Bush 's tax cuts for millionaires to be extended past their 2010 expiration date , as well as to prevent the alternative - minimum tax from impacting the overclass .
Still , the White House insists that everything is very simple :
" PAYGO would hold us to a simple but important principle : we should pay for new tax or entitlement legislation .
Creating a new non-emergency tax cut or entitlement expansion would require offsetting revenue increases or spending reductions . "
But , guess what ?
War supplementals and bankster bailouts are " emergencies " and the Pentagon and regular budget war funding are not " entitlements . "
( Someone will have to explain this to the CEOs over at Boeing , BAE , Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics , and Raytheon , but it 's true ) .
With roughly half of every dollar of income tax going to the military and wars and debt for military and wars , we again have a public discussion of " government spending " that ignores the military and wars .
Contrary to popular myth , by the way , team Obama just increased -- and therefore did not decrease -- what had been the largest military budget in world history .
And let 's not forget the Bush - Obama bankster bailouts that suddenly made military spending look small .
But note that 15 House Democrats thus far have said they will vote No , and with all the Republicans voting
No we only need a couple dozen more representatives of the party we keep electing to end the wars .
We CAN win this one .
How much cash do the record labels deserve for Jammie Thomas - Rasset 's alleged copyright infringement ?
Defense lawyer Kiwi Camara pressed Sony Entertainment 's Gary Leak on that point today , trying to force him to pick a number .
Leak refused to be baited .
It was " impossible to determine harm " in this case , he said , which is why the labels want statutory damages that can range from $ 750 to $ 150,000 per song .
Camara pressed again .
" A message should be sent , " Leak said .
But Camara wanted numbers ; what , in Leak 's view , did Thomas - Rasset owe Sony ?
" You ca n't tell the jury a number ? " he asked aggressively .
No , said Leak , it 's up to them to decide ; the law allows these damages , and we are asking only what 's allowed under the law .
The jury must pick the award .
Camara would n't give it up .
He asked if , by Leak 's logic , even the maximum $ 150,000 per song damage award would therefore be an appropriate amount .
Leak at last gave in .
" Certainly ! " he said in apparent exasperation , milliseconds before an objection from recording industry lawyers put an end to that line of questioning .
Bulldog on defense
Camara showed himself to be an aggressive litigator today as the trial kicked off in earnest — perhaps too aggressive .
Leak was the day 's first witness , and before his testimony was over , Camara had been reproved twice by Judge Michael Davis .
He had a habit of asking rapid - fire questions or mounting objections before a witness of the opposing lawyer had finished speaking , and Davis quickly put a stop to that .
" You can not interrupt opposing counsel , " he warned early on , turning the slow burn of his eyes on Camara .
Minutes later , a second warning about talking over witnesses — " let 's get this straight so we do n't have any problems later on , " said Davis .
Camara did give a strident opening statement in which he proclaimed Thomas - Rasset 's complete innocence of the charges .
" They have no evidence that Ms. Thomas did it , " he said , pinning his hopes on the fact that the evidence only identifies a particular cable modem and not a particular user .
Thomas - Rasset has 200 CDs that she purchased , Camara said .
" Ms. Thomas buys music , she does n't steal it ...
She 's one of the recording industry 's best customers ! "
As for the hard drive that was swapped out of her computer just a month after her alleged infringement was detected , Camara says that his client never received the notices about an investigation and replaced her hard drive for a simple reason : her 10 - year old son got frustrated playing a game , hit the machine , and its hard drive broke .
She took it to Best Buy and they replaced the drive .
Situation clarified !
The recording industry case
But it 's not , not completely , and the RIAA certainly does n't buy it .
For one thing , Thomas - Rasset was notified twice , first by instant message through KaZaA and once by FedEx package from her ISP , Charter .
( She claims that she never saw either notice . )
There 's also the little matter of the tereastarr@KaZaA username that investigators MediaSentry discovered .
Thomas - Rasset turns out to have used the " tereastarr " username for her Charter e-mail address and a host of other online accounts ; if she never used KaZaA to download or distribute music , then why did her computer have a KaZaA install with her preferred username ?
And that hard drive swap - out ... the timing is suspicious .
US District Court , Minneapolis
Tim Reynolds , the recording industry 's chief litigator in the case , made these points during his own opening statement .
" The infringement in this case was substantial — massive , " he told the juror , pointing out that the tereastarr@KaZaA share folder contained more than 1,700 songs .
This , he said , is not " sharing like we teach our children . "
The recording industry 's case unfolded in expected fashion .
MediaSentry presented its evidence of having caught the tereastarr@KaZaA user sharing files ; the company downloaded complete copies of 11 songs from that user and grabbed the metadata on nearly 2,000 more .
Seeking to head off the argument that these were all just CD rips , MediaSentry 's Chris Connelly pointed to metadata in numerous songs that suggested the material had itself been downloaded from the Internet .
" Bleeding Edge Ripping Crew , " said one .
" Uploaded by 0 ff$ 3 + , " said another .
A Charter representative helped connect the dots , explaining how the ISP could connect the IP address logged by MediaSentry to a particular user account — in this case , to Jammie Thomas - Rasset .
The evidence appears to be quite strong , though Camara is of course right that it cannot prove in some absolute sense that it was Thomas - Rasset behind the keyboard back in 2005 .
That may not matter ; the standard of judgment is more lenient in civil cases , and this defense failed the first time around .
Did the jury follow everything being said ?
With hours of testimony about MAC addresses , IP addresses , KaZaA , instant messages , share folders , MP3s , metadata , and more , the evidence might well have been difficult to take in .
Jurors took notes , of course , but several testified that they could not use computers without assistance , while most others appeared to be casual computer users at best .
Still , the recording industry did a fine job of connecting the threads , always coming back to the link between the IP address , Jammie Thomas - Rasset 's cable modem , and her " tereastarr " username .
A repeat in the making ?
Perhaps the biggest moment of the day went totally unnoticed by jurors .
During Leak 's testimony , the recording industry legal team moved to enter Sony 's eight copyright registrations into evidence .
Camara and his team have tried to question these , hoping to undercut the entire trial , but the RIAA managed to produce certified copies of the documents this morning and the judge ultimately accepted them into evidence .
Once that happened , Camara 's big gambles failed to pay out : MediaSentry 's evidence was in , the copyright registrations were in , and his proposed fair use defense was out .
The case now looks like it will play out last it did last time , with Thomas - Rasset taking the stand to declare that she did n't do it .
And there was evening , and there was morning , the first day .
Stay tuned for more reports from Minneapolis Tuesday , when Jammie Thomas is expected to take the stand .

Liskov uses program excerpts to illustrate how the Argus system exploits its programming language to create resilient , easily expressed , distributed programs .
The paper walks the reader through the design of a distributed banking database , and serves as an excellent introduction to the author 's Argus work .
It is written for a general audience and includes references to many Argus papers and related work .
The paper describes the tools of resilient programming : atomic actions , nested actions , locking , and recovery .
It tersely illustrates nested atomic actions and lock propagation and warns that it has not solved the deadlock detection and avoidance problems inherent to locking .
The two principal abstractions of Argus are guardians and actions .
“ An Argus guardian is a special kind of abstract object whose purpose is to encapsulate a resource or resources .
It permits its resource to be accessed by means of special procedures , called handlers . ”
An Argus action is essentially a nested atomic transaction .
Argus is unique because it provides atomic actions within a programming language .
It is more general than database transaction processing systems because it operates on general objects within a programming language ; it is not an interface to an underlying database .
The paper is well written and shorter than previously published descriptions of Argus .
It describes an important area of operating system research ( see the companion papers in this issue for an overview of other current operating system research projects ) .
Thyrd is an experimental , reflective , visual programming language and environment .
In Thyrd , both data and code are stored in cells situated in nested two - dimensional grids .
The user interface animates the transition from a cell to its subordinate or superordinate grid to help keep the user oriented in the hierarchical grid structure .
All operations the user can perform to edit the structure are implemented as operators in the Thyrd language , thus a Thyrd program can inspect and modify itself or other programs in the same space .
Thyrd is a member of the Forth family of languages .
Thyrd is a postfix concatenative language most similar to Joy in that it uses quotation and combinators to implement iteration and recursion .
The environment provides a viewer that animates the stacks of a Thyrd program and allows the program to be stepped both forwards and backwards .
The primary view of Thyrdspace is a 2D grid of text and icons .
A view may be overlaid with a panel consisting of arbitrary widgets editing the contents of individual cells or an entire grid .
A Thyrd application can be constructed in which all of the code and data are hidden behind panels and revealed only at the user 's request .
Thyrd is implemented in Tcl / Tk and Poet .
Quick Definition :
The mindset of not focusing on a specific result or growing attached to any outcome .
Outcome independence is an important mindset to have when approaching pickup .
Many GPUAs and newbies make the mistake of chasing after a specific outcome , such as getting a phone number or getting a close , so much that they come across as being needy .
Having an outcome oriented mindset makes a PUA reaction seeking , and , when he does n’t get the reaction that he desired , he becomes upset or disappointed .
Do n’t be like this kid
A better approach to take is to be outcome independent .
By not caring about the outcome of any specific interaction , a PUA comes across as less needy and does not put too much pressure on a woman .
This detached approach of indifference paradoxically makes women more attracted to the PUA because they do n’t come across as desperate .
They also become more of a challenge for the woman to win over .
Outcome independence goes hand in hand with having an abundance mentality .
By realizing that there are more attractive women than can ever be met in a lifetime , the PUA is able not put too much significance on any specific set or interaction , which allows him to relax and have fun — attractive qualities .
Another way to gain outcome independence is to focus on the learning experience of doing approaches , rather than any specific outcome .
No matter how well or poorly a set goes , the PUA gains experience that he can learn from , and thus the value is in having done the approach , rather than the result .
In this way , the PUA becomes outcome independent , and every set he approaches is reframed as a success , regardless of the outcome .

Residents say the Street View images let users see more than they should .
Google 's Street View service suffered a second blow this week after numerous complaints in Japan forced the firm to start reshooting all the photos .
Cameras attached to the Street View car were " too high " for Japanese buildings , allowing them to see over walls into private areas .
Google said it would lower the cameras on its cars by 40 cm ( 16in ) .
On 12 May , Greece 's data protection agency ordered Google to stop filming because of privacy concerns .
In a statement , Google said it would make " locally appropriate modifications to ensure a better user experience " .
" We have lowered the height of the camera due to the unique characteristics of many Japanese roads ; they tend to be narrow , without pavements and driveways , and houses are built close to the street , " the statement said .
" We think the new camera height allows us to get a high - quality image of the street while respecting the privacy of homeowners . "
The Street View service covers 12 cities in Japan , including Tokyo and Osaka .
Timeline First launched in the US two years ago , Street View now covers nine countries including the United Kingdom , and Google wants to expand the service to cover all of Europe .
Users zoom in to a location in Google Maps , and then drag the " Pegman " icon above the zoom bar on to a given street .
A picture of that street appears , which users can control to get a 360 - degree view of the area or to progress on street level , throughout the city .
Google says the service shows only imagery already visible from public thoroughfares .
However , it has come in for criticism from some quarters , being accused of an invasion of privacy .
Earlier this week , Greece 's data protection agency banned Google from expanding its Street View service in the country , pending " additional information " from the firm .
Authorities want to know how long the images will be kept on Google 's database and what measures it will take to make people aware of privacy rights .
In the UK , residents near Milton Keynes blocked the driver of a Google Street View car in April when he started taking photographs of their homes saying the service was " facilitating crime " .
The Pentagon has also banned Google from filming near or inside its military bases , saying it posed a " potential threat " to security .

DOVER , Del . ( AP ) - A bill that would allow the use of medical marijuana in Delaware has cleared a Senate committee .
The Senate health and social services committee released the bill Wednesday after a 90 - minute hearing in which no one spoke against the measure .
The bill would allow people with debilitating medical conditions such as glaucoma , cancer , AIDS and multiple sclerosis to use marijuana to treat their condition or alleviate their symptoms .
Sen. Margaret Rose
Henry , the chief sponsor , said the bill will need to be revised and clarified before being brought up for a vote by the full Senate .

Intel 's Linux - based Moblin platform for netbook devices has much in common with conventional Linux distributions .
Intel has adopted many standard components of the Linux desktop stack and has made modifications where necessary in order to boost mobile performance and usability .
Moblin 's extensive use of standard Linux components helps third - party developers because it guarantees a certain degree of portability between Moblin and regular Linux distributions .
But there are some major areas where Intel deviated substantially from the standard components and invented its own replacements .
Moblin 's highly innovative top - level user interface shell is one of the most evident cases , but there are other unique pieces of desktop infrastructure not immediately visible on the surface that are equally interesting .
One of Moblin 's custom software components that has recently attracted considerable interest is its network management and configuration system .
Instead of adopting NetworkManager , which is widely used by mainstream Linux distributions , Intel created its own framework called ConnMan ... but not everyone is pleased with the decision .
Pros and Conns
NetworkManager was created by Red Hat and is used today in Fedora , Ubuntu , OpenSUSE , and many other distros .
It provides a background service that manages devices and connections ; it also has a user interface front - end that is accessible through the desktop notification area .
The functionality provided by the NetworkManager background service is exposed through D - Bus , which makes it easy for third - party software developers to get information about connection availability and network device status .
The NetworkManager user interface gives users the ability to toggle connection status , select wireless networks , and perform other basic configuration tasks without having to use the command line or to manually edit configuration files .
There are several custom NetworkManager user interfaces , including one for KDE that is built with Plasma .
NetworkManager supports ethernet , WiFi , mobile broadband , and VPN connections .
ConnMan was created by Marcel Holtmann of Intel 's Open Source Technology Center .
Holtmann is probably best known for his works as the maintainer of BlueZ , the Linux Bluetooth stack .
During a presentation at the Linux Collaboration Summit , he explained ConnMan and discussed some of the problems he encountered with NetworkManager that compelled him to build an alternative .
One problem was the difficulty of extending NetworkManager to support additional kinds of connectivity ; Holtmann says that significant portions of NetworkManager 's code base would have to be rewritten to facilitate support for WiMAX , for instance .
He faced similar challenges when he attempted to overhaul NetworkManager to enable tight Bluetooth integration .
Holtmann also complains that the NetworkManager front - end and back - end are too tightly coupled and that too much of the connection switching logic is implemented in the front - end .
These design issues are problematic for Moblin because individual vendors want to be able to ship their Moblin - based products with custom network management user interfaces that match the aesthetic of their specialized software shells .
ConnMan is designed for easier extension on the back - end , and its front - end is intended to be easier to customize , rebrand , or replace .
Holtmann wanted to make it easy for third - party developers to use rich widget and canvas frameworks such as Clutter to build network configuration tools that will communicate seamlessly with ConnMan via D - Bus .
On a touchscreen Internet device , for example , a vendor might want to have a finger - friendly WiFi selector with big buttons .
There will also likely be scenarios where mobile carriers want to ship branded Moblin - based devices that integrate with their own connectivity services and have connection management tools that are designed accordingly .
Another advantage of ConnMan for Moblin is that it 's designed specifically for mobile environments .
Holtmann expressed frustration with NetworkManager 's dependencies , many of which he argues are n't needed on a mobile device .
In particular , he criticized NetworkManager 's reliance on Policy Kit — a framework for handling permissions — which he contends is superfluous on single - user devices .
ConnMan is lighter and has fewer mandatory dependencies .
PolicyKit and the udev device management system are optional dependencies , meaning that ConnMan can work without them in environments where they are n't needed .
Many of ConnMan 's advanced features are implemented in plugins , which can be disabled to further reduce its complexity and overhead .
ConnMan 's suitability for mobile devices has attracted the interest of Nokia , which recently formed an alliance with Intel to collaborate on mobile Linux software .
Nokia has committed to adopting ConnMan and contributing to the project as part of its joint development effort with Intel .
ConnMan is clearly gaining traction in the mobile Linux space , but the response from the desktop community has been mixed .
NetworkManager developer responds
NetworkManager developer Dan Williams recently published a blog entry disputing some of Holtmann 's criticisms of NetworkManager .
He argues that NetworkManager is mature and sufficiently flexible to work well on mobile devices .
He points out that NetworkManager has some significant features that ConnMan lacks , such as connection sharing , VPN support , and superior distro integration .
He also contends that the culture behind NetworkManager is beneficial to the broader Linux system because the developers seek holistic improvement of the entire network stack and consistently push vendors to deliver drivers that do n't suck .
In his view , NetworkManager has improved considerably over the past year and is currently in much better shape than it was when Holtmann decided to create ConnMan .
He argues that ConnMan is less aligned with the desktop because it eschews GObject and other existing idioms and its lack of integration with distro-specific network configuration elements will be problematic for users .
Williams also dismisses many of Holtmann 's criticisms of NetworkManager , particularly the claim that too much network selection logic is in the front - end .
He points out that there are already a number of nice custom NetworkManager front - ends including one that is specifically for netbooks and one for the OLPC Sugar platform .
It 's also worth noting that Williams himself is working on a really elegant facelift for GNOME 's Network Manager front - end .
Williams also attempts to debunk the claim that NetworkManager is too complex .
He argues that Holtmann 's graph of NetworkManager architecture is misleading and , in some places , factually inaccurate .
" It 's unlikely that either NetworkManager or ConnMan will disappear in the near future .
That means we 'll all have to live with two mutually exclusive connection managers and two completely different network configuration systems .
I think that 's pretty pointless , " he said .
" The users will decide which solution works best for them .
And that means NetworkManager will keep getting better , keep getting more useful , and will continue to be the easiest network management solution around . "
The developers of the respective connection management frameworks clearly do n't see eye - to - eye on design issues , so it 's useful to get the perspective of a neutral third - party .
Canonical , the company behind the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution , has conducted some preliminary research to evaluate the viability of replacing NetworkManager with ConnMan .
It found that ConnMan is promising but is not yet sufficiently mature on the desktop — it still lacks some critical features relative to NetworkManager .
A partial feature matrix is being assembled at the Ubuntu Wiki .
The fragmentation created by separate network management utilities is somewhat troubling for third - party application developers .
Software applications on the Linux desktop often query NetworkManager to determine connection availability and to get other kinds of relevant information .
The lack of a consistent shared D - Bus API for such tasks will create dev challenges ; to address this problem , it would be helpful if the two projects could collaborate and agree on some standard D - Bus APIs for a few important things that are required by application developers .
It 's not yet clear if ConnMan will be able to displace NetworkManager on the desktop , but its strengths in the mobile environments will likely make it relevant to mobile Linux adopters .
Users interested in participating in ConnMan development can find the source code at the project 's website .

Mission Sunday Streets Expected to Draw Largest Crowds Yet
When tens of thousands of people come out to the first of two Sunday Streets in the Mission on June 7th , they will find a route that winds through some of the densest pedestrian streets in San Francisco , a route that at just over two miles is half as long as previous events and should lend to casual strolling perhaps more than cycling .
Sunday Streets organizers released the route map recently on their website and tell Streetsblog that the event will be thick with programming that reflects the cultural diversity of the Mission .
" So much of San Francisco ’s culture emanates from the Mission .
It is the homeland of almost every cause that ’s important in the city , " said Livable City Sunday Streets organizer Susan King .
But she added that the density of people in the Mission will give this Sunday Streets a much different feeling than the Embarcadero or Bayview events , where destinations along the route could be separated by long stretches of streets without much activity .
" Because of the density and neighborhood of the route , it might be more of a two mile street festival than a bike ride , " said King .
" It will be a good chance for people to learn to ride a bike , but I do n’t know that it ’s going to be a chance to get on your bike and hit a good speed . "
Wade Crowfoot , the Mayor ’s Director of Climate Initiatives , said that the Mayor is very excited to move Sunday Streets beyond the waterfront into the core of the city .
He was delighted the merchants on 24th Street had requested the route go down their commercial corridor .
We initially thought that we were n’t going to be able to use 24th street because of the Muni line on it , but we heard from businesses on 24th street that they were hurting in these economic times and they wanted to see Sunday Streets on their corridor .
This is an evolution in thinking .
There used to be a feeling that on - street parking was necessary for business to thrive .
But now they realize that events like Sunday Streets bring more business than could ever come by car .
King said that programing along the route would be important to the character of Mission Sunday Streets and suggested that dance would be a very prominent feature , from performing artists to classes and activities .
Cheryl Burke Dance , which has been an active participant in the four previous Sunday Streets events and is a partner in Shape Up San Francisco , has programmed three different classes for the event , including Swing , Salsa , and Belly Dancing .
" I ca n’t say enough positive about Sunday Streets , " said Cheryl Burke Dance studio manager Janet Fjeldstad .
" It ’s fun for our teachers , it ’s fun for participants . "
She added : " I do expect that the dance pod will be more heavily participated because there will be more walkers than the Embarcadero and Bayview . "
The Mission Sunday Streets route wends through dense commercial and neighborhood streets
The route will pass from Dolores Park down 19th Street to Valencia ,
then south on Valencia to 24th Street , east again to York , and then end
at two points : Garfield Square and Rolph Playground .
King explained that organizers have been working with SFPD and the MTA
to coordinate volunteers to help with logistics at the many
intersections where traffic will be prevented from crossing the route .
And she said that while people might assume the Mission has a lot of open space and parks , there is still little green space for residents of the neighborhood .
" Part of the goal is to provide open space to communities that lack them , but there is limited physical open space there .
Dolores Park is on the edge of the Mission and is already packed on weekends , " she said .
" Our focus is going to be on programming in the other two parks and providing opportunity for people to get out in the street and move around . "
Mission resident Nancy Gonzalez said she is excited for the event in the Mission because it will not be like a parade , when onlookers are forced to the side of the street and to sidewalks .
" I think that 24th street will be packed with church goers and business .
The hustle and bustle of people on the sidewalks – its going to be nice not to have cars so you can bike and walk , " she said .
" My family – three of my sisters and two of my brothers live in the Mission – has talked about meeting up to make an afternoon of it . "
Gonzalez said that her mom , who lives on the route , is concerned how she and her friend are going to be able to drive from home to church with the street closures .
She ’s also worried about the demographic of the crowd .
" In her mind she was thinking it was going to be more like Carnaval , " said Gonzalez .
" During Carnaval after she gets out of church at 22nd and 23rd on Hampshire she ’s confronted by lots of nudity . "
Laughing , Gonzalez added , " I told her there will very likely not be a lot of naked people at Sunday Streets . "

A short one here … first of all , we have our debate and our topic picked out , look for that real soon … this one should be fun for both sides .
Now…i have been frequenting a forum called “ Christian Doctrine Discussion ” for about 3 weeks now…its a tiny forum and I started going there because a friend said they were open minded — boy was I wrong .
I just got banned last night , no warning given … nor a reason .. and the last message addressed to me is by Rick , the administrator saying :
And preferably not to RevOxley_501 who wants to convert you into believing the devils scam .
The context was that a Christian was struggling and being encouraged to find someone to talk to …i told him that I certainly understood the doubts he was enduring as well as anyone there … that post has been deleted .
Thought i would share that with you , since I was nothing but kind at that place and tried to understand everyone ’s point of view … Christian love is once again invisible and unseen .
Think I was probably rude ?
here are all my posts — I may have shown some confusion as some really hard to understand English , but I think I was more than respectful .
What do you think ?
Well anyway , Rick was supposed to be compiling evidence for me that the Bible was trustworthy as a source …he said the Holy Spirit told him he could — i guess the Holy Spirit changed his mind ?
So , for the christians — here is a tip , if an ex-Christian comes up to your forum one day … talk to him , he might be a nice guy…im over my bitter stage I think … maybe you can learn from him , and him from you …give us a chance , and at least pretend to love us .
In exclusive interview with the Guardian , prime minister says web era ' more tumultuous than any previous economic or social revolution '
This article is more than 11 years old

Foreign policy can never be the same again — and it's all because of the internet , Gordon Brown said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian .
Referring to the so - called Twitter revolution in Iran , the prime minister said technological advances and the democratisation of information mean " foreign policy can no longer be the province of just a few elites " .
" You cannot have Rwanda again , " he said .
" This week 's events in Iran are a reminder of the way that people are using new technology to come together in new ways to make their views known . "
He described the internet era as " more tumultuous than any previous economic or social revolution " .
" For centuries , individuals have been learning how to live with their next - door neighbours , " he added .
" Now , uniquely , we 're having to learn to live with people who we do n't know .
" People have now got the ability to speak to each other across continents , to join with each other in communities that are not based simply on territory , streets , but networks ; and you 've got the possibility of people building alliances right across the world . "
This , he said , has huge implications .
" That flow of information means that foreign policy can never be the same again .
" You cannot have Rwanda again because information would come out far more quickly about what is actually going on and the public opinion would grow to the point where action would need to be taken .
" Foreign policy can no longer be the province of just a few elites . "
During a frank and personal interview in Guardian Weekend magazine , published tomorrow , he also discussed the return to favour of the business secretary , Peter Mandelson .
Brown said that there was now a " common purpose " between the two of them , and that the Labour party – famously resistant to Lord Mandelson 's charms , had finally come round to him .
" People are coming to appreciate his talents in a way the Labour party did n't before ...
I think there 's a great affection for him now , " he added .

A look at North Korea 's economy :
_ GDP : North Korea 's gross domestic product was estimated at about $ 20.2 billion in 2007 , according to a report last year by South Korea 's central bank .
That was about 2.6 percent the size of neighboring South Korea's .
The Bank of Korea will release its estimate for 2008 later this month .
North Korea does not publish economic statistics .
_ STEADY DECLINE : North Korea 's economy over the past two decades has steadily declined .
The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s deprived the country of a key source of trade and aid .
Subsequent mismanagement , periodic bouts of severe flooding , crop failures , a famine and a standoff with the international community over its nuclear development that led to sanctions have also hurt the economy .
_ TRADE : North Korea 's top trade partners are China , South Korea , Singapore , India , Russia and Brazil .
Japan once was but commercial ties rapidly deteriorated after Tokyo imposed sanctions and restrictions over the North 's abductions of Japanese nationals and its nuclear and missile tests .
_ ILLICIT ACTIVITIES : North Korea has long been accused of engaging in illicit economic activities to supplement its economy and support the ruling regime , including counterfeiting cigarettes and U.S. currency , and drug - smuggling .
A U.N. report in 2007 said North Korea makes an estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion annually from criminal enterprises .
_ CHINESE INFLUENCE : China has become the biggest foreign economic player in North Korea .
The Korea Trade - Investment Promotion Agency , a South Korean trade agency , said in a report in May that Chinese exports to North Korea in 2008 totaled $ 2.03 billion , while North Korea 's exports to China totaled $ 750 million .
North Korea 's main imports from China were oil and textiles .
The North 's key exports were coal and iron ore .
_ RELATIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA : Economic ties with the South flourished throughout much of this decade as Seoul pursued closer political ties with Pyongyang .
Joint projects in manufacturing and tourism boosted trade .
Relations , however , have deteriorated since South Korean President Lee Myung - bak took office early last year with a vow to get tough with the North .
Tourism projects have been suspended and a joint industrial zone has been adversely affected by tightened border controls .
_ NATURAL RESOURCES : North Korea 's resources , which include coal , gold , graphite , iron ore , magnesite , silver , tungsten , zinc have drawn the interest of investors .
South Korea 's state - owned Korea Resources Corp. is involved in mining projects in the North .

Gun rights groups said attempts by Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor to defuse a showdown on Second Amendment rights have done little to assuage their concerns .
Gun Owners of America is actively lobbying against Judge Sotomayor ’s confirmation , but the National Rifle Association has yet to take a position .
The way the NRA chooses to go could have consequences for moderate to conservative Democrats who helped their party develop a staggering advantage in the Senate .
“ All options are on the table , ” said Andrew Arulanandam , NRA spokesman .
“ The rulings she has made are troubling , and concern us . ”
Whether the NRA includes the Sotomayor vote on its scorecard - a possibility Mr. Arulanandam did not rule out - could weigh heavily on Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2010 , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Judge Sotomayor on Tuesday told Sen. Jim DeMint , South Carolina Republican , she could not comment on an expansive definition of the Second Amendment .
On Thursday , she hurried to put out the fire by explaining to Sen.
Mark Udall , Colorado Democrat , that her stance was predicated on “ settled law , ” including last year ’s Supreme Court ruling that overturned the decades - old D.C. gun ban .
Gun issues have been an area where moderate to conservative Democrats have been more than willing to side with the Republican minority .
Oklahoma Sen .
Tom Coburn ’s amendment to adopt concealed - carry laws in national parks won inclusion with the help of 27 Democrats who crossed the aisle to support the measure .
Senate Democrats looking to expand their 19 - seat majority in the Senate , including a Minnesota seat still unresolved , have ample opportunity in the 2010 elections but also will defend seats in key states , such as Mr. Reid ’s in Nevada .
Shortly after President Obama nominated Judge Sotomayor , Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , issued a glowing assessment of the nominee , but stopped just short of an endorsement .
“ I ’m a little surprised the NRA is taking a ‘ wait - and - see ’ approach - they ’re having their board members come out and attack her , ” Mr. Helmke said last week .
Mr. Helmke said it ’s hard to determine Judge Sotomayor ’s standpoint on gun control because as an appellate judge she was constrained by the Supreme Court ’s ruling in the D.C. gun case and precedents set in the late 1800s that have long stood as the judicial benchmark on gun rights .
While Judge Sotomayor has not said outright what her stance is on gun control , she ruled last year that the Second Amendment right to bear arms does not automatically transfer to the states - a decision gun-control opponents have read as a clear stance on the issue .
“ Stating the obvious that Heller [ the D.C. gun case known as District of Columbia v. Heller ] is settled law does n’t tell us much , ” Mr. DeMint said .
“ What ’s more important is that Judge Sotomayor has recently ruled that Heller only applies to federal lands like Washington , D.C. , and her opinion was that the hundreds of millions of Americans in the 50 states do not have a fundamental right to bear arms .
She refused to back away from that opinion in my meeting with her this week . ”
Judge Sotomayor ruled against a man possessing nunchakus ( or “ nunchucks ” ) as part of a three - judge panel last year .
In the ruling , which was unsigned , the panel determined that while the Supreme Court struck down the D.C. gun ban , its rationale did not expressly extend the Second Amendment right to bear arms to the states .
Earlier this year , the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled comparably in a lawsuit seeking to strike down Chicago ’s ban on handguns .
The three - judge panel reached a similar conclusion as the Sotomayor panel , saying that the Supreme Court determined the Second Amendment right to bear arms is applicable only on federal land - including the nation ’s capital .
But a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled recently that the Second Amendment right to bear arms does extend beyond federal jurisdictions to the states , creating a “ circuit split ” among the federal appeals courts that could lead to the Supreme Court reviewing any or all three cases in its next session .
Gun Owners of America has had little hesitation in lobbying Democratic and Republican senators to oppose Judge Sotomayor ’s confirmation , arguing that previous votes in favor of gun rights pale in comparison to their upcoming Supreme Court vote .
“ We ’re conveying on the Hill that this is the big one , anything you might have done in the past was wiped clean , ” said Larry Pratt , executive director of Gun Owners of America .
“ We want Republicans deciding they ’re going to fight this .
This needs to be something that goes on the record , ” he said .
Mr. Helmke said he does n’t see a knock - down , drag - out fight over the Sotomayor nomination , but that if Second Amendment questions become a problem , his group will join the fray .
“ We might take a more active role if it looks like she ’s going to be contested , ” he said .

What is Myth ?
In a time long past , the armies of the dark came again into the lands of men ...
Myth is a real time tactical game based on squad and unit management rather than resource gathering and expansion .
Thanks to a realistic physics engine and meticulous unit balance , gameplay is highly varied and flexible .
Your success or failure will be dictated by clear planning , an understanding of the terrain and an ability to mobilise your troops effectively ; brute force alone will likely get you killed .
Set against the backdrop of an ancient cyclical struggle , Myth II tracks the progress of the forces of light in an epic crusade for survival .
The wild lands and immersive history of Myth — influenced heavily by mythology and literature — provide an exquisite setting for the desperate battle to defeat Soulblighter 's dark minions , and secure the fate of the world .
You can also play Myth online , both cooperatively and competitively .
The faithful fan community that has sprung up around the game as a result , has produced an incredible array of 3rd party maps and add - ons that have further extended the life of the series .
You can get involved too with the bundled mapmaking tools and community - run servers currently in operation .
How can I play Myth ?
To get started with your first experience of Myth , download the free Myth II 1.8.3 Demo and fire up a new single player game .
Once you 've had a taste of the carnage on offer , you 'll want to try your hand online .
You 're actually already set up to play on Gate of Storms as a guest user , without having to register .
So just open the Multiplayer Game menu , click " Server " , pick Gate of Storms , choose your login name , team and colors , then click on the Login button without entering a password .

Converting from MySQL to CouchDB with Haskell
Henry Laxen
June 1 , 2008
Why
My former website , which I started about ten years ago , is really beginning to show its age .
The dynamic part of it was written with perl , MySQL , and HTML :: Mason , which was ( and in many respects still is ) good technology , but about once a month or so I get an email that some page or other crashed .
Getting those last few bugs out of your perl code , especially after not looking at it for a few years , can be a very daunting task .
So my project for the foreseeable future is to redo the site with new bright and shiny technology .
For this I 've chosen Haskell , happstack , and CouchDB .
The first step in the transition is getting my data out of MYSQL and getting it into CouchDB .
My hope is that by documenting my experience , I can save others who choose the same ( or similar ) path some of the pain and frustration I experienced during this transition .
Another Why
Although I have been learning and using Haskell for more than a year now , my feeble mind has a very hard time getting itself around the documentation .
Yes , if you are really brilliant , the documentation provided is sometimes necessary , but rarely sufficient , to understand what the code does .
Personally , I like to learn by example , and thus far examples are severely lacking in most of the Haskell documentation I have encountered .
My hope is that by reading this paper , you will be able to avoid many of the blind alleys I had to go down in order to produce working code .
It may not be the best or most elegant solution to the problem , but at least you have something to start with .
It reminds me of what my best friend used to tell me : Better is the enemy of good .
One comment before we begin .
This code runs on my system , but of course it wo n't run on yours .
I doubt you have MySQL tables laid out like mine , and that your usernames and passwords are the same .
However , with minimal editing , there is no reason why you could n't make all of this code run on your system , and learn a lot in the process .
So let 's get started .
Here is the table that describes what data I am keeping about each user .
My goal is to get something similar into a CouchDB database and use Haskell to do the conversion .
CREATE TABLE `User` ( `user_id` int ( 10 ) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment , `user_key` varchar ( 40 ) NOT NULL default '' , `first_name` varchar ( 40 ) NOT NULL default '' , `last_name` varchar ( 40 ) default NULL , `password` varchar ( 40 ) NOT NULL default '' , `email` varchar ( 40 ) default NULL , `alternate_email` varchar ( 40 ) default NULL , `email_bounce` int ( 11 ) default NULL , `email_active` char ( 1 ) default NULL , `last_visit` date default NULL , `next_to_last_visit` date default NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `user_id` ) , UNIQUE KEY `user_key` ( `user_key` ) )
The first thing I wanted to do is just use Haskell to fetch a few rows of my data , and take a look at it .
I proceeded as follows :
> > import qualified Database .HSQL.MySQL as My > import Database .HSQL > import Database.CouchDB > import Data.Ratio > import Control .
Monad > import Text .JSON > import Text .JSON .
Pretty > import Text .JSON .
Generic > import Data .Data > import Data .
Char > import Data .
Maybe
Since I already wrote this code once , I discovered a few patterns that I used over and over again .
I 've put them here at the beginning , to make life a little easier .
> type QueryViewResult = ( Database.CouchDB.Doc , JSValue ) > type JSObjectItem = ( String , JSValue ) > > user = db " user " >
a Few = take 3 > > unJSObject :: JSValue -> [ ( String , JSValue ) ] > unJSObject ( JSObject x ) = fromJSObject x > ppJSON :: JSValue -> IO ( ) > ppJSON = putStrLn . render .
pp_value
Now lets grab some data from MySQL and have a look at it :
> openDB :: IO Connection > openDB = > My.connect " localhost.localdomain " " dbName " " dbUser " " dbPassword " > getSqlData :: Connection -> String -> IO ( [ ( String , SqlType , Bool ) ] , [ [ String ] ] ) > getSqlData con sqlStatement = do > stmt <- query con sqlStatement > let fields = get FieldsTypes stmt > let fieldnames = map ( \ ( a , _ , _ ) -> a ) $ getFieldsTypes stmt > values <- forEachRow ( \ st s -> do > v <- mapM ( get FieldValue st ) fieldnames > > return $ s ++ [ v ] > ) stmt [ ] > return ( fields , values ) > > run1 :: IO ( [ ( String , SqlType , Bool ) ] , [ [ String ] ] ) > run1 = do > conn <- openDB > getSqlData conn " select * from User " > > test1 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run1 > putStrLn ( show fields ) > print $ aFew values
which on my system printed out the following ( reformatted ) :
[ ( " user_id " , SqlInteger , False ) , ( " user_key " , SqlVarChar 40 , False ) , ( " first_name " , SqlVarChar 40 , False ) , ( " last_name " , SqlVarChar 40 , True ) , ( " password " , SqlVarChar 40 , False ) , ( " email " , SqlVarChar 40 , True ) , ( " alternate_email " , SqlVarChar 40 , True ) , ( " email_bounce " , SqlInteger , True ) , ( " email_active " , SqlChar 1 , True ) , ( " last_visit " , SqlDate , True ) , ( " next_to_last_visit " , SqlDate , True ) ] [ [ " 1 " , " williamxx " , " William " , " Hudsun " , " xxxxxx " , " dynamicg@a.com " , " dynamicg@a.com " , " 0 " , " 1 " , " 2005 -01-01 " , " 2005-01-01 " ] , [ " 2 " , " deanxxx " , " Dean " , " Murrisun " , " xxxxxx " , " dinum@a.com " , " dinum@a.com " , " 0 " , " 1 " , " 2003-02-24 " , " 2003-02-04 " ] , [ " 3 " , " calandcindixxx " , " Cal and Cindi " , " Huuver " , " xxxxxx " , " lucumutiunusa@a.com " , " calandcindi@a.com " , " 0 " , " 1 " , " 2003-12-08 " , " 2005-01-01 " ] ]
Great , we can get data out of the MySQL database .
The next step is to convert it to a JSON value , so that we can stick it into a Couch DB database .
While I 'm at it , I thought I should clean up some of the datatypes and I might as well use Haskell to write a little code for me .
So I tried the following :
> type ConvertSqlToJSON = SqlType -> String -> JSValue > cv1 :: ConvertSqlToJSON > cv1 ( SqlChar 1 ) x = JSBool ( x /= " 0 " ) > cv1 ( SqlVarChar _ ) x = JSString ( toJSString x ) > cv1 SqlInteger x = JSRational False ( ( read x ) % 1 ) > cv1 SqlDate x = JSString ( toJSString x ) > > cd1 :: ( String , SqlType , Bool ) ->
String > cd1 ( s , SqlInteger , _ ) = s ++ " :: Int ,
" > cd1 ( s , SqlChar 1 , _ ) = s ++ " :: Bool ,
" > cd1 ( s , SqlVarChar _ , _ ) = s ++ " :: String ,
" > cd1 ( s , SqlDate , _ ) = s ++ " :: String ,
" >
> sqlToJSON :: [ String ] -> [ SqlType ] -> [ String ] -> > ConvertSqlToJSON
-> JSValue > sqlToJSON names types value convertF = makeObj ( zip names values ) > where > values = map ( uncurry convertF ) ( zip types value ) > > run2 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run1 > let ( names , types , _ ) = unzip3 fields > jvalues <- forM ( a Few values ) ( \ x -> do > return $ sqlToJSON names types x cv1 ) > return ( concatMap cd1 fields , jvalues ) > > test2 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run2 > putStrLn fields > print values >
Now running test2 produced :
user_id :: Int , user_key :: String , first_name :: String , last_name :: String , password :: String , email :: String , alternate_email :: String , email_bounce :: Int , email_active :: Bool , last_visit :: String , next_to_last_visit :: String ,
which I copied and pasted into :
data User = User { ... } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show , Typeable , Data )
and something horrible like :
JSONObject { fromJSObject = [ ( " user_id " , JSRational False ( 1 % 1 ) ) , ( " user_key " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " williamlolohud " } ) ) , ( " first_name " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " William " } ) ) , ( " last_name " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " Hudson " } ) ) , ( " password " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " xxxxxx " } ) ) , ( " email " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " dynamicg@a.com "} ) ) , ( " alternate_email " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " dynamicg@a.com "} ) ) , ( " email_bounce " , JSRational False ( 0 % 1 ) ) , ( " email_active " , JSBool True ) , ( " last_visit " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " 2005-01 -01 " } ) ) , ( " next_to_last_visit " , JSString ( JSONString { fromJSString = " 2005 -01-01 " } ) ) ] } ...
I would have been much better off doing :
> test3 = do > ( _ , jvalues ) <- run2 > mapM_ ppJSON ( aFew jvalues )
resulting in :
{ " user_id " : 1 , " user_key " : " williamlolohud " , " first_name " : " William " , " last_name " : " Hudson " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " dynamicg@a.com " , " alternate_email " : " dynamicg@a.com " , " email_bounce " : 0 , " email_active " : true , " last_visit " : " 2005-01-01 " , " next_to_last_visit " : " 2005-01 -01 " } { " user_id " : 2 , " user_key " : " deandino " , " first_name " : " Dean " , " last_name " : " Morrison " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " dinom@a.com " , " alternate_email " : " dinom@a.com " , " email_bounce " : 0 , " email_active " : true , " last_visit " : " 2003-02 - 24 " , " next_to_last_visit " : " 2003-02 -04 " } { " user_id " : 3 , " user_key " : " calandcindiroy " , " first_name " : " Cal and Cindi " , " last_name " : " Hoover " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " locomotionusa@a.com " , " alternate_email " : " calandcindi@a.com " , " email_bounce " : 0 , " email_active " : true , " last_visit " : " 2003-12-08 " , " next_to_last_visit " : " 2005-01-01 " }
> showUser :: String -> IO ( ) > showUser idString = do >
Just ( _ , _ , jvalue ) <- runCouchDB ' $ getDoc user ( doc idString ) > ppJSON jvalue >
Now that looks like it might actually be right .
Now let 's see if we can stick this into a CouchDB database .
I created a database named user using the futon interface , and then proceeded with :
> test4 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run1 > let ( names , types , _ ) = unzip3 fields > runCouchDB ' $ do > mapM_ ( \ x -> newDoc user ( sqlToJSON names types x cv1 ) ) values >
and a few minutes later I am rewarded with a database containing 1846 documents , each one looking like :
_id " 000c6bddf83a6662d1a54bacdb059bc1 " _rev " 1-2462198463 " alternate_email " ecodwelling@a.com " email " maas.k@a.com " email_active true email_bounce 0 first_name " Kenneth " last_name " Maas " last_visit " 2004 - 10 - 31 " next_to_last_visit " 2004 - 10 - 15 " password " xxxxxx " user_id 1140 user_key " kennethcrab "
Great , we have a bunch of data to play with .
Now let 's see if we can grab it and put it inside of a Haskell data type .
Just so you do n't have to scroll back , earlier we defined :
> > data SqlUser = SqlUser { > user_id :: Int , > user_key :: String , > first_name :: String , > last_name :: String , > password :: String , > email :: String , > alternate_email :: String , > email_bounce :: Int , > email_active :: Bool , > last_visit :: String , > next_to_last_visit :: String > } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show , Typeable , Data ) >
So now lets grab a CouchDB doc and see if we can stick it in our data type .
getDoc returns a bunch of stuff besides the actual JSON data , so we define justDoc to unwrap it at get at the data we are interested in .
> justDoc :: ( Data a ) =>
Maybe ( Database.CouchDB.Doc , Rev , JSValue ) -> a > justDoc ( Just ( d , r , x ) ) = stripResult ( fromJSON x ) > where stripResult ( Ok z ) = z > stripResult ( Error s ) = error $ " JSON error " ++ s > justDoc Nothing = error " No such Document " > > test5 = do > d1 <- runCouchDB ' $ do > d2 <- getDoc user ( doc " 000c6bddf83a6662d1a54bacdb059bc1 " ) > return ( justDoc d2 :: SqlUser ) > print d1 >
resulting in :
SqlUser {user_id = 1140 , user_key = " kennethcrab " , first_name = " Kenneth " , last_name = " Maas " , password = " xxxxxx " , email = " maas.k@a.com " , alternate_email = " ecodwelling@a.com " , email_bounce = 0 , email_active = True , last_visit = " 2004-10 - 31 " , next_to_last_visit = " 2004-10 -15 " }
A real live Haskell data type !
Cool .
So , what I want to do now , is remove the user_key field , and add a field to the document identifying the type of the document , namely { docType : " user "} .
While I 'm at it , I 'll convert the names to a more Haskell - esqe look by removing the underscores , and capitalizing the next letter .
Furthermore , I want to do this for all of the documents in the database .
Time to roll out a couple more CouchDB functions , namely getAllDocIds and getAndUpdateDoc .
> rename :: String ->
String > rename s = prefix ++ fix rest > where > ( prefix , rest ) = span ( == ' _' ) s > fix ( x : ' _' : y : ys ) = x : ( toUpper y ) : fix ys > fix ( x : xs ) = x : fix xs > fix [ ] = [ ] > > tidyUser :: [ JSObjectItem ] -> [ JSObjectItem ] > tidy User x = addType .
renameKeys .
removeFields $ x > where > removeFields = filter ( \ ( x , _ ) -> x /= " user_key " ) > renameKeys = map ( \ ( x , y ) -> ( rename x , y ) ) > addType = flip ( ++ ) [ ( " docType " , showJSON " user " ) ] > > test6 = do > runCouchDB ' $ do > ids <- getAllDocIds user > forM_ ids ( \ x -> do > getAndUpdateDoc user x update ) > where > update z = return $ toJSObject .
tidyUser .
fromJSObject $ z >
if we now run showUser on some random _id we will see :
{ " _id " : " 000c6bddf83a6662d1a54bacdb059bc1 " , " _rev " : " 4-10419220 " , " userId " : 1140 , " firstName " : " Kenneth " , " lastName " : " Maas " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " maas.k@a.com " , " alternateEmail " : " ecodwelling@a.com " , " emailBounce " : 0 , " emailActive " : true , " lastVisit " : " 2004-10 -31 " , " nextToLastVisit " : " 2004 -10 - 15 " , " docType " : " user " }
Life is good .
The keys have been converted , the user_key field has been removed , and the docType field has been added .
What I did next was to go back to the futon interface and compact the database .
This resulted in all of the previous revisions ( the docs with the underscores ) being removed .
But since I 'm coming from a MySQL background , you can bet I have other tables lying around that reference the user table .
In fact , one of the apps available on my website is a kind of multiple listing service for the home buyers and sellers in the area .
My goal was to try to clean up the byzantine real estate practices that are common down here by providing publically accessible information .
( I 'm still working on that one . )
So ,
> run7 :: IO ( [ ( String , SqlType , Bool ) ] , [ [ String ] ] ) > run7 = do > conn <- openDB > getSqlData conn " select * from mops_buyer "
> test7 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run7 > print fields > print $ aFew values
which results in :
[ ( " buyer_id " , SqlInteger , False ) , ( " user_id " , SqlInteger , False ) , ( " search_district " , SqlChar 20 , True ) , ( " search_type " , SqlChar 20 , True ) , ( " search_bedrooms " , SqlReal , True ) , ( " search_bathrooms " , SqlReal , True ) , ( " low_price " , SqlReal , True ) , ( " high_price " , SqlReal , True ) , ( " search_currency " , SqlChar 1 , True ) , ( " display_order " , SqlChar 1 , True ) ] [ [ " 175 " , " 831 " , " 1 " , " 2 " , " 2 " , " 1 " , " 0 " , " 1e+07 " , " 2 " , " 1 " ] , [ " 2 " , " 31 " , " 1 " , " 12 " , " 2 " , " 1 " , " 0 " , " 75000 " , " 2 " , " 1 " ] , [ " 3 " , " 32 " , " 1 " , " 12 " , " 2 " , " 2 " , " 0 " , " 125000 " , " 2 " , " 1 " ] ]
Now my plan is that instead of having a separate document that holds the buyer data , I 'll just pull it into an object in the existing user document .
In essence I 'm doing a join , based on the user_id field present in a buyer row .
I also want to clean up the data while I 'm at it .
But before we go there , let 's take a look at how we can create and run views .
> test8 = do > runCouchDB ' $ do > newView " user " " mops " > [ ViewMap " byuserid " > " function ( doc ) {emit( doc.userId , doc ) ; } " ]
> limit :: JSObjectItem > limit = ( " limit " , showJSON ( 3 :: Int ) )
> test9 = do > a :: [ QueryViewResult ] <- runCouchDB ' $ do > query View user ( doc " / _design / mops " ) ( doc " byuserid " ) > [ limit ] > mapM_ ( ppJSON . snd ) a
which results in :
{ " _id " : " 3c98d483cde5d7da899b8f4ea877bd38 " , " _rev " : " 2-2948703597 " , " userId " : 1 , " firstName " : " William " , " lastName " : " Hudson " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " dynamicg@a.com " , " alternateEmail " : " dynamicg@a.com " , " emailBounce " : 0 , " emailActive " : true , " lastVisit " : " 2005-01-01 " , " nextToLastVisit " : " 2005-01-01 " , " docType " : " user "} { " _id " : " 932e15f0e3f00f769013cc5788becbcf " , " _rev " : " 2-1437920368 " , " userId " : 2 , " firstName " : " Dean " , " lastName " : " Morrison " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " dinom@a.com " , " alternateEmail " : " dinom@a.com " , " emailBounce " : 0 , " emailActive " : true , " lastVisit " : " 2003-02 - 24 " , " nextToLastVisit " : " 2003-02-04 " , " docType " : " user " } { " _id " : " 2832c0b77b1a3c35b6eb663da19c5772 " , " _rev " : " 2-2783322955 " , " userId " : 3 , " firstName " : " Cal and Cindi " , " lastName " : " Hoover " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " locomotionusa@a.com " , " alternateEmail " : " calandcindi@a.com " , " emailBounce " : 0 , " emailActive " : true , " lastVisit " : " 2003-12-08 " , " nextToLastVisit " : " 2005-01-01 " , " docType " : " user " }
Now let me explain what is happening here .
I wanted to be able to ask the question , is x contained in [ y ] , in perl , knowing that most of the users did n't care if x was contained in [ y ] , namely they were happy with any [ y ] .
Since I was using perl , I came up with this scheme to let strings represent the possible values of [ y ] , and I gave x= " 1 " the special property that it was an element of any [ y ] .
Now that I am converting this to Haskell , it is time to pay the piper and clean things up , so I will translate my perl / sql data into the Contains data type defined below .
> data Contains = Any | Some [ Int ] deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show , Typeable , Data ) > > ordering :: [ Int ] > ordering = [ ord ' 1 ' .. ord ' 9 ' ] ++ > [ ord ' A ' .. ord ' Z ' ] ++ > [ ord ' a ' .. ord ' z ' ] > mapFrom :: String -> [ Int ] > mapFrom x = map ( \ c -> ( fromJust $ lookup ( ord c ) ( zip ordering [ 0 .. ] ) ) ) x > cv2 :: ConvertSqlToJSON > cv2 ( SqlChar 20 ) x = toJSON $ if x == " 1 " then Any > else Some $ ( map ( \ y -> y 1 ) ) ( mapFrom x ) > cv2 SqlInteger x = toJSON ( read x :: Int ) > cv2 SqlReal x = toJSON ( read x :: Float ) > cv2 ( SqlChar 1 ) x = toJSON $ head ( mapFrom x ) > test10 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run7 > let ( names , types , _ ) = unzip3 fields > jvalues <- forM ( a Few values ) ( \ x -> do > return $ sqlToJSON names types x cv2 ) > mapM_ ppJSON jvalues
resulting in :
{ " buyer_id " : 175 , " user_id " : 831 , " search_district " : " Any " , " search_type " : { " Some " : [ 0 ] } , " search_bedrooms " : 2 , " search_bathrooms " : 1 , " low_price " : 0 , " high_price " : 10000000 , " search_currency " : 1 , " display_order " : 0} { " buyer_id " : 2 , " user_id " : 31 , " search_district " : " Any " , " search_type " : { " Some " : [ - 1 , 0]} , " search_bedrooms " : 2 , " search_bathrooms " : 1 , " low_price " : 0 , " high_price " : 75000 , " search_currency " : 1 , " display_order " : 0} { " buyer_id " : 3 , " user_id " : 32 , " search_district " : " Any " , " search_type " : { " Some " : [ - 1 , 0]} , " search_bedrooms " : 2 , " search_bathrooms " : 2 , " low_price " : 0 , " high_price " : 125000 , " search_currency " : 1 , " display_order " : 0}
Whoops , it appears that I forgot how inconsistent I was ten years ago .
Apparently the search_type does not have an any choice .
I 'll have to fix that .
This is ugly , but I think the easiest way to do it is to modify the value I get back from the sql before I convert it to JSON .
So I 'm going to modify test10 to become :
> replace :: Int -> ( a -> a ) -> [ a ] -> [ a ] > replace i f ( y : ys ) > | i >
0 = y : replace ( i 1 ) f ys > | otherwise = f y : ys > replace _ _ _ = [ ] > > add1 :: String ->
String > add1 = map ( \ x -> chr $ ( ord x ) + 1 ) > > test11 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run7 > let ( names , types , _ ) = unzip3 fields > jvalues <- forM ( aFew values ) ( \ x -> do > let y = replace 3 add1 x > return $ sqlToJSON names types y cv2 > ) > mapM_ ppJSON jvalues
resulting in :
{ " buyer_id " : 175 , " user_id " : 831 , " search_district " : " Any " , " search_type " : { " Some " : [ 1 ] } , " search_bedrooms " : 2 , " search_bathrooms " : 1 , " low_price " : 0 , " high_price " : 10000000 , " search_currency " : 1 , " display_order " : 0} { " buyer_id " : 2 , " user_id " : 31 , " search_district " : " Any " , " search_type " : { " Some " : [ 0 , 1]} , " search_bedrooms " : 2 , " search_bathrooms " : 1 , " low_price " : 0 , " high_price " : 75000 , " search_currency " : 1 , " display_order " : 0} { " buyer_id " : 3 , " user_id " : 32 , " search_district " : " Any " , " search_type " : { " Some " : [ 0 , 1]} , " search_bedrooms " : 2 , " search_bathrooms " : 2 , " low_price " : 0 , " high_price " : 125000 , " search_currency " : 1 , " display_order " : 0}
Now let 's go ahead in stick these rows into CouchDB .
I 'll Haskellize the names as before , and add one more field , namely docType = mopsBuyer .
> tidyBuyer :: [ JSObjectItem ] -> [ JSObjectItem ] > tidyBuyer x = addType .
renameKeys $ x > where > renameKeys = map ( \ ( x , y ) -> ( rename x , y ) ) > addType = flip ( ++ ) [ ( " docType " , showJSON " mopsBuyer " ) ] > > test12 = do > ( fields , values ) <- run7 > let ( names , types , _ ) = unzip3 fields > runCouchDB ' $ do > forM_ values ( \ x -> do > let y = replace 3 add1 x > let v = ( make Obj .
tidyBuyer .
unJSObject ) $ > sqlToJSON names types y cv2 > newDoc user v > )
Okay , at this point I went back into the futon utility , and created a view in a design document .
I wrote a simple little javascript program , which I saved as join1 in design document mops as follows :
function ( doc ) { if ( doc.docType == " mopsBuyer " ) { emit ( [ doc.userId,0 ] , doc ) ; } else if ( doc.docType == " user " ) { emit ( [ doc.user Id,1 ] , doc ) ; } }
which spits out all of the documents , in sorted order , with mopsBuyer docTypes preceding user docTypes , if they exist .
I can use this view to do a join , by incorporating the mopsBuyer docType into a user doc .
> addMopsInfo :: JSValue -> JSValue -> JSValue > addMopsInfo buyerDoc userDoc = add Field $ removeUnwanted > where > notWanted :: [ String ] > notWanted = [ " buyerId " , " userId " , " docType " , " _id " , " _rev " ] > removeUnwanted :: [ JSObjectItem ] > removeUnwanted = filter ( \ x -> fst x `notElem` notWanted ) > ( unJSObject buyerDoc ) > add Field :: [ JSObjectItem ] -> JSValue > add Field x = makeObj $ ( unJSObject userDoc ) ++ [ ( " mopsBuyer " , make Obj x ) ] > > printView :: QueryViewResult -> IO ( ) > printView ( docID , jvalue ) = do > putStrLn $ ( show docID ) ++ " ->
" ++ ( render .
pp_value ) jvalue > > join2 :: [ QueryViewResult ] -> IO ( ) > join2 [ _ ] = return ( ) > join2 [ ] = return ( ) > join2 ( x1 : x2 : xs ) = do > let isBuyer = isJust $ lookup " buyerId " ( unJSObject ( snd x1 ) ) > update = const $ return ( addMopsInfo ( snd x1 ) ( snd x2 ) ) > if isBuyer > then do > runCouchDB ' $ do > getAndUpdateDoc user ( fst x2 ) update > forceDeleteDoc user ( fst x1 ) > join2 xs > else join2 ( x2 : xs ) > > test13 = do > r :: [ QueryViewResult ] <- runCouchDB ' $ > queryView user ( doc " / _design / mops " ) ( doc " join1 " ) [ ] > join2 r > > test14 = showUser " 0071c83f5990ac6efcc761bb7f3d7449 " >
Running test13 followed by test14 results in :
{ " _id " : " 00558ccbcce5040cdb1c6e0eafaf123c " , " _rev " : " 3-3763208442 " , " userId " : 1498 , " firstName " : " Mike " , " lastName " : " Vukasinovich " , " password " : " xxxxxx " , " email " : " eastcounty@a.com " , " alternateEmail " : " eastcounty@a.com " , " emailBounce " : 0 , " emailActive " : true , " lastVisit " : " 2006-04 - 17 " , " nextToLastVisit " : " 2006 -04 - 17 " , " docType " : " user " , " mopsBuyer " : { " searchDistrict " : " Any " , " searchType " : { " Some " : [ 0 , 1]} , " searchBedrooms " : 0 , " searchBathrooms " : 0 , " lowPrice " : 0 , " high Price " : 10000000 , " searchCurrency " : 1 , " displayOrder " : 0}}
Which looks like what I wanted .
The mopsBuyer info has been absorbed by the user doc .
If we want to start over , we can delete the CouchDB database and regenerate it with :
> runall = test4 >> test6 >> test12 >> test13
Let 's stop here and review what we 've done .
We 've grabbed some data from a MySQL database , and looked at what came out with test1 .
We saw that we can get the names , types , and values of the data .
We then wrote some code to convert the sql data to JSON , and a little more code to print out the Haskell data type associated with this MySQL table in test2 .
In test3 we used the JSON pretty printer to display the converted sql data in a more readable format .
Then , in test4 we put the data into a CouchDB database .
In test5 we grabbed some data out of the CouchDB database and used the generic JSON conversion to convert it into a Haskell data type .
Then , in test6 we updated the CouchDB docs to change both the names and some of the objects of the JSON data .
In test7 , we took a look at an associated MySQL table , which references keys in the user table defined previously .
In test8 we used Haskell to add a new view to CouchDB , and in test9 we used the view to look at the CouchDB database in a different way .
In test10 we grabbed some data from the mops_buyer table , converted it to JSON , and took a look at it , realizing that our conversion was in error , which we fixed in test11 .
Then in test12 , we took the result of the conversion , cleaned it up some more , and put it into a bunch of new CouchDB docs , adding a field that told us this doc was a mopsBuyer , and not a user .
We then wrote a relatively trivial piece of javascript to view the existing CouchDB data , such that it was displayed with all mopsBuyer type docs just before their associated user type doc .
Using this view , we were able to do a join of the mopsBuyer table into the user table in test13 .
The end result is a bunch of CouchDB documents , each one describing a user of the maztravel.com system .
Those users that were interested in learning about new properties for sale had a mopsBuyer field that contained the parameters of the properties they were interesting in learning more about .
In addition , the type system of Haskell , forced me , kicking and screaming , to clean up some of the inconsistencies that perl let me get away with when I first built the system ten years ago .
Not bad for a days work .

They were killed on the same day , in the same way .
One of the deaths captured the attention of a city and spurred the Los Angeles Police Department into overdrive .
The other slipped by unnoticed , leaving a lone detective with little more to go on than hope .
Adrianna Bachan died first .
Shortly after 3 a.m. March 29 , Bachan , 18 , and a friend stood at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street on the edge of the USC campus .
Returning home after a night out , the two students stepped into the crosswalk and started across Jefferson .
An eastbound car blew through a red light , tossing Bachan into the air and hurling her friend onto the windshield , before it disappeared into the darkness , witnesses and police said .
Bachan ’s friend suffered broken legs and other injuries .
Bachan was alive when she reached California Hospital Medical Center , but died before sunrise of massive head injuries .
Advertisement
Minutes before 11 that night -- just as television stations were about to start news broadcasts filled with reports about Bachan ’s death -- Agapito Gaspar Nicolas stepped into a crosswalk on Figueroa Street , a block from his cramped Highland Park apartment .
The 55 - year - old Guatemala native had been scratching out a living on construction crews since coming to California about 15 years ago .
Nicolas ’ girlfriend would guess later that he had been on his way to a taco stand to pick up carne asada burritos for her and her children -- something he did often .
Just before he reached the far curb , a car broadsided him and dragged or threw him 70 feet .
Paramedics found Nicolas lying in the street with a fractured skull .
He died soon afterward .
::
About an hour after Bachan was hit , Jimmy Render , a detective supervisor in the LAPD ’s South Bureau Traffic Division , arrived at the scene to take over for uniformed officers .
He was not encouraged by what he found .
Witnesses could offer only a vague description of the car -- a dark - colored sedan , maybe a Toyota Corolla , maybe a Honda Accord .
No one had glimpsed the license plate or managed to get a look at the driver .
And no piece of the car -- a hood ornament or bumper that could have been used to identify the make and model -- had been recovered .
Advertisement
Render knew his best move was an appeal to the public .
Perhaps the driver had confessed to someone or a neighbor had seen the damaged car .
By midmorning , police had put out a news release about the accident and TV stations and newspapers jumped at a story involving the death of a USC student .
Render did several on - camera interviews that day , offering details of the crime .
The driver , he said , had driven on with Bachan ’s friend lying on the hood of the car .
The car stopped suddenly and a passenger jumped out to pull the young man ’s body to the ground .
The car then sped off again .
Media interest exploded the next morning , when Bachan ’s mother went to the site of the hit - and - run , clutching photographs of her daughter , a freshman from Santa Barbara .
Television crews and newspaper reporters waiting for an LAPD news conference swarmed the woman .
Wild with grief , she paced back and forth .
“ Please , anyone who knows anything , please help us , ” she wailed .
“ Please , I beg you . ”
Advertisement
Over the next several days , television broadcasts and news websites were saturated with images of an inconsolable Carmen Bachan at news conferences , addressing the L.A. City Council and attending memorial services for her daughter .
The photographs of Adrianna she carried and held up to the cameras added to the pathos .
The media seized on one that showed a rosy - cheeked young woman with dirty - blond hair and big , round eyes , smiling broadly .
The callousness of the driver and passenger , the grief of the mother , the image of a beautiful young woman -- it all added to the usual pressure on LAPD and city officials to quickly solve high - profile crimes at USC , an enclave of privilege and wealth surrounded by poverty and violence .
Typically , City Council members wait for a request from police before posting a reward in a case .
But police said staffers for Councilman Bernard Parks , who represents the USC area , did not wait for a request and arranged for speedy approval of a $ 75,000 reward -- the highest amount allowable under city statute .
The university added $ 50,000 , the county Board of Supervisors $ 10,000 , and an anonymous donor $ 100,000 , bringing the total to $ 235,000 .
It was more than someone could collect from the city for information about a serial killer believed responsible for at least 11 deaths .
Advertisement
News of the reward led to hundreds of tips , which quickly overwhelmed detectives .
Normally , one or two detectives work a fatal hit - and - run .
In this case , LAPD officials assigned all four detectives in the South Bureau Traffic Division , along with several police officers and about 12 of the bureau ’s best homicide detectives , who put their other cases on hold , police said .
In all , as many as 20 detectives and uniformed officers would join the hunt for Bachan ’s killer -- extraordinary resources for a hit - and - run investigation .
The effort paid off .
Amid all the bogus tips was a real lead : a phone call from someone who identified the driver as Claudia Cabrera , a 30 - year - old South Los Angeles woman .
On an unannounced visit to her home , detectives saw shards of broken window glass on the carport floor .
Cabrera told police her husband had been in an accident , but was vague about the details and said she did n’t know where he or the car had gone , police said .
In what would prove to be a crucial break , Cabrera gave the detectives her cellphone number .
A surveillance detail kept watch on Cabrera .
Early the next morning , Det. Chris Barling of the South Bureau ’s Criminal Gang Homicide Group reached out to an FBI agent he knew who had expertise in tracking cellphones .
Within a few hours , using call records and other data from Cabrera ’s cellphone provider , the agent determined that she was in the immediate vicinity when Bachan was struck .
Advertisement
In the days that followed , police would piece together Cabrera ’s movements that night .
She and her husband , Josue Luna , left their infant son with a baby - sitter at a friend ’s house near USC and drove to the San Fernando Valley with the friend for a party , police said .
Shortly before 3 a.m. , the couple returned to drop off their friend and pick up the 5 - month - old baby .
Then they headed home .
Cabrera was behind the wheel and Luna -- the heavyset Latino witnesses had seen dragging Bachan ’s friend off the hood -- was in the passenger seat , police said .
Detectives returned to Cabrera ’s house with a search warrant and , by late afternoon , took her into custody .
Before a phalanx of TV cameras , high - ranking police officials and council members announced the arrest .
“ I really want to thank the press for keeping this story alive , ” Bachan ’s mother said through tears .
“ That was my goal . ”
Advertisement
Cabrera has pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular manslaughter and hit - and - run .
A few days after her arrest , Luna was caught by federal border agents trying to re-enter the country after fleeing to Mexico .
He was charged with being an accomplice to a crime .
In television interviews after posting bail , he expressed remorse for the crash and for leaving the scene , but said he believed the traffic light had been green .
Adrianna Bachan had been dead less than a week .
The search for Agapito Nicolas ’ killer unfolded differently .
No detective was summoned to the crime scene -- common in hit - and - runs in which the victim does not die at the scene .
Instead , uniformed officers collected what information they could and wrote a report .
As with Bachan , there was n’t much evidence : no license plate , no description of the driver , only two witnesses , who said they believed the car had been a silver Volkswagen Jetta .
Advertisement
The next morning , the case was assigned to Det. Michael Kaden .
A 13 - year veteran of hit - and - run investigations , Kaden read the crime scene report and knew he was in for a long day .
He drove to the scene and spent the morning looking for more witnesses or security cameras that might have captured the incident .
He drove back to LAPD ’s Central station to make copies of an “ Information Wanted ” flier , then returned to the crosswalk and spent much of what remained of the day handing the fliers to passersby .
A news release elicited no interest from newspapers or television stations .
Kaden would give no interviews that day or any other until contacted by The Times .
Deputy police chiefs and City Council members would host no big press conferences .
The public would not hear Nicolas ’ girlfriend , Joaquina Ramos , talk about how he used to slip her children $ 20 bills wrapped in napkins to pay for groceries or how people who knew him called him Tito .
They would not see the hurt on the face of Ramos ’ daughter , who considered Nicolas , a legal U.S. resident , her father .
“ I want justice , ” Ramos said in an interview with The Times , the same wish that Bachan ’s mother had expressed .
Nearly four weeks passed before the City Council approved a $ 50,000 reward without any fanfare .
The reward remains in limbo , awaiting the signature of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
Advertisement
“ This is basically a worst - case scenario , ” Kaden said in an interview .
“ I do n’t even know if I am looking for a man or a woman . ”
Kaden considered knocking on doors of the auto body shops that line Mission Road in East L.A. to see if anyone had worked on a silver Jetta .
Then he decided it would be a waste of time , since no witness could describe what damage , if any , the car sustained .
“ I could go and ask to look at their records of all the Jettas that came in with broken windshields , but they ’ll look at me and say , ‘ What records ? ’ ” Kaden said .
The detective searched a state database for silver Jettas built between 2000 and 2008 that had been cited for traffic violations in recent years .
Information on more than 200 cars came back .
He winnowed the list to cars registered in Los Angeles and found himself staring at the addresses of 84 Angelenos .
Kaden thought he had caught a break when he plotted the addresses on a map and saw that two of the Jettas were registered to people living close to where Nicolas had been run down .
Neither lead panned out , however .
Advertisement
And so Kaden did the only thing left to do :
He went looking for the remaining Jettas on the list , hoping he might find the one that had killed Nicolas .
Two detectives helped him for a day .
Other than that , Kaden was on his own and still had to deal with the rest of his workload , including preparing evidence for several upcoming criminal trials .
“ I ’ve at least touched this case every day , ” he said .
“ I wish I could say it ’s the only thing on my plate right now , but it ’s not . ”
Kaden began one morning of searching at an impressive Spanish - style home near Griffith Park .
A silver Jetta sat parked outside .
Kaden circled to the front of the car and inspected the edges of the windshield for glue that could indicate it had recently been installed .
Finding nothing , he stepped back to snap some photos with a Polaroid camera .
After leaving a brief note and his calling card at the front door , he opened a large binder with Nicolas ’ name and “ Unsolved ” on the spine and crossed the car off the list .
Advertisement
The day would take him to several apartment complexes in Thai town and Koreatown , and to an artist colony at a converted brewery in East L.A .
He found several Jettas , but none could be connected to Nicolas ’ death .
Still , he fastidiously took notes and photos of each car and calmly explained himself to the confused owners before moving on .
Twice , after spotting silver Jettas on the side of the road , he pulled quick U - turns to check them out .
“ You gotta think you might get lucky , otherwise you would n’t do this job , ” he said .
“ You ’d be frustrated beyond frustration .
I try not to focus on the bleakness of it all .
“ Is it fair ? ” he asked , reflecting on the difference between Nicolas ’ case and Bachan’s .
“ I ca n’t look at fair .
Any time you have a high - profile person involved in a crime or a high - profile situation , you are always going to receive more attention .
Is that right ?
Is that wrong ?
I do n’t know . ”
Three weeks after Nicolas was killed , Kaden departed for a long - planned vacation with his family .
When he returns , he plans to continue making his way down the list of Jettas .
Advertisement
“ I could theoretically never be done with this , but it ’s an unfortunate part of this job that you have a lot of unsolved cases .
At some point , I ’ll have to move on to the next one , because there will be another one . ”

REWARD : $ 50,000 approved by Los Angeles City Council , nearly a month after the accident .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has yet to sign off on it .
POLICE RESOURCES : The LAPD Central Bureau Traffic Division assigned one detective ; two other detectives assisted him for one day .
STATUS : The case remains unsolved , 36 days later .
On a former soybean field in the rolling hills of northern Kansas , a few miles outside Lawrence , David and Susan Millstein ’s contribution to environmental sustainability curves and bends around the Kansas landscape like an undulating gray ribbon .
It ’s an earthship .
To be more precise , it ’s a variation on the theme of this green building technology , which incorporates into its design thermal walls built of used automobile tires filled with earth from the site and passive solar heating .
Ten years ’ worth of lovingly collected recycled building materials are incorporated into the modified earthship ’s construction .
Its windows are framed with cypress rescued from a mushroom barn ; recycled flooring from a University of Kansas handball court covers the dining / activity room floor .
The living room floor is fashioned of planks from old tobacco sheds in Louisiana , and the marble floor in the home ’s entry hall comes from a hospital in Kansas City .
The opening portholes that add a touch of whimsy to the second story are Navy surplus .
All the interior walls get their color from tinted plaster , not paint .
Safe and sound
The house , which covers 2,700 square feet — 3,000 square feet with the sunroom — is light and airy yet massive and secure at the same time .
The first floor contains the living room , greenhouse , bedrooms for three children who are now grown ( although daughter Casey , age nineteen , still lives at home while attending University of Kansas ) , and the dining activity room — which the Millsteins call “ The Egg ” because of its shape .
The second floor contains the master suite and reading nook .
And besides fulfilling the Millsteins ’ desire to tread lightly on the earth , it ’s exactly what they were looking for to insulate themselves from the endless Kansas prairie winds .
“ We wanted this house to be passive solar and to use recycled materials , but we also wanted to let the wind play with this house rather than fight it , ” explains David , who has a background in building restoration .
According to Susan , the house has achieved their objectives and more .
“ There ’s wonderful lighting that accompanies passive solar heating , ” she says .
“ I love the light , and I wanted to use all these wonderful materials David had accumulated over the years . ”
The house has cut their energy bills drastically .
David says they spend about half what they paid for propane at the family ’s former residence , a Victorian farmhouse .
It ’s also wired to accept direct current ( DC ) if the Millsteins ever go completely off the energy grid .
“ Being off the grid would be perfection , but the payback is so extended we thought conservation would be more pragmatic , ” David says .
Definitely not square
Inspiration for the Millsteins ’ modified earthship came in the early 1990s .
They had already done what they could with their traditional , turn - of - the - century farmhouse in terms of environmental retrofitting .
“ We added a greenhouse and some solar collectors , but the house was pretty inefficient , ” David explains .
About that time they read about a free - form home made from lightweight Ferro cement , which is used more often in boat building than in home building .
“ That piqued my curiosity , ” David says , because Ferro accommodates curves more readily than conventional , reinforced concrete .
“ My favorite architecture is definitely not square . ”
Soon after , a friend showed them an article describing actor and environmentalist Dennis Weaver ’s so - called “ tire house ” earthship in Ridgway , Colorado .
From those two sources came David ’s idea to combine the technologies and create his family ’s personal Kansas - style earthship .
“ The vision sort of evolved , ” he admits .
“ I doodled around with a number of ridiculous designs , but things started coming together when we saw the free - form Ferro cement house . ”
As with all things creative , there were hurdles to jump , so the Millsteins decided to begin their construction with an outbuilding .
“ We learned a lot through that process , ” David says .
Specifically , they discovered that traditional earthship construction would n’t work in Kansas .
True earthship tire - wall technology , developed in Taos , New Mexico , depends on dry soil and climate to work best .
In eastern Kansas , where it rains about thirty - five inches a year , modifications to conventional tire - wall construction techniques had to be made .
Instead of berming the tire wall , it was built as a freestanding wall , making moisture - proofing easier .
Construction techniques were also changed .
“ By the time we were working on the upper layers of the wall , it was like standing on Jell - O , ” David says .
“ We were always having problems keeping things plumb . ”
The solution was to chink the tire layers with concrete at the end of each day so that when work on the tire wall began the following day , it was rigid enough to stand on .
The tires on the upper level of the wall were pounded on the ground , set in place , then keyed into position with some finish tamping .
The Millsteins also found they could n’t include the graywater systems often incorporated into classic earthship designs ( see “ Anatomy of an Earthship , ” page 56 ) because of county building codes .
By the time the outbuilding was complete , the Millsteins had a pretty good idea of what they could and could n’t do to replicate an earthship design in Kansas .
They also managed to get county code inspectors to believe in the project .
“ For about the first eight months , they were skeptical , ” David says .
“ They wanted some engineering done to satisfy their curiosity . ”
The couple asked John Easley , professor emeritus in engineering at the University of Kansas , to prove the home ’s structural integrity .
“ By the time the process was two - thirds through , the county inspector had developed some faith , ” he continues .
“ Then he got on board and was really enthusiastic . ”
Tires and cement

The main house took about two years to build — most of the tire - pounding labor coming from David , friend Chris Robinson , and members of their son Josh ’s high school cross-country running team .
Its design incorporates only one freestanding tire wall , on the north side , which is n’t susceptible to the Kansas moisture .
The wall contains 586 tires , while the outbuilding contains another 614 tires for a total of 1,200 .
Each was hand picked and cost nothing , if you do n’t add in the cost of the labor to find them and fill each with 350 pounds of Kansas clay .
“ We had a route from Lawrence to Ottawa to Topeka to Kansas City .
We sorted through piles of tires , ” David recalls .
The endeavor may sound daunting , but the tire wall is crucial to the interior temperature of an earthship house .
“ The wall acts as a temperature - moderating influence , ” David says .
“ The rooms that have the highest ratio of tire - wall area to room area are the easiest to heat and cool . ”
The rest of the house was built using stick construction and Ferro cement .
The Ferro cement allows for the home ’s graceful curves and also made it possible to build a waterproof roof without having to use the water - repelling membrane typically required to keep water from leaking into a relatively flat - roofed structure .
In winter , however , the roof has a minor drawback .
Ferro cement is semi-permeable , which means while water wo n’t pass through it , vapors do .
“ In continuous below freezing weather — which we do n’t get much of — vapor freezes on the underside of the Ferro , and we get a little condensation , which watermarks the ceiling in the high areas where the vapors collect , ” he says .
If he were to do it over again , David would put vents in the roof ’s highest sections to allow vapors to move more freely .
Susan adds that because sound resonates so well off the plaster walls , she might have opted for some softer surfaces .
When it was completed in 1995 , the Millsteins ’ earthship cost between $ 60 and $ 65 per square foot .
That ’s about half of what traditional home construction cost at the time .
But , David is quick to note , “ that ’s not including my labor . ”
All in all , however , the Millsteins declare their modified earthship a resounding success .
“ I feel good about the house .
It ’s holding up great , ” David says .
“ It provides us with a really nice environment . ”
Ninety children known to Ontario's child welfare system died in 2007 , according to the latest report from the chief coroner 's office – a number the province 's new child advocate says is shocking and should trouble us all .
Equally disturbing , says Irwin Elman in his first annual report to the Legislature today , is the government 's refusal to share detailed information on these deaths with his office .
" These are obviously very critical documents for the understanding of the events leading to the death of the child or youth , and entirely necessary for the work of the Advocacy Office , " Elman writes in the report entitled 90 Deaths : Ninety Voices Silenced .
" The matter of access to information is one that we will pursue vigorously . "
In an interview , Elman , who has worked with youth in the care of children 's aid societies in Toronto for more than 20 years , said he had " no idea " so many of these vulnerable children , who were either open cases of the CAS or had died within a year of their files being closed , could perish in a single year in Ontario .
Nor did he know that the number of children who have died has been constant since the late 1990s when the Coroner 's office began tracking their deaths .
When he asked medical officers of health and colleagues in child welfare , they , too , were surprised by the number and urged him to speak out , Elman said .
It is why the deaths are highlighted on the cover of his 25 - page report , he said , with the face of a child whose mouth is covered by a red banner reading " 90 deaths , ninety voices silenced . "
Elman notes the deaths represent less than a quarter of all children who died in the province in 2007 and are a fraction of the 26,260 open cases of children 's aid societies .
But the number of deaths is " too high by any standard . "
" These are children that we , as a province , have determined are in some peril and should be receiving the best of what we , as their parents , have to offer , " he said .
" So how could 90 of them die ?
I want all of us to be thinking about that . "
Gaining more access to information about children and youth involved in the child welfare and youth criminal justice systems , and broadening his office 's legal right to the coroner 's files on deaths are key goals this year , he said .
" We need ( this information ) to help resolve issues that youth have contacted us about , to know how to respond to incidents involving children and youth in care and to investigate any deaths among our charges , " his report says .
The 90 deaths in 2007 are recorded as part of the chief coroner 's annual Pediatric Death Review Committee report released last June .
They include children and youths in foster care , whose families had open files with a children 's aid society or had died within a year of their files being closed .
Most of the deaths were preventable , the committee concluded .
Sixteen were accidental ; nine were listed as suicides ; four were homicides ; eight died from natural causes and could probably not have been prevented ; 22 were considered undetermined , which means there was no evidence for any specific classification or they fit within more than one classification ; 17 are yet to be assigned a classification ; and 14 were not considered appropriate by the Coroner for investigation because their deaths were expected due to fragile health .
Of the 76 classified deaths , 34 were babies younger than one year old and 24 were youths between the ages of 12 and 18 .
The report provides broad geographical information about where in the province the children died , but there is no information about ethnicity , family income and community resources , or if the child was in foster care or living with parents .
( In an interview , a spokesperson for the coroner 's office said 14 of the classified deaths in 2007 were children in foster care . )
Prevention strategies suggested in the coroner 's report include safer sleeping arrangements for babies ; co-ordinated mental health services for youth ; better supervision ; educating caregivers early in a baby 's life to be more mindful ; and paying more attention to children 's medical needs .
Elman says his office must focus on the deaths and strive to understand the circumstances – broad and specific – to ensure the children are safe and thriving .
" I would like to honour the kids who died by looking at their journeys and using them to help the living in as broad a sense as we can , " he said .
In his report , Elman says his office will request legal standing at all inquests into deaths of children in the system and will conduct an independent review of jury recommendations dating back 10 years to determine trends and gaps .

The office receives about 3,000 phone calls for help each year from among more than 20,000 children and youth in contact with Children 's Aid .
Those in foster care are there because of parental neglect or abuse and many feel their lives are spinning out of control , the report says .
Worse , many say the stigma of being connected to the system is overwhelming .
Elman wants his office to do more to reach out and give these children a voice and a role in improving their lives .
And he hopes to form regional youth reference groups so their concerns can be heard .
The report includes a section and letter addressed directly to children and youth in care , advising them of their rights and urging them to phone the office – collect if they can't access the 1-800 - 263-2841 number – if they need help .
" Children and youth like you have overcome tremendous barriers in the past to become loving parents , lawyers , professors , plumbers , artists , activists – you name it , " Elman writes .
" We are here to help you with the hard work and courage needed for you to take the risks to overcome barriers you face , " he adds .
" I intend to lead an office ... that demonstrates each day our belief in you . "
The office will work to implement Jordan 's Principle – named for a First Nations child in Manitoba – which aims to ensure conflicts over which level of government has financial responsibility to help a status Indian or Inuit child are settled after the service is provided .
For Northern Ontario , where only one advocate fields calls from 15 child welfare agencies , the report said the office will appoint a special director or deputy provincial advocate to consult with the community on how best to proceed .
New measures , which likely wo n't take effect until later in the year , would need additional funding , the report says .
The child advocate 's annual budget when the office existed as part of the provincial ministry of children and youth services was $ 1.8 million .
But it will top $ 3.9 million in this , its first year as an independent office .
Still , the report notes that with a staff of just 21 , including 13 advocates , Ontario has the smallest per capita staff and budget of any provincial children and youth advocate 's office and may need more resources in the future to fulfill its mandate .

For Mr. Gurstelle , this column was as rousing as Henry V’s speech at Agincourt .
He is also an admirer of Hunter S. Thompson , who in “ Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ” introduced the term “ edge- work ” into the lingo .
( “ It was dangerous lunacy , ” Mr. Thompson wrote about one of his enterprises , “ but it was also the kind of thing a real connoisseur of edge - work could make an argument for . ” )
Image William Gurstelle Credit ... Matt Blum
Mr. Gurstelle warns against incorporating Thompson ’s hallmarks  “ shotguns , LSD and anarchy ”  into your lifestyle .
Because you are not Hunter S. Thompson .
And because he does not want you to die stupidly and young .
Just as important , he observes , it is hard to make playing with shotguns , LSD and anarchy artful .
And for him , style , ingenuity and playfulness are everything .
In “ Absinthe & Flamethrowers , ” Mr. Gurstelle burrows into the difference between what he calls “ Big - T types ” ( genuine thrill - seekers ) and “ little - t ’s ” ( total milquetoasts ) , while suggesting that most of us dwell somewhere in the middle .
He even provides a test that indicates where , on the thrill - seeking scale , a reader stands .
He notes “ the specific brain chemicals  dopamine , monoamine oxidase and norepinephrine , among others  that underlie the personality traits of risk taking , impulsivity and self - preservation . ”
There are pages and pages of warnings in “ Absinthe & Flamethrowers . ”
Some of these are very funny .
( “ Do not eat any chemicals no matter how tasty they smell . ” )
All are serious .
Mr. Gurstelle does not want you to get hurt .
But he notes : “ Part of the appeal of living dangerously may be that there is a real possibility of death .
However , that possibility should be extremely , extremely remote . ”
Mr. Gurstelle exactingly describes how to make your own gunpowder , a substance he calls “ the most significant chemical compound mankind has ever developed . ”
It ’s the foundation for many of his book ’s activities , the same way the perfect fish stock undergirds dozens of recipes in a cookbook .
Making even small quantities of gunpowder , he adds , “ puts you in the rarefied company of such important historical figures as Joan of Arc , Roger Bacon , Mark the Greek , Lammot du Pont , Black Berthold and Leonardo da Vinci . ”
From there , he ’s on to making things like fuses , rockets and an eprouvette , or small cannon .
“ Absinthe & Flamethrowers ” is not “ The Anarchist ’s Cookbook Redux . ”
Making your own gunpowder or small - scale rocket is real work , hardly worth a terrorist ’s time .
Everyone learns in school about the five senses : vision ( sight ) , audition ( sound ) , olfaction ( smell ) , taction ( touch ) , and gustation ( taste ) .
These senses are responsible for our interaction with the external world .
Additionally , we have several senses that are responsible for our internal functioning .
One of the most important internal senses is called proprioception , or position sense .
Proprioception affects our lives every moment of every day , and allows us to accomplish complex tasks that would otherwise be impossible .
The sense is so fundamental to our functioning that we take its existence for granted .
Proprioception allows humans to control their limbs without directly looking at them .
Take , for example , the complex task of driving .
We are able to keep our eyes on the road and simultaneously adjust our arms and hands on the steering wheel , and apply the appropriate amount of pressure to the pedals to maintain speed .
Talented drivers can also change the radio station , eat small meals , reach for something in the rear seat , or any host of other tasks while maintaining eye contact with the road ahead .
If humans had to observe their limbs to successfully accomplish tasks , we would have to look down at our feet every time we wanted to change from gas to brake , or stare at our arms if we wanted to make a right turn .
The distraction would make driving nearly impossible .
Human beings do not have a single organ for proprioception .
Instead , the sense is processed by the entire nervous system as a whole .
Inside every muscle and joint lie tiny meters called muscle spindles and Golgi tendons that constantly measure the amount of tension and degree of contraction .
This information travels up a discreet highway in the spinal cord called the spinocerebellar tract , and makes its way to the cerebellum .
The cerebellum accepts information from every muscle and joint in the body , and calculates where the limbs must be in space .
The system is not perfect , but gives a rough estimate to allow for basic task completion .
We can use our vision to confirm limb position for more technically demanding tasks .
Like most physiological processes , proprioception can be improved with challenging practice , and can also be impaired by disease or disuse .
A concert pianist can play incredibly complex music with their eyes closed because they have trained the proprioceptive sense of their fingers to be precise enough for the task .
If that same concert pianist tried to play a piece they have never seen before , they would have to look at their hands to master a complicated section .
By contrast , patients who suffer from stroke often have difficulty with balance and coordination during their recovery .
Proprioception is also impaired by diseases or injuries affecting the musculoskeletal system , like an ankle sprain or diabetic neuropathy .
Patients suffering from these types of conditions are predisposed to falls and repeat injuries , which compounds problems .
For this reason , physical therapists can work with patients on proprioceptive training to help gain a stronger position sense .
Training usually consists of working on uneven or irregular surfaces , and balancing on affected joints with a blindfold to remove visual confirmation .
Although these exercises are demanding , patients can usually see functional benefits within a few weeks .
For any readers who have had previous impairments to their proprioception , comments below regarding any of these questions would be much appreciated :
How did you notice that your proprioception was impaired ?
What kinds of therapies have you tried to improve your proprioception ?
What impact has a lack of proprioception had on your daily life ?

I found myself having a small but heated debate with someone at the pub the other night .
Turned out he was a Communist ( we still have a few over here ) .
It also turned out that he saw it as his goal in life to convert me to Communism too .
Apparently , according to him , we should all be voting at the next election for a great Stalinist Utopia .
So I thought I ’d help him out .
Me : I ’ve got an idea .
Why bother going to all the trouble of electing a Communist Dictatorship when you can start creating a little Communist Utopia all of your own first thing tomorrow .
That way you can get to live in your Glorious Workers ’
Paradise without foisting it on the rest of us .
Him :
Stop taking the piss … you know it ’s people like you that keep this corrupt system robbing us of what ’s rightfully ours blah blah blah …
Me : No , no… I ’m serious … look , it ’s simple .
All you have to do is this …
And this Ladies and Gentlemen ( Ladies !?
Gentlemen !?
What a bourgeois capitalist bastard I am ) , is the suggestion I offered ( slightly edited for style and tone ) :
Me : First you ’ll need to look for a new job .
Convince someone to hire you to do a laborious industrial job on outdated machinery which results in you producing an item that is of no use or value to anybody whatsoever .
Do this for 10 hours a day , 6 days a week , and at the end of the week ask your employer to pay you in monopoly money .
Spend your ‘ weekend ’ hunting down ‘ western tourists ’ and attempt to persuade them to exchange large quantities of your monopoly money for small quantities of their Dollars or Sterling .
Fail .
By now of course , you ’ll be hungry .
Your refrigerator will be empty ( for the full - on Communist Utopia experience you should have emptied your fridge of all edible food items on the first day .
A few slices of mouldy bread , a rancid orange and a quarter pint of curdled milk are permissible ) .
Forget going to the supermarket .
There are no supermarkets in your Glorious Workers ’ Paradise .
Instead , find a poor quality Butcher ’s .
Stand outside Butcher ’s shop for 8 hours .
Go home empty - handed .
Go to a poor quality Baker ’s .
Stand outside Baker ’s shop for 8 hours .
Go home empty - handed .
Go to a poor quality Greengrocer ’s .
Stand outside Greengrocer ’s shop for 8 hours .
Go home empty - handed .
Repeat week after week after week .
Of course , in a real Communist Utopia , you ’d make your wife stand , hopelessly , outside all these shops .
But in your own personal , private Communist Utopia , you will no longer have a wife .
Eventually you may acquire enough money to indulge yourself .
Perhaps you ’d like to splash out on a new car .
( Yes , I ’m employing artistic license here , I know car dealerships wo n’t take monopoly money . )
Go down to the car dealership that sells the cheapest , dullest and most unenjoyable cars available .
When you ’ve made your ‘ choice ’ , pay the full amount upfront .
( Do n’t try to bargain , there is no bartering in your Glorious Workers ’ Paradise .
Ask for so much as a free mudflap and you ’ll be having to incarcerate yourself in a homemade gulag for the next 6 months ) .
Once you ’ve paid for your delightful automobile , tell them to have it delivered to you .
In five year ’s time .
You ’ll be really hungry by now .
So go home and scour your refrigerator for anything edible .
There will be nothing edible in there , but you ’ll look anyway .
In fact , you ’ll spend the whole evening regularly getting up from your chair to check the fridge , knowing that it ’s still going to be barren .
And you ’ll spend the whole evening being disappointed .
At this point , you ’ll do what everyone does in a Glorious Workers ’ Paradise .
You ’ll start the long and systematic destruction of your liver with the daily consumption of gallons of cheap vodka .
Voilà !
You ’ve made it .
Utopia at last .
Utopia at last .
Thank God Almighty , Utopia at last .
–
That rant made me thirsty .
So I picked up what I thought was my pint and took a healthy swig .
Him : Err… that ’s my beer !
Me : Oh , sorry … errr… hang on a second .
What happened to ‘ all property is theft ’?
Senator Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) let it rip at the Computer & Communications Industry Association 's Annual Washington Caucus on Wednesday .
" Continued growth of the ' Net right now is being hampered by the lack of clear enforceable standards on net neutrality .
I do n't think the country can afford that , " Sen .
Wyden warned a lunching band of telecom , computer , and software executives during his keynote address .
" We 've got to make sure that the ' Net is protected from the ever present impulse of companies that would like to take advantage of their position of the middleman to erect poles and barriers for their own benefits . "
But Wyden directed his ire less at the various telcos and ISPs associated with this controversy , and more at the government agency charged with resolving the issue .
" I was disappointed that the Federal Communications Commission in its recent Notice of Inquiry about the country 's broadband future did not once , not once , mention the concept of net neutrality , " he declared .
" You see the words ' universal service , ' ' open networks , ' ' competition , ' ' affordability , ' but there is kind of an elaborate dance around the central concept of net neutrality . "
The Senator was referring to the FCC 's recent call for feedback about its National Broadband Plan , which the Commission must deliver to Congress by next February .
Wyden acknowledged the significance of the agency 's Internet Policy Statement — four principles that assert the right of consumers to access the legal Internet sites and applications of their choice .
But he suggested that they have fostered " more legal wrangling than they have innovation and investment . "
And indeed , Comcast and others charge that they lack the statutory or procedural grounding to be used as enforceable rules — the cable giant is even suing the FCC over its enforcement action against the company for P2P throttling .
But when pressed by Ars for specifics on what Wyden wants the FCC to do now , the senators ' responses were vague .
Interim Chair Michael Copps , for example , has called for a fifth Internet principle , explicitly invoking a policy of nondiscrimination .
We asked if that is what Wyden wants .
" Copps has some good ideas , " the senator conceded , " but I 'm not ready to embrace that fully . "
Ok , then given concerns that the FCC needs more statutory authority for creating an enforcement mechanism , how can Congress help the agency ?
Here was Wyden 's reply :
" Well , the regulatory structure is clearly outdated .
The 1996 [ Telecommunications ]
Act is certainly behind the times .
It has n't been updated to reflect the current market .
It does n't make any sense — one Internet service provider being regulated differently from another .
I think a big part of the answer is to have a telecommunications policy that is free of discrimination that favors one technology over another .
VoIP , IPTV , everybody else ought to have the same crack at the market . "
So who is going to lay this issue to legal rest , Congress or the FCC ?
Or both ?
Wyden was long on rhetoric , short on specific fixes .
The rhetoric was good , though .
" I think it is time to step up and challenge the Federal Communications Commission to guarantee that the newest Web application that runs from a garage or dorm room has the same access to Internet users as Microsoft or Google , " he concluded .
" I think it is time to challenge the Federal Communications Commission to create black - and - white rules ensuring that Internet service providers are gateways to the whole net and not gatekeepers where they get to pick the winners and losers . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Laid off from Wall Street ?
The CIA wants you -- as long as you can pass a lie detector test and show that you are motivated by service to your country rather than your wallet .
The lobby of the CIA Headquarters Building in McLean , Virginia , August 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
The Central Intelligence Agency has been advertising for recruits and will be holding interviews on June 22 at a secret location in New York .
“ Economics , finance and business professionals , if the quest for the bottom line is just not enough for you , the Central Intelligence Agency has a mission like no other , ” one radio advertisement for the agency says .
“ Join CIA ’s directorate of intelligence and be a part of our global mission as an economic or financial analyst .
Make a difference in your career and for your nation , ” it says .
Ron Patrick , a spokesman for recruitment and retention at the CIA , told Reuters Television the agency had received several hundred resumes so far from applicants ranging from people just out of graduate school to laid - off bankers .
“ It ’s going to be a very different use of their skill set than perhaps they ’ve used on Wall Street , ” Patrick said .
Recruits will have to pass rigorous background and medical checks , as well as a polygraph , or lie - detector test .
Starting salaries range from around $ 60,000 for a new graduate to $ 100,000 for somebody with more experience , and top out at $ 160,000 .
Generous benefits are included .
Patrick said the agency would welcome worthy applicants from Wall Street , whose reputation has been tarnished by the financial crisis and revelations of lavish lifestyles and multi-million dollar bonuses at banks blamed for the meltdown .
“ Typically the people that come to the CIA want to serve the government , they want to serve their countries .
It ’s a different mindset perhaps than serving a company or serving profit as a bottom line , ” he said .
“ As long as they can make that attitude switch from profit being the motivator to serving their country , I think they ’ll fit in very well with us . ”
However , in May 2004 , for example , he submitted £ 238.30 of Tesco receipts but claimed £ 332.48 for food on his expenses .
In August that year , he submitted £ 210.31 in supermarket receipts , including the women 's shoes and bibs , and put in a food claim for exactly the same amount , which was reimbursed in full .

Anatomy of a Myth
Here 's a classic example of an inaccurate story instantly gaining mythological status .
As Mark Silva blogs for Tribune , Washington yesterday was " abuzz with word that Vice President Joe Biden reportedly had disclosed the location of the undisclosed location that his predecessor , Dick Cheney , made mysteriously famous . "
Consider the Fox News headline : Biden Reveals Location of Secret VP Bunker .
What set it all off was a blog post by Newsweek 's Eleanor Clift : " Ever wonder about that secure , undisclosed location where Dick Cheney secreted himself after the 9/11 attacks ?
Joe Biden reveals the bunker - like room is at the Naval Observatory in Washington , where Cheney lived for eight years and which is now home to Biden .
The veep related the story to his head - table dinner mates when he filled in for President Obama at the Gridiron Club earlier this year .
He said the young naval officer giving him a tour of the residence showed him the hideaway , which is behind a massive steel door secured by an elaborate lock with a narrow connecting hallway lined with shelves filled with communications equipment .
The officer explained that when Cheney was in lock down , this was where his most trusted aides were stationed , an image that Biden conveyed in a way that suggested we should n’t be surprised that the policies that emerged were off the wall . "
Roxanne Roberts and Amy Argetsinger write in The Washington Post that Clift 's " source " was the club 's newsletter , in which club President Dick Cooper of the Tribune Co. recounted what Biden had said to him at the dinner -- fully two months ago .
But Clift apparently put two and two together and got five .
The room in question was not Cheney 's secret bunker .
As Silva writes : " Elizabeth Alexander , Biden 's spokeswoman , offered this explanation this afternoon : ' What the vice president described in his comments was not - as some press reports have suggested - an underground facility , but rather , an upstairs workspace in the residence , which he understood was frequently used by Vice President Cheney and his aides .
" ' That workspace was converted into an upstairs guestroom when the Bidens moved into the residence , ' Alexander said .
' There was no disclosure of classified information . ' "
But too late -- Biden 's latest " gaffe " has now entered the pop-culture bloodstream .
Via U.S. News , here was Jay Leno last night : " Well , another gaffe by Vice President Joe Biden .
God bless Joe Biden ....
He 's been our savior here .
' Newsweek ' is reporting that at the Gridiron Dinner , Joe Biden started talking and accidentally revealed Dick Cheney 's secret hiding place .
See , there 's more proof you do n't need waterboarding to get secret information .
Just give Joe Biden a couple of drinks . "
And David Letterman : " Here 's something that I am very excited about .
Joe Biden , the current vice president , was yakking away over the weekend .
And he -- remember when Dick Cheney ... was in an undisclosed location and everybody thought where ?... So supposedly top secret information , classified information .
And Joe Biden just says , ' No , I know where he was .
He was hiding under his house .'...
Joe Biden is living proof that people can give up sensitive information without being tortured . "
How does a lobby group manufacture consensus ?
As University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist points out , it does so very , very carefully .
Geist has unraveled a tangled skein of reports , polls , and lobbying on copyright issues in Canada , tracing a wide variety of this material back to two primary sources : the music and movie businesses .
Pay enough groups to produce similar conclusions and — presto ! — a " consensus forms " as later papers quote earlier papers , even though everything is funded from the same sources and often uses the same data .
As Geist puts it , " the net effect [ of paying for multiple reports from multiple groups ] has been a steady stream of reports that all say basically the same thing , cite the same sources , make the same recommendations , and often rely on each other to substantiate the manufactured consensus on copyright reform . "
It goes almost without saying that such consensus is then helpfully provided by lobbyists to lawmakers .
Funding research
In his examples , Geist considers four major reports on Canadian copyright from the last couple of years .
All four separately recommended the creation of an " IP council . "
What did they suggest calling this council ?
An " Intellectual Property Coordination Council , " and " IP Ministerial Coordination Council , " an " Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Council , " and an " IP Inter - ministerial Coordination Council . "
All four reports suggested the creation of an IP " task force , " too , with nearly identical names and descriptions .
And the list goes on .
But the multiplicity of reports does n't necessarily indicate a real multiplicity of research and viewpoints .
As Geist points out , the Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA ) and the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association ( CMPDA ) directly paid for three of these reports , while the fourth was paid for by two of the groups CRIA and CMPDA had already funded .

It 's a little hard to believe that research groups would sell themselves out to funders in any sort of overt way , so who knows how or if influence was applied in each case ?
But we do know that it happened in at least one case , when The Conference Board of Canada ( ironically ) plagiarized parts of its own IP report .
The Conference Board finally ' fessed up after Geist unmasked the problems .
" The Conference Board of Canada regrets the fact that this project ( specifically , three intellectual property rights research reports ) has suffered lapses of process and judgment , " said the group .
" Plagiarism did occur , and it was n’t detected due to insufficient oversight of this project . "
The problems went deeper than plagiarism , though .
" The evidence indicates there was undue reliance on feedback from a funder who was deemed to have important technical expertise , " said the Board .
" We failed to seek similar feedback from a broad range of stakeholders .
The report relied heavily on too few sources and lacked sufficient balance . "
Taken together , the various reports were used , in Geist 's words , to " advance the same goals , claims , arguments , and recommendations , " but to do so in a way that made it appear many groups had come to exactly the same conclusions .
Such conclusions are then fed to legislators as evidence that they must act , and always in one direction : more copyright protections and stricter penalties .
Such strategies , of course , are n't limited to Canada , nor to particular industries , but Canadian rightsholders seem particularly good at deploying them .
And Michael Geist seems pretty good at exposing them .
The beginning of tradition of social sciences has been major developments of the 19
century .
Social sciences such as economics , political science , and history though have a long story of their own , could get the recognition as " social sciences " only in the 19
century .
and writers such as
Herodotus
[ known as the " Father of History " ] ;
Aristotle
[ often known as the " Father of Political Science " ] ;
Manu
, the great law giver ;
Kautilya
, an authority on "
" , and many others had written good treatises on
areas of social sciences more than 2000 years ago .
The political and social atmosphere of
Greece , Rome and India also favoured this kind of intellectual exercises .
Due to historical reasons these countries could not maintain the same tempo during the middle age .
[ 500 A.D. to 1550 A.D. ]
But during 17
and 18
centuries the processes of Renaissance , and Enlightenment gave a big impetus to the continuation of the
reasoning .
This change in the intellectual atmosphere favoured the development of sciences which came to be called " social sciences " .

The US Navy just totally pwned Ricky and his crew holding that ship captain !
Damn it .
You know , look .
We know what we signed up for , but WTF ?
They totally shot Ricky , Jim and Harvey .
And captured Paulie .
I mean , really ?
Why leave Paulie alive ?
This was his first mission and he was n't even good at it .
At least he does n't know a lot of secrets .
Frankly , I hope the US tortures him .
Maybe he 'll tell them about his thing for the Jonas Brothers .
Jim was a class act man .
Well , for a ruthless pirate .
Last week he let me skip pirate practice so I could catch up with " For The Love of Ray J " on VH1 .
Damn , that one girl with the tattoos on her face is hot stuff .
Maybe if she gets kicked off the show we can fly her out here and she can be , like , a girl pirate .
Anyway , back to Jim .
I think my favorite memory of Jim was from our first pirate mission .
We were lying in wait , out on the sea , in a shitty little boat that did n't even have any porn in it .
So we 're sitting there , cleaning the machine gun and checking the GPS , and we get to talking about the movie Mulholland Drive .
You know that part about 2/3 of the way through with the cube , after which the whole movie changes ?
What was up with that ?
Jim explained that the whole first part of the movie , starting with the limo and including all the memory loss stuff was a dream !
Bummed me out because I was hoping the lesbian scene was real .
Anyway he explained that being a Somali pirate was alot like living a new David Lynch movie every day .
Each day brings new weird experiences that are difficult to explain .
The other pirate in the boat with us agreed , and so did the schizophrenic Peruvian midget with a lisp .

White Supremacist Opens Fire at Holocaust Museum , But Will it Be Labeled â€ œTerrorismâ€ ?
A White Supremacist and Holocaust denier , James W Von Brunn , opened fire at the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. this afternoon , wounding at least one person before being shot in the head .
That makes the second violent attack by right - wing extremists in about three weeks .
Meanwhile , the “ radical ” animal rights and environmental movements have not harmed a single human being in their 30 - plus years of existence .
Yet they are the FBI ’s “ number one domestic terrorism threat . ”
On top of this , the Holocaust Museum–one of D.C. ’s most popular tourist destinations –was full of school children .
And it ’s not the first time Brunn armed himself in the nation ’s capital :
In 1981 , von Brunn entered the Federal Reserve in Washington with a shotgun to make a citizens arrest , he later said , to protest about high interest rates .
He was sentenced to 11 years in jail .
Will the government and the press respond the same way they did in the murder of Dr. Tiller , and not label it “ terrorism ” ?
How do you think the government and the press will respond ?
So I finally got my Wireless Access Point ( an Apple AirPort ) authenticating off of Active Directory - integrated LDAP in Server 2008 ( which is called NPS now ) .
So now I authenticate wireless users individually , through Active Directory , rather than using a shared secret .
WPA2 Enterprise … it overfloweth with w00tn3ss .
Setup
So here are the basic steps , and I can provide more detail if you have questions in the comments .
1. Install AD and Create Users
First install Active Directory .
Easy stuff .
Next , since the whole point of this is to have unique user authentication , you need to have …users .
So create them as usual but be sure to add them to a new group like “ RADIUS ” or something , and ensure that they have dial - in access within their user account .
I used “ RADIUS Users ” because I ’m creative and eccentric .
2. Enable Network Policy and Access Services in Server 2008
This is what replaces IAS in Server 2008 .
The install is pretty straight forward ; it ’s the policy that ’s the trick .
I ’m using PEAP right now , although I have n’t yet researched the ideal setup .
Soon , though , and if you have any input ( or good reading ) on this let me know .
You also want to set the authentication rule to Windows Authentication within the policy , and then select your group out of Active Directory that you placed your users in .
Be sure to setup a RADIUS client within the NPS configuration , and enter the info for your access point rather than for your individual clients .
3. Configure Your Wireless Access Point
Tell your wireless access point to use WPA2 Enterprise , and configure the RADIUS info to point to your domain controller that you just set up NPS on .
Enter the shared secret you configured during the NPS piece .
4. Configure Your Clients
Connect to your AP as you normally would , and when prompted you will enter your Active Directory username and password .
I ’ve chosen PEAP as my authentication protocol pending more research on which is ideal :
Fin
And that ’s about it .
Connect to your AP and enter your credentials .
Now when your friends come over you simply make them an account in Active Directory and they have wireless access using their own username and password .
And when they leave you disable their account until next time .
This way you get all the added benefits of password expiration and stuff like that .
Oh , and if any part of this fails , check the NPS logs on your DC .
Logs are much improved in 2008 vs. previous versions of Windows , and it ’s pretty easy to troubleshoot .
I saw a lot of errors with authentication types not being supported before I figured out which to use .
Bonus :
If you ’re one of the cool kids you ’ll have your AD and AP logs going into Splunk so you can see ( and alert on ) attempts to access your wireless network from accounts and MAC addresses you do n’t recognize .
More on that later .
Anyway , enjoy , and hit me up with any questions . ::
" I think you 're always reading and evaluating defenseman and obviously Jay 's a pretty highly rated guy in the League .
We would n't have tried to go after him if we did n't think he could play a lot of minutes . "
-- Darryl Sutter
- The Jay Bouwmeester trade rumors can finally be put to rest .
The Florida Panthers traded their All - Star defenseman 's negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames on Saturday for unrestricted free agent defenseman Jordan Leopold and a 2009 third - round draft pick .
Florida used the pick to take right wing Josh Birkholz ) .
Flames General Manager Darryl Sutter told NHL.com that he will contact Bouwmeester 's agent , Byron Baltimore , to begin talks upon his return to Calgary .
" I'm as confident ( in getting him signed ) as any other time I go into any other negotiation , " Sutter said .
" He 's 26 years old , so I feel his best years are in front of him .
But until we talk to him , I really could n't tell you anything else .
" I have n't spoken to Jay or his agent , " Sutter continued .
" We just got the right to talk with him a short time ago , so once the draft is over , we 'll go back to Calgary and try to take that next step .
" Bouwmeester , an Edmonton native , had said he wanted to go to a place where hockey was king .
Calgary fits that bill .
" About 18 months ago , ( Bouwmeester 's agent ) gave us a list of teams they were interested in and Calgary was right at the top ; he 's an Alberta boy and Darryl Sutter is aggressive and creative .
I think he 'll find a way to get a deal done , " Panthers interim GM Randy Sexton said .
Leopold , who was traded to Calgary by the Colorado Avalanche at the March 4 trade deadline , had 7 goals and 24 points in 83 games this past season .
If the Panthers sign Leopold , they 'll be getting a puck - moving defenseman capable of starting the transition in Bouwmeester - like style .
In addition , Leopold , like Bouwmeester , can log big minutes as evidenced -- he averaged 23:09 of ice time in 2008 - 09 .
The biggest difference between the two is the physical element -- Bouwmeester is a much more physical player .
" We had every intention of trying to sign Leo and we were n't able to do that , so we felt that we'd give him the opportunity to go somewhere else and try and sign -- and obviously we 've had interest in Bouwmeester for a long time , " Sutter said .
The Panthers are interested in signing Leopold .
" I 've already received a couple of text messages from ( Leopold 's agent ) Ben Hankinson and I know him well , so we 'll sit down and talk things through , " Sexton said .
" We 'll have to sell ( Leopold ) on the merits of South Florida and we 're pretty confident we can do that .
But at the end of the day , it all depends on how much money he 'll need to get a deal done .
" The 6 - foot - 4 Bouwmeester , who figures to be the most sought - after player if he reaches free agency on July 1 , was rumored to be on the block for months leading up to the March 4 trade deadline .
Then - Florida GM Jacques Martin never pulled the trigger on a trade , opting to keep his best defenseman as part of a playoff push -- one that came up short .
The Panthers had 18 regular - season games remaining at the time of the trade deadline and stood in sixth place in the Eastern Conference with 33 wins and 74 points .
It was thought the decision to keep Bouwmeester , the NHL 's reigning iron man having played in 342 consecutive games , was proof the organization was committed to qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in eight seasons .
The playoffs never happened , however , as the Panthers got just 19 points in their final 18 games to finish ninth in the East .
Bouwmeester had 2 goals and 8 points with a minus - 6 rating over that span .
Bouwmeester has appeared in just one playoff series in the past 12 seasons -- in 2005 with the American Hockey League 's Chicago Wolves .
Still , he did lead the League in average ice time ( 26:59 ) while playing all 82 games for the fourth straight season .
Bouwmeester , 25 , also equaled a career high with 15 goals .
" I think you 're always reading and evaluating defenseman , and obviously Jay 's a pretty highly rated guy in the League , " Sutter said .
" We would n't have tried to go after him if we did n't think he could play a lot of minutes .
" Bill Torrey , the Panthers ' first team president and alternate governor , and Sexton were determined to come away with something for Bouwmeester , their first - round draft pick ( No. 3 ) in 2002 .
" We felt all along that there were not going to be any free looks , " Sexton said .
" We wanted to have something of value because of the quality of player he is and we tried really hard to get a second round pick for him , but no one was willing to pony up .
We settled on a third - round pick and had a deal with several teams on the third .
What varied was the different amount of compensation to be signed .
But we like Leopold and we 'll try and sign him ; we do n't know if we will or not , but he 's a mobile puck - moving guy who 'll be a really fine replacement for Jay .
" With Bouwmeester 's situation now resolved , next on Torrey 's to - do list is finding a replacement for Martin , who resigned on June 1 to become the coach of the Montreal Canadiens .
Torrey is in the process of interviewing the more than 60 applicants that applied for the position .
Martin had been the club 's general manager the past three seasons .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The Justice Department has begun an investigation into whether the recruiting practices of some of the largest technology companies violated antitrust laws , according to several people with knowledge of the investigation .
Companies including Google , Yahoo , Apple and Genentech have received formal requests for documents and information related to the inquiry , these people said .
Antitrust lawyers said companies that receive such requests are not necessarily targets of an investigation .
The exact focus of the inquiry is unclear , but the people familiar with it said Justice Department lawyers appeared to be looking into whether the companies involved agreed to not actively recruit employees from each other .
Other companies that have received requests for information include Microsoft and Intel , according to these people , who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential .
A federal thrift regulator bungled its oversight of Downey Savings & Loan , allowing the Newport Beach thrift to pile on billions of dollars in high - risk mortgages and eventually collapse , according to a government report .
The regulators from the beleaguered Office of Thrift Supervision also botched their oversight of Pomona - based PFF Bank & Trust , which collapsed along with Downey last fall , according to reports issued this week by the U.S. Treasury Department ’s inspector general .
The Obama administration proposed Wednesday that the OTS , which has long been criticized as weak and ineffectual , be abolished .
As part of his overhaul of financial regulation , Obama recommended that savings and loans , which have been principally mortgage lenders , answer to the same regulators as full - service commercial banks that specialize in a range of loans to businesses as well as consumers .
“ We ’ve seen that structural deficiencies allow some companies to shop for the regulator of their choice , ” Obama said .
“ And that ’s why , as part of these reforms , we will dismantle the Office of Thrift Supervision and close loopholes that have allowed important institutions to cherry - pick among banking rules . ”

This week ’s reports are only the latest critical looks at failed thrifts supervised by the OTS .
After the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. spent $ 10.7 billion to back deposits at Pasadena ’s failed IndyMac Bank , the inspector general said in February that OTS examiners ignored repeated warning signs of trouble with exotic mortgages and allowed the thrift to backdate a cash infusion to make it seem stronger .
The Downey failure attracted special attention because it was a major purveyor of one of the riskiest types of home loans : the pay - option adjustable - rate mortgage , which allowed borrowers to pay so little that their loan balances went up instead of down .
These option ARMs , often written without checking borrowers ’ earnings or assets , emerged as a major contributor to the nation ’s foreclosure crisis .
The inspector general said Downey ’s problems stemmed not only from issuing option ARM loans and subprime mortgages to people with bad credit but also from having inadequate systems to monitor risk and a high turnover among managers .
Downey ’s executives frequently failed to respond to recommendations from the OTS , the report said .
The final straw was the bursting of California ’s housing bubble .
Downey had counted on borrowers ’ being able to refinance adjustable - rate loans before the payments shot higher .
But as borrowers ’ home values sank far below the amount of their mortgages , they were unable to do so and defaulted in higher numbers .
Advertisement
So many of the loans went sour that by November 2008 , when Downey was taken over by regulators , the bank had lost $ 548 million in just nine months .
OTS officials closed PFF the same day .
It was clear by 2002 that Downey was heavily involved in high - risk loans , according to the Treasury report , and examiners began warning Downey ’s management that year of potential problems .
Yet despite the warnings , “ OTS examiners did not require Downey to limit concentrations in higher - risk loan products , ” the report said .
“ We believe that in light of the OTS ’s repeated expressions of concern and management ’s unresponsiveness to those concerns , OTS should have been more forceful , at least by 2005 , to limit such concentrations , ” the report said .
Advertisement
Even after Downey , operated by parent Downey Financial Corp. , was downgraded in the confidential regulatory ratings from a strong institution to an average one in 2006 , the OTS took only an informal enforcement action against the thrift .
The agency ’s guidelines required a formal enforcement action , the report said .
OTS spokesman William Ruberry said Wednesday that the agency , after conducting its own internal review , agreed with the inspector general ’s report on Downey .
The report found that the OTS ’ enforcement was strong in some respects and that the agency “ appropriately used its authority to address Downey ’s capital levels , ” Ruberry said in an e-mailed statement .
U.S. Bancorp acquired Downey and PFF in November in a deal brokered by the FDIC , which said Downey ’s collapse would cost the deposit insurance fund about $ 1.4 billion and PFF ’s failure an additional $ 729 million .
Several large OTS - supervised thrifts , including Washington Mutual Inc. , IndyMac and Downey , failed after suffering large losses on option ARMs and other risky loans .
Advertisement
The portfolios of two other major option ARM lenders overseen by OTS , Golden West Financial Corp. of Oakland and Countrywide Financial Corp. of Calabasas , also have racked up huge losses .
Countrywide , which switched from a more stringent banking regulator to the OTS in 2007 by becoming a thrift , is now part of Bank of America Corp .
Golden West , parent of World Savings , was bought by Wachovia Corp. , which failed and was taken over by Wells Fargo & Co .

The team 's coach believes the players are destined for great things
By Prachi Pinglay
BBC News , Mumbai
India 's first women 's rugby team is preparing to take part in an international tournament .
At their first press conference , the players are curious and amused with all the media attention , but also excited about leaving for Thailand .
Sangeeta
Minz smiles shyly if you ask her about how she started playing .
It 's been only a month since she played her first game and she has already made it to India 's first women 's rugby team .
Sangeeta , 20 , is a kabaddi ( a South Asian team sport ) player from Bhubaneshwar , Orissa , and is thrilled about her selection to represent India at the Asian Women 's Rugby Sevens tournament to be held in Thailand on 30 and 31 May .
Rugby India , the organisation that promotes the sport in the country , recently held a national competition to find talent for the tournament .
They picked a 13 - member squad to represent India from the 16 teams that participated .
" First the Indian men 's team participated in an international competition in 1998 , " said Aga Hussain , vice - president of Rugby India .
" It is after 11 years that the first Indian women 's team is doing likewise .
It is a very important day for us . "
Excited Apart from India , 13 other teams from countries including China , Singapore , Iran , Cambodia and Malaysia will take part .
It is like wrestling while running ...
I use my strength only if someone comes in my way
Vahbiz Barucha Mr Hussain said that players had come from as far away as the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala .
He said that after this tournament , women 's rugby would start rolling and more players will participate next year .
Many of the 13 players selected - including captain Avani Sabade - are from Pune , the IT capital of Maharashtra state , where several schools encourage rugby .
" I 've been playing rugby for four , five years now , " said Avani .
" Some of my teammates have played rugby only for a few months , some have played for a few years .
We will give it our best and try to win in our pool at least . "
' Stamina ' Sangeeta and Jashobani Pradhan are the only two players not from Pune .
Sangeeta said that her family , who live far from Bhubaneshwar , are yet to see a rugby match .
The players may lack experience but have enthusiasm " I did n't even tell them exactly what rugby is , " she said .
" As a game , I feel kabaddi is more rough and violent than rugby but in rugby you have to run across the field .
You need a lot of stamina . "
Many players may not have played rugby for long but have represented their state or school in sports like boxing , wrestling and kabaddi .
They hope to draw skills from the other sports they play and apply them to rugby .
Vahbiz Barucha , who plays handball and practises wrestling , says rugby is more interesting than wrestling .
" It is like wrestling while running , " she said .
" I prefer team games to solo ones .
I was getting bored with wrestling and I have attended national camp for handball .
Rugby is good .
I use my strength only if someone comes in my way .
I do n't like to see anyone hurt .
This is better than wrestling . "
Vahbiz 's father , Boman Barucha , is not perturbed when asked if rugby is a rather unusual game for girls in India .
" I feel it is only through sports that one learns discipline and caring for others , " he said .
" She is a very hard - working and conscientious girl .
We as a family are very proud .
It is very difficult even to go on holidays as she does n't want to leave the sports ground . "
The team 's coach , Usaia Buimuiwai , is from Fiji .
He says the standard of their game will go up as they play more tournaments .
" Before long our female Team India could be winning more often than their male counterparts in cricket , " he jokes .

Scala 2.8 offers the possibility to call methods using " named arguments " , which means specifying the arguments based on the parameter names ( instead of the parameter positions ) .
Named arguments help to avoid confusing parameters of the same type and improve code readability .
def resize ( width : Int , height : Int ) = { ... } resize ( width = 120 , height = 42 )
Furthermore , Scala 2.8 allows providing default arguments on method parameters .
In current versions of Scala , default arguments have to be implemented manually using method overloading .
This causes some level of code duplication which can be avoided using default arguments .
def f ( elems : List [ Int ] , x : Int = 0 , cond : Boolean = true ) f ( List ( 1 ) ) f ( Nil , cond = false )
The example also shows how named arguments allow to selectively use defaults of a method : the second application to f uses the default for x , but not the one for cond .
Compiler - generated copy methods
One very useful application of named and default arguments are the compiler - generated " copy " methods in case classes , which allow to create modified copies of an instance using a lightweight syntax .
The copy method takes the same type and value parameters as the primary constructor of the case class , and every parameter defaults to the corresponding constructor parameter :
case class A [ T ] ( a : T , b : Int ) { // def copy [ T ' ] ( a : T' = this .a , b : Int = this .b ) : A [ T ' ] = new A [ T ' ] ( a , b ) } val a 1 : A [ Int ] = A ( 1 , 2 ) val a 2 : A [ String ] = a 1. copy ( a = " someString " )
Download a recent nightly build ( linux - mac / windows ) to try out named and default arguments yourself !
To read more about named and default arguments , have a look at the corresponding SID .
I wanted to renew my GPG key for some time and after reading the latest news , I finally have generated a new key today .

Like you , I ’ve developed a sneaking respect for all the fun and interesting tricks a person can use to distort the scientific evidence , so Dr Scott S Reuben is a double scumbag : this week , in the biggest fraud case from recent medical history , he has been caught out , rather unimaginatively , just fabricating his data .
How did he get away with it ?
Firstly , if you ’re planning a career in scientific fraud , then medicine is an excellent place to start .
Findings in complex biological systems – like “ people ” – are often contradictory and difficult to replicate , so you could easily advance your career and never get caught .
And fraud is not so unusual , depending on where you draw the line .
In 2005 the journal Nature published an anonymous survey of 3247 scientists : 0.3 % admitted they had falsified research data at some point in their careers , in acts of outright fraud ; but more interestingly , 6 % admitted failing to present data if it contradicted their previous research .
They are not alone .
Robert Millikan , to take just one example , won a Nobel prize in 1923 after demonstrating that electricity comes in discrete units ( electrons ) with his oil drop experiment .
Millikan was mid-career – the peak period for fraud – and fairly unknown .
In his famous paper from Physical Review he said : “ this is not a selected group of drops but represents all of the drops experimented on during 60 consecutive days ” .
That was untrue : in the paper there were 58 droplets , but in the notebooks there are 175 , annotated with phrases like “ publish this beautiful one ” and “ agreement poor , will not work out ” .
Chillingly , there is a continuum between this naughtiness , and lots of apparently innocent research activity : what should you do with the outliers on the graph ?
When you drop something on the floor ?
When the run on the machine was probably contaminated ?
Dr Reuben was at the other end of the scale .
He simply never conducted various clinical trials he wrote about for ten years .
In some cases he did n’t even pretend to get approval to conduct studies on patients , but just charged ahead and invented the results all the same .
The details have n’t come out yet – investigators have asked various academic journals to formally withdraw at least 21 studies – but fabrication is often easier to spot than selective editing , and some people have argued for various fraud detection tools to be used more commonly by academic journals .
The human brain is a fairly bad random number generator , for example , and simple frauds have often been uncovered by forensic statisticians looking at last digit frequency : if you ’re pencilling numbers into a column at random , you might have a bit of an unconscious preference for the number 7 .
And a more interesting version of this pattern spotting applies to the lead digits further to the left in a number , which should conform to the Benford Distribution : a mathematical formalisation of the common sense observation that 1 is more common than 9 in these positions , if you ’re measuring stuff .
Fine , you might say : I ’ll use a random number generator .
But here you run into the problem of telltale uniformity in your randomness .
Jan Hendrik
Schön co-authored roughly one paper every week in 2001 , but his results were too accurate .
Eventually someone noticed that two studies had the same amount of “ noise ” , and it turned out that many of his experimental results had been generated by computer , using the very equations they were supposed to be checking , with supposedly realistic random variation built into the model .
But for all our joy at mischief , we should remember that fraud has consequences .
Faking the coin can retard progress , and it can waste the time of big thinkers .
Arthur Smith Woodward , one of the 20th century ’s greatest paleontologists , burned valuable life at Piltdown every year until he died , trying to find more remains to match the fraudulent Piltdown Man .
And in medicine , data is n’t an arbitrary or abstract thing : Reuben ’s work examined the best way to manage pain after operations , and he provided evidence that non-opiate medications are equally effective .
Now that field is in turmoil .
And pain really matters .

Alan Shearer is to take over as Newcastle United 's manager until the end of the season in a sensational move which will see the club 's former captain , who has no coaching experience , charged with the task of avoiding relegation .
Newcastle sit third from bottom of the Premier League and have turned to their popular former striker after a desperate run of form under the caretaker manager , Chris Hughton , and amid concerns over the health of Joe Kinnear .
Kinnear was appointed as a short - term " firefighter " in September but has not worked since undergoing a triple heart bypass operation in February .
He has an appointment with a cardiologist on Monday but the club has decided in advance of that to make a managerial change .
It seems highly unlikely that Shearer 's appointment will not turn out to be a longer - term deal , although all that matters for now is ensuring the club does not drop into the Championship , which would be potentially financially calamitous .
Shearer has long been expected to take the reins at St James '
Park at some point but it is something of a surprise that he has chosen to do so amid such turbulence and uncertainty over the club 's future .
His appointment comes after the owner , Mike Ashley , had ignored a series of opportunities to hire him in the past .
After Sam Allardyce was sacked in January 2008 , Shearer made it clear that he was keen to accept the job but Ashley turned a deaf ear to his overtures and instead appointed Kevin Keegan , Newcastle 's other great icon .
Keegan 's half - hearted attempts to bring Shearer on to the coaching staff were met with a polite rebuff but given the past friction between the men that was no surprise .
When Keegan departed this season , Shearer again signalled that he was ready to take charge in the right circumstances but the team looked in a far healthier position at that point .
Newcastle have won only one of their past 12 league games , a narrow victory over the bottom club West Bromwich Albion , and Shearer 's first two matches look daunting .
He will start on Saturday at home to Chelsea and then take the team to Newcastle 's fellow strugglers Stoke City for a crucial game .
Shearer appears to be under no illusions as to the scale of the task ahead .
When asked last week about Newcastle 's situation , he said : " It will be one hell of a battle .
It will be one hell of a fight .
'' It will be tough .
We have some tough games coming up .
I do n't think anyone can safely say that we are going to be guaranteed safety . "
Although there were frenzied celebrations on Tyneside last night , in the cold light of morning fans may be divided over Shearer 's appointment .
While many will be delighted to see their former hero back , others may be concerned by his lack of managerial experience .
One individual bound to welcome the appointment is Michael Owen .
Shearer persuaded the striker to sign for Newcastle in the first place and the pair share a mutual respect .
If anyone is capable of rejuvenating Owen 's latterly flagging career it is probably Shearer .
With the team struggling to score goals , Premier League survival is likely to be dependent on Owen regaining his penalty area sharpness .
Shearer becomes the fourth person to lead the club this season , with Ashley finally deciding he could no longer allow the side to drift under Hughton while waiting for Kinnear to recover from surgery .
Shearer could bring Rob Lee , his close friend and former Newcastle team - mate , on to his coaching staff .
Rescue mission : Eight crunch games
Newcastle , third from bottom , have just eight games to climb out of the relegation places .

SAN FRANCISCO  Apple is one of the world ’s coolest companies .
But there is one cool - company trend it has rejected : chatting with the world through blogs and dropping tidbits of information about its inner workings .
Few companies , indeed , are more secretive than Apple , or as punitive to those who dare violate the company ’s rules on keeping tight control over information .
Employees have been fired for leaking news tidbits to outsiders , and the company has been known to spread disinformation about product plans to its own workers .
“ They make everyone super , super paranoid about security , ” said Mark Hamblin , who worked on the touch - screen technology for the iPhone and left Apple last year .
“ I have never seen anything else like it at another company . ”
But even by Apple ’s standards , its handling of news about the health of its chief executive and co-founder , Steven P. Jobs , who has battled pancreatic cancer and recently had a liver transplant while on a leave of absence , is unparalleled .

Pirate attacks have risen despite increased naval patrols A Somali minister has said the problem of piracy in the region is being made worse by the international community paying ransoms .
Abdul Karis Osman Issa , public works minister in semi-autonomous Puntland , said investment should be directed at beefing up mainland security .
He said the pirates are better financed and armed than the regional government .
Meanwhile , Mogadishu is reportedly calm after three days of fierce fighting which left more than 50 people dead .
See map of how piracy is affecting the region and countries around the world
The public works minister told the BBC the budget for the administration in Puntland , north - east Somalia , where most of the pirates are based , was " very , very , limited " .
He added : " If the international community helps the Puntland government , Puntland government can do a lot of things , even they can eliminate the pirates .
" But the international community , they do n't want to help the Puntland state , they want to pay ransoms .
" They are just running for ransom , you know ... and giving to these pirates and this is what made them strong .
" They are giving millions of dollars so this is the problem , created by the international community first . "
' Million dollar question ' Navies from Nato , the EU , Russia , Japan , China , India , Yemen , US , Malaysia and Singapore have been patrolling the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden to deter pirates , but the number of attacks has continued to rise .
This is the tragedy of Somalia - every group is hiding another group , which is itself hiding another group
Mohammed Ould Abdullah
UN special representative
The sea bandits have hijacked more than two dozen vessels this year .
The BBC's Peter Greste in Puntland 's commercial capital , Bosasso , says there is a consensus among diplomats and military commanders that the problem of piracy can only be solved on land , not at sea .
Our correspondent says the lucrative life of piracy often seems a dangerously attractive alternative for jobless young men in the deprived region .
Meanwhile , a tense calm prevailed in Mogadishu on Monday after what correspondents described as the fiercest fighting in years .
The fighting began on Thursday and escalated late on Saturday in a district close to the presidential palace .
Journalist Mohammed Sheikh Noor in Mogadishu told the BBC's Network Africa programme residents were fleeing with their belongings and the bodies of civilians killed in the clashes were littering the street .
The fragile interim government has been fighting radical Islamist groups like al - Shabab in long - running violence which has killed thousands of people since 2006 .
The UN 's special representative to Somalia , Mohammed Ould Abdullah , told Network Africa what the radical Islamists actually wanted was the " million dollar question " .
He said efforts to negotiate peace were complicated by the constantly shifting array of factions .
" Increasingly people are realising some of the Somalis who have brought their country to chaos and anarchy over the last 18 years are not interested in any dialogue , " he said .
" This is the tragedy of Somalia - every group is hiding another group , which is itself hiding another group . "
Somalia , a nation of about eight million people , has experienced almost constant conflict since the collapse of its central government in January 1991 .
When first loaded , the map 's focus falls on Somalia where most of the pirates are based .

Will Hutton :
You are warning that what happened to Japan could happen to the whole world .
Japan 's GDP at the end of this year will be no higher than it was in 1992 - 17 lost years .
You are saying that this is an ongoing risk , certainly for the North Atlantic economy - maybe the world economy .
Paul Krugman : Yes .
It 's not that the risk of the Japan syndrome has receded very much .
The risk of a full , all - out Great Depression - utter collapse of everything - has receded a lot in the past few months .
But this first year of crisis has been far worse than anything that happened in Japan during the last decade , so in some sense we already have much worse than anything the Japanese went through .
The risk for long stagnation is really high .
WH : So what is the heart of your pessimism ?
The bust banking system ?
A critic would say : " Hold on , Paul Krugman .
Japan is a special case .
It had an overblown export sector that had become too large for an American market it had saturated .
The yen was very , very overvalued .
And this interacted with a credit crunch and bust banking system .
Its policy response was consistently behind the curve .
That 's not the story of the United States or the United Kingdom . "
PK : The thing about Japan , as with all of these cases , is how much people claim to know what happened , without having any evidence .
What we do know is that recessions normally end everywhere because the monetary authority cuts interest rates a lot , and that gets things moving .
And what we know in Japan was that eventually they cut their interest rates to zero and that was n't enough .
And , so far , although we made the cuts faster than they did and cut them all the way to zero , it is n't enough .
We 've hit that lower bound the same as they did .
Now , everything after that is more or less speculation .
For example , were the problems with the Japanese banks the core problem ?
There are some stories about credit rationing , but they are not overwhelming .
Certainly , when we look at the Japanese recovery , there was not a great surge of business investment .
There was primarily a surge of exports .
But was fixing the banks central to export growth ?
In their case , the problems had a lot to do with demography .
That made them a natural capital exporter , from older savers , and also made it harder for them to have enough demand .
They also had one hell of a bubble in the 1980s and the wreckage left behind by that bubble - in their case a highly leveraged corporate sector - was and is a drag on the economy .
The size of the shock to our systems is going to be much bigger than what happened to Japan in the 1990s .
They never had a freefall in their economy - a period when GDP declined by 3 % , 4 % .
It is by no means clear that the underlying differences in the structure of the situation are significant .
What we do know is that the zero bound is real .
We know that there are situations in which ordinary monetary policy loses all traction .
And we know that we 're in one now .
WH : So your point is that the crisis in Japan was about excess debt , excess leverage and lack of demand - reinforced by the fallout from the asset bubble collapsing .
They did n't have credit contraction on anything like our scale , but even so , zero interest rates were just unable to turn the economy around .
PK : That 's right , that 's right .
WH : But an optimist would say that there are signs all around of the traction that you say does n't exist is working .
The stockmarkets in London and Wall Street - along with most world markets - are up a solid 20 % to 25 % .
You 've got all these improving business confidence indicators .
You 've got the first signs of the housing market bottoming in both the UK and the United States .
This is what the optimists would tell you .
PK : But all of that points to levelling off , rather than an actual recovery .
Britain 's looking the best among the major European economies because it's got a PMI [ purchasing managers ' index , a key measure of economic sentiment ] that 's just above 50 .
In other words , Britain actually may have stopped contracting - that 's the most positive thing one can say .
Who knows if the stockmarket makes sense or not ?
It was pricing in the possibility of an apocalypse a few months ago .
That possibility seems to have receded , so it makes sense for the markets to come up , but that 's not saying that the economy is going to be great .
If you do the comparison not with where they were three months ago , but where they were two years ago , then the markets still seem awfully depressed .
I hope I 'm wrong but the question you always have to ask is : where do we think that this recovery 's going to come from ?
It 's not an easy story to tell .
WH : In your lectures , you drew attention to the importance of stressed balance sheets holding back consumers and business alike in their likely spending ambitions - and thus dragging back economic activity .
Is this going to be a balance - sheet - constrained recovery ?
PK : It 's probably true that households have been impoverished a lot by the fall of the housing and stock prices .
And that it 's likely that households , with all of this debt , are going to have trouble spending .
And yes , the North Atlantic economy was supported quite a lot by gigantic housing booms .
Here in the UK you have had the house price surge without very much construction .
Economists have a well - developed theory about how balance - sheet problems can cause financial and economic crises , but we thought of it in terms of third world countries with foreign - currency debt .
We did n't realise that there were lots of other ways in which that can happen .
WH : So , one way to think about it is that self - reinforcing financial crises rooted in overstretched , overborrowed companies and governments in less developed countries - like those in Argentina and Indonesia , which were amazingly destructive in the 1990s and 2000s , but localised - are now playing out in the developed world ?
PK : There are really two stories .
One is the Japan - type story where you run out of room to cut interest rates .
And the other is the Indonesia - and Argentina - type story where everything falls apart because of balance - sheet problems .
WH : So in a nutshell your story is ...
PK : The " Nipponisation " of the world economy with a bunch of " Argentinafications " playing a role in the acute crisis .
But even after those are over , we have the Nipponisation of the world economy .
And that 's really something .
WH : What was the heart of the Japanese problem ?
What was at the heart of their 17 years of going nowhere ?
PK : Well , my guess is that it was that the balance - sheet problems took a very long time to resolve .
And it is difficult to get enough demand in an economy where you have really very adverse demography ...
WH : So , which countries look closest to being Nipponised - combining balance - sheet problems and ageing populations ?
PK : Well , the US does n't have the same combination .
But in Europe , Germany and Italy look comparable .
France is better and Europe as a whole is considerably better .
WH : Germany matches Japan to an uncanny degree .
You talk about the Nipponisation of the world economy : I 'm not so sure .
But I would talk about the Nipponisation of Europe via a German economy at its centre in the grip of the same problem - and that starts to be a global problem .
PK : Germany has huge inadequacy of domestic demand .
Their economic recovery in the first seven years of this decade rested on the emergence of gigantic current account surplus .
How is it possible that Germany , which did not have a house price bubble , is having a steeper GDP fall than anyone else in the major economies ?
The answer is that they depended upon exporting to the bubble regions of Europe , so they actually got side - swiped by the loss of those exports worse than the bubble regions themselves got hit .
It 's Germany on a global scale that is the concern .
We worry about the drag on world demand from the global savings coming out of east Asia and the Middle East , but within Europe there 's a European savings glut which is coming out of Germany .
And it 's much bigger relative to the size of the economy .
WH : And on top there is an unique and unaddressed huge potential banking crisis .
The Germans pride themselves on their three - legged banking system , but it is incredibly interlinked .
The IMF warns that Germany could have to take at least $ 500bn of writedowns , which its banks have not begun to recognise .
German banks hold a trillion dollars - maybe more - of maturing collateralised debt obligations that can only be refinanced by crystallising the losses .
We 've had RBS and you 've had Citigroup .
Germany 's GDP will fall 6 % this year - before the banking crisis has hit it .
PK : Yeah , that 's the financial view .
Its important to keep track of the financial state of the banks .
But one always has to keep track of the real side of the economy , too .
It is a hypothesis that the problem is essentially financial .
But it is by no means a hypothesis that we know is true .
WH : So even after what we 've gone through , you say it 's just a hypothesis that the cause of the crisis is financial ?
PK : That the cause is primarily financial .
Certainly , Lehman and all of that alerted us all .
And it did trigger an immediate drop in demand .
But the housing bust was going to happen regardless .
The fall in business investment is at least to a large degree a response to excess capacity , which is the result of falling consumer demand and the housing bust .
So we do n't know .
WH : I think we know more than that .
The links between bank capital , loan losses , credit availability and economic activity and asset prices have never been clearer .
That was why there was a threat of Depression .
PK : Clearly , re-establishing stability in the financial markets is a necessary condition for recovery .
But we 're not sure it 's sufficient .
WH : That 's very scary .
PK : Well , that is part of the reason why I am so depressed .
WH : In one of your lecture charts you seemed to be suggesting that we 're 12 months into what you think could be a 36 - month period of downturn , albeit at a slower rate .
PK : Easily .
WH : It 's quite shocking that you think it will be that severe .
PK : If we measure the 2001 US recession by when the labour market finally started to turn around , it was a 30 - month recession .
It was really 30 months in before you started to see the unemployment rate come down .
WH : In Britain , there is now a new consensus forming that the government 's economic forecasts , which were roundly mocked at the time of the April budget for being wildly optimistic , could be right - that is , growth will start to resume in 2010 , albeit at a very low rate .
PK : Well , the UK has achieved a lot of monetary traction in the way that no one else has through the depreciation of the pound .
In effect , you 've carried out a successful beggar - my - neighbour devaluation .
WH : So , the United Kingdom might actually get through this in reasonably good shape ?
PK : Yeah .
That 's why I 've been watching with an outsider 's slight puzzlement , your bizarre political circus .
WH : Darling and Brown deserve more credit than they 're given ?
PK : If the government can hold off having an election until next year , Labour might well be able to run as " we 're the people who brought Britain out of the slump " .
WH : So your advice to the Labour Party is : hold steady .
PK : Probably .
WH : Probably ?
PK : I do n't know enough about the other aspects of politics , but I would guess that the option value is quite high that the economy might actually have turned a corner .
That 's unique .
That 's a uniquely British thing .
None of the other G7 countries has anything like that .
WH : And that 's a combination of our big beggar - our - neighbour devaluation , aggressive monetary policy , successfully recapitalising our banks and our fiscal policy .
PK : There has n't been very much discretionary fiscal expansion when all 's said and done .
WH : Well , there was a £ 20 bn temporary cut in VAT .
PK : Yeah .
WH : Which is non-trivial .
PK : Non-trivial .
But not much [ other spending ] , as I understand .
WH : Well , there was bringing forward £ 3 - 4bn of capital spending .
Perhaps together in a full year the stimulus was 1.5 % GDP .
Maybe 2 % at the outside .
PK : Monetary policy has been more aggressive - though maybe less than the Fed - and the depreciation of the pound is a nice thing from a UK point of view .
WH : So you remain committed to the key role of fiscal policy ?
PK : Yeah .
Fiscal policies are best ; certainly something to do to mitigate recession .
People say that the Japanese fiscal policy on all that infrastructure was wasted .
But it did help sustain the economy and avoid a collapse .
Fiscal policy can certainly do that : it gives the credit sector time to rebuild its balance sheets .
There 's every reason to be expansive around the fiscal side now because even if you 're not sure that it provides a long - term solution , avoiding catastrophe is a big thing to do .
WH : If you believe that , is Obama doing enough on fiscal policy ?
PK : Well we have a stimulus which is a little over 5 % of one year 's GDP but some of it is not real - something that was going to happen anyway and not very stimulative .
So it 's really about 4 % of GDP of genuine stimulus , but spread over two and a half years .
So , it 's actually quite a lot less than what I was arguing for .
WH : So , will it be sufficient ?
PK : Well , sufficient to actually restore full employment would probably have to be 5 % or more .
More than we have would certainly be a good thing .
It actually might happen .
You know , the buzz I 'm getting is that a second - round stimulus might well come on the agenda .
WH : Really ?
When you say " the buzz you 're getting " , have you been asked ?
PK : Well , it 's what you hear from people who talk to people who talk to people .
WH : Who would argue for that ?
Would it be Larry Summers [ director of the US National Economic Council ] ?
PK : I think Larry .
I 'm not sure Tim Geithner [ US treasury secretary ] would be opposed to it .
Nor would Chrissie [ Christine Romer , director of the Council of Economic Advisers ]
I 'm sure they would be making similar judgements .
It is actually a little spooky .
WH : They 're all people you know pretty well , who look at the world the same way , use the same tools and framework ...
PK : Yeah .
They may be sitting where they are , having some differences .
Larry 's always more conventional than I am .
Sometimes rightly .
Sometimes wrongly .
But they do operate in the same framework .
WH : How seriously do you take the argument that the growth of public debt on this scale will crowd out the spontaneous amount of growth of corporate and private debt ?
Is this already happening with the rise in long - term interest rates in the US ?
PK : The thing about long - term interest rates is that they are a weighted average of future expected short - term interest rates .
Movements in long - term rates are mostly about what people think the short rates are going to be .
Look , real rates are barely up at all .
What seems to have moved up is the expected rate of inflation , which is still below the Fed target .
So it 's more like what the markets are doing is reducing their discounting of deflationary catastrophe .
WH : how do you see the politics working out in the States and in the UK now ?
Your praise of Gordon Brown after the banks in October were recapitalised was front - page news .
Are you still as well disposed ?
PK : I still think his economic policies have been pretty good .
They really kind of lost their nerve on fiscal policy , but I do understand it 's harder to do it here .
I think the UK economy looks the best in Europe at the moment .
I have no position on all of the crazy stuff .
But I think the policies are intelligent .
The fact of the matter is that Britain did manage to stabilise the banking situation .
I 'm not ecstatic , but I 'm not sure I know what I could have done better .
WH : So where are you on the debate about various shape recoveries ?
V - shaped ?
L-shaped ?
A W - shaped recovery ?
PK : There is a possibility that we get some perk - up as the stimulus dollars start to flow and an almost mechanical bounceback in industrial production as inventories are built up .
But then we slide down again .
The idea that we sort of bounce along the bottom is all too easy to imagine .
WH : Is it just a story about the right dose of fiscal policy ?
What structural change would you advocate in the economy , to support recovery ?
PK : Financial regulation .
Rein in that monster .
The huge increase in general private - sector leverage is at the core of how we got so vulnerable .
We went for 50 years after the Great Depression without any major financial crises , and that , I think , was because we had a financial sector that did n't let people get as deeply into debt as they have now .
WH : So rein in the financial monster and give a fiscal stimulus .
So you would leave the American way of doing capitalism untouched ?
PK : I 'm not that cosmic in this stuff .
But it is true that Gordon Gekko [ the anti-hero of Oliver Stone 's film Wall Street , motto : Greed is Good ] went hand in hand with the wave of financialisation .
Corporations got more brutal and fiercer .
WH : But it is all connected .
Without the leverage , there would have been no Gordon Gekkos .
And leverage meant that predator companies had the firepower to launch contested hostile takeovers .
The only way to fend off attack , or to make the sums work after an attack , was for companies to be more brutal and fierce - often breaking the promises to staff and suppliers that kept commitment and trust .
PK : All of that is true .
I have a more mundane view about what we do .
I just want a stronger welfare state and a little bit more social democracy .
And some restoration of the labour movement as a counterweight .
I 'm not sure - maybe I 'm just not thinking about it deeply enough .
I guess I 've got the same attitude Keynes had , which was he was looking for almost technical fixes .
You 're looking for ways to fix the parts that have gone wrong rather than replace the whole thing .
You know the human cost of this crisis is vastly worse in America than it is on this side of the Atlantic .
So this is a good time to push for a better US social safety net too .
WH : And lastly - you 've been critical about Obama .
Your view now ?
PK : I 'm increasingly happy with him .
I was unhappy ; I think they could have gotten a bigger stimulus coming out the gate .
But they 've become more forceful .
I would have been more aggressive on the banks ; we 'll see if we need to re-fight that battle later on .
Healthcare is looking really good .
I 'm getting increasingly optimistic on healthcare reform .
Climate change looks like it 's going to happen .
So my odds that this will in fact be the kind of New Deal I was hoping for are rising .
I had my scepticism , but he is smart .
He 's impressive .
And it is such a relief to have somebody whom you can respect in the White House .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Iran 's supreme leader on Friday rejected opposition claims that last week 's presidential elections were rigged , describing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's win as " definitive " and demanding an end to days of protests .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first address since the June 12 presidential elections .

In his first speech since the June 12 election outcome sparked the country 's worst unrest in 30 years , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the vote accurately reflected the will of the people and accused " enemies of Islam " of stoking anger .
He warned opposition leaders , who are planning a new rally on Saturday , against staging further demonstrations , saying they would be held accountable for any violence .
The " Islamic establishment would never manipulate votes and commit treason .
The legal structure in this country does not allow vote - rigging , " Khamenei said , in his first address since the elections .
He told a large crowd at Tehran University that the " historic " 85 percent turnout of more than 40 million people was a " political earthquake " and was too large to have been manipulated .
" There is a difference of 11 million votes .
How can vote - rigging happen ? " he added .
Watch Khamenei dismiss claims of fraud »
Ahmadinejad , whose hardline policies have antagonized Western nations , claimed victory with more than 62 percent of the votes , surprising many experts who had predicted a stronger showing from main opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi .
The Ayatollah 's speech was likely to come under heavy scrutiny in Iran , amid expectations that , despite conciliatory comments , his strong endorsement of Ahmadinejad will do little to appease Moussavi 's emboldened supporters .
Read about Iran 's power structure »
Moussavi 's allegations of ballot fraud and calls for a fresh vote have rallied thousands on the streets of Tehran and other cities , in scenes not witnesses in country since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled its monarchy .
The unrest prompted Iran to place restrictions on foreign media , limiting their reports on six days of street protests , police arrests and some outbreaks of violence that have left at least eight people dead .
Watch militia crackdown »
Khamenei described the dispute over the election outcome as a disagreement within Iran 's establishment , accusing " foreign enemies " and " Zionists " -- including the United States , Britain and Israel -- of fomenting violence , and criticizing international media coverage of the unrest .
Britain's Foreign Office confirmed shortly after the speech that it was summoning Iran 's London ambassador in response to Khamenei 's comments .
His speech was punctuated with exhortations from the crowd , including : " Allah is Great , " " Death to Israel , " " Death to America , " and " Death to Britain . "
Expressing support for Ahmadinejad , Khamenei accused rival election candidates of insulting the president in the run-up to the vote .
" They swore and called the president superstitious and called him names , which is embarrassing .
They forgot about morality and law , " he said .
Khamenei , who has authorized a partial vote recount , said proper legal channels should be used for any challenge to the election outcome .
He called for an end to street protests , warning that perpetrators of violence would face punishment .
On Thursday , tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Iran 's capital for the sixth day in a row .
Some estimates put the total number of participants in the hundreds of thousands .
See where protests have taken place »
Moussavi spoke through a bullhorn from atop a building to the throngs of marchers who snaked through the city , in what was described as a peaceful protest .
He spoke hours after the Iranian government agreed to meet with candidates for crisis talks to discuss complaints stemming from the election .
With restrictions on reporting the unrest , much of the news , video and images emerging from Iran have come via social networking sites , often bypassing authorities ' attempts to block applications such as Facebook and Twitter .
CNN 's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour described Khamenei's address as a heartfelt defense of Iran 's establishment but said it was uncertain the opposition would heed his call to end demonstrations .
Watch Amanpour discuss speech . »
" That 's the all important question .
Whether or not the leaders of the opposition -- Mir Hossein Moussavi -- will call on these people to stop their protests is unclear , " she said .
" Whether they will end and whether the people on the the streets will listen -- because the protests have been spontaneous .
It will be intersting to see after this call from the supreme leader , from whom all power in Iran flows . "
Moussavi , who called for a boycott of Khamenei 's prayer sermon , was absent from the audience , which included Ahmadinejad and , next to him , parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani , who has previously had a tense relationship with the president .
Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who has been in a power struggle with Khamenei , was not visible on the TV broadcast of the event .
Rafsanjani is chairman and overseer of the Assembly of Experts -- which is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader .

In his speech , Khamenei defended Rafsanjani from charges of corruption made by Amhadinejad during a pre-election debate .
However , he opened the door to corruption charges against Rafsanjani 's relatives .
In discussing Iran 's support of human rights , Khamenei slammed U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He even made an apparent reference to the deaths of people -- what he called the " burning alive " of 80 men , women and children -- during the federal siege of the Branch Davidian complex in Waco , Texas in 1993 .
" We have raised the flag of human rights through Islam , " Khamenei said .
There have been arrests and casualties in civil unrest , with human rights group Amnesty International saying reports suggest that up to 15 people have died .
The government maintains seven people have died .
Iranian TV
Thursday night aired confessions from people who authorities say were paid to destabilize Iran .
It aired remarks from some " terrorists " who said the United States paid them to enter from Iraq to committing terrorist acts against the Iranian leadership .

Stone
Age bone flute discovered in southern Germany
The find proves that Stone Age humans had a highly developed musical culture , wrote Nicholas Conard , an archeologist from the University of Tuebingen in the British journal " Nature . "
Largely intact , the flute had been constructed from the hollow wing bone of a giant vulture using stone tools , according to the study .
Nearly 22 centimeters long ( 8.7 inches ) , the instrument roughly resembles its modern equivalent .
Five holes were carved into it to alter the pitch .
Fragments of three ivory flutes were uncovered at the same site , in the Ach Valley in southern Germany , along with other instruments that are not quite so old .
Previously , a carved figurine from the same period had been discovered just a few steps from the cave where the instruments were found , suggesting that culture was important to the people who lived in the region during the Upper Palaeolithic period ( approximately 40,000 - 10,000 years ago ) .
The bone and ivory flutes were dated using radiocarbon dating techniques ; they are some 5,000 years older than the previously oldest known instruments .
" Upper Palaeolithic music could have contributed to the maintenance of large social networks , and thereby have helped facilitate the demographic and territorial expansion of modern humans " compared to the more " culturally conservative " and isolated Neanderthals , Conard said , as reported by AFP news agency .
No concrete evidence has been found that Neanderthals were also active musicians .
While Upper Palaeolithic people are considered modern humans , Neanderthals are classified as either a subspecies or a separate species .
We just got off the phone with deposed Miss California USA Carrie Prejean -- and she says the pageant was trying to whore her out to Playboy .
Prejean claims pageant honcho Keith Lewis actually asked her last month if she would take two gigs -- appearing on " I 'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! " and Playboy .
Prejean says Lewis told her Playboy offered $ 140,000 for her to pose semi-nude .
She rejected both offers .
A few minutes ago we talked to Lewis who said he was not pushing her to take either gig -- but merely passing the offers along .
Lewis said Prejean had insisted they not turn anything down without running it by her .
Prejean -- who told us she was " shocked " at the news she was fired and learned about it only after we broke the story -- tells us she has been more than cooperative with pageant officials .
Prejean says , " What 's behind this I think is a political debate .
They do n't agree with the stance that I took [ on Prop 8 ] .
Shanna [ Moakler ] is trying to bash me .
They do n't like me .
From day one they wanted me out and they got what they wanted . "
Prejean also told us she could n't believe Donald Trump would say she treated people in the pageant " like s**t . "
For the record , Trump did tell Harvey Levin that on the phone earlier today .
Prejean said if Trump really feels that way she 's sorry , adding : " I 've shown respect for every party involved , even when they have n't shown it back . "
To get inside the head of a homing pigeon as it navigates towards its roost , researchers turned a flock of pigeons into cutting - edge techno - birds .
The scientists outfitted the birds with " neurologgers " consisting of an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) to read the bird 's brain waves and a GPS tracker to record its location ; by matching a bird 's position to its brain activity , the researchers could determine the bird 's reaction to the landscape below it .
They found that , just like humans , the pigeons use visual landmarks in their navigation .
How homing pigeons find their way back to a starting point is not completely known .
Studies have shown that the birds variously use the position of the Sun and the Earth ’s magnetic field as a compass , and sense of smell and visual cues as navigation aids .
But the use of visual cues has been difficult to study , because if a bird flies over a landmark and does n’t change its course , it ’s impossible to know whether the bird has not perceived the cue or is ignoring it [ The New York Times ] .
For the study , published in Current Biology , lead researcher Alexei Vyssotski released the outfitted birds over the Mediterranean , and saw the
activity in one particular frequency range plummeted as the birds flew across the featureless sea .
Brain waves in this band , however , perked up as pigeons neared the coastline , and when Vyssotski's team released pigeons in a city , the same frequencies spiked when the birds crossed prominent landmarks , such as highways [ New Scientist ] .
Researchers also detected two surprising blips while birds were flying over a unremarkable rural landscape ; when the scientists visited those locations , they found thriving pigeon colonies that presumably caught the fliers ' attention .
There were a few other unexpected quirks .
Pigeons flying in flocks also produced fewer of these brain waves than pigeons flying solo .
" When animals are flying in flocks it is not necessary to look at landmarks , " Vyssotski says [ New Scientist ] .

The influence of the Stanford University computer scientist Rajeev Motwani , who has been found dead in the swimming pool of his California home , at the age of 47 , stretched beyond Silicon Valley to affect the lives of millions of people around the world .
Known among his peers as having a brilliant mind , Motwani was an award - winning professor whose work in data mining and algorithms scooped a string of accolades , including the prestigious Gödel prize ( 2001 ) .
But it was in his role as a mentor and adviser to some of the world 's most powerful technology companies - including his pivotal part in the development of the internet search engine Google - that he made the greatest impact .
He had a critical role in assisting the graduate research of the Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page , encouraging the duo and helping them develop the systems that made them billionaires , so kickstarting what has probably become the pre-eminent company of the 21st century .
Like many of America 's pioneering technologists , Motwani was an immigrant , born in the Indian border city of Jammu to a military family .
With his father in the army , the family moved regularly , but the young Rajeev was soon sent to the St Columba 's boys ' school in New Delhi .
He showed an aptitude for numbers at an early age , and soon expressed a desire to become a mathematician , inspired partly by the family 's collection of biographies of famous scientists , including his hero , the 19th - century German genius Carl Gauss .
When the time came to consider university , however , Motwani 's family encouraged him to study computer science , which was a sideways move that they saw as more stable and lucrative than pure mathematics .
Despite his protestations , Motwani enrolled at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and swiftly discovered that computer science was , after all , a highly mathematical discipline .
By the time he graduated in 1983 , the home - computer explosion was in full swing , and he moved continents to conduct research for a PhD ( 1988 ) at the University of California , Berkeley .
Within a few years he became a professor at Stanford , the institution that spawned companies including Hewlett - Packard , Cisco and Sun Microsystems and has a unique role at the heart of California 's hi-tech industry .
Thus Motwani was at the academic summit of technology , and over the years oversaw the work of many students as director of graduate studies in the computer science department , and became involved in fields such as robotics , data manipulation and even drug design .
However , his most profound impact came when he played a role in guiding the work of Brin and Page .
As an expert on data mining and algorithms , Motwani saw an incredible opportunity in the worldwide web , and helped start a number of classes and groups at Stanford aimed at investigating how to apply the mathematical principles he had worked on to the online world .
When approached by Brin for advice , he was initially sceptical that a new web search engine could make a difference in a crowded market .
However , he saw something different in their work and co-authored several papers that developed their strategy for finding information online - taking on the role of informal adviser to Google as a result .
In return for his involvement , Motwani was rewarded with a stake in the company , a relationship that paid off when Google reached the stockmarket in 2004 , making Page and Brin billionaires and reaping great rewards for himself .
Although Motwani did not get the mainstream recognition that his former students achieved , the experience turned him even further towards helping nascent technologists and he found entrepreneurial zest intoxicating .
As an adviser and investor to a string of other companies , including the internet payments service PayPal and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , he quickly became one of the best - connected figures behind the scenes in Silicon Valley .
Motwani gained a reputation for never turning away a question and going out of his way to help any entrepreneur who asked him for advice .
Confident but not brash , unlike many of his peers , he was described by his friend Ron Conway , another technology investor , as " one of the smartest people who has ever existed in Silicon Valley " .
By the time he was interviewed by Business India in 2007 , Motwani had a different way to describe himself : a " startup junkie " .
He is survived by his wife , Asha Jadeja , and daughters Naitri and Anya .

Even as a child , Warren Farrell had little patience for the gender roles mandated by society .
His family was conventional enough : a New Jersey suburban home , three children ( he was the oldest ) , an accountant father who was definitely the primary earner .
But the young Warren refused to be pigeonholed by anyone 's view of proper behavior for a boy .
In seventh grade , he entered -- and won -- a beauty contest for boys .
" I was elected class prince , " he recalled with a still - proud laugh .
In eighth grade , he was tagged as a math whiz , but he found math too boring to pursue .
Although he was tall and athletic , he hated fighting , so , of course , he attracted the taunting of the local bullies in high school .
He finally fought one .
He won , and the bully clique respected him after that .
" It made me sad -- winning a wrestling match is such a stupid reason to respect someone , " he said .
Dr. Farrell always suspected that women tended to undermine themselves .
One day , while he was teaching urban politics at Rutgers , he attended a convention at which one attendee , an attractive young woman , wanted to make a point but was beset with stage fright .
" I encouraged her to speak up , and when she did , she blew everyone away , " he said .
She and Dr. Farrell soon married and , after she became a well - known corporate executive , she offered to be primary breadwinner while he pursued a doctorate in political science from New York University .
( He asked that her name be withheld to protect her privacy . )
He did his dissertation on the women 's movement .
" My wife 's income allowed me to do what I really loved , " he said .
" I realized that women 's liberation is men 's liberation , too . "
After they divorced -- they remain friends , he said -- Dr. Farrell moved to San Diego , where he still lives .
Ten years ago he met , and eventually married , Liz Dowling , a California entrepreneur with two daughters -- Alex , now 17 , and Erin , 18 .
Although he has written extensively about issues like sexual harassment and fatherhood , he says he is not spurred on by personal experiences .
" I 've always been motivated to stop people from doing dysfunctional things , " he said .
Which , of course , provided a nice segue into his thoughts on how women can stop the self - sabotage that so often leads to low pay .
Refreshingly , he steered clear of advice about body language , attitudes , dress and communication skills ; women are already better at all of those than men , he said .
But he did offer other observations :
There can be good jobs in fields you think you hate .
So what if you are all thumbs .
" A woman with organizing skills can run a construction company without ever picking up a hammer and nail , " Dr. Farrell said .
Do you like medicine , but can't stand blood ?
" Pharmacists can make as much as doctors , " he said , and can have more control over their lives .
Jobs that are hazardous for men can be pretty safe for women .
Women in the military are rarely sent to the front lines , Dr. Farrell said .
Studies have shown that women who are cabdrivers usually pull daytime hours , female postal workers get safer routes , and male coal miners try to keep their few female colleagues out of danger .
" When women need protection , men will compete to give it , " he said .
WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Eric
Holder said some detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , may end up being released in the U.S. as the Obama administration works with foreign allies to resettle some of the prisoners .
Mr. Holder , in a briefing with reporters , said administration officials are still reviewing individual cases of the approximately 250 detainees to determine which will be put on trial and which may be released to comply with plans to close the detention facility by next year .

This is what happens when you do n't allow real competition into the picture .
It 's also what happens when you have a for - profit healthcare system :
Executives of three of the nation 's largest health insurers told federal lawmakers in Washington on Tuesday that they would continue canceling medical coverage for some sick policyholders , despite withering criticism from Republican and Democratic members of Congress who decried the practice as unfair and abusive .
The hearing on the controversial action known as rescission , which has left thousands of Americans burdened with costly medical bills despite paying insurance premiums , began a day after President Obama outlined his proposals for revamping the nation 's healthcare system .
An investigation by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations showed that health insurers WellPoint Inc. , UnitedHealth Group and Assurant Inc. canceled the coverage of more than 20,000 people , allowing the companies to avoid paying more than $ 300 million in medical claims over a five - year period .
It also found that policyholders with breast cancer , lymphoma and more than 1,000 other conditions were targeted for rescission and that employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses .
Is n't that lovely .

By By Michael Cosgrove May 20 , 2009 in World A French Government report on sect deviance has denounced what it calls excessive sect activity in international institutions .
Scientology and other groups are in its sights , and these groups are putting up fierce resistance .
Mental destabilisation , exorbitant financial demands , a rupture with members ’ original environment , power in the hands of one person , the invasion of a person ’s physical integrity , the recruitment of children , antisocial preaching and troubling public order , activities which lead it to be tried in a court of law , using parallel economic structures , attempts to infiltrate the workplace , schools , and public powers .
There are around fifty religions or groups which are being tracked , the most commonly known of which are ; Jehovah ’s Witnesses , Scientology , Mormons , The Universal Church , Raelians and The Unification Church ( Moon . )
Criticism of the Miviludes is fierce , and since the organisation began extending its activities to organisations outside of France it has also been attacked by foreign government agencies such as the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom , which has in the past been highly sceptical about the motives of the Miviludes .
Yesterday saw the release of their 199 - page
The report notably singles out NGO ’s ( Non-governmental organizations ) which it says are attempting to legitimise sect activities under cover of the principles of religious freedom .
They are said to be acting in concert to limit the influence of the Miviludes within the UN by using tactics such as official complaints and smear tactics .
OSCE / UN services said to be particularly infiltrated are the Office of Democratic Institutions and that of Human Rights .
Other major institutions said to be affected are the European Council and the US State Department and its Report on Religious Freedoms in the World .
NGO ’s said to be active in trying to destabilise the Mivilude ’s work include Human Rights Without Frontiers , the Institute on Religion and Public Policy , the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty and the Information and Advice Centre for New Spititualities .
These and other organisations are said to be acting as front organisations for various religions who do not have UN accredited presence .
Most notable amongst them is the Church of Scientology , which has launched several attacks on the Miviludes , notably by using the US State Department ’s clout at the UN .
The Scientology Internet site logo looks very much like the UN logo and the Church presents itself as being ‘ Associated with the UN Department of Public Information . ’
One week ago the Paris offices of the Miviludes were visited by OSCE officials demanding to audit the report before release and check it for what it called any possible human and religious rights abuse .
The staff present refused that any documents be taken away .
The OSCE intervention was applauded by the Church of Scientology which had appealed to the UN and OSCE in order that they surveille the activities of the Miviludes .
The fact that France is a fiercely secular country provides a partial explanation for the existence of an organisation as unique and with as much influence as the Miviludes .
It has been involved in long - running battles with various religious organisations , or sects as they call them .
Now that this battle has moved onto the international stage the stakes have gone up and both sides are sharpening their knives .
France has a government agency called the Miviludes , unique in Western countries , whose job it is to track and counter those religious and other groups it considers as being sects .
Miviludes is an acronym of the French phrase ‘ Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires , i.e. ‘ Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combating Cultic Deviancy . ’
A sect is defined here as being any religious organisation which can be characterised as employing any of the following methods ; Mental destabilisation , exorbitant financial demands , a rupture with members ’ original environment , power in the hands of one person , the invasion of a person ’s physical integrity , the recruitment of children , antisocial preaching and troubling public order , activities which lead it to be tried in a court of law , using parallel economic structures , attempts to infiltrate the workplace , schools , and public powers .

Yesterday saw the release of their 199 - page Annual Report , of which ten pages are consecrated to a stinging criticism of the activity of sects and their supporters in the UN and the OSCE ( Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe . )
The OSCE is the biggest security - oriented intergovernmental organisation on the planet .
Its job is to surveille and uphold principles such as fair elections , press freedom and human rights .
It is an ad - hoc UN Agency .
The report notably singles out NGO ’s ( Non-governmental organizations ) which it says are attempting to legitimise sect activities under cover of the principles of religious freedom .

General Motors may be so short of cash that bankruptcy is among its dwindling options , but the company is still in the business of creating dreams .
Its latest dream , the P.U.M.A. mobility pod , to be unveiled Tuesday in New York , is pretty far out — and as such , requires no big immediate investments .
Indeed , Larry Burns , G.M. ’s vice president for research and development and strategic planning , said the P.U.M.A. prototype cost “ only one half of 1 percent of G. M ’s typical engineering budget ” for a year .
Of course , the P.U.M.A. ( for Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility ) is not really a car , and it ’s not really being introduced , except as a bit of blue - sky thinking about better ways to move around crowded urban areas than driving an automobile .
Mr. Burns has used the phrase “ reinvention of the automobile ” before , in relation to fuel - cell vehicles like the G.M. Sequel .
But the P.U.M.A. , a joint project with Segway , the New Hampshire - based creator of self - balancing two - wheel scooters , is quite different .
Think of a larger , two - passenger , sit - down version of the Segway PT , with two gyroscopically balanced wheels .
The prototype has minimal bodywork , but podlike enclosures ( which look like computer mice on wheels ) are imagined for production .
If it gets that far .
If all of this conjures visions of a rickshaw , well , the prototype does somewhat resemble one .
Mr. Burns imagines Singapore , which has rickshaws , as one possible early market .
The P.U.M.A. , which will be displayed at the New York International Auto Show ( which opens to the public on Friday ) , is an electric vehicle powered by lithium - ion batteries .
James D. Norrod , the president and chief executive of Segway , says it has a 35 - mile range and 35 m.p.h. top speed .
A three - hour charge costs , not surprisingly , 35 cents .
It is , in essence , a neighborhood electric vehicle , or N.E.V. , whose limited speed keeps it off highways ( and , in most states , off roads with speed limits over 35 ) .
Mr. Burns said that six P.U.M.A. ’s would fit in a standard parking space .
A new N.E.V. — many are little more than glorified golf carts — is not going to reinvent the automobile .
Despite the claims by proponents that these vehicles could serve the driving needs of many millions , they have failed to make much of a dent in the car market .
Ford abandoned its Neighbor N.E.V. when it sold the Norwegian company that made it , Think Nordic , at the end of 2002 .
Fewer than 6,000 Neighbors were sold in the United States that year .
Chrysler still sells Global Electric Motorcars vehicles , which have had some success in gated communities .
In a meeting Monday with editors and reporters at The New York Times , Mr. Burns pulled out his cellphone to make a point : Project P.U.M.A. vehicles would be designed to tap into the two - way communications made possible by G.M. ’s OnStar technology , which has six million North American subscribers .
The vision is expansive : using “ vehicle to vehicle , ” or V2V , communications , these “ 100 percent digital ” devices would communicate with one another over a quarter - mile range to prevent collisions , eventually allowing what G.M. calls “ autonomous driving and parking . ”
Mr. Burns imagines a hands - free urban driver ignoring dense city traffic to concentrate on sending text messages from a P.D.A. clipped - in to serve as a dashboard , as the mobile Internet pod moves toward its destination .
“ My daughter sleeps with her iPhone in her hand , ” Mr. Burns said .
“ At this point , is using a cellphone the distraction , or has driving become the distraction ? ”
There ’s more : the pods would also be equipped to communicate with the smart grid of the future ( as is the Aptera EV , another podlike electric vehicle that is due to be introduced in the fall ) , returning electricity to utilities during times of peak demand .
That ’s not V2V , it ’s V2G — vehicle to grid .
Video
The Segway PT costs $ 5,000 , so the more capable 600 - pound P.U.M.A. would presumably be priced considerably higher , though Mr. Burns declined to speculate where the sweet spot might be .
“ This is a prototype , not a product , ” said Mr. Norrod of Segway .
“ We have not made a decision to commercialize it . ”
Mr. Burns concluded his remarks by offering a glimmer of what his company could become if it managed to transform the urban roadscape .
“ We were the S.U.V. company , and we accept that , ” he said .
“ We want to become the U.S.V. company — known for ultra-small vehicles . ”

A British soldier who lost control of both his legs after a rocket attack in Iraq has completed the London marathon , almost two weeks after he started .
Major Phil Packer completed the 42 kilometre course on crutches , defying doctors who told him he would never walk again .
He walked two miles a day since the marathon started on April 26 , and was greeted by hundreds of well - wishers who lined the final mile .
The 36 - year - old said this was an important victory for him .
" It makes you want to do things like that .
It makes you want to carry on and show that disability does n't stop you from doing anything , " he said .
" I 've changed as a person , [ and I ] understand disability a lot more .
I feel very fortunate that I 'm able to stand and able to walk again . "
Major Packer raised 630,000 pounds ( $ 1.25 million ) for the Help For Heroes soldiers ' charity , which helps injured servicemen and women , and is hoping to raise enough to reach the one - million - pound mark .
" I 've walked 52,400 steps and somebody has walked with me every step of the way , be it a dinner lady , a London taxi driver or a metropolitan police officer , " he said upon completing the marathon .
" I 've had time to talk to people and have conversations , people have really opened up about their feelings about the [ armed ] services and it has been humbling . "
Xi‘s unofficial spokes person Jess has allegedly put together a LittleBigPlanet level that works in tandem with Xi ( PlayStation Home ’s ARG ) .
Not only can you play LBP to get stickers and cute little doo- dads , now it can help you progress in the butterfly collecting adventure known as Xi .
Inside of the level is a code that is only accessible after going through the level once and collecting the sticker trigger at the later stages of the level in which you need to use in the earlier stages of the level to make a code pop up .
That code unlocks a butterfly in Xi .

Sitting on the couch after a night of debauchery , you ’ve doubtless seen them .
Struggling to catch those much needed Z’s at 3 a.m. , you ’ve watched an ad or two .
In fact during a regular night ’s broadcast these guys can be seen shilling everything from car wax to cutlery and they make a bucket - load of money doing it .
Why ?
Because people buy .
Deep down we all know we ’re never really going to use a foot - scraping egg or a lifetime supply of adhesive bonding compound , but it makes no difference when one of these over - enthusiastic fellows promotes the product : our wallets are open for business .
I ’ll be the first to admit that I , too , have purchased a Sham - Wow and you know what ?
They actually do work … sort of .
Now , even without the happenstance on one of these infomercials , you can watch two of the greatest in the biz ( Billy Mays and Anthony Sullivan ) hard at work on the show Pitchmen on the Discovery Channel .
And I ’ll tell you what : it is fascinating what these guys and their production crew go through just to get an item on the air !
I highly recommend it .

Somebody seems to have fond memories of the civil war :
You ca n’t convince me that the Founding Fathers would n’t allow you to secede .
The Constitution is not a suicide pact , and if a state says : ‘ I do n’t want to go there , because that ’s suicide , they have a right to back out .
They have a right — people have a right to not commit economic suicide ... ... Texas says go to hell , Washington , which by the way has been said before .
I believe it was Davey Crocket ... it ’s about time that somebody says that again . "
Dave Neiwert talks about this kind of rhetoric is his new book , The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right :
Not only has the village lunatic gained permission to continue wandering the town square poking everyone he dislikes in the eye with a sharp stick , but he gets to claim victimhood when the victims respond angrily .
Unfortunately , in the process , the whole village is transformed , and not for the better .
Outside of the blogosphere , most media outlets have either ignored Beck 's rise at Fox or handled him with kid gloves .
But he 's not some amusing little cry baby ; he 's radicalizing the mainstream American right in ways that are n't good for this country .
No one has ever accused Fox of being anything other than a front for the GOP .
But at least then they were n't looking to tear apart the country .
Now , barely three months after losing power , a secession - minded host is the face of their network .
Is there anybody at Fox willing to stand up to this nutcase ?

Update by Jed ( 5:25 PM ) --
Uh , General Beck , Dallasdoc needs a word with you :
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration ’s sweeping new proposal to restrict executive pay is likely to be a humbling exercise for seven of the nation ’s largest companies , which have received billions of dollars in federal assistance to survive the economic crisis .
But for most other companies , the plan is expected to have only a marginal effect on pay practices for now .
The Treasury Department on Wednesday appointed a well - known Washington lawyer , Kenneth R. Feinberg , to oversee the compensation of employees at the seven companies  the American International Group , Citigroup , Bank of America , General Motors , Chrysler and the financing arms of the two automakers .
He will have broad discretion to set the salaries and bonuses for their five most senior executives and their 20 most highly paid employees .
Well , the Republican National Committee said they would fight back against the idea of a news program to inform Americans about the debate over health care reform , and despite the embarrassment it may have caused their official media arm , and having David Westin , chairman of ABC News calling bullshit on their whining , they showed the world that they meant business :
At least 20 House Republican lawmakers took advantage of the RNC 's offer of free airtime throughout the day Wednesday to push back against the Obama administration 's healthcare reform plans .
And while the President may have reached millions to talk about a plan that a majority of the country supports , those 20 brave Republicans ... ummm ... did n't .
This morning Sony reported a dismal $ 1 billion loss for its 2008 fiscal year , but the one bright spot was the conglomerate 's movie division , which was still in the black .
But after Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton 's remarks at a panel discussion in New York this morning , you 've got to figure he 's feeling the pressure , too , since his unit 's operating income dropped by nearly 50 % to $ 305 million .
And even though Sony 's studio is n't flailing and has n't suffered the same sort of plunge in profits and piracy that befell 20th Century Fox , Lynton is staring down the barrel of a scary future .
First , he decried the impact of the Internet on the movie business : " I am a guy who has n't seen any good come out of the Internet , " Lynton , a former CEO of AOL Europe and president of AOL International , said .
" It seems to have done damage to every ( part ) of the entertainment business . "
Surprising remarks considering how willing Sony has been lately to stream its movies online : it has deals with Hulu , YouTube and makes more titles available on its own video site Crackle .
Also many of its releases are covered by Netflix 's streaming pact with Starz , meaning many of Sony 's DVD titles can be viewed online via Netflix .
He also called on Washington to increase protections for copyrighted material , saying " somebody has got to realize that we need some rules . "
While Lynton 's insistence that Washington focus on fighting piracy is a typical statement from a movie exec , it 's not as if Sony just had a movie pirated and downloaded four million times before its release .
No , that was 20th Century Fox .
Lynton also bellyached about the state of film financing , describing the inability to raise money due to the ongoing credit crunch as " really a crisis . "
Another statement that does n't seem to apply to Sony 's own money situation .
The studio still has two pacts with Relativity Media to co-finance its upcoming titles , including many summer films .
There are other studios , like Disney and Paramount , that do n't have any slate co-financing deals in place .
He did say that the current financing challenges in Hollywood might lead studios to pool their money into one fund and noted that lucrative gross participation deals for actors and directors do n't seem to work anymore .
Does that mean
Sony wo n't be paying Will Smith and Adam Sandler as much money upfront anymore ?
Probably not .
The Origin of Unix Pipes
In a typewritten piece of paper , Doug McIlroy described pipes long before the advent of Unix .
Edmonton — University of Alberta researchers conducting a water study in the Mackenzie River Delta have found a dramatically higher delivery of mercury from the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean than determined in previous studies .
Researcher Jennifer Graydon analyzed water in the Mackenzie River as it flowed north into the Beaufort Sea .
She collected samples for three months and discovered the total amount of mercury exported from the river during that three - month period was equal to an entire year 's worth of mercury calculated in previous studies .
Graydon 's research and previous studies measured export of all chemical forms of mercury in water including methyl mercury .
" Methyl mercury is a neurotoxin and it's primarily passed on to humans through contaminated fish muscle , " Graydon said .
" This leaves northern communities vulnerable , because a large part of their diet is Arctic fish species and Beluga whales . "
Gradyon says existing studies already show Beluga whales in the western Arctic have higher mercury levels in their flesh than Belugas in the eastern Arctic .
The Mackenzie River empties in the Beaufort Sea at the western edge of the Northwest Territories .
Graydon 's new estimates were confined to the three months the research team spent on the delta while previous research used data to model mercury export over the course of an entire year .
" Previous annual mercury delivery estimates are premature because of the understudied effects of spring ice - jamming and of 45,000 delta lakes , " said Graydon .
" That influence water chemistry as the Mackenzie River passes through the delta . "
" There are very few point sources for mercury in the Arctic , " said Graydon .
" Mercury is a metal that undergoes long range transport so the Arctic is getting mercury from a global pool .
" Graydon says the biggest contributor of man-made mercury pollution is coal - fired power production .
This summer U of A researchers will return to the Mackenzie region after it floods to study mercury levels in the thousands of lakes in the delta when flooded by the river .
Graydon 's Mackenzie River research was published in the journal Science of the Total Environment earlier this year .

Mort Zuckerman , owner and publisher of US News & World Report , has a lengthy opinion piece out in the magazine entitled : “ Obama Should Not Abandon Israel in His Effort to Court Muslims . ”
The title summarizes the premise , which is that while Obama has reasons to court Muslims he is endangering or threatening Israel in order to do it .
The core flaw to the reasoning though is that getting out of the West Bank does n’t endanger Israel .
It ’s actually critical to the country ’s future well - being , even its survival .
There are a few core points to note in this regard .
People who argue that the Palestinians and other Arab states are either unwilling or unable to make peace buy into a basic fallacy — namely that ‘ giving up ’ the West Bank is a sacrifice that must be reciprocated by some meaningful and confirmable sacrifice on the other side .
In other words , land for peace , as the phrase goes .
But are several levels of problem with his formulation .
First , strategic considerations .
It used to be argued that Israel could n’t surrender the West Bank because without it , the country would lack ‘ strategic depth . ’
In other words , the country ’s ‘ waistline ’ would be too narrow and an invader from the east could easily cut the country in half .
But hardly anyone makes this argument any more .
And for good reason : successive Israeli generals and members of the country ’s security establishment say this is n’t true .
Next , the settlements themselves , particularly the outlying ones sometimes called ‘ political ’ settlements are a security liability in themselves since they ’re isolated population centers that must be defended in any conflict and occupation duty tends to degrade an army ’s war - fighting capacity .
But these pale in comparison to the real heart of the matter .
Israel does n’t have enough Jewish citizens to make Jews the clear majority in both Israel proper and the Occupied Territories .
Therefore , whatever the morality or international law of the matter , holding the Occupied Territories permanently puts Israel on a course to one of two options : becoming a binational state in which Jews make up half or less of the population or a non-democratic state which probably cannot survive under the norms governing first world countries in the 21st century .
Let ’s be clear what that means : a country that permanently holds territories with residents who lack citizenship , the vote and many of the rights of the citizens of the country in question .
You can throw around inflammatory words like ‘ apartheid ’ which I do n’t think is appropriate or apt because of the very different origins of the two situations .
But it strikes me as naive to believe that such a situation can be maintained permanently without growing international pressure and isolation that will strangle the country .
What this logic tells me is that getting out of the West Bank is n’t a prize to be exchanged for peace if and when you can find a leader on the Palestinian side who you have perfect trust in .
Getting out of the West Bank is quite simply necessary to the survival of Israel as a Jewish state .
So ideally you get out in exchange for a durable peace .
And you try to do it in the smartest and most orderly manner .
But you get out regardless .
And realizing the necessity of leaving means , at a minimum , as a first step , stopping doing things that make it harder , perhaps nearly impossible , to leave .
And the first thing on that list is continuing to build new settlements and infrastructure which creates a growing constituency to stay in the settlements forever .
There ’s nothing remotely original about this argument .
It ’s the same inexorable logic that has led former ‘ Greater Israel ’ advocates like Tzipi Livni and Ehud Olmert to come to more or less the same conclusion .
And let me note , to be emphatically clear , that there are many other reasons for Israel to leave the West Bank — the prospect of a durable peace , which I think is probably achievable , its contribution to regional stability which is a real advantage to the US , the rights of the Palestinians to their own self - determination , etc. etc. etc .
But I ’ve focused on this point because at the end of the day it is undeniably in Israel ’s interest to leave the West Bank .

Mr Blunkett hopes its demise will free town centres of the tired and emotional gangs of mini-skirted lasses and their staggering boyfriends who materialise soon after chucking - out time .
So troublesome are their lager and alcopop - fuelled antics that police and health authorities are keen to hasten the passing of Happy Hour and its disorderly offspring , Cheap Drinks Promotions .
Friends of the family might have seen the writing on the wall last summer when pub crawls were banned in the drinking establishments of Falaraki , the Greek resort favoured by young Brits on hedonistic holidays .
A further nail in Happy Hour 's coffin is the imminent arrival of its controversial sibling , 24 - hour Licensing Laws .
For Britons ' enthusiastic drinking habits mean that our towns ain't big enough for the both of them .
No flowers .
Or toasts .

How you construct your linking patterns has a lot to do with the success of your site .
Internal links are how you keep visitors on your site , clicking through to more pages and getting more information .
You want them to convert to customers .
Your pages should be as focused on sales as you can without losing the edge of being informative .
You will want to keep your home page strong , so keep obtaining inbound links to as many internal pages as possible to avoid weakening your home page .
Link down through your pages sensibly , to add link juice where needed and to make your site easy to navigate .
Link your home page to a few key pages , gather inbound links to those same pages , then spread the love down from there .
Your home page should contain ( among other things ) several boxes with links to various portions of your site , but these should be limited to five or ten at the most .
There is no need for links to specific product pagesfrom your home page .
Once we get the internal pages , we can start working on these types of links .
So , the home page links to interior pages , which link to the following : contact information , FAQ , the home page , and any related pages within your website , product pages should link to ‘ Add to Cart ’ .
and ‘ checkout .
– other pages should still include a link to checkout as the person may surf before checking out .
Deal with enormously long pages by breaking them up or adding a ‘ back to top ’ link .
This can cut down on customer impatience if they have scrolled way down a long page and want to get back to the top fast .
As you add pages to your website , it will be fairly obvious where the internal links to each page will need to come from .
Always keep in mind that visitors who come to your site want to be able to find what they want quickly and easily , so multiple landing pages are nice .
Try to link like things together across your product categories to encourage more browsing and increase sales .
You can even have certain items marked as qualifying for a discount , or free shipping when purchased with another qualifying item ( make sure you only specify products with a high profit margin for this type of promotion ! ) .
Do n’t forget the possibility of an up - sell !
A strong internal linking structure only costs you time , and the ROI is worth it .
If you have advertising on your site as well , then the longer you keep consumers clicking and bouncing around the more likely they are to click on an ad…and then you make a commission ; same if you run an affiliate website .
Microsoft is getting ready to offer Windows users a free antivirus product ( code name Morro ) , something it should have built into one of its operating systems a long time ago .
But , of course , Microsoft never makes things simple .
So the big question is will Morro be worth the price ?
Microsoft 's goal is to offer the antivirus product as a hosted service , which is very different from what users have come to expect , especially when the word " free " is attached to the term " antivirus . "
After all , Grisoft and Avast have offered free versions of their antivirus products to PC users , and those free products are of the traditional download and install nature .
Microsoft says Morro will be released as a public beta " soon . "
There is no word on the final release .
The big question here becomes will users entrust their security to Microsoft and what may be a half - baked beta product ?
It is worth noting that Microsoft is claiming that " Morro " will be more than just a dedicated antivirus product .
Microsoft is wrapping the term " real - time anti-malware " around the service .
Morro will work by routing all of a users Internet traffic to a Microsoft datacenter , where the Morro application will process the traffic and identify and block malware in real time , by examining all of the rerouted traffic .
That will give Morro a leg up on the free competition .
The free products from Grisoft and Avast are merely antivirus products and do n't address real - time malware threats .
By keeping Morro free , Microsoft has a lot to gain .
First off it will help to sell Windows 7 when it hits the market in October .
That will give Windows 7 the perception it has anti-malware technology built in ( albeit , as a service ) .
Secondly , Microsoft can use Morro as an avenue to force users to patch their systems -- quickly eliminating security flaws that are regularly discovered .
Finally , Morro will help Microsoft to build better products in the future , by being on the leading edge of malware protection .
This helps Microsoft gain insight into how malware develops , spreads and infiltrates systems .
Of course a lot of questions remain about Morro .
Questions that will need to answered quickly if Microsoft aims to succeed in the hosted antimalware area .
* Will Morro remain free forever ?
* What user information will Microsoft gather with a Morro service ?
* Will the service still protect when a user is not connected to the web ?
* Will Microsoft keep the service as up to date as competing products ?
* Will Morro be available for all Microsoft OSes ?
* Will Morro noticeably impact performance ?
Once there are solid answers to those questions , many will wonder what all of this will mean for the antivirus software market .
Will a free security service from Microsoft push vendors such as Symantec , McAffe , Panda , Kaspersky , and others out of the market ?
The answer is probably not .
Most of the security software vendors do a lot more than just desktop anti-malware -- the real expertise lies with protecting networks and providing products that prevent data leaks , kill spam and handle the other multitude of security ills that users can be exposed to .
At the very least , Morro should prove to be a marketing success for Microsoft , whether or not the service will be able to compete with commercial products is yet to be seen .
At least the impression will be that Microsoft is concerned with security and is looking to protect their Desktop OS customers .
PARIS — President Barack Obama remains by far the most popular world leader among people in major Western nations and is the one political figure on whom people consistently pin their hopes in the economic crisis , according to new polls conducted for the International Herald Tribune .
About 80 percent of people in France , Germany , Italy and Spain have a positive view of Mr. Obama , a ratio that declines only slightly , to about 70 percent , in the other two countries surveyed , Britain and the United States .
The only politician who comes close is Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany , who gets a positive rating from two - thirds of those in Continental Europe but from only one - third of Britons and Americans .
The new survey , conducted by Harris International for the I.H.T. and the cable news channel France 24 , reinforces the results of one conducted a month earlier showing that about half of those surveyed expressed the most confidence in Mr. Obama ’s ability to solve the economic crisis , with Mrs. Merkel coming in second , at 22 percent .
The surveys found that a solid majority of people in the major Western democracies expect a rise in political extremism in their countries as a result of the economic crisis .
Even in the United States and Italy , the two countries whose citizens are least likely to hold that view , fully 53 percent of those surveyed say more extremism is “ certain to happen ” or “ probable ” in the next three years .
KABUL
Family planning services are available in over 90 percent of health facilities across Afghanistan but the number of women using them in rural areas is too low , according to the Ministry of Public Health ( MoPH ) .
Hamida Ebadi , director of MoPH ’s reproductive health unit , reckoned only 14 - 15 percent of women in rural and remote regions use family planning services .
“ The number of women using these services in urban areas is higher than in rural areas but we do n’t have formal statistics to show the disparity , ” Ebadi told IRIN in Kabul .
Several NGOs and the MoPH are involved in the delivery of family planning services , which include professional advice on gaps between pregnancies and free distribution of contraceptives , including condoms , tablets and injections .
Second only to Sierra Leon , Afghanistan has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world with 1,600 deaths per 100,000 live births ( 24,000 preventable deaths every year ) , according to the UN Population Fund ( UNFPA ) .
Most pregnancy - related deaths happen in remote , isolated and insecure areas of the country where people have poor access to quality health services , officials say .
Taboo
“ The majority of people here are not familiar with family planning and contraceptives , ” said Narghes Azimi , a health worker in the southern province of Kandahar .
“ Sex and contraceptives are strong taboos here , ” she said .
Lack of awareness and strong conservative traditions which often hamper women ’s access to health centres are major reasons why family planning measures are not making much headway in the countryside , health experts say .
“ Lack of female health personnel also inhibit women ’s access to health services because many men do not permit women to be seen by a male doctor or nurse , ” said Hamida Elmi , head of an obstetric hospital in the northern city of Mazar - i- Sharif .
Sex and contraceptives are strong taboos here .
Backed by the government , UNFPA has been training imams from around the country on the benefits of family planning and pregnancy gaps in a bid to increase public awareness and reduce pregnancy - related maternal deaths .
However , health officials acknowledge the problems of reproductive health in rural areas go far beyond a lack of awareness or restrictive traditions .
Insecurity , the high prevalence of child marriages , the dearth of professional female health workers particularly outside urban areas , and the lack of roads in remote areas are some of the big challenges contributing to high maternal and infant mortality and morbidity , MoPH officials say .
Birth spacing
Birth spacing through better pregnancy planning and the use of contraceptives is recommended by health experts and is believed to be instrumental in curbing preventable maternal mortality .
“ Children , whose mothers die , are 10 times more at risk of dying compared to children who are cared for and fed by their own mothers , ” said Health Minister Amin Fatimie .
Birth spacing is also believed to lead to improved infant health , experts say .
Largely owing to donor funding , the country has made progress in reducing infant mortality from 165 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2001 to about 129 in 2006 , according to the UN Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) .
Maternal health has also improved due to extended health services , but no formal assessments have been conducted to illustrate the progress .
Challenges ahead
However , significant challenges lie ahead given that Afghanistan has the highest fertility rate in Asia and the average Afghan woman gives birth to 6 - 7 children , according to UNFPA .
Ranked the fifth least developed country by the UN Development Programme ( UNDP ) in 2007 , Afghanistan ’s current estimated population of more than 28 million is anticipated to exceed 56 million by 2050 , which could create enormous social , health and developmental challenges .

About
Amerika approaches politics as philosophy and not a team sport .
We intend to restore Western Civilization through a focus on realism and a drive toward excellence .
In our view , human groups succumb to herd behavior when they focus on people ( means - over - ends ) instead of their purpose ( ends - over - means ) .
Western Civilization fell because it relied on a type of collectivized individualism known as Crowdism ; the antidote to this can be found in our most ancient traditions , including reverence and aggression .
We have no interest in the football game of Red team versus Blue team politics , but turn our minds toward the eternally practical : how to adapt to our world in the best way possible and rise above all that would thwart us .
Staff
Submissions : please send all submissions to media@amerika.org .
We use the American Renaissance style guide .
Mission
We approach politics as a form of philosophy because philosophy analyzes abstract structures in reality and thought and assesses how well they correspond .
Humans face the same struggle as any other species , namely to adapt to our environment and maximize our prospects without growing too big and depleting our food supply .
Politics in theory aims toward that goal , but in reality has become a football game of Red versus Blue teams where there is no objective except to “ win . ”
This occurs because it happens to all human groups unless they actively push back against it .
Over time , human groups become inverted when the people involved start focusing on their own careers , interests , or advantage instead of the goal of the group .
This is an example of herd behavior , and it deconstructs everything we attempt to do .
This is why human groups , including civilizations , keep self - destructing , blowing up like test rockets on the launch pad .
Very few people see our future as a shared resource .
A tragedy of the commons happens when individuals , acting in self - interest , exploit a resource until there is nothing left .
The inversion of human groups fits the profile of a tragedy of the commons if we accept that the group and its prospects can be a commons because we depend on it for our future .
If we do not have leadership which limits exploitation of this resource , it becomes depleted and we suffer .
For us to keep an eye on the goal , we have to discuss the balance between ends ( also known as goals , purpose , and principles ) and means ( also called methods and procedures ) .
Politics has become both an end and a means because people depend on it for their salaries .
People “ do politics ” for personal gain , and its original goal has been forgotten .
In order to invert this inversion , our first task is to restore our focus on goals , which requires us to understand how to assess which are the best realistic goals to have .
The Unknown Right
Conservatives have no idea who they are .
Since the mid-1700s , the West has been steadily moving Leftward in response to the fragmentation of authority produced by religious conflict , Mongol / Muslim wars , and increasing wealth .
The Right , as named in the years after the French Revolution , consists of those who accept the Leftward direction without liking it , and hope to endure it through the personal freedom to avoid being compelled to follow the rest of the herd .
As we see several hundred years later , however , it is impossible to avoid being ruled by the herd , and the herd inevitably tends toward something like Communism .
Western Europe and America , despite elaborate constitutions and systems of law to avoid this , have now become Leftist super - states of a “ soft totalitarian ” nature where control is enforced through ostracism of those who fail to be Leftist in their public viewpoints .
Our people have PTSD .
Not only are they living in a civilization with obvious signs of collapse — insanity , corruption , vandalism , criminality , division — but they have zero faith in any aspect of our society being good .
They have settled instead for a principled retreat where they flee the cities to suburban homes , work hard at their jobs , and try to escape notice by the Left .
Our people have lost hope that things will ever change or become better .
In so doing , they have forgotten conservatism , which is not a political viewpoint so much as the philosophy that we should conserve what is best in life .
This means that we remember what works , and choose from those the things that produce the best results .
This is a qualitative viewpoint , meaning that we assess by quality of results , instead of quantitative , where we look for new options constantly in the hope that one of them will magically change life to be as the Left thinks it “ should ” be .
For most of history , our people have been conservative because conservatism is common sense .
We settle on a goal , and apply ends - over - means analysis , which means that we choose whatever methods achieve that goal regardless of our perceptions of those methods ; then , we discover how life is good , and applying that transcendental logic , choose the functional methods that produce the most excellence , beauty , goodness , realism , and health .
That approach scares many people because it means an end to the ideals advanced in The Renaissance ™ and The Enlightenment , ™ namely that the individual is the measure of all things .
In conservatism , reality and excellence are higher goals than the individual , and the individual is a means to the end of achieving these .
That disturbs Leftists , so they counter with a means - over - ends approach .
Staring Down Entropy
Many on the Right recognize the Left as our competition , but do not see the Left for what it is : entropy .
The Left attempts to validate the inversion of human groups through egalitarianism , or the idea that all people should be equal .
Egalitarianism start as meritocracy , but inevitably progresses to a demand that all people be of equal status , wealth , and power because otherwise egalitarianism inverts itself .
To stay consistent , it must grow more extreme over time .
This is not a philosophy ; it is a pathology , or a compensatory behavior that makes the individual feel better in the moment without fixing the long - term issue that causes them to feel bad in the first place .
In this way , it joins drug addiction , over - eating , self - harm , and other pathologies in the list of human immaturities .
People who need Leftism are those who inwardly feel like losers and want to tear down those above them , a behavior we also see in our simian relatives .
No one else needs equality or meritocracy but those who feel they are permanently of lower ability .
Those who can do something find a way to do it and recognize inequality as one of the infinite forms of adversity that we face .
Those who cannot do that thing demand subsidies of some kind , knowing that meritocracy reduces the task from a question of accomplishment to one of working within a human system , such as taking tests at school , which is easier than facing the complexity of the world .
This pathology begins with fear .
People fear the world , and since fear is stronger than any other emotional response , become addicted to that feeling of intensity .
This then orients them toward the negative , or looking at risks , and in response they react with a preemptive defensive posture against anything that could cause a loss of individual status , power , or wealth .
This makes the individualists , or those who want “ me first ” before any order , logic , natural condition , or values system .
Individualists engage in a simple type of game theory .
They know that selfishness is not popular , so they disguise it as altruism by offering the group anarchy , or everyone doing whatever they want without losing social status , no matter how unproductive or destructive their behavior is .
This creates a group around them of collectivized individualists , called a crowd , which then defends their interests without meaning to .
Crowds operate by the same principle as gangs , mafias , unions , or cults .
They threaten to act collectively if their demands are not met .
This increases their power while transfering wealth from the group around them to the gang .
Over time , they become large enough to take over , at which point they become unstable because their purpose is defined in opposition to the majority , and without that majority , they have no way of initiating activity .
They destroy their host like a cancer .
Any institution , group , or idea can be subverted by a crowd .
They invert it by altering its focus on ends - over - means to means - over - ends , specifically the people involved .
All humanist , utilitarian , egalitarian , and pluralist views are of this nature .
Crowdism is most clearly expressed in Leftism , which always manifests in bureaucracy because any society tending toward egalitarianism has abolished social order and requires a managerial - administrative state to keep people motivated .
These crowds appear through social interaction .
In social groups , everyone must be included for the group to feel good , so ends are deprecated in favor of means .
That method — including everyone — then substitutes for both means and ends .
This allows the gang to form and engage in the pretense of being better than others , so when people reject its ideas , its members can act as if they were attacked , and retaliate without seeming to be initiating an attack .
After all , they were “ correct ” and the others are “ ignorant . ”
Crowd - run societies , following the model of the French and Bolshevik Revolutions , have a cycle of their own known as “ The Napoleonic Arc . ”
They take over , persecute or destroy dissidents , then their economies collapse , and to compensate , they become militaristic and totalitarian in order to keep people motivated enough so that the civilization keeps operating .
After that , they embark on agendas of world conquest to spread the “ good news ” of Leftism , resulting in mass carnage .
What is Rightism ?
Understanding Leftist pathology leads us back to wonder what we , as conservatives , should do .
The answer to this question lies in understanding that the Leftist pathology is a universal temptation for human beings like most bad human behaviors , and that accepting any amount of it means that more will come .
Different types of Leftists do not have different philosophies , but disagree only in terms of degree based on how confident they are , such that a moderate Democrat when given power over time becomes a full - blown Communist .
We call for an “ ultra Right ” whose founding principle is the idea of zero tolerance for Leftism and its associated ideas ( feminism , egalitarianism , pluralism , diversity ) as well as its root ( individualism ) .
We do this by asserting ends - over - means thinking where there must always be a purpose and principles to our existence , and we achieve those however we have to , which devalues our individualistic sentiments to the non sequitur they are .
For the Left , the goal is the individual and that individual having power over all else ; for the Right , our goal is to create orders larger than the individual , such as civilization , heritage , culture , learning , customs , faith , values , genetic health , and spirit .
Our quest to delve into the Right begins when we stop thinking about what we want and start thinking about what is required to achieve those things .
As part of our Ultra Right , we call for several general directions to be applied :
Elitism .
Some people are better than others in terms of “ force of intellect ” and “ force of ( moral ) character . ”
These aristocrats of the soul need to be our leaders and entrusted with all of the money , power , and social prestige / status , so that they can guide us with their greater ability .
Please note that for them , this is a life sentence to duty ; conservatism does not think in terms of “ Rights , ” but paired duties and privileges .

Please note that for them , this is a life sentence to duty ; conservatism does not think in terms of “ Rights , ” but paired duties and privileges .
Hierarchy .
Correspondingly , the rest of us fit into a hierarchy or pyramidal order where there are a few excellent ones on top and a great number of undistinguished ones at the bottom .
This is a fact of life , and all attempts to change it have failed , so we accept it whether we like it or not .
A caste system , where each person is one of three groups — leaders , independent workers , and workers — allows the best to influence the rest , producing more people of genius by encouraging society in that direction through opportunity to rise .

Reward .
Following our ends - over - means analysis , we believe in rewarding people for productivity , instead of subsidizing them or giving them wealth , power , or status before they contribute ; reward occurs solely after contribution .
This means zero socialism , welfare state , government benefits , and relativism ; in its place , we offer fairness that takes into account the past contributions and situation of the individual , and the possibility of charity for those facing temporary hard times .

Spirit .
The future belongs to those who love life and , by realizing that life is good with the possibility of excellence , realize that its methods are in fact good even when they are bad .
Good created evil so that the two might tussle , and that constant conflict produces increasing quality , if we allow it to work for us .
By striving for transcendentals — the good , the beautiful , and the true — we work with the order of nature .
In 2012 , Leftism experienced a “ Berlin 1945 moment ” when world faith in it declined .
Simply , it promised to end some problems and not only failed , but made those problems worse while introducing others .
People had gone along with the Leftist idea for most of its arc but once it achieved power as it did in 2008 , it became clear that it had no plan except further decay , and so people lost faith in Leftism and its political arm , liberal democracy , which Francis Fukuyama defines as democracy with a focus on civil rights .
Our current society resembles a hybrid of consumerism and Communism , with a strong ruthless economy mated to a nanny state government that provides jobs and benefits to most citizens .
This unstable form of living has run all of our countries into extreme bankruptcy and changed the psychology of our citizens to make them dependent on the state and highly selfish in their outlook toward life .
This in turn has made people atomized , or isolated through an inability to form connection to others and a sense of purpose .
To fix Western Civilization , we need to start with its core and origin : Western European people and their descendants .
Diversity causes internal conflict as each group competes to have its standards , values , and aesthetics dominate those of other groups ; it does not matter which groups are involved , because with any form of diversity — cultural , racial , religious , ethnic — the effect of internal division is the same .
Diversity destroys social trust , culture , and values systems .
For that reason , we must end diversity along with other failed Leftist policies .
Our goal cannot be solely to remove their policies , but remove them and replace them with functional institutions of civilization that are informal and therefore less prone to centralized collapse , which happens when people learn to “ play the game ” and through the resulting careerism , invert the organization .
Our Goals
Amerika seeks to inform conservatives about what they believe and what that realization leads them to do , recognizing that almost all conservatives navigate by gut instinct about a few basic principles .
Since they do not articulate what they believe , and ideology carefully does in a way that is easily understood by many , conservatives find themselves at a disadvantage in all debates with Leftists .
Our goal as a news and opinion site is to further accelerate the “ cultural wave ” theorized by European New Right thinkers and implemented by the American Alt Right .
We want to change attitudes by changing philosophies toward what we value , how we choose to act , and why we see some things as better than others .
Translating these highly abstract considerations into everyday examples and providing positive incentives constitute a large part of our set of goals .
We seek , above all else , to restore Western Civilization because we are not in denial and notice that it has collapsed .
This presents a strong dividing line : most people are still in denial and hoping to patch up the current system at least until the hour of their deaths , but many of us realize that there is far greater opportunity in restoring civilization and making it sane , balanced , and powerful again .
Toward this end , we describe healthy ways of living in addition to more realistic and transcendental ways of thinking .
We offer insights on culture , literature , lifestyles , science , and daily issues in addition to politics and philosophy so that people can think their way out of this failing time and seek a better , more fruitful future .
Thank you for reading and we hope you will stay with us on this challenging and exciting journey .
History
Amerika continues the work of previous sites like the American Nihilist Underground ( 1988 -2010 ) and CORRUPT ( 2008 - 2012 ) in addition to numerous BBS and USENET postings from 1988 - 1998 .
All of these have focused on radical realism mated with a transcendental , naturalistic vision .
Many of the writings on this site date back to the 1990s , with improved editing , re-writing , images , and formatting .
The ideas on many of these originate in the two decades prior to that , when the original concept of nihilism — a type of extreme realism that rejected human notions in favor of more accurate understanding of patterns in nature , following the ideal of the Platonic forms or Germanic idealism — was invented and developed by our Editor .

Where Is the Political Flynn Effect ?
By Bryan Caplan
According to IQ tests , we ’re getting smarter .
But when I was reading Warren Harding ’s “ Return to Normalcy ” speech , it seemed way over the heads of a modern audience .
The anomaly inspired me to plug Harding ’s words into an online grade level applet .
The result :
The average estimated grade level required to understand Harding ’s speech was 16.06 years .
By way of comparison , Obama ’s 2008 acceptance speech had an average estimated grade level of 9.64 years – and McCain ’s was 7.72 !
If you adjust for the fact that average education levels are much higher in 2008 than they were 1920 , these numbers are just weird .
Harding was talking at least a standard deviation over the head of his median voter .
Obama and McCain are talking at least a standard deviation below the head of theirs .
If I did n’t know better , I ’d assume that there ’s been a drastic expansion of the franchise since 1920 .
It looks like we ’ve gone from a world where only Harvard grads could vote , to one where all you need is passing grades in kindergarten .
Advice Worth $ 1 Billion
Usually , when people talk in terms of billions of dollars , they are referring to macroeconomic questions .
Recently , however , three economists ( Jeremy Bulow , Jonathan Levin , and Paul Milgrom ) were hired as consultants to advise a group that was bidding in a spectrum auction that would allow them to provide wireless service .
By following the advice of the economists , the group was able to purchase wireless coverage for the United States for $ 2.4 billion , while their major competitors ended up paying $ 3.5 billion for the same spectrum in the same auction .
Thus , their advice was worth more than $ 1 billion to their clients .
Unfortunately for the economists , they were not paid as a share of the value they generated .
They got a flat fee that was many zeros short of what they could have earned if they had negotiated a different contract .
The ultimate proof that these guys are academics at heart : they wrote up the results in an academic paper , giving away their billion - dollar secrets to anyone who wants them .
I ’ve talked to one of the authors , however , and he says they have more secrets up their sleeves .
He also told me that if I could convince a future client to sign a contract that made the consulting fee a share of the value they add , he would give me a piece of the action .
So if you have any plans to bid in a spectrum auction anytime soon , please contact me .
THE retail giant Target has confirmed it will ban plastic bags in its 283 Australian stores next month .
It will be the first large retailer to break ranks and ban bags on environmental grounds .
Instead of issuing plastic bags to shoppers at checkouts , from June 1 Target will require shoppers to either bring their own bags or buy reusable bags for $ 1 each or compostable corn starch bags for 10 cents each .
Target will soon phase out plastic bags .
Credit : Dallas Kilponen
Other retailers are understood to be furious at the decision because it undermines what was a solid retail opposition to banning bags .
Target says the ban will stop 100 million plastic bags from going into landfill and polluting the environment each year - or just under 3 per cent of the 4 billion bags that pass through Australian checkouts each year .
WASHINGTON  Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells , once hailed by President George W. Bush as a pollution - free solution for reducing the nation ’s dependence on foreign oil , will not be practical over the next 10 to 20 years , the energy secretary said Thursday , and the government will cut off funds for the vehicles ’ development .
Developing those cells and coming up with a way to transport the hydrogen is a big challenge , Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in releasing energy - related details of the administration ’s budget for the year beginning Oct.
1 . Dr. Chu said the government preferred to focus on projects that would bear fruit more quickly .
The retreat from cars powered by fuel cells counters Mr. Bush ’s prediction in 2003 that “ the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen , and pollution - free . ”
The Energy Department will continue to pay for research into stationary fuel cells , which Dr. Chu said could be used like batteries on the power grid and do not require compact storage of hydrogen .
The Obama administration will also establish eight “ energy innovation hubs , ” small centers for basic research that Dr. Chu referred to as “ Bell Lablettes . ”
These will be financed for five years at a time to lure more scientists into the energy area .
Just Cause was one of those games that people seemed to either love or hate when it was first released .
On one hand , the game featured one of the largest open - world environments we had ever seen and some impressive graphics , but some of the builds were buggy and many of the missions were rather repetitive and dull .
At E3 , Avalanche Studios was showing off the latest build of the game for the press , and it looks like many of the flaws in the first title have been dramatically improved upon .
The game once again stars Rico Rodriguez , who is reluctantly dragged back into action by The Agency in order to track down his former mentor , a man who has suddenly gone AWOL with a ton of Agency money and intel .
The game occurs on the fictional island of Panau , the economy of which seems to be torn between high - end resort tourism and terrorist - based drug trafficking ; as a result , Rodriguez is going to take on a slew of enemies on his own , but he 'll have some pretty cool gear to help with his quest .
The two items that players will be able to use infinitely are Rodriguez 's parachute and grappling hook .
The grappling hook functions in much the same way that it did in the original Tenchu games , attaching to any surface and pulling Rodriguez towards the object in question at breakneck speeds .
Combine this with the gliding ability of his parachute , and Rodriguez can practically fly wherever he wants .
This is only one of the ways that Avalanche Studios has managed to create a game that is incredibly open - ended and capable of being played in more ways than one might imagine .
It 's amazing how , thanks to the grappling hook , the gameplay is so adaptable ; this is what Bionic Commando could have been like had it been done right .
The two missions we were shown could be played in a number of ways : the first required Rodriguez to blow up an enemy encampment , while the second involved saving an informant from hostile agents .
During the first part , we got to see how players could engage in standard run-and - gun gameplay , or they could freely glide around the base and reign death down from above , or combine the two combat styles .
The second part involved taking a helicopter to a high - rise hotel , hanging from the chopper 's skids and shooting enemies , and then riding on the top of the informant 's car to defend him during a high - speed chase .
The last part includes leaping from vehicle to vehicle , shooting out tires ( which causes the cars to flip spectacularly ) , and using the grappling hook to drag your opponents .
Of course , the game 's graphics look spectacular as well : character models were impressively detailed , but the island of Panau looked great .
At the beginning of the demo , we were given a panoramic view of the island , and the draw distance showcased much of the game 's roughly 400 square miles of terrain , all of which looked extremely lush .
At the same time , some of the game 's voice acting was extremely cheesy , something that probably wo n't be improved before the game is released for PS3/ 360 / PC next year .
In spite of that , it looks like Just Cause 2 will be a great action title , thanks in large part to its open - ended and fast - paced gameplay .
Li Rongbiao had been looking forward to a quiet retirement .
But after he left his job aged 65 a few years ago , his wife had an accident .
Watching these markets is confusing , even to the best .
Some say we are in a bear equity market rally , witnessing moves that have been distorted by low volumes , other will obviously dispute .
We are watching Crude hit 8 - month highs , despite fundamental data stating that we are consuming less with Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdemand destructionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ remaining strong .
We have seen Cbanks dominate last weeks US treasury auctions , providing support for lower yields .
Some believe we have seen the worst of the recession , we may have , but we will not know until we are out of it .
We have exactly 6 - months to prove that the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœgreen shootÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ economic theory is taking root , the psychological time line imposed by Governments marketing department .
Obviously the most important variable to this successful equation is the consumer .
The one that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s supposedly hoarding excess cash , the one that seeks employment , the one whoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s net worth losses will take nearly a generation if not more to recoup , the one that suppose to make a difference within 6 - month !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 15 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ illiquid trading range .
The USD move has been on Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœfumesÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , depth of both currency and equity markets are surprisingly small and should concern most investors about the nature of their conviction .
Both month end and quarter end is creating some exaggerated directional moves for various asset classes .
This is also a holiday shortened week with both the ECB and NFP to make trading even messier .
Today will be dominated by the several month - end and half year - end fixings .
Analysts believe that given the fact that the month - to - month change of the S&P 500 is below 1 % they do not expect huge currency overlay in the North American session .
Predictions for NFP range from - 375 k to - 500 k .
This is a range that the market will interpret as somewhat bullish for the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœgreenbackÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢!
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.20 % , GBP +0.71 % , CHF +0.23 % and JPY +0.48 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.27 % and AUD +0.47 % .
The loonie remains in a tight range and is heading for a monthly loss ahead of this morning Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Canadian GDP numbers .
Some hedge funds are slowly paring their bets in this commodity uptick ahead of weekly inventory data tomorrow .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s also a shortened trading week ( Canada Day Tomorrow and US Holiday on Friday ) .
It seems that liquidity remains at a premium .
The loonie is down - 6.2 % since reaching a yearly high on the 1st day of the month .
Governor Carney has been rather vocal about the currencies aggressive appreciation since March and the effects it is having on Canadian economic growth .
The BOC last week said that CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s recession is as deep as their southern trading partners .
They believe that Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœCanadian households are facing rising stresses because of increases in unemploymentÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , which will not be currency positive in the medium term .
In the short term , expect speculators to be better buyers of USDÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s on deeper pull backs , unless we get a big surprise in the jobs data on Thursday !
The AUD found its Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœsea legsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ again and advanced against the USD in the O/N session .
This quarter will be the best performance by the currency vs. its US counterpart in 14 - years .
Renewed optimism that the global slump is easing is providing support for most of the higher yielding assets ( 0.8132 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 72.02 up +50 c ) .
Oil once again is hovering dangerously close to its 8 - month highs on the back of Nigerian militants ( MEND ) again attacking another Royal Dutch Shell plant .
Their actions are impeding production from AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largest producer .
Global demand destruction cannot support these elevated prices .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœbullsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ currently own the direction of crude prices .
But , underlying fundamentals do not support this play .
The IEA lowered its 5 - year forecasts for global crude demand because of the economic slump .
They are cutting daily consumption levels by - 3 m bpd until 2013 .
Markets continue to see little evidence of an economic recovery in the weekly commodity reports .
Last week the API reported that gas stockpiles increased to +211.4 m barrels and crude supplies fell - 72 k barrels to +356.6 m , while the weekly EIA announcement supported the API findings .
Refineries are also operating at the highest rates this year ( +87.1 % ) and fuel demand is off - 5.5 % , w/w ( the biggest year - to - date ) .
Demand destruction remains commodities greatest nemesis and not volatile currency levels .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s now expected that OPEC in Sept. will not announce a further reduction in production , but , Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œwill ask for more compliance with existing quotasÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ( to date members have a 77 % compliance record with last years production cuts ) .
This oil markets seem to be moving on Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœfumes aloneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in a shortened trading week in the US .
If the big dollar ever starts to find some traction , by default , should weigh on oil prices eventually !
Over the next couple of months expect the market to focus on the US driving season that ends on US Labor Day .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ managed to retreat yesterday on the back of the USD paring its losses and in some cases advancing against its largest trading partners , this morning with the USD under pressure itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s gaining some support ( $ 941 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,958 up +175 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,882 down - 3 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,285 down - 9 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 4 bp yesterday ( 3.49 % ) and is little changed in the O/N session .
Yields managed to touch their lowest level in a month yesterday on the back of the PBOC comments that China will stick with its foreign reserve policy for the time being .
The flight to quality and USD based assets are occurring due to reports showing that economic growth remains weak .
This is both month end and quarter end and the demand for product will be slightly exaggerated .
The dilution of riskier assets will support treasuries on deeper pull backs in the medium term .

Consumer Alert : Children 's Deaths Tied to Pet Doors
Unknown danger for curious tots able to squeeze through tiny openings .
May 12 , 2009  --
More than a hundred children have died or been seriously injured in the last decade after squeezing through tiny pet doors and getting into swimming pools or other dangerous places , new research has found .
" What we see is a picture that 's emerging which shows that the pet door is a really serious hazard in a home that no one has really had on the radar screen , " said Sean Kane , of Safety Research and Strategies .
At the request of trial lawyers , Kane combed through hundreds of coroner 's reports and media accounts .
" It 's a very laborious task to get through the documents and the data and the connections to find these incidents , " said Kane .
" But I think at the end of this we 're going to find hundreds of incidents . "
Kane compared the issue with pet doors to the discovery of the pattern of children hurting themselves in cribs .
Millions of pet owners have installed the convenient devices , which allow cats and dogs to come and go at will .
Some of the openings measure 8 by 11 inches , no bigger than a sheet of paper .
In a demonstration , three - year old Dylan Didier was able to easily squeeze through a pet door meant for cats and small dogs .
Click here to see the demonstration .
" Parents do n't appreciate that their children , even if they 're bigger , can get through , " said Dylan 's father , Hank Didier , a Florida lawyer suing a pet door manufacturer for the family of two - year old Matthew Ranfone .
Matthew 's mother Carol , of Spring Hill , Florida , found her son floating in the backyard swimming pool after he managed to get through a small pet door in the family home .
" I remember when the accident occurred , " she recalled , " and thinking to myself , ' How in the world did he ever fit out of that door ? ' "
The PetSafe door in the Ranfone home contained no warning to parents of the possible danger on its package or product instructions .
She was outraged to learn that many children had died under similar circumstances before her son .
" It was just unbelievable to me that all of these accidents happened as a result of doggie doors and how come I was n't informed , " she told ABC News .
The manufacturers of the PetSafe door , Radio Systems Corporation , of Knoxville , Tennessee , would not provide any executive to talk with ABC News .
In a statement , the company said its " thoughts and prayers go out to the Ranfone family , " but declined further comment , citing the ongoing litigation .
Pet Door Company Says Parents at Fault
In depositions in the Ranfone case , the company 's quality director , Steve Ogden , said , in effect , the parents must bear the responsibility for their son's death .
" We believe it is obvious that a dog door is an opening to the outside world in the same way a door that 's opened is an opening to the outside world and we consider that the parent is responsible for supervising the child from going out this obvious opening , " Ogden testified .
PetSafe does acknowledge the problem , however , on its more expensive , electronic pet door .
A remote device attached to a pet 's collar unlocks the door as the pet approaches .
The door then locks again after the pet exits .
In its marketing materials , the company touts that the electronic lock " will prevent children from leaving the home . "
" Clearly they 're aware that children interacting with doors is an issue , " said lawyer Didier .
" They 're actually trying to make money on other products by selling them as protecting children , and I think that 's talking out of both sides of your mouth . "
A spokesman for the pet business trade association said he welcomed the ABC News investigation and hoped it would lead pet door manufacturers to provide warnings in the future .
" I think that now that it 's known to be a problem , you 'll see it there , " said Bob Vetere , president of the American Pet Products Association .
" To me as a parent , if something happened to my kid I 'd be blaming myself .
But if it was a problem that I had no idea could possible occur , I 'd be thinking , gee , I wish somebody had told me about it . "
Carol Ranfone has started her own web site , Pet Access Dangers , to share Matthew 's story with other parents , and warn them of the risks involved with pet doors .
" I 'm doing it for Matthew .
It 's like in my mind , I can't save Matthew 's life , but I can save another child and if this is my goal in life and if this is my mission in life , then I 'll do it . "

Premier Gordon Campbell says the disappearance of up to five years of cabinet e-mails does not break any privacy rules .
The NDP and defence lawyers in the corruption case stemming from the raid on the B.C. legislature claim some information that may be related to the case could have been deleted .
But Campbell says the government ensures all information that must be protected under privacy rules is protected .
Two former government aides -- Dave Basi and Bobby Virk -- are accused of providing government information to a lobbying firm during negotiations to sell BC Rail .
Defence lawyer Michael Bolton says the lost e-mails could clear his client and he insists the messages could be recovered -- including some involving Premier Campbell .
Bolton claims the leaked information involving BC Rail actually came from inside cabinet because neither Basi or Virk attended meetings where crucial information about the railway would have been discussed .
Ugly Chapter in Yahoo !'s History Revisited Bill would prevent Yahoo ! , others from aiding foreign crack down on free speech .
May 8 , 2009  --
An ugly chapter in internet giant Yahoo !'s history was revisited this week with the introduction of new legislation that would prevent a repeat botch - up the company made that landed Chinese journalists in prison .
The bill would prevent companies like Yahoo ! , Google , and Microsoft from helping such governments find , convict and torture citizens for engaging in democracy promotion and human rights advocacy on the internet .
" U.S. businesses should have no role in aiding and abetting oppression around the world , " said Rep. Christopher Smith , ( R - NJ ) , a long time human rights activist in Congress , who authored the New Global Online Freedom Act ( GOFA ) .
Smith 's words are weighted with memories of journalists jailed in China with the aid of Yahoo !.
The company settled a lawsuit from two Chinese journalists in 2007 who went to jail after the company turned over details of their online activities to Chinese authorities .
The settlement came one week after a Congressional hearing scrutinized Yahoo !'s role in the jailing of former financial writer Shi Tao , who was jailed for providing state secrets to foreigners .
His conviction stemmed from an e-mail he sent containing his notes on a government circular that spelled out restrictions on the media .
In May 2007 , Shi Tao joined journalist Wang Xiaoning in suing Yahoo !
and its subsidiaries , accusing the company of " aiding and abetting " their imprisonment - and their torture .
Both journalists were serving ten year sentences in prison for using the web to promote democracy , and both were sentenced after Yahoo ! disclosed their other online data to the Chinese government .
" After meeting with the families , it was clear to me what we had to do to make this right for them , for Yahoo ! , and for the future , " former Yahoo !
CEO Jerry Yang said at the time .
Smith said this week that it is " unconscionable that American businesses , founded in the world 's leading democracy , would even consider enabling repressive governments that seek to stifle basic freedoms . "
Chinese Criminal Court Says Yahoo !
Handed Over Info to Chinese Government
The bill would require U.S. IT companies doing business in repressive countries to keep records on and notify the U.S. Attorney General of demands for personal information about Internet users .
The legislation also gives the Attorney General the authority to order IT companies not to comply if there is a reasonable likelihood that the demand is made for tracking down political or religious dissidents .
Chinese criminal courts identified Yahoo !
as having handed over information requested by the Chinese government which resulted in prison sentences for four Chinese " cyber- dissidents " .
Morton Sklar , lead counsel for the dissidents said he believes there are many more whose names did not show up in the court documents .
" We estimate there were hundreds if not thousands of internet users who were similarly affected by Yahoo ! disclosures , " said Sklar , who is also the Executive Director Emeritus of the World Organization for Human Rights USA .
In November 2007 hearings , Congressional leaders asked Yahoo ! to identify all the names of those that they had disclosed that resulted in arrests and also asked Yahoo ! to indicate whether the disclosure policy was still being followed and Yahoo !
never responded to those requests though they said they would , according to Sklar .
Yahoo !
said that a reliable estimate of the number and nature of Chinese law enforcement demands is not attainable because the underlying law enforcement demands are not within Yahoo !
Inc. 's control .
Yahoo !
transferred its mainland China operations to Alibaba.com in 2005 , and owns a minority stake in that China - based company .
" While Yahoo !
Inc. previously ascertained some limited information about Chinese law enforcement demands , we have been unable to verify this information without the necessary documents or information from Alibaba .
Our formal and informal requests for information regarding these demands have been denied by Alibaba , " the company said .
Reporters Without Borders , a non-profit first amendment advocacy group , said that China is the world 's top jailer of journalists , with 30 currently in prison and another 48 " cyber - dissidents " in detention .
Some Experts Say Global Online Freedom Act is Premature
Google and Microsoft have been criticized for agreeing to censor themselves in China .
They , along with Yahoo ! , say they have adhered to a Global Network Initiative ( GNI ) code of conduct formed to " help stakeholders in the technology industry uphold the rights of freedom of expression and privacy in the face of pressures from governments to comply with laws and policies that violate these internationally recognized human rights . "
Yahoo ! has said that the company was founded on the principle that promoting access to information can improve lives and advance human rights around the world , and it is hosting a Business and Human Rights Summit this week at its Sunnyvale , California , headquarters .
Some experts say that the GNI should continue to conduct research before a law like GOFA should be implemented .
Colin M. Maclay is the Managing Director of Harvard University 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society , an organization involved with developing the GNI principles .
He said he is worried that the problem of internet surveillance is an evolving global issue and that he fears Smith 's bill is premature .
" What we 've done with the GNI is to try to build a structure to lay the groundwork so that we will be able to pass a law .
My fear is that a law [ now ] would be precipitous , that it 's going to yield to unintended consequences , that it 's going to not have a net positive effect , " he said .
Sklar criticized the GNI principles saying that the companies took far too long to come up with broad - stroked language that has no value in practice : " It took more than two years to come up with little more than a very general statement of principles in support of internet privacy with no real content and no effective enforcement mechanism . "
Sklar added that the GNI fails to address the issue of U.S. technology exports to China being used to allow the Chinese government to monitor internet use on a broader basis .
" [ The GNI ] does n't address US support of improving monitoring capability involving the internet in foreign countries , " said Sklar .
Previous Version of Global Online Freedom Act Never Reached House Floor
Rep .
Smith agrees that the GNI does not prevent IT companies from blocking web sites , controlling search engine results , or answering secret police subpoenas for information identifying dissidents so they can be tracked down and even imprisoned .
" Though GNI was a step in the right direction , it has not changed the bottom line , " he said .
A previous version of GOFA , approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in October 2007 , did not reach the House floor .

OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ AND THE WORLD : COKE ZERO
To the Honorable Hugo Chavez , President of Venezuela
from Dr. Betty Martini , D.Hum .
Mission Possible World Health International
9270 River Club Parkway
Duluth , Georgia 30097
Telephone : 770-242-2599
E- Mail : < mailto:BettyM19@mindspring.com >BettyM19@mindspring.com
Dear President Chavez :
One editor 's note was that the FDA themselves listed 92 documented symptoms of aspartame from four types of seizures to coma and death .
We have it on web .
Also , this toxin damages the mitochondria so it interacts with drugs and vaccines .
Here in the US they even add aspartame to the very drugs used to treat the problems it causes .
To make matters worse aspartame is blended with acesulfame potassium which caused cancer and leukemia in original studies .
I read the pathetic rebuttal by Coke that the ingredients were safe .
They seem to have forgotten the protest of the National Soft Drink Association , now American Beverage , against aspartame :
< http://www.mpwhi.com/open_letter_dick_adamson.htm>http://www.mpwhi.com/open_letter_dick_adamson.htm
Coke and Pepsi were the two top members .
Some people think politics underlined the decision , but no one would have guessed cyclamates because its not labeled on the container .
Indeed , if it was found by analysis its another grievance against industry for adding ingredients that are not labeled .
The public is entitled to know what they are consuming .
Cyclamates was banned because of cancer .
So if the concern is cancer then you definitely do n't want aspartame in your country .
The molecule even breaks down to diketopiperazine , a brain tumor agent that triggered brain tumors in original studies .
Note what the FDA toxicologist told Congress :
Dr. Adrian Gross , FDA toxicologist who asked that Searle be indicted for fraud told Congress at least one of Searle 's studies " has established beyond ANY REASONABLE DOUBT that aspartame is capable of inducing brain tumors in experimental animals and that this predisposition of it is of extremely high significance .
...
In view of these indications that the cancer causing potential of aspartame is a matter that had been established WAY BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT , one can ask :
What is the reason for the apparent refusal by the FDA to invoke for this food additive the so - called Delaney Amendment to the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act ? "
The Delaney Amendment makes it illegal to allow any residues of cancer causing chemicals in foods .
In his concluding testimony Gross asked , " Given the cancer causing potential of aspartame how would the FDA justify its position that it views a certain amount of aspartame as constituting an allowable daily intake or ' safe ' level of it ?
Is that position in effect not equivalent to setting a ' tolerance ' for this food additive and thus a violation of that law ?
And if the FDA itself elects to violate the law , who is left to protect the health of the public ? "
Congressional Record SID835:131 ( August 1 , l985 )
The cancer issue was known early on by the FDA and the Bressler Report , FDA audit , discussed the fraud , like excising brain tumors from rats , putting them back in the study , and then resurrecting them on paper when they died .
They were filtering out neoplasms and anything else they did n't want the FDA to know about .
Unfortunately both US Prosecutors Sam Skinner and William Conlon hired on with the defense team and the statute of limitations expired .
Then the FDA Board of Inquiry revoked the petition for aspartame .
This is when Don Rumsfeld stepped in who was CEO of Searle at the time , and said he would call in his markers and get aspartame approved anyway .

A portfolio of more than 2,600 Internet domain names was almost auctioned off at the Fairmont on Nob Hill in San Francisco on Thursday .
But at the last minute , the buyers held back .
The few who showed up felt more comfortable negotiating in private - removing the sale from public view and scuttling what would have been one of the first - and probably classiest - live auctions of domain names in the history of the Internet .
" I still believe domain names are going to be the next Internet gold rush , " said Scott King , executive vice president of sales for J.P. King Auction Co. , the 94 - year - old luxury auction house in Gadsden , Ala. , that handled the sale .
J.P. King usually sells yachts and high - end real estate from the physical world and viewed this auction as an experiment .
" The average American has just not thought about domain names yet , " King said .
Sales of domain names are booming , according to Adam Dicker , a vice president at GoDaddy.com , because more people want to establish their presence on the Web .
GoDaddy.com is conducting 2 million online auctions for names .
Some names fetch good prices - auction.com sold recently for $ 1.7 million .
But live auctions of Internet domain names are still rare , especially for more specialized ones .
In this case , they were real estate domain names .
The names that were for sale Thursday belong to Craig Harrison , an entrepreneur from Fort Collins , Colo. , who has been carefully collecting them for 10 years .
Many end in realestatelistings.com , and are interlinked , representing states , cities and suburbs in the United States and abroad .
Harrison wanted a live auction to attract upscale buyers and picked San Francisco for its proximity to Silicon Valley , Los Angeles and Seattle .
He said he bought the first 500 or so names in December 1999 , after his son , Craig Harrison Jr. , then a college student , told him domain names would one day be valuable .
Names had just been allowed to be more than 60 characters long , and there was a rush to buy them .
" I had to have the courage to keep spending the money , " said Harrison , who remembers sitting at his computer for four days and using three or four credit cards .
He spent about $ 35,000 .
Interest in Thursday 's auction was high , according to both Harrison and King .
In the days leading up to the auction , the Web site got 5,000 hits , and J.P. King had e-mails and calls from interested buyers .
But the event fizzled .
Perhaps the names were n't as valuable as they seemed .
" Had we had premium names , like toys.com , there would have been an auction , " King said as waiters in the Fairmont cleared trays piled with sandwiches from the empty room .
Or perhaps the recovery of the real estate market is n't as close as Harrison thought .
On Thursday afternoon he had four buyers interested in joint ventures - which he can't auction - he said , but no one willing to take the risk and buy the names on their own .
Iran has clamped down on foreign media , effectively confining reporters to their offices as the country braces for more anti-government demonstrations .
Press cards have been invalidated , and foreign reporters have been informed they cannot cover " unauthorized " demonstrations , forcing news agencies to use screen grabs from government television .
A BBC correspondent says these are the " most sweeping restrictions " on reporting that he has ever encountered .
Covering Iran is n't easy .
The authorities have tried to block both citizen journalists and mainstream media outlets from relaying words and images from the opposition demonstrations .
Just getting a visa to report from Iran is a major hassle :
It took me three tries before I finally got permission for a short reporting trip in February 2007 .
So is this the moment when citizen journalism will show its real potential , and put the bad ol ' MSM to shame ?
After all , social media like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube have become one of the primary ways for circumventing the government 's information blockade .
Here 's video of a protest in Shiraz , posted on YouTube :
Many smart observers have complained of less - than - stellar coverage by mainstream outlets .
Over the weekend , the Twitterati slammed CNN for offering a menu of infotainment while massive election protests unfolded in Iran .
( My favorite poke at CNN , from user NordicClick : " While Twitter provided updates to the world , Larry King gave us Jeff Foxworthy . " )
And New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller got a fair amount of flak for parachuting into Tehran – and writing a rather tepid news analysis that was quickly overtaken by events .
( A New York Times spokeswoman explained that Keller “ had long wanted to visit Iran and the occasion of the election seemed like a great time to do so , accompanying our reporter , Robert Worth .
Bill had not planned to write articles but when the story got so big , he did so . ”
Umm , better not mention that expenses - paid jaunt to the angry worker bees of the Boston Globe ! )
It 's fun to bash traditional media for their cluelessness .
The reality , however , is a bit more complex .
CNN , perhaps shamed into action by the Twitter critics , has now stepped up its coverage .
The New York Times is throwing a lot of resources into the story , and The Lede blog has been posting a steady stream of updates .
Even if Iran ’s government bans members of the foreign press from covering rallies in Tehran , it 's a fair guess that reporters will find a way to get out there .
As we learned last year during the war between Georgia and Russia , the world of new media often failed to deliver on its promises , and citizen journalists often merely amplified local propaganda rather than delivering facts .
The sheer volume of information coming out of Iran , however , is something entirely new and remarkable :
It 's created a tremendous mosaic of coverage that has actually complemented traditional news reports .
ALSO :
Pay claims were first made by female cleaners , dinner ladies and caretakers A " landmark " legal decision involving three councils in the north east of England could pave the way for 12,000 men to take forward equal pay claims .
Financial settlements had earlier been agreed for women workers paid less than men doing similar work .
The Employment Appeal Tribunal has now ruled that 300 other male workers were discriminated against as they then remained on lower pay than the women .
The councils involved were Hartlepool , Middlesbrough and South Tyneside .
The men , who were working in jobs such as care assistants , caretakers , drivers and leisure attendants , had lodged discrimination claims about bonuses paid to male workers in better paid jobs such as gardeners and refuse collectors .
This was at the same time as women in low paid jobs , who were also claiming that the bonuses were discriminatory .
' Piggy back '
Whilst the women 's case succeeded and they were offered financial settlements , the men were not .
This left them in a worse financial situation than the women , as well as the better - paid men .
The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that the 300 men should have been offered the same back pay as the women .
These claims are sometimes called piggy back claims as the men " piggy back " on the successful women 's claims .
Mr Justice Underhill said : " It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if the [ Equal Pay ]
Act offered no remedy to men in a situation like the present .
" The case where men and women do the same job but receive different rates of pay is the paradigm of the kind of situation which the Act was intended to prevent , how would it seem if the roles were reversed and the ' piggyback ' claimants were not men but women ? "
Lawyers involved , from the Cloister Chambers , have described it as a landmark ruling which will have a bearing on many other cases , and could cost councils hundreds of millions of pounds .
Yvette Genn from Cloisters said : " This ruling is what thousands of male workers who have not received equal pay up and down the country have been waiting for .
" There is no doubt that many of the similar 12,000 cases in the system will now proceed and are likely to be successful . "

Introduction
Loadable kernel modules ( LKMs ) are quite popular on most modern operating systems such as GNU / Linux , FreeBSD and of course Microsoft Windows , just to name a few .
They offer you the possibility to extend the kernel 's functionality at runtime without recompiling or even rebooting the system .
For example nearly every Linux device driver is available - or can be made available - as a loadable kernel module , that can be loaded at runtime to get support for a particular device ( or even a pseudo - device ) .
With NetBSD , LKMs are not that popular yet .
At the time of this writing only a few drivers are available as loadable modules ( mostly filesystem and compat drivers , and a few others such as the linuxrtc emulation ) .
This might change in near future .
The loadable kernel module interface was originally designed to be similar in functionality to the loadable kernel modules facility provided by SunOS .
The lkm ( 4 ) facility is controlled by performing ioctl ( 2 ) calls on the / dev/lkm device , but since all operations are handled by the modload ( 8 ) , modunload ( 8 ) and modstat ( 8 ) programs , you should never have to interact with / dev/lkm directly .
Note , that you need to run a kernel compiled with the LKM option in order to make use of LKMs .
Writing the module
I 'd like to show you how to write a simple character device driver that does nothing but the simple job of calculating the FIBONACCI numbers ( I 'll therefore name the module fibo . o and let all the function 's names begin with fibo_ ) .
The driver will provide 8 minor devices / dev/fibo0 to / dev/fibo7 .
Each minor device offers the following functions :
static int fibo_open ( dev_t , int , int , struct proc *) ; static int fibo_close ( dev_t , int , int , struct proc *) ; static int fibo_read ( dev_t dev , struct uio * , int ) ;
You can open and close a device provided by this driver and you 'll be able to read from it ( we 'll have a closer look at the parameters later , when we discuss the actual functions ) .
Now we need to tell the kernel that we provide a character device with the 3 functions listed above .
Therefore we need to fill in a struct cdevsw ( cdevsw means character device switch and the struct cdevsw is defined in sys / conf.h ) .
static struct cdevsw fibo_dev = { fibo_open , fibo_close , fibo_read , ( dev_type_write ( ( * ) ) ) enodev , ( dev_type_ioctl ( (* ) ) ) enodev , ( dev_type_stop ( (* ) ) ) enodev , 0 , ( dev_type_poll ( (* ) ) ) enodev , ( dev_type_mmap ( (* ) ) ) enodev , 0 } ;
enodev is a generic function that simply returns the errno( 2 ) ENODEV ( Operation not supported by device ) which says that we does not support any operations besides open , close and read .
So , for example , whenever you try to write to the device , the write ( 2 ) will fail with ENODEV .
Furtheron we need to tell the kernel how the module is named and where to find information about operations provided by the module .
This is a quite simple task with the lkm interface : we use the preprocessor macro MOD_DEV , which is defined in sys / lkm.h to hand the information over .
The MOD_DEV macro was changed in NetBSD - current , therefore we use the following construct to get things working with both NetBSD 1.6 and earlier and NetBSD 1.6H and later ( thanks to Anil Gopinath for the hint ) .
# if ( __NetBSD_Version__ >= 106080000 ) MOD_DEV ( " fibo " , " fibo " , NULL , - 1 , &fibo_dev , - 1 ) ; #else MOD_DEV ( " fibo " , LM_DT_CHAR , - 1 , & fibo_dev ) ; #endif
This means that our module is named fibo , we 'll provide a character device ( minor devices are handled by the module itself , so they does n't matter for now ) , we want to retrieve a dynamic major device number from the kernel ( if you want to use a specific major device number you 'll need to specify that instead of the - 1 , but beware of getting in conflict with other device drivers ) and we provide the information about the supported operations in fibo_dev .
In order to ensure proper unloading of the module we need to keep a global reference counter of opened minor devices .
static int fibo_refcnt = 0 ;
And furtheron we need to keep a bunch of information about each minor device .
struct fibo_softc { int sc_refcnt ; u_int32_t sc_current ; u_int32_t sc_previous ; } ; #define MAXFIBODEVS 8 static struct fibo_softc fibo_scs [ MAXFIBODEVS ] ;
As mentioned above our driver will provide 8 minor devices .
Each minor device stores information about how often it was opened ( in our example each minor device can only be opened once because of simplicity ) , the current number and the previous number for calculating the FIBONACCI numbers .
If you do n't know how to calculate the FIBONACCI numbers , you should have a look on a book about algorithms , as explaining this is beyond the scope of this article .
Each kernel module needs to have an entry point which is passed to ld( 1 ) by modload when the module is linked .
The default module entry point is named xxxinit .
If xxxinit can not be found , an attempt to use modulename_lkmentry will be made , where modulename is the filename of the module being loaded without the .o .
In general the entry function will consist entirely of a single DISPATCH line , with DISPATCH being a preprocessor macro defined in sys / lkm.h to handle loading , unloading and stating for us .
So our fibo_lkmentry function will look like this :
int fibo_lkmentry ( struct lkm_table * lkmtp , int cmd , nt ver ) { DISPATCH ( lkmtp , cmd , ver , fibo_handle , fibo_handle , fibo_handle ) ; }
Now we need a handler function for our module to do module specific tasks when loading , unloading or stating the module .
The name of this handler function is passed to DISPATCH ( see above ) to tell the kernel which function it has to call when doing such things .
A pointer to the module entry in the LKM table and an integer representing the desired command ( LKM_E_LOAD , LKM_E_UNLOAD or LKM_E_STAT ) are passed to the handler function .
The handler is called after the module is linked and loaded into the kernel with the LKM_E_LOAD command .
Then we need to check whether the module was already loaded into the kernel and initialize our data structures .
When unloading the module , the handler is called with the LKM_E_UNLOAD command and we need to check if the module is not required any more ( e.g. check if all devices are closed for char / block driver modules ) before confirming the unload command .
static int fibo_handle ( struct lkm_table * lkmtp , int cmd ) { switch ( cmd ) { case LKM_E_LOAD : /* check if module was already loaded */ if ( lkmexists ( lkmtp ) ) return ( EEXIST ) ; /* initialize minor device structures */ bzero( fibo_scs , sizeof ( fibo_scs ) ) ; printf ( " fibo : FIBONACCI driver loaded successfully
" ) ; break ; case LKM_E_UNLOAD : /* check if a minor device is opened */ if ( fibo_refcnt > 0 ) return ( EBUSY ) ; break ; case LKM_E_STAT : break ; default : return ( EIO ) ; } return ( 0 ) ; }
The open function is quite simple as most of the hard stuff is already handled by the NetBSD kernel ( e.g. the kernel will automatically allocate a vnode ( 9 ) for you ) .
The parameters for the open function are the major and minor device numbers ( use the major and minor macros ) , the flag and mode arguments as described in open ( 2 ) and a pointer to the struct proc of the process that did the open system call .
So the first thing to do is to check if the minor device number we got when the device was opened is not out of range , and if the minor device is not already opened .
You should always keep in mind that the minor device handling is completely up to you and that this is a never ending source of mistakes !
Then we need to initialize the minor device data ( the FIBONACCI starting numbers : = 1 , 0 + 1 = 1 , 1 + 1 = 2 , 1 + 2 = 3 , ... ) and increase the minor device and the global module reference counter .
static int fibo_open ( dev_t dev , int flag , int mode , struct proc * p ) { struct fibo_softc * fibosc = ( fibo_scs + minor ( dev ) ) ; if ( minor ( dev ) >= MAXFIBODEVS ) return ( ENODEV ) ; /* check if device already open */ if ( fibosc -> sc_refcnt > 0 ) return ( EBUSY ) ; fibosc -> sc_current = 1 ; fibosc ->sc_previous = 0 ; /* increase device reference counter */ fibosc-> sc_refcnt ++ ; /* increase module reference counter */ fibo_refcnt ++ ; return ( 0 ) ; }
The close function has the same parameters with the same meanings as the open function described above .
It is used to free the internal data structures of a minor device opened before .
You do not need to worry whether the device was opened before or to do things like releasing the vnode associated with the device , all you need to do is to cleanup the module specific stuff .
In our example this means decreasing the minor device and the global module reference counters and so that our close function is quite simple .
static int fibo_close ( dev_t dev , int flag , int mode , struct proc * p ) { struct fibo_softc * fibosc = ( fibo_scs + minor ( dev ) ) ; /* decrease device reference counter */ fibosc-> sc_refcnt--; /* decrease module reference counter */ fibo_refcnt --; return ( 0 ) ; }
Last but not least the read function .
This function has 3 parameters : the device major and minor numbers like in the open and close functions , a flag field indicating for example whether the read should be done in a non-blocking fashion or such things and a pointer to a struct uio defined by sys / uio.h .
A struct uio typically describes data in motion , in case of a read ( 2 ) system call data moved from kernel - space to user - space .
This may look a bit strange if you have already done device driver progamming on GNU / Linux , but the uio concept used by the NetBSD kernel simplifies a lot of things and provides a generic and consistent interface for kernel - space to user - space and kernel - space to kernel - space data moving .
See uiomove ( 9 ) for more information .
Back on stage , we should first have a look at the read function and discuss the details afterwards .
static int fibo_read ( dev_t dev , struct uio * uio , int flag ) { struct fibo_softc * fibosc = ( fibo_scs + minor ( dev ) ) ; if ( uio -> uio_resid < sizeof ( u_int32_t ) ) return ( EINVAL ) ; while ( uio->uio_resid >= sizeof ( u_int32_t ) ) { int error ; /* copy to user space */ if ( ( error = uiomove ( &( fibosc - > sc_current ) , sizeof ( fibosc - > sc_current ) , uio ) ) ) { return ( error ) ; } /* prevent overflow */ if ( fibosc -> sc_current > ( MAXFIBONUM - 1 ) ) { fibosc -> sc_current = 1 ; fibosc -> sc_previous = 0 ; continue ; } /* calculate */ { u_int32_t tmp ; tmp = fibosc -> sc_current ; fibosc -> sc_current += fibosc -> sc_previous ; fibosc -> sc_previous = tmp ; } } return ( 0 ) ; }
So the first thing we do , is to check whether the process requests less than size of ( u_int32 _t ) bytes ( actually 4 bytes ) .
Our read function always reads a bunch of 4 - byte blocks and to keep it simple and easy to understand we disallow reading less than 4 bytes at a time ( uio -> uio_resid holds the number of remaining bytes to move to user - space , automatically decreased by uiomove ) .
The function copies the current FIBONACCI number into the user - space buffer , checks for a possible overflow ( only the first 42 FIBONACCI numbers fit into u_int32_t ) and calculates the next FIBONACCI number .
If there is enough space left in the user - space buffer , the function loops and restarts the process of moving , checking and calculating until the buffer is filled up to the possible maximum or uiomove ( 9 ) returns an error .
Note , that a read ( 2 ) system call on this device will never return 0 , and so it will never reach an end - of - file ( EOF ) , so the device will generate FIBONACCI numbers forever .
If you 're familar with GNU / Linux device driver programming you might have noticed that we do not return - ERRNO on failure , and in case of the read system call the number of bytes read , but instead we return 0 on success and the positive errno value on failure .
Everything else is handled by the NetBSD kernel itself , so we do not need to care about .
Loading the module
Now that our device driver module is completed , we need a shell script that will be executed when the module is successfully loaded to create the required device nodes in / dev .
This shell script ( or program ) is always passed three arguments : the module id ( in decimal ) , the module type ( in hexadecimal ) and the character major device number ( this differs for other types of LKMs such as system call modules ) .
So our script is pretty simple :
if [ $ # - ne 3 ] ; then echo " $ 0 should only be called from modload ( 8 ) with 3 args " exit 1 fi
First check whether all three command line arguments are present and exit with error code if not .
for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ; do rm -f / dev / fibo$i mknod / dev / fibo$i c $ 3 $ i chmod 666 / dev / fibo$i done exit 0
And finally ( re ) create the required special device nodes .
Now we are ready to give our module a first test run .
Compile the module and load the module with the following command ( this needs to be run as superuser ) :
modload -e fibo_lkmentry - p fibo_post.sh fibo.o
If everything went well , the modstat ( 8 ) program should present you output similar to this :
Type Id Off Loadaddr Size Info Rev Module Name DEV 0 29 dca4f000 0004 dca4f260 1 fibo
Testing the module
In order to test your new kernel module , we need a small test program that does nothing more than reading a 32 bit unsigned integer value from / dev/ fibo0 and outputs the value to standard output .
See the sample program below :
# define DEVICE " / dev/fibo0 " int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { u_int32_t val ; int fd , ret ; if ( ( fd = open ( DEVICE , O_RDONLY ) ) < 0 ) err ( 1 , " unable to open " DEVICE ) ; while ( ( ret = read ( fd , &val , sizeof ( val ) ) ) == sizeof ( val ) ) printf ( " %u
" , val ) ; if ( ret < 0 ) err ( 2 , " read ( " DEVICE " ) " ) ; close ( fd ) ; return 0 ; }
When you run this sample test program , it will output FIBONACCI numbers below 2971215074 until you interrupt or kill the program .
To unload the kernel module , you need to run the following command ( as superuser ) :
modunload -n fibo
Ken Lewis , the CEO of Bank of America , is in trouble -- a stock collapse ; a rocky merger ; the worst fourth - quarter losses in at least 17 years ; a stockholder revolt ; an urgent need to raise more capital despite a $ 45 billion infusion from the federal government ; and on top of that , he effectively has a new boss , President Barack Obama .

In Breaking the Bank , FRONTLINE producer Michael Kirk ( Inside the Meltdown , Bush 's War ) draws on a rare combination of high - profile interviews with key players Ken Lewis and former Merrill Lynch CEO John
Thain to reveal the story of two banks at the heart of the financial crisis , the rocky merger , and the government 's new role in taking over -- some call it " nationalizing " -- the American banking system .
It all began on that fateful weekend in September 2008 when the American economy was on the verge of melting down .
Then -Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson , his former protégé John Thain , and Ken Lewis , one of the most powerful bankers in the country , secretly cut a deal to merge Bank of America and Merrill Lynch .
The merger of the nation 's largest bank and Merrill Lynch was supposed to help save the American financial system by preventing the imminent Lehman Brothers bankruptcy from setting off a destructive chain reaction .
But it became immediately clear that it had not worked .
Within days , the entire global financial system was collapsing .
In Washington , Secretary Paulson was determined to spend billions of government dollars to prevent the American banking system from dragging the country into a depression .
That October , Lewis ,
Thain and other top bank CEOs found themselves at an emergency meeting at the Treasury Department .
Paulson told the group they had no choice but to accept $ 125 billion of capital from American taxpayers in order to save the financial system .
Initially , Bank of America 's CEO Lewis was supportive of the plan .
" We are so intertwined with the U.S. that it's hard to separate what 's good for the United States and what 's good for Bank of America , " Lewis tells FRONTLINE .
But some observers now say that Paulson 's injection of public capital was the beginning of unprecedented government involvement in the nation 's banking system , with consequences few understood .
" I think we nationalized the banks in the U.S. on that day , " former International Monetary Fund chief economist Simon Johnson says .
" The government got a lot of say in how they are run , a lot of constraints , a lot of responsibility .
A lot of downside risk was taken on that day . "
By December , Lewis was discovering what it meant to have the government as a partial owner .
When fourth - quarter losses at Merrill grew to $ 15 billion , Lewis began to look for a way to get out of the deal .
But in tense negotiations with government officials , Lewis was told he had no choice .
If he did not go through with the merger , regulators threatened to change the bank 's management .
" Ken Lewis blinked , the full force of the government is being brought upon him .
The rules of the game have changed , " Wall Street Journal reporter Dan Fitzpatrick says .
" Ken Lewis is on top of the financial services world , but he 's not in charge .
The government holds all the cards at the end of the day . "
FRONTLINE 's Breaking the Bank tells the story of Lewis ' struggle to survive in this new financial order , where public outrage and government edicts are now as important to banking as shareholders and deposits .
With his bank on the brink , Lewis now finds himself the subject of a shareholder revolt , congressional indignation , presidential pressure and the increasingly conflicting demands of private investors and government officials .
" This is more than a story about just one man or one bank , " says producer Michael Kirk .
" This is the story of the most important change in the relationship between government and private business in a generation . "
The most pressing task facing all countries in the world today is to restore global economic growth as soon as possible .
Yet it is worrisome to note that the surge of trade protectionism has made the prospects of the already fragile world economy even worse .
China and the European Union , two major economies and stakeholders in the world , should take a responsible attitude and demonstrate their common , clear commitment against trade protectionism at the second China - E.U. high - level economic dialogue .
Trade liberalization is the engine of economic growth .
It has served as a strong propeller of economic globalization and benefited people around the world .
On the contrary , trade protectionism — featuring the pursuit of benefits for one country at the expense of others — will only lead to retaliation .
It serves the interest of no one .
The world economy paid a heavy price for the prevalence of trade protectionism during the Great Depression in the 1930s , which led to the contraction of global trade by two thirds .
We should make sure that the same mistake is not repeated .
Most medical experts in fitness and physiology advocate a more varied regime but concede that weight training has become more medically accepted in the last 15 years .
They reject the notion of discarding cardio workouts entirely .
The latest , shorter regimes rely on the basic principle of replacing fat with muscle because muscles burn calories at rest , and fat does not .
'' Muscles are like an investment in the bank , earning you money , '' Mr. Cruise said .
'' Fat is like a job you go to and once you leave , it stops paying .
Once you get off that treadmill , you stop burning calories , whereas muscle keeps burning all day long . ''
Mr. Cruise 's workout can be done at home , using free weights .
Jim Karas , who is Diane Sawyer 's trainer and the author of '' Flip the Switch : Discover the Weight - Loss Solution and the Secret of Getting Started '' ( Harmony Books , 2002 ) , trains his clients with inflated rubber balls , free weights and resistance bands .
He prescribes two to three sessions of 20 minutes each a week , with five minutes of cardio to warm up .
Mr. Zickerman and Fredrick Hahn , the author of '' The Slow Burn Fitness Revolution : The Slow Motion Exercise That Will Change Your Body in 30 Minutes a Week '' ( Broadway Books , 2002 ) , subscribe to the slow - motion school of lifting , which is performed , ideally , on customized weight training machines , though their books tell how to do the workouts at home .
The Hahn workouts consist of six or seven exercises performed for three minutes each .
'' By moving heavy weights at a slow pace , you eliminate any momentum that might help get the weights up faster and make it easier on the muscle , '' said Mr. Hahn , who owns Serious Strength , a gym on the Upper West Side .

Cleveland failed to advance to the NBA Finals , losing to Orlando , 4 - 2 .
The Magic , on paper , have a stronger team .
If you lined up all the players for The Cavs and Magic up at a playground and had Van Gundy and Brown pick teams for a game , the results would prove which team had superior talent .
Obviously Mike Brown would pick Lebron first .
Van Gundy would probably take Dwight Howard second .
The next three picks would all be Magic players too .
Lebron James tried to be a one man gang when he had to .
Unfortunately for Cavs fans , Delonte
West could n’t hit an outside shot the whole series .
Mo Williams was n’t the guy Cavs fans fell in love with this year .
Zydrunas Ilgauskas looked tired and old .
Anderson Varajeo and Ben Wallace should never be looked at as offensive threats .
All during the regular season , teams would do their best to take the lane away from Lebron forcing him to kick the ball out to a wide open Williams or West who made teams pay .
The single biggest malfunction in the Orlando series was that nobody was able to shoot from the outside with wide open , or at least , great looks .
These are shots your perimeter players have to make , and no one stepped up .
Not Wally , not Sasha , not Delonte and not Mo .
With that being said , the Cavs could only take away the three - pointer to leave Dwight Howard open , or doubleteam Howard and get their eyes knocked out from three .
Let Rafer Alston shoot the threes .
Rafer Alston owned us and outplayed anyone in Cleveland ’s backcourt every game .
People are pointing fingers at Mike Brown , the 2009 NBA Coach of The Year .
I do n’t see how he can blamed for riding the horse that got him there .
The mismatches and lack of a second scorer killed the Cavs , and what could Brown do ?
Too many weapons , too many ways , and not enough responses .
Was Lebron a bad sport ?
Go through life winning everything everytime you play .
Have a season like Cleveland did , losing only 20 games all year , but six to Orlando .
The competitor in him has n’t had much practice at losing when he was supposed to win , so he was ultra - frustrated and disappointed with the results .
He made good yesterday by talking to the media , congratulating Orlando , and wearing a Yankees hat , bringing me to the next item .
Is Lebron leaving ?
No .
The Cavs are going to offer him an extension this summer which he will sign .
Before he signs , look for changes .
Remember , Lebron kind of handpicked Mike Brown , most of his teammates , and the city is in love with the guy .
The Cavs can also offer him an extra year that no one else can because he is currently plaing for them .
What needs to happen ?
Nice knowing you Zydrunas and Ben , time to move on .
Ilgauskas drives me nuts .
When you are over 7′ , hit the boards on offense instead of waiting outside the arc to shoot a three .
Ben Wallace was the scrappiest rebounder in the league a few years ago and was never a threat to score anywhere he played .
However , he is not the same as he was when he played for Detroit .
He would get 20 rebounds in a big game , no questions asked .
Having both he and Anderson Varajeo on the court makes the Cavs better defensively , but cripples the offense .
The Cavs need to get that # 2 guy , whoever he is .
Someone who can light it up on offense to take the burden away from Delonte and Mo. Lebron ’s gonna get his , no matter what .
I did a story about why the Cavs would do better against Boston than they would against Orlando , I feel vindicated for writing it , but wish I could tell you how wrong I was .
I might have lost my cool a bit in the the " P.S. " to the " What 's a ' Fast Lens ' ? " post below .
I apologize for that .
My problem is that I 've been sensitized .
I was the editor of a technical photography magazine for six years .
Depth - of - field ( DoF ) is a subject that is deeply beloved of wannabe photo - tech writers , and few things could create instantaneous dismay deep in my editor 's heart like opening a submission and finding yet another beautifully prepared , extensive , arcane article on DoF .
DoF is perhaps the ultimate hell of photo - tech — graspable enough so many people think they can understand it ( or think they should ! ) , complex enough so that very few really can .
Whenever the subject really gets going , great reams of material are spewed forth " explaining " it , always — always — strewn with considerable content that happens not to be true .
Assuming any given reader engages with said great mass of verbal matter , he comes out the other side usually no more enlightened , and possibly considerably more confused .
Finally , add to those conditions the simple fact that a technical understanding of DoF is not required for the successful practice of photography , and you begin to appreciate the extent of my exasperation with the subject .
( By the way , the other day I finally figured out why " grammar police " types can seem to be so fussy and cross .
It 's because they keep correcting the World , and the World keeps making the same mistakes anyway .
If you tell your child three times to hang up the wet towel in the bathroom and he does n't , you 're not that irritated .
When you 've told him 700 times and you still come into the bathroom and find the damp towel in a moldy pile on the counter , you might well be incensed .
So do you see my point ?
No matter how many times I remind people that " loose " is the opposite of " tight " and " lose " is the opposite of " win , " people are still going to misspell it — because it 's different people all the time , and there are an inexhaustible supply of them .
It 's like having 40,000 children , each one of whom needs to be trained to hang up the towel .
The first three people I correct , I 'm perfectly calm .
By the 700th , I 'm about to " loose " my mind .
Anyway , you see the problem : educate one photographer about DoF , or ten , or a hundred — at however great a cost of time and effort — and you still have numberless millions to go .
It 's Sisyphean . )
In any event , I 've just added more material to the end of the original post .
Ctein chimed in .
It 's now longer .
And hopefully a bit more clear .
But it 's beginning to flirt with becoming yet another of those great masses of verbal matter on DoF with which the literature of photography , and now the internet , is littered .
End-around
Anyway , I figured I might try to do a quick , painless end - around on the subject , and try to tell you what actually matters about DoF .
I 'm going to ignore the technical explanation : because That Way Lie Dragons ; Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter there ; etc .
I 'm doing that on purpose , so please do n't write to fill me in .
1 . By far — by far — the most important factor in how much DoF you 'll get is your distance setting .
The farther the distance between the lens and whatever it 's focused on , the more you 'll get in the DoF .
2 . Next most important : the focal length of the lens relative to the size of the film / sensor .
Again , on principle , let 's forget all the tech - talk about what 's " really " going on and the scientific explanations and all that .
All you need to remember is that the longer the lens , the less apparent DoF there will be in your shots .
And , big jumps matter , little ones not so much ; there 's not that much difference between an 85 mm and a 100 mm , or between a 24 mm and a 20 mm .
Very roughly speaking , when there 's a 2 x or 1/2 x difference in focal length , you 're going to have noticeably different DoF characteristics to learn .
3. Last : aperture setting .
When I was teaching , all my kids had to memorize the following phrase : " The higher the number the smaller the hole the greater the depth of field . "
Can you see differences ?
Of course .
But again , it takes relatively bigger jumps to really matter all that much .
The other two factors matter more .
Quick 'n'dirty
Photography is a visual medium , so let 's take a look at a couple of examples of point 1 , above .
I 'm saying that your distance setting is the biggest determinant of DoF .
Take a look at these two shots :
28 mm lens on 24x36 mm , ƒ/5.6
Same camera , same lens , same focus distance setting , ƒ/2.8
In both of the above examples , I 've focused on the tree trunk in the middle of the frame .
I was standing about thirty feet away from it .
There are some differences in the two pictures , mainly because most lenses are at their crappiest wide open and this lens is a fairly crappy little lens , so the lower picture looks a little worse .
And the much closer branch - tips in the upper right are a little crisper in the ƒ /5.6 shot .
But when your distance setting is 30 feet with a 28 mm lens , the aperture is n't going to have very much effect on apparent DoF .
No matter what the maximum aperture of the lens , you 're going to have a hard time getting anything out of focus with this focal length lens at this distance setting .
Now look at the same two - aperture difference at a much closer distance setting , wider aperture first this time :
In this case , you can actually see a little difference in the blur , because you actually have some blur .
In both of these , the focus was placed on the flower in the middle of the foreground , at the bottom of the frame .
( I should have been a little more careful with exposure and framing .
Sorry .
Then again , if I made everything perfect , I 'd never get anything done . )
Now , obviously , there 's some difference here .
There should be : the aperture has been stopped down two stops .
The flower is indeed a bit more " isolated " in the top , wide - open shot , and the blurry parts are indeed a bit blurrier .
But just look back and forth between the house details at the top of the frame .
There 's some difference , all right .... but it 's not that much difference .
So in the top pair , you 'd have a hard time opening up the aperture enough to introduce any blur ; in the bottom shot , you 'd have a hard time stopping down enough to eliminate all the blur .
The point is that the top shot is pretty much going to have no blur , and the bottom shot is going to have some blur , with this camera and lens .
And that 's because of focus distance , mainly .
In any case , where DoF is concerned , do n't sweat the small changes too much — whether this or that sensor is slightly larger or slightly smaller , whether this or that lens is ƒ/1.7 or ƒ/2.4 , whether you 're focused at 10 feet or 12 feet .
When learning to manage sharpness and blur , it 's the big swings that make more noticeable differences .
Hope this helps .
But if it 's just more verbiage added on to the great whacking pile of internet blather about DoF for you , well ... at least you 've got my sympathies !

Featured Comment by FS : " I am surprised that nobody has referred so far to this little gem : The Ins and Outs of Focus by H. M. Merklinger ( Warning : PDF download ) :
" This is about infinity focus versus using DOF scales .
The idea ist to focus on infinity , and then stop down so that the actual opening of the aperture is about the same size as the smallest object to b resolved . "
Mike replies : I was looking all over for a current source for Harold 's book yesterday , and was stymied .
I had no idea the entire book was a free PDF download .
Thanks !
Harold 's methods are a bit quirky , but his two books are a fine brief introduction to the understanding of focus and DoF .
But where is “ there , ” and what does it look like ?
“ There ” is nowadays likely to be increasingly large , powerful , energy - intensive , always - on and essentially out - of - sight data centers .
These centers run enormously scaled software applications with millions of users .
To appreciate the scope of this phenomenon , and its crushing demands on storage capacity , let me sketch just the iceberg ’s tip of one average individual digital presence : my own .
I have photos on Flickr ( which is owned by Yahoo , so they reside in a Yahoo data center , probably the one in Wenatchee , Wash . ) ; the Wikipedia entry about me dwells on a database in Tampa , Fla . ; the video on YouTube of a talk I delivered at Google ’s headquarters might dwell in any one of Google ’s data centers , from The Dalles in Oregon to Lenoir , N.C. ; my Linked In profile most likely sits in an Equinix - run data center in Elk Grove Village , Ill . ; and my blog lives at Modwest ’s headquarters in Missoula , Mont .
If one of these sites happened to be down , I might have Twittered a complaint , my tweet paying a virtual visit to ( most likely ) NTT America ’s data center in Sterling , Va .
And in each of these cases , there would be at least one mirror data center somewhere else — the built - environment equivalent of an external hard drive , backing things up .
Small wonder that this vast , dispersed network of interdependent data systems has lately come to be referred to by an appropriately atmospheric — and vaporous — metaphor : the cloud .
Trying to chart the cloud ’s geography can be daunting , a task that is further complicated by security concerns .
“ It ’s like ‘ Fight Club , ’ ” says Rich Miller , whose Web site , Data Center Knowledge , tracks the industry .
“ The first rule of data centers is : Do n’t talk about data centers . ”
Yet as data centers increasingly become the nerve centers of business and society — even the storehouses of our fleeting cultural memory ( that dancing cockatoo on YouTube ! ) — the demand for bigger and better ones increases : there is a growing need to produce the most computing power per square foot at the lowest possible cost in energy and resources .
All of which is bringing a new level of attention , and challenges , to a once rather hidden phenomenon .
Call it the architecture of search : the tens of thousands of square feet of machinery , humming away 24/7 , 365 days a year — often built on , say , a former bean field — that lie behind your Internet queries .
INSIDE THE CLOUD
Microsoft ’s data center in Tukwila , Wash . , sits amid a nondescript sprawl of beige boxlike buildings .
As I pulled up to it in a Prius with Michael Manos , who was then Microsoft ’s general manager of data - center services , he observed that while “ most people would n’t be able to tell this was n’t just a giant warehouse , ” an experienced eye could discern revelatory details .
“ You would notice the plethora of cameras , ” he said .
“ You could follow the power lines . ”
He gestured to a series of fluted silver pipes along one wall .
“ Those are chimney stacks , which probably tells you there ’s generators behind each of those stacks . ”
The generators , like the huge banks of U.P.S. ( uninterruptible power supply ) batteries , ward against surges and power failures to ensure that the data center always runs smoothly .
Image Known for its bean and spearmint fields , Quincy , Wash. , is also home to rows of servers in a 500,000 - square - foot data center that Microsoft built in 2006 .

After submitting to biometric hand scans in the lobby and passing through a sensor - laden multidoor man trap , Manos and I entered a bright , white room filled with librarylike rows of hulking , black racks of servers — the dedicated hardware that drives the Internet .
The Tukwila data center happens to be one of the global homes of Microsoft ’s Xbox Live : within those humming machines exists my imagined city of ether .
Like most data centers , Tukwila comprises a sprawling array of servers , load balancers , routers , fire walls , tape - backup libraries and database machines , all resting on a raised floor of removable white tiles , beneath which run neatly arrayed bundles of power cabling .
To help keep servers cool , Tukwila , like most data centers , has a system of what are known as hot and cold aisles : cold air that seeps from perforated tiles in front is sucked through the servers by fans , expelled into the space between the backs of the racks and then ventilated from above .
The collective din suggests what it must be like to stick your head in a Dyson Airblade hand dryer .
As results were counted on Saturday May 16th it looked likely to win around 200 of 543 available seats , which would represent the biggest win by any party for 18 years .
Under the prime ministership of Manmohan Singh , Congress will return to power at the helm of a simpler and , it is expected , more stable coalition than it has presided over for the past five years .
Its United Progressive Alliance was projected to win around 260 seats .
For additional support , Congress will be able to choose from an eager host of independents and small regional parties , including several recently jettisoned allies .
India ’s Communist parties , which provided support and endless headaches to the outgoing government for most of its tenure , will not be among them .
The leftists were projected to do unprecedentedly badly , winning around 24 seats — down from their 2004 tally of 62 .
A new Congress ally in West Bengal , the Trinamul Congress , is the main beneficiary .
It was set to win 20 of 42 seats in West Bengal , a state the Communists have ruled for three decades .
A couple days ago pundits and pandits were all predicting very close election results for India , resulting in another weak central government cobbled together from competing interests and unable to accomplish anything -- sort of like the Democratic Party in the U.S. Senate .
But they were all wrong .
The centrist Congress Party rolled over the far right BJP ( the Indian version of the Republicans ) and tore into the Communist Party 's base in West Bengal and will wind up with a very functional governing coalition .
Congress ' decline has been reversed
The " free market " and racist BJP looks to wind up with 116 seats and got destroyed in one of its main bases , Rajasthan , where Congress took 21 of the 24 available seats .
Last time I was in India ( 2007 ) I wrote about the Narendra Modi phenomena ; he won that election for the BJP in Gujarat .
Today BJP leaders sifting thru the ashes are pointing to Modi as part of the reason for their electoral collapse .
The BJP leader , Chandan Mitra , said that " Bringing up Narendra Modi 's name in the middle of the campaign was a serious error of judgement .
"
The big winner , besides Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who is the first full - term PM since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected , is Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi , great - great grandson of Nehru .
He is credited with Congress ' big comeback in Uttar Pradesh , India 's biggest electoral prize .
He 's being touted as a future prime minister .
According to , the Obama Administration is happy about the results , which are viewed as a clear win for regional stability .
Hillary Clinton and Obama are extremely well - regarded in India and they depend on India for cooperation in dealing with sometimes out of control trouble spots in India 's neighborhood -- Pakistan Myanmar , and Nepal

If you thought legroom on commercial airlines was already cramped , get set to be squeezed some more .
New Boeing 737-800s now being delivered to American Airlines have the same - size cabins as the existing 737-800s in American 's fleet .
But the new planes have 12 more coach seats , pushing the total number of seats to 160 .
Delta Air Lines Inc. has also added 10 seats to its 737-800s , raising the total to 160 .
So has Continental Airlines Inc .
The seat squeeze shows how airlines are aggressively cramming more seats into jets .
The trend has been going on for years , but has picked up momentum of late as airlines take food galleys out of airplanes since they 've stopped serving free meals .
Some carriers also are replacing seats with new ones made with slimmer frames and cushions , creating additional rows .
American Airlines Capt .
Jim Kaiser shows off the new interior of the airline 's 737-800 planes .
Associated Press
Slimmer seats free up space .
But instead of giving it to customers , airlines are using it to try to make their fleets more profitable , taking all those inches and adding more seats to jets .
A few extra passengers on each trip can spell the difference for tight - margin airlines between losing money and making money .
In American 's case , some customers will lose some legroom .
The airline says it standardized the " seat pitch " -- the distance from a point on one seat to the same point on the seat in the next row -- at 31 inches throughout the coach cabin .
Some rows in the old configuration had as much as 33 inches of seat pitch , and American 's Web site says the old configuration averaged 32 inches .
Exit rows still have more legroom in the new layout -- about the same 39 - 40 inches as in the old configuration .
But " bulkhead " seats in the first row of the coach cabin wo n't be as roomy as frequent fliers are accustomed to .
A spokesman for American says there 's a " slight reduction " in legroom for the first row of the economy section .
AMR Corp .'s American says the room for the two added coach rows was freed up by several changes besides just newly designed seats with thinner seatbacks squeezed closer together .
Two service - cart storage cabinets behind the last row of seats were eliminated because , well , there 's not as much food and beverage service onboard flights these days .
The space between the two cabins was shrunk using a new contoured divider .
Despite the squeeze , American believes the new seats wo n't feel more crowded to travelers .
The seat bottoms pivot forward a bit like movie - theater seats to give the person behind you more knee room when reclining .
" The new seat design does not make you feel cramped , " said spokesman Charles Wilson .
" It has everything to do with a combination of both the way the seat reclines and the new material used for the seat cushions . "
There are other benefits as well .
The new 737s come with regular power ports available at all seats , bigger overhead bins and 20 drop - down LCD video units for entertainment programming .
The 737-800s will also burn 35 % less fuel per-seat than the MD - 80s they replace .
Read More The Middle Seat Terminal
Still , seat pitch at 31 inches may well feel tight to many travelers .
American once had 34 inches in coach when it marketed itself as the " More Room " airline from 2000 - 2005 .
The MD - 80s being phased out in favor of the 737-800s will replace MD - 80 jets that have 31 - to 33 - inch pitch in coach .
While some low - cost airlines still offer 32 - 34 inches of seat pitch on planes , 31 inches has become the standard in coach at many carriers .
Delta , for example , had 32 inches in its 737-800s when it had 150 seats .
A reconfiguration completed last summer on all 71 737-800s in Delta 's fleet pushed that to 160 seats , using slimmer seats .
But seat pitch did decline :
The first seven rows in coach have 32 - inch pitch , but the 15 rows behind the exit doors have 31 - inch pitch .
More passengers on a plane means more travelers competing for the same overhead bin space .
And bathrooms , too .
Most 737-800s are delivered from Boeing with three bathrooms -- one in the front for first - class passengers and two in the rear for coach customers .
Continental and Alaska Airlines are notable exceptions .
Continental opted to add an extra mid-cabin bathroom to some of its 737-800s and use those planes primarily on trans - continental flights .
That version also has an extra row of first - class seats and carries a total of 155 seats .
The bathroom retrofit began after the airline 's president at the time , Greg Brenneman , was quoted in a 1999 page one story in this newspaper acknowledging that the new 737-800 was " one bathroom shy of what it needs . "
With only two lavatories in the rear for then 140 coach seats ( and today 144 coach seats ) , lines for the bathroom , especially when movies end , can be long .
Alaska , a unit of Alaska Air Group Inc. , received its first three 737-800s from Boeing with 160 seats and three bathrooms , but customers complained there were n't enough bathrooms .
So Alaska decided to remove three seats and add an extra bathroom in the rear of the plane .
American will have to add a flight attendant on flights with the new layout compared with staffing on its current 737s .
The 148 - seat version gets three flight attendants .
The new layout , with 160 seats , requires four since federal rules require one flight attendant for every 50 passengers .
To keep the two versions separate , the newly delivered 737s with the dozen added seats will be based in Chicago , American says .
Right now they are flying between Chicago and Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Denver , Fort Lauderdale , Philadelphia and Minneapolis .
The airline started taking 737 deliveries again in March after a hiatus of more than seven years , and the first two planes with the new configuration went into service on April 14 .
American plans to take delivery of two or three per month until its order of 76 is complete in the first quarter of 2011 .
The 77 737-800s already in American 's fleet with the older seat configuration will eventually be upgraded to the new design , the airline says .

Verdeckte Blogger LobbyControl kritisiert Deutschen Bauernverband
Gesteuerte Blog -Einträge , um den eigenen Verband gut aussehen zu lassen - das kommt nicht gut an : LobbyControl hat das Vorgehen des Deutschen Bauernverbandes als " manipulativ und hoch problematisch " bezeichnet .
Auch andere Agrar - Verbände reagierten entsetzt .
Journalism.co.uk had been surprised to learn at last month ’s Journalism in Crisis event that the BBC used only stringers to cover South America , according to director of news Helen Boaden .
The location of global bureaux ‘ is something to do with your colonial past ’ she said , adding to comments by BBC director - general Mark Thompson , when he was questioned by an irate audience member on the corporation ’s lack of coverage in that part of the world ( specifically Latin America ) .
Audio here :
Does the BBC really have no bureaux in Central and South America ?
Well , the BBC press office later told Journalism .co.uk , it depends how you define stringers and bureaux .
There is a distinction between ‘ newsgathering hub ’ bureaux and ‘ non - hub ’ regional bureaux the BBC spokesperson said .
While there are no ‘ newsgathering hub bureaux ’ in South and Central Americas , there are four regional offices , located in Sao Paulo , Buenos Aires , Mexico City and Havana .
How many in each , Journalism .co.uk asked .
Two in each of the four cities : one producer and one local fixer , both on sponsored stringer contracts with retainers .
Other individual stringers cover the rest of the continent other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean , with freelancers working from Colombia , Peru , Venezuela , Chile and Jamaica .
It ’s an interesting question : where are international news organisations ’ bureaux and why ?
A particularly pertinent one to raise , given the difficulties in accessing material from Iran at the moment .
The BBC office in Tehran remains open , but permanent correspondent Jon Leyne has been ordered to leave the country , the corporation reported yesterday .
While the BBC had two producers inside a Gaza office in 2008 , it did not have any permanent crew on the ground and this affected its coverage of the crisis at the end of that year , and the early part of 2009 .
It was helpful for Al Jazeera to have people already based in Gaza , as its two correspondents told Journalism .
co.uk in a live - blog interview in April .
NB : Whether Al Jazeera were the ‘ only ’ English - language international broadcaster in the area for the 12 - day media block is still a bone of contention : a journalist later reminded Journalism .co.uk that his employer , Iranian government - funded Press TV , was also reporting from the region during that period .

After scoring a surprise electoral win in Sweden and getting high - profile support in Germany , the Pirate Party 's next port of call may be Canada , where a so - far small band of buccaneers is hoping to sink copyright restrictions .
Right now , they 're a handful of loosely - organized individuals spread across the country .
But they want to become an official federal political party within the next few years and get enough support to persuade Parliament to relax proposed copyright laws they say are heavy - handed and a violation of personal privacy .
" I think one of the roles a party like the Pirate Party can play is to more or less stiffen up the spines of people who might be in the NDP or the Liberals who want to get this stuff done , " said Rob Sutherland , a freelance computer programmer in Regina who is one of the organizers of the Canadian group .
The Pirate Party was little - known anywhere in the world until earlier this year , when the four founders of Pirate Bay , a Swedish torrent tracker site that helped people find and download movies , music and software , were fined millions of dollars and sentenced to jail .
Swedish seat
The verdict created a public backlash and , almost overnight , membership in the Swedish Pirate Party more than doubled .
In June 's European Parliament elections , the party took 7.1 per cent of the vote in Sweden — enough for its first seat .
There has been a similar surge of support in Germany , where lawmaker Joerg Tauss recently quit the Social Democrats , one of the country 's governing parties , and offered to join the fledgling Pirate Party of Germany .
The party 's goals are fairly simple .
It says people should have the right to share and copy music , movies and virtually any material , as long as it is for personal use , not for profit .
It opposes government and corporate monitoring of Internet activities , unless the monitoring is part of a criminal investigation .
And it also wants to phase out patents , arguing that patents on new drugs , for example , raise the cost of medical care and keep life - saving medicine out of the hands of many people .
" For me , I think copyright at its core is a good idea but I think it 's been taken too far , " said Rob Britton , a Montreal web developer who has also joined the Canadian Pirate Party movement .
" I think stronger copyright and stronger patent law stifles innovation and discourages a free - market ecosystem . "
Public concerned about copyright : organizers
Britton and Sutherland freely admit that many Canadians are unlikely to vote for a new , one - issue party .
But they say the public has become more concerned about copyright issues because of several controversial proposals put forward by the federal government .
These include :
A copyright bill that would fine people as much as $ 20,000 for uploading music files and forbid people from breaking digital locks on DVDs , CDs and other goods in order to make copies .
The bill was not passed into law before the last election but is being revived .
Two bills currently before the Commons that would give police greater access to private Internet communications and information about Internet subscribers , in some cases without a warrant .
The international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , currently being negotiated by several countries including Canada , which could allow border guards to search MP3 players , laptops and other devices for unauthorized music , software or other files .
" These issues have a certain momentum , I guess , and it seems to have kind of broken out of the gate at this point , " said Sutherland .
While the Pirate Party 's platform appeals to music and movie downloaders , it 's bound to get a cool reception from the music industry , which has seen compact disc sales plummet since file - sharing took off in the late 1990s .
Annual retail sales declined by $ 465 million in the early part of this decade , according to industry statistics , leaving companies with less money to scout out , develop and promote new artists .
" Why would anybody want to make any sizable investment in music , especially from outside of Canada , in Canada , if they felt that immediately after doing so , all the stuff was going to be ripped off ? " said Duncan McKie , president of the Canadian Independent Record Production Association .
" It does n't seem to me that that 's a good business proposition . "
McKie and other industry leaders maintain that copying deprives the industry — and in the end , artists — of money needed to keep Canada 's music scene alive .
The Pirate Party , however , contends the money paid for CDs ends up in corporate hands , with little going to the artist who wrote or performed the song .

--format-executableは、gemに実行ファイルが含まれていたときに、そのファイル名をリネームするための指定。 上の設定だと、例えばramazeをインストールしたときに、1.8のは「ramaze」で、1.9のは「ramaze-1.9」で起動できるようになる。
いちいち 「 sudo gem install hoge 」 して「 gem - 1.9 install hoge 」するのはめんどいなーと思い始めたので、
両方に一気にgemをインストールするコマンドを書いた。 「 gem-1.9」というコマンド名は適当に変えてね。
Rubyスクリプトを書くときはたいてい「 require ' rubygems '」から始めるわけですが、 RubyGemsが標準添付になった1.9系ではもうこれ不要なんですよね。
なので、未来を見越して、今日から「 require ' rubygems '」を手書きするのは止めることにしました。
シェルの設定 で
export RUBYOPT =" rubygems "
と書いておけば、rubyの起動時にRubyGemsを読み込むオプションが指定されたと見なされるので、
1.8系でもいちいち「require ' rubygems '」と書かなくて良くなります。楽ちんですね！
ちなみに上の設定は、rubyの起動時に「-rubygems」というオプションを指定するのと同じことになります。
え、そんなオプションあったっけって？ruby - hを読むと、 「 - r < ライブラリ名 > 」は「 require '< ライブラリ名 > ' 」
と同じことが分かります。ということは「-rubygems」は「require ' ubygems '」と同じはず…。 そこで /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/ を見ると、なんと「ubygems.rb」が。中身は、単に require ' rubygems 'しているだけです。
The sun is thought to have reached the lowest point in its activity in December 2008 , but the new solar cycle has gotten off to a slow start .
This week , however , two active regions ( bright regions in upper - left corner ) – whose knotty magnetic fields often coincide with eruptions and flares – appeared on the far side of the sun .

The sun ’s new solar cycle , which is thought to have begun in December 2008 , will be the weakest since 1928 .
That is the nearly unanimous prediction of a panel of international experts , some of whom maintain that the sun will be more active than normal .
But even a mildly active sun could still generate its fair share of extreme storms that could knock out power grids and space satellites .
Solar activity waxes and wanes every 11 years .
Cycles can vary widely in intensity , and there is no foolproof way to predict how the sun will behave in any given cycle .

In 2007 , an international panel of 12 experts split evenly over whether the coming cycle of activity , dubbed Cycle 24 , would be stronger or weaker than average .
The group did agree the sun would probably hit the lowest point in its activity in March 2008 before ramping up to a new cycle that would reach its maximum in late 2011 or mid-2012 .
But the sun did not bear out those predictions .
Instead , it entered an unexpectedly long lull in activity with few new sunspots .
It is thought to have reached its minimum in December 2008 , and now seems to be slowly waking up .
One such sign is two new active regions captured this week by the ultraviolet camera on one of NASA ’s twin STEREO probes ( see image ) .
‘ Ready to burst out ’
“ There ’s a lot of indicators that Cycle 24 is ready to burst out , ” panel chair Doug Biesecker of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder , Colorado , told reporters on Friday .
The panel now expects the sun ’s activity will peak about a year late , in May 2013 , when it will boast an average of 90 sunspots per day .
That is below average for solar cycles , making the coming peak the weakest since 1928 , when an average of 78 sunspots was seen daily .
Sunspots are Earth - sized blotches that coincide with knotty magnetic fields .
They are a common measure of solar activity – the higher the number of sunspots , the higher the probability of a major storm that could wreak havoc on Earth ( see Space storm alert : 90 seconds from catastrophe ) .
Not unanimous
A lower number of sunspots could mean space weather will be relatively mild in the coming years .
But Beisecker cautions it may be too early to call .
“ As hard as it is to predict sunspot number , it ’s even harder to predict the actual level of solar activity that responds to those sunspots , ” he told reporters .
If there are fewer storms , they could still be just as intense , he said .
But not everyone on the panel expects the coming cycle to be weaker than average .
“ The panel consensus is not my individual opinion , ” says panel member Mausumi Dikpati of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder , Colorado .
Dikpati and her colleagues have developed a solar model that predicts a bumper crop of sunspots and a cycle that is 30 % to 50 % stronger than the previous cycle , Cycle 23 .
Because it is still early in the new cycle , it is too soon to say whether the sun will bear out this prediction , Dikpati says .
“ It ’s still in a quiet period , ” she told New Scientist .
“ As soon as it takes off it could be a completely different story . ”
Most people do n’t make widespread infamy into a personal goal , but when Benjamin Linus from Lost recently joined the ranks of Hannibal Lecter and Voldemort in an Entertainment Weekly readers ’ poll of the biggest villains of all time , actor Michael Emerson could n’t help but feel a little flattered .
Now ending its fifth season , Lost has seen Emerson transform from a frightened hot - air balloonist named Henry Gale to the diabolically driven Ben Linus .
In the process , he ’s become a not - so - nice main character that fans not only like , but root for .
With only one season left to go , Lost still has a lot of explaining left to do .
The A.V. Club recently spoke with Emerson about possible plot developments , what lies ahead for him after Lost , and why he has it harder than Darth Vader .

The A.V. Club : Darth Vader and the Joker were two of the bigger names that Entertainment Weekly ’s readers put higher on the villains list than your character .
Do you want to talk any shit about Darth Vader ?
Michael Emerson : [ Laughs . ]
He ’s a great force of darkness , I guess , but how much acting goes on behind a plastic head ?
I ’m not sure about it .
[ Laughs . ]
It seems like his costume does more work for him than mine does for me .
I should get handicap points , I think .
Advertisement
AVC : Your character is n’t necessarily a straight - up villain ; he ’s sometimes portrayed as having the best of intentions .
Why do you think Benjamin Linus has been so easily labeled as a villain ?
ME : I do n’t know .
I ’m happy to live with it , but I think it ’s interesting that I make these best - villain lists when it ’s not even clear that I am a bad guy .
I think it ’s something in the playing of the part .
I think it worries people when they ca n’t get a handle on a character .
I tend to play him kind of ambiguously .
There is a sinister quality to him , but I think the verdict is still out about what his position is on the scale of good and evil .
To a large extent , people ’s interest in the character is the mystery of the character .

AVC : Because there are no clear - cut heroes and villains , it ’s interesting to watch people discuss the show and say , “ Obviously this person is good and this person is evil . ”
In the end , Hurley will probably wind up being the major villain , because nobody will see it coming .
ME : [ Laughs . ]
Yeah , because that ’ll come out of left field .
That would be the last thing anyone was expecting .
I ’m going to make a broad statement here and say that I think people respond to villains because people in general are more villainous than heroic .
I think it speaks to the human condition .
I think we all secretly understand that we have our sins and our dark thoughts , but we put a face on it for the world .
When we see villains played , we sort of perk up .
We go , “ How ’s he doing ? ” [ Laughs . ]

AVC : Are you worried about being typecast ?
ME : It ’s on my mind , and it ’s something I will have to deal with .
Who ’d say no to a role for fear of being so popular that they become typecast ?
You just do your work and let the chips fall .
I really do think that every time you play a role well , you are in danger of being identified with that role until the next big thing comes along .
My break on the live stage was playing the character Oscar Wilde in Gross Indecency .
So for a while , it looked like all I would ever play was flamboyant Englishmen .
But then I get a couple of things on TV where I ’m a little bit sinister , and now that ’s the thing I ’m in danger of being forever .
So I ’ll have to be a little bit careful about what I pick next , and try to bust out and find another part that is such a good fit that I ’m in danger of being pigeonholed .

AVC : You ’ve done a lot of theater work , and you were once referred to as a stage actor who also does movies and television .
Was it an easy transition from the stage to television and film ?
ME : It was n’t that easy , not so much in acting terms as in social terms .
It ’s an adjustment , you know , just to find your way around to those studio lots and stuff in L.A .
The drill is different .
It ’s a different kind of working regimen .
It just did n’t have all of the old comfortable rituals : the first table - reads , the meet - and - greet , all those things I ’m used to ; starting out at the table and gradually getting on your feet and having four weeks to rehearse the thing .
Suddenly in television and movies , you ’re left to be ready on the day .
Your rehearsal was auditioning for the part .
Now you ’re ready to go on .
Higher stakes , in a way .
But now I really like it .
I do n’t think it ’s a huge acting problem .
Anyone with any sense can see that you just have to dial it back a little bit when the camera ’s up your nose .

AVC : The show has become huge , and so has your role .
But when you were starting out , was it hard to tell whether what you were doing was going to be well - received , as opposed to being onstage , where you can gauge an audience in real - time ?
ME : It is a different feedback system .
You depend a little bit more on a set of subtle signals from the crew , or from the director of the episode .
But in your actor ’s heart , you know when you ’re playing well .
Others may not always agree with you , but I ’m always aware of when the scene is cooking or not .
You have an instinct about that from years of doing scenes and plays , and I think it stands you in good stead even in the TV world .

AVC : When it comes to what ’s going to happen next on the show , the cast is largely kept in the dark , getting scripts just before shooting begins .
At what point did you realize that Benjamin Linus was going to be an integral part of the story ?
ME : That really dawned on me gradually .
As you know , I was originally engaged to be a guest player , to do a few episodes and go away , so I was n’t thinking in terms of staying in Hawaii .
The scenes I was in in the early going , when I was Henry Gale , they had a kind of ambiguity about them .
There was a mystery in there , and no one could really figure it out .
I remember one day , a director came to me — I had a line , Sayid was waving a gun in my face saying , “ Tell us who your leader is , ” and I said , “ If I tell you , he ’ll kill me , ” and the director came and said , “ That ’s good .
Let ’s take it again , and this time , act as if the leader is the scariest person on Earth . ”
And I said , “ Okay , I can do that , but what if the leader is me ? ”
And he blinked at me a couple of times and said , “ I ca n’t discuss that . ” [ Laughs . ]
And that was it .
From then on , I thought , “ Oh , I see .
This could turn into something . ”
I ’m like a slower factor on those kinds of issues ; if even I can see that that ’s a possibility , then it must be in there somewhere .
And as it turns out , it was true .
It was a great development .
Advertisement
AVC : Tell the truth , you were getting online and posting anonymously , “ Who is this Ben Linus guy ?
He ’s great !
They should give him more screen time . ”
ME : I wish I had the savvy to do that .
I do n’t go online much , and of course I do n’t even have the sense to have an e-mail name that is n’t my own name , so I can never do any of that stuff anonymously .
I ’m hopeless .

AVC : About a year from now , you ’re going to be done , and people are going to be packing up and leaving the island .
Do you fear having a post - Lost depression ?
ME : It will be a sad time .
You know , your body just lets down .
I ’ve been ill since we wrapped 10 days ago .
When the pressure ’s off , that ’s just natural .
It will be sad to see this amazing chapter …
It ’s a great show , the show really interests me , and I ’ve had so much visibility because of my work on it , it ’s a great thing .
I ’ll never duplicate this experience .
But on the other hand , it will be good to move on and embrace the unknown future and see what that holds .
I will say that life will be simpler when I do n’t spend two - thirds of the year in the middle of the Pacific .
Advertisement
AVC : But is that so bad ?
ME : No , no , it ’s great .
I have a great time there , and the people are so lovely .
Not every TV show is as welcoming and warmhearted as the Lost company .
Everything ’s good about that .
It ’s just the logistics of being so far from Carrie , my spouse , and loved ones , and the world of theater , and the life of New York City .
That ’s sort of my life for many years now .
But I ’ll go back to it .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you have any predictions for Ben in the sixth and final season ?
ME : No , I do n’t know .
I would n’t even venture to try and second - guess Damon Lindelof .
He ’s so brilliant .
I ’m really curious to where it will go .
People say , “ What new angles and developments for your character do you long for ? ” and I say I do n’t really long for any .
I think Ben has a kind of constancy , that Ben ’s mission remains the same .
His character is rather set .
I ’ll be curious to see what sorts of challenges or situations they provide for me .
Having said that , they may completely change the character , for all I know .
[ Laughs . ]
I do n’t think so , though .
I ’ll be glad to be in it , because I ’ll be curious to see how far into the last season I ’ll survive .
We ’re going to have to start losing people next year .
Today the Senate is expected to vote to limit debate on a bill that toughens the existing bankruptcy law , probably ensuring the bill 's passage .
A solid bloc of Republican senators , assisted by some Democrats , has already voted down a series of amendments that would either have closed loopholes for the rich or provided protection for some poor and middle - class families .
The bankruptcy bill was written by and for credit card companies , and the industry 's political muscle is the reason it seems unstoppable .
But the bill also fits into the broader context of what Jacob Hacker , a political scientist at Yale , calls " risk privatization " : a steady erosion of the protection the government provides against personal misfortune , even as ordinary families face ever - growing economic insecurity .
The bill would make it much harder for families in distress to write off their debts and make a fresh start .
Instead , many debtors would find themselves on an endless treadmill of payments .
The credit card companies say this is needed because people have been abusing the bankruptcy law , borrowing irresponsibly and walking away from debts .
The facts say otherwise .
Birds do it .
Bees probably do it .
No one 's sure whether educated fleas do it .
What they do is have same - sex relationships and , in a new review of published research on the subject , biologists have started to consider what it might mean for the evolution of the animals in question .
Nathan Bailey and Marlene Zuk , biologists at the University of California , Riverside , found that same - sex relationships were a universal phenomenon in the animal kingdom , seen in everything from worms to frogs to birds .
" It 's clear that same - sex sexual behavior extends far beyond the well - known examples that dominate both the scientific and popular literature : for example bonobos , dolphins , penguins and fruit flies , " said Bailey .
Penguins have been known to form long - term same - sex bonds where males will engage in sexual activity .
Toads generally do n't discriminate between sexes while marine snails all start out male and , when they mate with another male , one of them helpfully changes sex .
Dolphins will often touch their genitals together or one male might even mount another and penetrate its blowhole .
Bonobos go the furthest in same - sex bonding with regular copulation among males .
But not all relationships should be considered the same .
A male fruit fly , for example , may court other males because it lacks a gene that allows it to tell the difference between the sexes .
" But that is very different from male bottlenose dolphins , who engage in same - sex interactions to facilitate group bonding , or female Laysan albatross that can remain pair - bonded for life and cooperatively rear young , " said Bailey .
Writing in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution , the authors said that lots of previous studies had considered how same - sex relationships might have come about but very few studies had considered whether the relationships shape the course of evolution .
" Same - sex behaviors – courtship , mounting or parenting – are traits that may have been shaped by natural selection , a basic mechanism of evolution that occurs over successive generations , " Bailey said .
" But our review of studies also suggests that these same - sex behaviors might act as selective forces in and of themselves . "
In other words same - sex relationships might shape evolution in subtle and important ways for many animals .
When bilogists think about selective pressure in evolution , they tend to focus on environmental concerns such as weather , temperature , or geographic features in a particular locality .
Social circumstances can also have an impact and Bailey argues that same - sex relationships could " radically change those social circumstances , for example by removing some individuals from the pool of animals available for mating . "
In addition , the behaviour can lead to the evolution of defence mechanisms .
" For example , male - male copulations in locusts can be costly for the mounted male , and this cost may in turn increase selection pressure for males ' tendency to release a chemical called panacetylnitrile , which dissuades other males from mounting them , " said Bailey .
Bailey and Zuk are also researching the Laysan albatross , a species in which females form same - sex pairs and rear young together .
" Same - sex behavior in this species may not be aberrant , but instead can arise as an alternative reproductive strategy , " they said .
Almost a third of Laysan albatross couples are female - female pairs and they are more successful than unpaired females when it comes to rearing chicks .
" Same - sex sexual behaviors are flexibly deployed in a variety of circumstances , for example as alternative reproductive tactics , as cooperative breeding strategies , as facilitators of social bonding or as mediators of intrasexual conflict .
Once this flexibility is established , it becomes in and of itself a selective force that can drive selection on other aspects of physiology , life history , social behaviour and even morphology , " said Bailey .
A few months ago , I heard an interesting idea about the 2nd Worst Developer .
It 's wrapped up in a simple statement :
… the quality of a software system is proportional to the skills of the second worst programmer
While at first pass , that may seem to be a silly statement , but here 's why :
… everyone on the team knows who the worst programmer is , so senior developers are closely monitoring everything that he does and cleaning up problems .
The work of the second worst programmer is not monitored with that attention so he has the chance to do some real damage .
On small teams with short projects and even shorter deadlines , this problem is multiplied .
Not only are you dealing with overlooked problems , but you 're dealing with less - than - perfect decisions consciously made to “ get it launched ” .
Now you have two problems that compound on each other …
Brandon Savage covers this one well in “ Paying Down Technical Debt “ .
But what if you had a way of preventing technical debt in the first place ?
Well , obviously you 've hired the top 1 % of developers so how can we improve things without firing everyone and hiring new people ?
Food for thought :
– Oddly enough , everyone claims to have hired the top 1 % of developers …
– If you hired the people you just fired , what makes you think you can hire better people next time ?
While many teams have solved this problem backwards and fowards , it 's worth considering and working our way through again …
I do ( and recommend ) three things as a starting point :
First of all , as my friend and colleage Cal Evans ( aka Mr April ) says , every developer should read every commit message .
When I was with WhyGoSolo , at its peak , we had a team of 7 developers each working on different parts of the system which often interacted with one another .
Once we went into Feature Freeze for a release , we had a simple rule : every single commit had to be “ blessed ” by another developer .
It made sure that someone was looking over someone else 's shoulder .
As a result , I believe only a handful of bugs made it into production .
Second , there are a handful of nifty things you can do with Subversion Commit Hooks as Matthew Turland shares .
While it does n't seem like much at first pass , it 's very handy to know there are zero syntax errors in the PHP within our repository .
That does n't mean there are no bugs … but it ensures that any bugs are logical errors as opposed to typos .
Finally , I make sure to commit frequently to Subversion .
Every time I 've fixed a specific bug , cleaned up some code , or implemented a new feature , I commit .
It means that at any given time , no matter how I 've screwed things up , I can roll back to an old known - good version .
Even more importantly , by keeping every commit atomic , I limit the set of changed files to the scope of what I 'm currently working on .
There is plenty of room for improvement in this scenario : Unit Test , Continuous Integration , etc …
Any other suggestions or creative things you 've seen ?

NEW STUDENT ORGANIZATION “ MEN IN POWER ” DEBUTS AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
Male Advocacy Group — Only of Its Kind in America — Provides Pre-Professional and Social Opportunities to All ; Angers Some
The demographics of American colleges are changing , females now representing 58 percent of graduating students .
According to third - year Men in Power president Steve Saltarelli , the presently male - dominated corporate environment is a reflection of the nature of the educational landscape 30 years prior , with workplace gender - dynamics bound to change in the coming generations .
At University of Chicago , there are twelve female - oriented advocacy groups , but none to prepare men for this change ; until now .
After a satirical editorial in the Chicago Maroon , the school ’s newspaper , birthed the idea , Men in Power has gathered steam , amassing 125 members on campus and becoming a Registered Student Organization .
Some university groups and students , however , are n’t thrilled about their new peer , whom they see as misogynistic .
The article exhibits some of this resistance .
A poster identified only as “ Hannah ” says , “ Men : 51 % of US workforce , 97 % of fortune 500 CEOs . ”
Other comments decry the group as “ bashful and naive sexism ” .
The editorial , Saltarelli insists , is satire , and as a group Men in Power will operate on the highest plane of professionalism and inclusivity .
The organization is composed of five groups , three of which are pre-professional ( Business , Pre-Law , Pre-Med ) , complementing the group ’s Outreach and Events wings .
Men in Power includes numerous female members , including its Head of Outreach , third - year Liz Scoggin .
Men in Power is currently looking to establish alumni ties and contact with professional leaders in the Chicago - land area .
They hope to hold their first campus - wide event before the academic year ends in June .
Men in Power at the University of Chicago seeks to equip an enterprising group of young men with the tools , knowledge , and connections they will need to become future leaders in their respective fields of business , law , healthcare , and politics .
###
If you ’d like more information about this topic , or would like to schedule an interview with any of Men in Power ’s members , please contact Steve Saltarelli at MenInPowerChicago - at- gmail.com

DEFGLOBAL in SBCL #
hacking , May 22nd 2009
I recently added support for global variables in SBCL : they cannot be rebound or made unbound , which are occasionally useful semantic properties .
More importantly , however , they are an efficiency measure for those cases when a threaded application is using a special as global variable — never rebinding it : on threaded builds special variable lookup has a fair bit of overhead : in addition to normal boundness checking the system also needs to check for the thread - local binding .
Using a global instead allows just grabbing the value slot of the symbol :
( defparameter * foo* 0 ) ( defparameter * foo2 * 0 ) ( defun foo ( n ) ( declare ( fixnum n ) ) ( dotimes ( i n ) ( setf * foo * * foo2 * ) ( setf * foo2 * * foo * ) ) ) ( defglobal ** bar** 0 ) ( defglobal **bar2 ** 0 ) ( defun bar ( n ) ( declare ( fixnum n ) ) ( dotimes ( i n ) ( setf ** bar * * ** bar2**) ( setf ** bar2 ** ** bar** ) ) ) ( time ( foo 100000000 ) ) ( time ( bar 100000000 ) )
FOO takes 0.55 seconds of run time , and BAR 0.37 — about 30 % difference in favor of global variables .
It needs to be taken into account , however , that this is an extremely artificial benchmark .
Eg. doing bignum arithmetic in the loop loses the difference between specials and globals into noise , so gains for real applications are likely to be much smaller — and almost certainly nonexistent for a large class of applications .
Secondary effects due to reduced code size are possible , however .
This is what assignment from * FOO2 * to * FOO * ( both special variables ) looks like :
; 1E2 : L0 : 8B05A8419E11 MOV EAX , [ # x119E41A8 ] ; '* FOO2 * ; 1E8 : 8B5011 MOV EDX , [ EAX+17 ] ; 1EB : 64 FS - SEGMENT -PREFIX ; 1EC : 8B12 MOV EDX , [ EDX ] ; 1EE : 83FA5A CMP EDX , 90 ; 1F1 : 7503 JNE L1 ; 1F3 : 8B50 FD MOV EDX , [ EAX - 3 ] ; 1F6 : L1 : 83FA4A CMP EDX , 74 ; 1F9 : 7464 JEQ L8 ; 1FB : 8B35AC419E11 MOV ESI , [#x119E41 AC ] ; '* FOO * ; 201 : 8B4611 MOV EAX , [ ESI + 17 ] ; 204 : 64 FS - SEGMENT -PREFIX ; 205 : 83385A CMP DWORD PTR [ EAX ] , 90 ; 208 : 7405 JEQ L2 ; 20A : 64 FS - SEGMENT -PREFIX ; 20B : 8910 MOV [ EAX ] , EDX ; 20D : EB03 JMP L3 ; 20 F : L2 : 8956 FD MOV [ ESI - 3 ] , EDX
Contrast and compare with assigment from ** BAR2 ** to ** BAR ** ( both globals ) :
; A18 : L0 : 8B15CC69A211 MOV EDX , [ # x11A269CC ] ; '** BAR2 ** ; A1E : 8B52 FD MOV EDX , [ EDX - 3 ] ; A21 : 8B1DC869A211 MOV EBX , [ # x11A269C8 ] ; '** BAR ** ; A27 : 8953 FD MOV [ EBX - 3 ] , EDX
Hopefully there are users out there who find this of use !
To me at least they seems like a natural match for locks , for example .

This is n't a good time for monopolies to bully the market .
I wonder how Microsoft is feeling today , now that Intel has been told to stop its anticompetitive rebates programs ?
From the EU Commission 's press release : Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies , at least in certain defined segments , from Intel ...
Certain rebates can lead to lower prices for consumers .
However , where a company is in a dominant position on a market , rebates that are conditional on buying less of a rival 's products , or not buying them at all , are abusive according to settled case - law of the Community Courts unless the dominant company can put forward specific reasons to justify their application in the individual case ....
As a result of Intel 's rebates , the ability of rival manufacturers to compete and innovate was impaired , and this led to reduced choice for consumers ....
Intel also interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD .
Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD - based products and / or put restrictions on the distribution of specific AMD - based products .
The $ 1.4B fine is record - breaking , so Microsoft no longer holds that dubious crown .
You know what this means ?
It means AMD told us the truth since at least the year 2000 , when it first filed a complaint with the Commission , according to this ruling .
I invite you to look back at the media coverage of AMD 's complaints , and ask yourself : how well did most of the mainstream media cover what was happening to AMD ?
Of course , Intel can appeal , and it says it will .
It 's so significant a turn of events , I will place the press release on Groklaw , as part of our permanent record of this part of antitrust history .
And should you ever , ever , hear of anything like this happening again in Europe , you know who to tell .
The EU Commission even has a form you can fill out , should that day ever come .
Of course , such conduct is n't done out in the noon day sun .
So how did Intel get caught ?
Here 's the kind of evidence that convinced the Commission :
The Commission obtained proof of the existence of many of the conditions found to be illegal in the antitrust decision even though they were not made explicit in Intels contracts .
Such proof is based on a broad range of contemporaneous evidence such as e-mails obtained inter alia from unannounced on - site inspections , in responses to formal requests for information and in a number of formal statements made to the Commission by the other companies concerned .
In addition , there is evidence that Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments .
Intel has issued a statement : EC Ruling : Statement by Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini SANTA CLARA , Calif. , May 13 , 2009  Paul Otellini , Intel Corporation president and CEO today issued the following statement regarding the European Commission decision on Intels business practices :  Intel takes strong exception to this decision .
We believe the decision is wrong and ignores the reality of a highly competitive microprocessor marketplace  characterized by constant innovation , improved product performance and lower prices .
There has been absolutely zero harm to consumers .
Intel will appeal .
 We do not believe our practices violated European law .
The natural result of a competitive market with only two major suppliers is that when one company wins sales , the other does not .
The Directorate General for Competition of the Commission ignored or refused to obtain significant evidence that contradicts the assertions in this decision .
We believe this evidence shows that when companies perform well the market rewards them , when they dont perform the market acts accordingly . 
 Intel never sells products below cost .
We have however , consistently invested in innovation , in manufacturing and in developing leadership technology .
The result is that we can discount our products to compete in a highly competitive marketplace , passing along to consumers everywhere the efficiencies of being the worlds leading volume manufacturer of microprocessors . 
 Despite our strongly held views , as we go through the appeals process we plan to work with the Commission to ensure were in compliance with their decision .
Finally , there should be no doubt whatsoever that Intel will continue to invest in the products and technologies that provide Europe and the rest of the world the industrys best performing processors at lower prices .
Microsoft at first swore it was not guilty too , but its threat to appeal was eventually dropped .
According to lawyers quoted in this article in the Wall St. Journal , Intel 's may not work out either : " There is nothing in the commission 's decision that pushes the established law , " said Thomas Vinje an antitrust partner at law firm Clifford Chance .
Ultimately the case will come down to Intel 's word against that of the commission on whether or not the rebates were tied to excluding the competition or just used as a regular sales practise , lawyers said .
" Usually when it comes to contesting the interpretation of facts at the European Court of First Instance , the commission has the upper hand , " said Stephen Kinsella , a partner at lawfirm Sidley Austin .
The only way Intel can win this appeal is if the commission is wrong about the facts , Vinje added .
Here , then , is the EU Commission 's press release .
Update :
And to answer many of your questions , I am adding , after the double row of stars , the EU Commission 's FAQ , linked from the press release .
It tells you things like where the money goes : ***********************
Antitrust : Commission imposes fine of  1.06 bn on Intel for abuse of dominant position ; orders Intel to cease illegal practices The European Commission has imposed a fine of  1 060 000 000 on Intel Corporation for violating EC Treaty antitrust rules on the abuse of a dominant market position ( Article 82 ) by engaging in illegal anticompetitive practices to exclude competitors from the market for computer chips called x86 central processing units ( CPUs ) .
The Commission has also ordered Intel to cease the illegal practices immediately to the extent that they are still ongoing .
Throughout the period October 2002 - December 2007 , Intel had a dominant position in the worldwide x86 CPU market ( at least 70 % market share ) .
The Commission found that Intel engaged in two specific forms of illegal practice .
First ,
Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all , or almost all , their x86 CPUs from Intel .
Intel also made direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with Intel x86 CPUs .
Such rebates and payments effectively prevented customers - and ultimately consumers - from choosing alternative products .
Second ,
Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing competitors 
x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products .
The Commission found that these practices constituted abuses of Intels dominant position on the x86 CPU market that harmed consumers throughout the EEA .
By undermining its competitors  ability to compete on the merits of their products , Intels actions undermined competition and innovation .
The Commission will actively monitor Intels compliance with this decision .
The world market for x86 CPUs is currently worth approximately  22 billion ( US$ 30 billion ) per year , with Europe accounting for approximately 30 % of that .
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said : " Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years .
Such a serious and sustained violation of the EU 's antitrust rules cannot be tolerated " .
The computer manufacturers concerned by Intel 's conduct in the Commissions decision are : Acer , Dell , HP , Lenovo and NEC .
The retailer concerned is Media Saturn Holding , owner of the MediaMarkt chain .
Conditional rebates and payments
Intel awarded major computer manufacturers rebates on condition that they purchased all or almost all of their supplies , at least in certain defined segments , from Intel : Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer A from December 2002 to December 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing exclusively Intel CPUs
Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer B from November 2002 to May 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 95 % of its CPU needs for its business desktop computers from Intel ( the remaining 5 % that computer manufacturer B could purchase from rival chip maker AMD was then subject to further restrictive conditions set out below )
Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer C from October 2002 to November 2005 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing no less than 80 % of its CPU needs for its desktop and notebook computers from Intel
Intel gave rebates to computer manufacturer D in 2007 conditional on this manufacturer purchasing its CPU needs for its notebook computers exclusively from Intel .
Furthermore , Intel made payments to major retailer Media Saturn Holding from October 2002 to December 2007 on condition that it exclusively sold Intel - based PCs in all countries in which Media Saturn Holding is active .
Certain rebates can lead to lower prices for consumers .
However , where a company is in a dominant position on a market , rebates that are conditional on buying less of a rival 's products , or not buying them at all , are abusive according to settled case - law of the Community Courts unless the dominant company can put forward specific reasons to justify their application in the individual case .
In its decision , the Commission does not object to rebates in themselves but to the conditions Intel attached to those rebates .
Because computer manufacturers are dependent on Intel for a majority of their x86 CPU supplies , only a limited part of a computer manufacturer 's x86 CPU requirements is open to competition at any given time .
Intel structured its pricing policy to ensure that a computer manufacturer which opted to buy AMD CPUs for that part of its needs that was open to competition would consequently lose the rebate ( or a large part of it ) that Intel provided for the much greater part of its needs for which the computer manufacturer had no choice but to buy from Intel .
The computer manufacturer would therefore have to pay Intel a higher price for each of the units supplied for which the computer manufacturer had no alternative but to buy from Intel .
In other words , should a computer manufacturer fail to purchase virtually all its x86 CPU requirements from Intel , it would forego the possibility of obtaining a significant rebate on any of its very high volumes of Intel purchases .
Moreover , in order to be able to compete with the Intel rebates , for the part of the computer manufacturers ' supplies that was up for grabs , a competitor that was just as efficient as Intel would have had to offer a price for its CPUs lower than its costs of producing those CPUs , even if the average price of its CPUs was lower than that of Intel .
For example , rival chip manufacturer AMD offered one million free CPUs to one particular computer manufacturer .
If the computer manufacturer had accepted all of these , it would have lost Intel 's rebate on its many millions of remaining CPU purchases , and would have been worse off overall simply for having accepted this highly competitive offer .
In the end , the computer manufacturer took only 160,000 CPUs for free .
As a result of Intel 's rebates , the ability of rival manufacturers to compete and innovate was impaired , and this led to reduced choice for consumers .
Rebates such as those applied by Intel are recognised in many jurisdictions around the world as anti-competitive and unlawful because the effect in practice is to deny consumers a choice of products .
Payments to prevent sales of specific rival products Intel also interfered directly in the relations between computer manufacturers and AMD .
Intel awarded computer manufacturers payments - unrelated to any particular purchases from Intel - on condition that these computer manufacturers postponed or cancelled the launch of specific AMD - based products and / or put restrictions on the distribution of specific AMD - based products .
The Commission found that these payments had the potential effect of preventing products for which there was a consumer demand from coming to the market .
The Commission found the following specific cases :
For the 5 % of computer manufacturer
Bs business that was not subject to the conditional rebate outlined above , Intel made further payments to computer manufacturer B provided that this manufacturer : sold AMD - based business desktops only to small and medium enterprises sold AMD - based business desktops only via direct distribution channels ( as opposed to through distributors ) and
postponed the launch of its first AMD - based business desktop in Europe by 6 months .
Intel made payments to computer manufacturer E provided that this manufacturer postponed the launch of an AMD - based notebook from September 2003 to January 2004 .
Before the conditional rebate to computer manufacturer D outlined above , Intel made payments to this manufacturer provided that it postponed the launch of AMD - based notebooks from September 2006 to the end of 2006 .
The Commission obtained proof of the existence of many of the conditions found to be illegal in the antitrust decision even though they were not made explicit in Intels contracts .
Such proof is based on a broad range of contemporaneous evidence such as e-mails obtained inter alia from unannounced on - site inspections , in responses to formal requests for information and in a number of formal statements made to the Commission by the other companies concerned .
In addition , there is evidence that Intel had sought to conceal the conditions associated with its payments .
x86 CPUs are the main hardware component of a computer .
The decision contains a broad range of contemporaneous evidence that shows that AMD , essentially Intel 's only competitor in the market , was generally perceived , by computer manufacturers and by Intel itself , to have improved its product range , to be a viable competitor , and to be a growing competitive threat .
The decision finds that Intel 's practices did not constitute competition on the merits of the respective Intel and AMD products , but rather were part of a strategy designed to exploit Intel 's existing entrenched position in the market .
Intels worldwide turnover in 2007 was  27 972 million ( US$ 38 834 million ) .
The fine in this case takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement .
In accordance with the Commission 's 2006 Guidelines on Fines ( see IP/06/857 and MEMO/06/256 ) the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Intel 's x86 CPU sales in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) .
The duration of the infringement established in the decision is five years and three months .
The Commissions investigation followed complaints from AMD in 2000 , 2003 and 2006 ( the last having been sent to the German competition authority and subsequently examined by the European Commission ) .
The Commission 's decision follows a Statement of Objections sent in July 2007 ( see MEMO/07/314 ) , a Supplementary Statement of Objections sent in July 2008 ( see MEMO/08/517 ) and a letter sent to Intel in December 2008 setting out additional factual elements relevant to the final decision .
Intel 's rights of defence have been fully respected in this case .

MEMO/09/235 Brussels , 13 May 2009 Antitrust : Commission imposes fine of 1.06 billion euros on Intel for abuse of dominant position ; orders Intel to cease illegal practices - questions and answers
( see also IP/09 /745 )
What must Intel do to comply with EU law ?
The Decision sets out how Intel has breached EU antitrust law by engaging in two types of practices which have harmed competition .
First ,
Intel gave wholly or partially hidden rebates to computer manufacturers on condition that they bought all , or almost all , their x86 central processing units ( CPUs ) from Intel .
Intel also made direct payments to a major retailer on condition it stock only computers with Intel x86 CPUs .
Second ,
Intel made direct payments to computer manufacturers to halt or delay the launch of specific products containing a competitor 's x86 CPUs and to limit the sales channels available to these products .
Intel is obliged desist from the specific practices identified in this case and not to engage in these or equivalent practices in the future .
What is the geographic scope of the remedy ?
This is a worldwide market .
Within this context , Intel is obliged not to engage in any abusive practices that have an effect within the European Economic Area ( EEA ) .
How will this Decision help innovation in the market ?
Intel limited consumer choice and stifled innovation by preventing innovative products for which there was a consumer demand from reaching end customers .
Such practices deter innovative companies which might otherwise wish to enter and compete in the market .
By ordering Intel to end its abusive practices , competition on the x86 CPU market will play out on the merits with the effect that innovation to the benefit of the consumer can flourish .
Does the Commission seek to limit companies ' ability to provide customers with discounts ?
No .
This case is about the conditions associated with Intel 's rebates and payments , not the rebates and payments themselves .
What is at stake here are loyalty or fidelity rebates , granted on condition that a customer buys all or most of its requirements from the dominant undertaking , thereby preventing that customer from purchasing from competitors .
Intel also paid clients to delay or not launch computers incorporating a competitor 's CPUs , a conduct which is not linked at all to a company 's ability to provide customers with discounts .
Does the Commissions Decision seek to protect competitors ?
No , the Commission acts in the interests of consumers .
The Commission does not look at the specific interests of individual companies , but is charged with ensuring that competition on the merits is safeguarded .
This creates an environment where consumers can benefit and where innovation can flourish .
What is the case - law underpinning the Commissions case ?
The legal underpinning of the Commissions case is based on a consistent pattern of Court jurisprudence , including Case 85/76 Hoffmann - La Roche v Commission , Case T- 203/01 Michelin v Commission , Case C-95/04 British Airways v Commission , Joined Cases T - 24/93 and others , Compagnie Maritime Belge v Commission and Case T-228/97 , Irish Sugar .
Has the Commission applied its Guidance Paper on its enforcement priorities in applying Article 82 ?
Formally , the Guidance Paper does not apply to this case since proceedings were initiated before it was issued .
The Decision is nevertheless in line with the orientations set out in the guidance paper , and includes a rigorous , effects - based analysis which has demonstrated that Intel 's conduct has reduced consumer choice and limited innovation in the market .
Intel is a US company .
What gives the European Commission authority to decide whether its behaviour is legal or not ?
Intel sells its products inter alia in the European Union , which is one of its main markets in the world .
It must therefore respect EU antitrust rules in the same way that European companies must respect US law when operating on the other side of the Atlantic .
Did the Commission co-operate with the United States on this case ?
The Commission and the United States Federal Trade Commission have kept each other regularly and closely informed on the state of play of their respective Intel investigations .
These discussions have been held in a co-operative and friendly atmosphere , and have been substantively fruitful in terms of sharing experiences on issues of common interest .
Does Intel have to pay the fine immediately ?
The fine must be paid within three months of the date of notification of the Decision .
Where does the money go ?
Once final judgment has been delivered in any appeals before the Court of First Instance ( CFI ) and the Court of Justice , the money goes into the EUs central budget , thus reducing the contributions that Member States pay to the EU .
Does Intel have to pay the fine if it appeals to the European Court of First Instance ( CFI ) ?
Yes .
In case of appeals to the CFI , it is normal practice that the fine is paid into a blocked bank account pending the final outcome of the appeals process .
Any fine that is provisionally paid will produce interest based on the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank to its main refinancing operations .
In exceptional circumstances , companies may be allowed to cover the amount of the fine by a bank guarantee at a higher interest rate .
What percentage of Intel 's turnover does the fine represent ?
The fine represents 4.15 % of Intel 's turnover in 2008 .
This is less than half the allowable maximum , which is 10 % of a company 's annual turnover .
How was Intel able to exercise its rights of defence ?
Intel has been provided full access to the Commission 's file , with the exception of legitimate claims relating to business secrets of other companies and internal Commission documents .
Intel has been able to fully comment on the evidence on which the Commission has based its Decision .
The file in this case comprises several hundred thousand pages and the Decision is based on a broad range of contemporaneous evidence from a variety of sources .
How long is the Decision ?
The Decision is 542 pages long .
When is the Decision going to be published ?
The Decision in English ( the official language version of the Decision ) will be made available as soon as possible on DG Competitions website ( once relevant business secrets have been taken out ) .
French and German translations will also be made available on DG Competitions website in due course .
A summary of the Decision will be published in the EU 's Official Journal L series in all languages ( once the translations are available ) .
Sen . Chuck Schumer and his aides arrive in a small plane at Niagara Falls International Airport in 2005 .
Senators fly high on taxpayers ' dime
Sens .
John Cornyn and Chuck Schumer each spent more than $ 140,000 in taxpayer money on travel in the first half of the fiscal year — roughly 10 times as much as some of their thriftier colleagues .
Cornyn , a Republican , racked up the highest travel bill in the Senate by spending more than $ 38,000 on a St. Michaels , Md. , retreat for 59 staffers and by taking expensive , multicity charter flights throughout his home state of Texas .

Schumer , a Democrat , ran up the second - highest bill by routinely flying private charters to cities in New York served by commercial airlines .
On Dec. 2 , for example , Schumer spent $ 4,000 to take a private plane from New York City to Albany and back again .
Delta and US Airways both fly that 140 - mile route several times a day , with fares ranging from around $ 400 to less than $ 200 if purchased in advance .
Asked about the senator ’s use of charter flights , Schumer ’s office released a statement saying that he promised when he first ran for office that he would visit each of New York ’s 62 counties every year — and that he ’s kept that promise by using “ a small , propeller plane to make as many as five stops across upstate New York and hundreds of visits each year . ”
Chart Transportation costs for every senator
“ Sen .
Schumer takes outreach to his 19 million - plus constituents seriously , and his busy travel pace makes him one of the most accessible members of Congress , ” Schumer spokesman Brian Fallon said in an e-mail to POLITICO .
Fallon said that Schumer usually travels with a personal aide and sometimes with one other staffer .
Cornyn spokesman Kevin McLaughlin said his boss ’s Texas - size airfare tab stems from the size of Texas itself .
The Politico 44 Story Widget Requires Adobe Flash Player
“ It has to do with travel around Texas ... the realistic ability to use commercial flights to get him where he needs to be , when he needs to be there , ” said McLaughlin .
“ I ’ve driven from Austin to El Paso , which is easily an eight - hour drive .
It ’s unbelievable how far it is . ”
But other big - state senators manage to get around much more cheaply .
Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison spent about $ 88,000 on travel in the first half of the fiscal year ; Alaska Sen .
Lisa Murkowski spent about $ 65,000 on transportation — less than half of what Cornyn spent .
The transportation expenditures are paid out of the senators ’ official personnel and office expense accounts , the $ 2 million to $ 4 million each senator gets annually to cover the cost of travel , staff payroll and other expenses related to members ’ official duties .
These figures do not — or at least should not — include money the senators spend on purely political trips , such as any Cornyn and Schumer may have taken as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and past chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , respectively .
They also do not cover trips senators take as part of overseas congressional delegations , which are paid for by separate funds .
While office - account records show that Schumer and Cornyn are the biggest Senate spenders when it comes to transportation , they ’re not the only members of the taxpayer - funded frequent - flier club .
In the first half of the fiscal year , three other senators spent more than $ 100,000 each on transportation : Patty Murray ( D - Wash . ) , Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) and Kit Bond ( R - Mo . ) .
Although Murray flies commercial , her $ 122,000 travel tab is more than twice that of her Washington state colleague , Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell — largely because she returns to the state nearly every weekend .
“ It ’s a very large state , incredibly rural , and some major population centers are four hours away from each other , ” said Murray spokeswoman Alex Glass , echoing an explanation voiced by a number of other Senate aides .
“ Sen . Murray believes that she and our staff can help our constituents best by going into the communities , talking to people on the ground .
She puts a priority on being back in the state . ”
The use of high - priced charter flights to travel on Senate business does not violate Senate ethics rules as long as they are paid for by the member ’s office , but they can be a source of embarrassment for elected officials , especially during times of economic hardship .
“ We are living in a world where members of Congress are treating themselves to an elite lifestyle on the taxpayers ’ dime , ” said Leslie Paige , spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste .
“ Charter flights should be the choice of last resort .
It should n’t be used like a cab .
It ’s the most carbon - intensive and expensive way to fly . ”
Between October 2008 and March 2009 , records show , Schumer took 25 chartered trips to destinations within his home state , more than any other senator .
Each trip carried a price tag of between $ 1,000 and $ 7,000 , bringing the total cost of Schumer ’s chartered travel to more than $ 100,000 in six months — approximately two - thirds of the $ 144,014 he spent on transportation in that time period .
In most cases , Schumer traveled to cities within 30 minutes of an international airport , some of them served by hourly commercial flights for as little as $ 49 each way .
Five years ago , during his first reelection campaign , Schumer answered accusations that he had spent more than $ 400,000 in taxpayer funds on chartered trips during his six - year Senate term .
Then aides touted his 603 - flight record as evidence that he was committed to his constituency , but they were also forced to contend with the “ Charter Chuck ” tag that Republican rivals hoped would stick during the campaign .
Corker and Bond have also paid thousands for chartered flights in fiscal year 2009 ; aides say they ’re needed to cover long distances in the senators ’ states .
Sen. John Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) also spent taxpayer money on charters , taking three trips — at more than $ 5,000 each — between Washington and his hometown of Charleston , W.Va .
His senior colleague , Sen. Robert Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) , does not use chartered jets to make the hourlong flight , Byrd ’s spokesman said .
Rockefeller ’s office did not respond to a request for comment .
On average , transportation costs account for less than 5 percent of a senator ’s office expense budget ; in most cases , the remainder of the funds is consumed almost entirely by staff payroll .
In the first half of the fiscal year , California Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein spent a total of $ 2.1 million out of her office account , more than any other senator .
Rounding out the top five were Sens. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , Hutchison , Cornyn and Schumer .
PETA is finally going after President Barack Obama for delivering capital punishment to a housefly on the White House grounds yesterday -- a death that was caught on tape .
When asked for comment , here 's the statement PETA released :

A while ago , the Republicans noticed that calling an opponent a “ liberal ” did n’t quite have the sting it once did , so they decided to simply replace the word “ liberal ” with the word “ socialist ” .
Seriously .
Unfortunately , I do n’t think any of them bothered to look up what socialism means .
This led to ironic situations where people like “ Joe the Plumber ” were calling Obama a socialist because he was going to lower Joe ’s taxes ( by raising taxes on the rich ) .
But I did n’t think that even Republicans could talk out of both sides of their mouth — applauding and decrying “ socialist ” policies — simultaneously .
Until now .
Monday , Fox News broadcast Sean Hannity interviewing Sarah Palin .
One minute , Palin is bragging about how she increased the size of the check that every resident ( man , woman , and child ) gets from Alaska ’s oil revenues :
Palin :
We are the only state with a negative tax rate where we do n’t have any income , sales or property tax statewide , and yes we have a share of our oil resource revenue that goes back to the people that own the resources .
Imagine that .
Hannity :
And it went up higher since you ’ve been the governor and you negotiated with the oil companies .
That all went up so people get a bigger check .
Palin :
There was a corrupt tax system up there and we had a couple of lawmakers end up in jail because of the tax system that was adopted so we cleaned it up and said we wanted a fair and equitable share of the resources that we own , and the people will share in those resource revenues that are derived .
If this is n’t socialism ( or at least redistribution of wealth beyond Obama ’s wildest dreams ) then I do n’t know what is .
At the time , even Republicans called her a socialist , according to the Alaska blog The Mudflats :
After renegotiating the tax rate with oil companies , and using the gain to hand out $ 1200 checks to every man , woman and child in the state , some Republicans in Alaska were screeching “ Socialism ! ” and comparing her to Hugo Chavez .
All this , of course , was back before Palin became a household name outside Alaska ’s borders .
Most Alaskans thought this whole plan was just great .
There were those on the left and those on the right that disagreed with Palin ’s tactics , but it was a good lesson in how to become popular .
Hand out cash .
But Hannity does n’t even notice .
In fact , just a few minutes later this in the interview , the other side of their mouths open :
Palin : If Americans are n’t paying attention , unfortunately our country could evolve into something that we do not even recognize .
Certainly that is so far from what the founders of our country had in mind for us .
Hannity : Socialism ?
Palin : Well … that is where we are headed .

The best part was that my wife did n’t have to put in nearly as many hours as her day job to make significantly more money and she was much happier too .
Having our own business allowed her to stay at home and take care of our child while running our online store at the same time .
Even though things started out slowly , our online store managed to replace my wife ’s salary of $ 100 K within one year .
As for my wife , she wanted to quit her job so she could take care of our child full time .
She did n’t want to miss a single minute of our baby ’s childhood .
The only problem was that with the additional expense of having a child , she did n’t want to place a major crimp on our lifestyle or our finances .
As a result , we needed to find another way to make money and replace her six figure salary .
Hence our online store , Bumblebee Linens , was born .
As millions of thoughts swirled through my head , my primary concern became financial security .
We needed a bigger house .
We needed to live in a better school district .
We needed to start a college education fund .
We needed an emergency fund so large that we could survive even if I lost my job or got laid off .
All of a sudden I felt like I needed to get off my ass and become a better person .
I felt like I needed to be more responsible and to take charge of my life .
I felt like I needed to get my act together and provide for my family .
My wife became pregnant !
I still do n’t fully comprehend how peeing on a stick could stir up so many emotions , but my wife and I became excited and terrified at the same time .
For one thing , I got a sudden injection of motivation and enthusiasm .
Even though she changed companies several times during her career , she never felt fulfilled working at any of her jobs .
What ’s ironic is that my wife and I had always wanted to start a business and be our own boss but we never got around to it .
We talked about opening an online store many times but never took any action until it happened ….
It was particularly painful for me because I had to watch her drag herself out of bed and witness her suffer every morning .
In fact , the only memory that stands out in my mind was how much she dreaded having to go to work each and every day .
Every morning she would kiss me goodbye and then say
Days and weeks went by quickly and we did n’t have anything to show for it .
Even when I try really hard , I am unable to recall any specific memories during that period of my life .
The only thing I remember is that I watched a hell of a lot of television and that my wife was terribly unhappy with her day job .
It sounds harsh , but my wife and I were lazy pieces of !@ # $ .
Even though we had a lot of free time , we always ended up wasting it on empty activities .
For example , our day consisted of working from 9 - 6:30 pm , eating dinner and then watching television until it was time to go to bed .
Even though we both made a pretty good salary from our day jobs , we were coasting our way through life like lifeless zombies .
After all , we were n’t challenging ourselves .
We were n’t trying new things and we stayed within our comfort zone when making important decisions .
We had no sense of purpose and we were unmotivated and stagnant .
Back then , my wife and I used to get up early in the morning , go to work , eat dinner , sleep and then wake up again the next day to repeat the cycle .
It ’s a debilitating condition that causes you to trudge through each day doing the daily grind as life quickly passes you by .
It ’s an illness that stops you from pursuing your personal goals and aspirations because you can never find the time .

how to make headcrabs June 14 , 2009
Posted by AnnaTheRed in bento blog ( all ) Tags : half - life
I ’m always thinking about what kind of bento I can make next , and what kind of how - to I should do next .
Sometimes , my boyfriend gives me suggestions for how - tos , and he ’s been telling me that I should do a how - to on the headcrabs from the headcrab bento .
I was n’t sure because I really did n’t think anyone would want to make & eat headcrab , and I asked him “ why headcrab ? ”
He said that because not only it looked really like headcrab , but it was very delicious .
I could n’t think of anything else to do for the how - to this weekend , and it was a request from my only customer after all , so I decided to do this .
Of course , you do n’t have to make headcrabs .
It tastes exactly the same if it ’s not shaped like head - crab .
You can just a recipe for a simple finger food .
( Not even sure you can call this a recipe … )
[ How to make headcrabs ]
– Potato
– Mayonnaise
– Parmesan cheese
– Salt & Pepper
– Bacon ( You can put corn , or cheese instead of bacon )
1. Peel and boil potatoes until tender .
( * If you ’re making headcrabs , make sure you leave some potato for the legs & teeth , and keep it in water until you use it . )
2. Drain water , and lightly mash the potatoes .
( * I like when there ’s still some chunks of potato in it . )
3 . Put some salt , pepper and mayonnaise .
( * I do n’t have specific measurements for this .
Just taste it and adjust the ingredients to your preferences . )
3 . Chop bacon into tiny bits and cook them on a pan .
Cook them extra crispy !
4 . When the bacon is done , take just the bacon out the pan with a fork , and put it into the mashed potato .
( Do n’t throw away the grease from bacon yet . )
5 . Make a small ball with the mashed potato , and make lines of dents on on the front with a toothpick .
6. Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese over them , and put it in a toaster oven ( or oven ) .
Cook it until the surface is golden brown .
7 . While the headcrabs are being cooked , cut potato you saved into the shape of legs and teeth .
8 . Cook the pieces in the bacon grease .
( * You do n’t need to use bacon grease .
I just use it because I ’m lazy .
:P )
9 . When the headcrabs are done , put the legs and teeth underneath the body .
10 .
If you want more realistic headcrabs , you can put some BBQ sauce or / and ketchup for the gore effect .
It ’s basically baked mashed potato balls .
You can of course put crab meat in it , but bacon is what makes their outside look zombie like .
The legs and teeth will fall apart when you pick up the body .
If you ’re thinking of serving these to other people ( then you ’re awesome ) , you might want to put individual headcrabs onto a small piece of tin foil or sliced veggie or something so the legs do n’t fall off .
Whenever I say “ potato salad ” , I usually mean lightly mashed potato with mayonnaise .
Once you have plain lightly mashed potato , you can add bacon , corn , cheese , egg , etc … pretty much anything you want .
You can wrap it with lettuce to make a character ( see “ how to make Yoshi ” ) , make croquettes , or just eat it as is .
How to make headcrabs on my flickr ( There are more pictures ! )

The amount people drink varies worldwide One in 25 deaths across the world are linked to alcohol consumption , Canadian experts have suggested .
Writing in the Lancet , the team from the University of Toronto added that the level of disease linked to drinking affects poorest people the most .
Worldwide , average alcohol consumption is around 12 units a week - but in Europe that soars to 21.5 .
The report authors warn the effect of alcohol disease is similar to that of smoking a decade ago .
We face a large and increasing alcohol - attributable burden
Dr Jurgen Rehm
Alcohol units guide
The analysis also found that 5 % of years lived with disability are attributable to alcohol consumption .
The paper says that , although there have been some benefits of moderate drinking in relation to cardiovascular disease , these are far outweighed by the detrimental effects of alcohol on disease and injury .
In addition to diseases directly caused by drinking , such as liver disorders , a wide range of other conditions such as mouth and throat cancer , colorectal cancer , breast cancer , depression and stroke are linked to drinking .
Drinking patterns do vary around the world , and the researchers point out that most of the adult population - 45 % of men and 66 % of women - abstain from drinking alcohol for most of them for their life .
Across the Americas , average consumption is 17 units per week , while the Middle East was the lowest at 1.3 units per week .
Death rates
For 2004 , the latest year for which comparable data are available on a global level , 3.8 % of all global deaths ( around 1 in 25 ) were attributable to alcohol .
Overall , alcohol - attributable deaths have increased since 2000 mainly because of increases in the number of women drinking .
Europe had the highest proportion of deaths related to alcohol , with 1 in 10 deaths directly attributable .
Within Europe , the former Soviet Union countries had the highest proportion at 15 % , or around one in seven deaths .
This study is a global wake - up call
Professor Ian Gilmore , Royal College of Physicians president Globally , men are five times more likely to die from alcohol - related illness than women .
And young people are more likely to have a disease linked to alcohol than older people .
Of all years lived with disability attributable to alcohol , 34 % were experienced by people aged 15 - 29 , 31 % in the 30 - 44 age group , and 22 % by those aged 45 - 59 .
Writing in The Lancet , the researchers led by Dr Jurgen Rehm said : " Globally , the effect of alcohol on burden of disease is about the same size as that of smoking in 2000 , but it is greatest in developing countries . "
But they added : " This finding is not surprising since global consumption is increasing , especially in the most populous countries of India and China .
" We face a large and increasing alcohol - attributable burden at a time when we know more than ever about which strategies can effectively and cost - effectively control alcohol - related harms . "
' Irresponsible sale ' Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK , said : " This study is a global wake - up call .
" We need an international framework convention for alcohol control , similar to that on tobacco , as soon as possible , to put into practice the evidence - based measures needed to reduce alcohol - related harm .
" These include increasing the price of alcohol , reducing its availability and banning advertising , and the action needs to start now . "
Alcohol Concern chief executive Don Shenker added : " These statistics are unfortunately reflected in England , where we have seen deaths caused by alcohol increase almost a fifth since the beginning of the decade .
" On both a national and global scale we 're facing a disease burden of huge proportions .
" There is no longer any doubt that if a society drinks large amounts of alcohol , we 'll see high levels of harm as a result . "
He added : " Many countries are investigating new ways to cut deaths and disease and reduce the burden on health services by using the price of alcohol to lower consumption .
" As the chief medical officer has identified , putting a stop to the irresponsible sale of low cost alcohol would be an effective step in the right direction .

SYNOPSIS : Do n't sacrifice our long term economic prospects in the name of ending a short - term slump
Post - terror nerves aside , what mainly ails the U.S. economy is too much of a good thing .
During the bubble years businesses overspent on capital equipment ; the resulting overhang of excess capacity is a drag on investment , and hence a drag on the economy as a whole .
In time this overhang will be worked off .
Meanwhile , economic policy should encourage other spending to offset the temporary slump in business investment .
Low interest rates , which promote spending on housing and other durable goods , are the main answer .
But it seems inevitable that there will also be a fiscal stimulus package .
That package should include only measures that really will promote spending now , when the economy needs it .
It should n't include anything that worsens the long - run budget position more than is necessary , or anything that looks like " hitchhiking , " exploiting the short - run difficulties of the economy to pursue unrelated long - run goals .
Unfortunately , the Bush administration has just taken a big step away from those principles .
Until late last week it looked as if much of any stimulus package would consist of increased government spending to rebuild New York , to pay for military operations and to provide unemployment benefits .
This would put money into the economy in a clearly temporary way .
Giving money to lower - income families would also be sensible .
The problem with temporary tax breaks is that you can't be sure people will spend them ; in fact , the much - vaunted rebate seems to have gone mainly into the bank rather than the economy .
The chances are better if the money goes to poorer people , whose spending is often constrained by simple lack of cash .
But the big - ticket items in the stimulus proposal sketched out by administration officials on Thursday , and reaffirmed by George W. Bush after a meeting with Congressional hard - liners , are thoroughly wrongheaded — and they suggest that bipartisanship is over , that we 're back to the cynical budget politics of the past .
One key proposal is a permanent new tax break for business investment .
This violates the basic principle that stimulus proposals should be only short - term .
Furthermore , it would probably have only a modest effect on business investment now , when there is excess capacity ; but it would increase long - term interest rates , by increasing both future deficits and future business borrowing .
And since long - term interest rates are what matter for housing , on balance this measure might well delay recovery instead of promoting it .
Another key administration proposal is an acceleration of tax cuts for higher income brackets that under current law are not scheduled to happen for several years .
On the face of it this idea seems bizarre : it gives money to precisely the people who are least likely to spend it .
Is this just a case of knee - jerk conservatism , of the belief that tax cuts for the affluent are the answer to all problems ?
Alas , no : it 's worse than that .
The real reason to accelerate the Bush tax cut is surely to forestall the growing likelihood that part of that tax cut will eventually be rescinded .
Over the last couple of months the long - run budget outlook has darkened dramatically ; we 've gone from arguments about whether the Social Security surplus would be raided to the prospect of deficits plain and simple as far as the eye can see .
A natural response , once the slowdown is over , would be to cancel some or all of the tax cuts , mainly for upper brackets , that are scheduled to happen in 2004 and beyond .
As a political matter , that will be much harder to do if the cuts have already gone into effect .
And that , surely , is why the administration wants to accelerate the tax cut .
It 's being billed as a short - run stimulus proposal , but it 's really a case of covert hitchhiking .
To add to the insult , a preliminary analysis of the numbers suggests that fuzzy math is back : the administration appears to be greatly understating the true budget cost of its proposals and pretending that a package that consists overwhelmingly of tax cuts is evenly split between tax cuts and spending .
As far as one can tell , the ultimate shape of the fiscal stimulus package is still fluid .
The package that eventually emerges could be genuinely designed to help the economy , or it could be mainly a vehicle for political opportunism .
Sadly , the latter possibility has just become much more likely .

( AAPL ) notebook line is set to bloom in spring with the arrival of new PowerPC G3 systems that will strive to maintain their lead over Intel - based notebooks .
Apple 's new top- line PowerBook is slated to feature a 292 - MHz PowerPC 750 processor , outpacing the 266 - MHz and 300 - MHz Pentium II notebooks expected to be available in the April time frame .
Currently , Apple 's fastest notebook is the PowerBook G3 with a 250 - MHz PowerPC 750 processor .
( Intel is an investor in CNET : The Computer Network . )
The second generation of G3 notebooks will be important for Apple on a number of fronts .
First , the company can continue to claim bragging rights for shipping the fastest notebook , a fact which it has started to trumpet in television commercials .
More important , the new notebooks will signal Apple 's continued effort to simplify its product lines and hence cut costs .
Like the Power Mac G3 desktop systems , these notebooks will use a simplified , customizable circuit board design for all three different models , a technique which streamlines manufacturing .
Apple 's new line of PowerBooks will run the gamut from a fully loaded notebook with a 14.1 - inch active - matrix display and possibly a DVD - ROM drive at an expected price of around $ 6,300 to a midrange notebook with 233 - MHz PowerPC 750 processor and 12.1 - inch passive - matrix display for around $ 2,500 .
In between , Apple is expected to offer a system with 250 - MHz PowerPC processor and either 12.1 - inch or 13.3 - inch active - matrix display for $ 3,600 and $ 4,600 , respectively .
Basing multiple products around a common circuit board saves Apple on production as well as inventory costs .
With a common design , Apple does not have to keep as many systems and parts on hand .
So far , the Power Mac G3 desktop systems have been a hit for Apple because of their aggressive pricing , say numerous dealers .
The company also seems to have maintained a steady supply of the systems for customers .
Supply has been a chronic and often financially perilous problem for Apple .
Maintaining a steady supply of notebooks , which typically represent higher profit margins than desktop computers , will be essential to Apple as it tries to repeat or exceed its first quarter financial feat of turning a $ 45 million profit .
Apple is likely to phase out the 3400 series notebooks with the introduction of the next - generation G3 notebooks .
The 3400 series PowerBooks were originally introduced in February 1997 , and were refreshed in November with a faster PowerPC 750 processor .
One hardly has words to describe how incomprehensibly stupid Joe the Fake Plumber Wurzelbacher consistently p roves himself to be :
Referring to the Constitution as “ almost like the Bible , ” Wurzelbacher said of the Founding Fathers : “ They knew socialism does n’t work .
They knew communism does n’t work . ”
As the article helpfully points out :
The Constitution predates the origins of socialism by nearly 100 years .
As I understand it , the Founding Fathers also knew that John & Kate would n’t work out and deduced that atomic fusion would be an impractical energy source .

Update : Below , Twitter CEO Evan Williams comments to clarify Todd 's position on Twitter 's board .
He writes : " To be clear : Todd is a Twitter investor and a very smart and helpful guy .
However , he is not actually on Twitter 's board and , in this article , he 's brainstorming on his own .
These are not in the least bit concrete plans of the company . "
Earlier : Twitter users should get ready for messages from companies bearing coupons and discounts , says a Twitter investor .
Todd Chaffee , an Institutional Venture Partners VC and Twitter board member , told the New York Times Twitter will make money allowing companies to send users coupons and e-commerce links embedded in messages sent as automatic replies to questions like " What treadmill should I buy ? "
He said :
“ Commerce - based search businesses monetize extremely well , and if someone says , ‘ What treadmill should I buy ? ’ you as the treadmill company want to be there .
As people use Twitter to get trusted recommendations from friends and followers on what to buy , e-commerce navigation and payments will certainly play a role in Twitter monetization . ”
We think Twitter should proceed very carefully with this idea .
If Twitter sets it so users have to opt-in to receive commercial messages from companies , then okay .
Otherwise , there are already too many spam accounts on Twitter that do nothing but send an " @ reply " to any user that tweets particular phrases or words .
( Try tweeting " Web hosting , " for example . )
Any more spam like that , and users might quit in droves .
Chaffee and Twitter are correct that it makes sense to pair user - queries about certain products with ads from the companies that make those products , but we think a smarter way to do that would be through putting those companies ' ads next to relevant search results .
With .001 % market share , Twitter Search is n't popular enough to make selling search ads a real business yet , but we think Twitter could get there , especially if it signs a long - rumored deal with Google .
The contradiction and tragedy of communist - anarchism Part III Share This :
REVOLUTION : THE ROAD TO FREEDOM ?
" It 's true that non-violence has been a dismal failure .
The only bigger failure has been violence . "
- Joan Baez
There 's an old story about a motorist who stopped a policeman in downtown Manhattan and asked him how he could get to the Brooklyn Bridge .
The officer looked around , thought a minute , scratched his head and finally replied , " I 'm sorry , but you can't get there from here . "
Some anarchists are now wondering if you can get to the free society from where we stand today .
I must confess that I , too , harbour some doubts .
But if there is a way , it is incumbent upon all who wish to find that way to carefully examine the important end - means problem .
" The end justifies the means . "
Few people would argue with this trite statement .
Certainly all apologists of government must ultimately fall back on such reasoning to justify their large police forces and standing armies .
Revolutionary anarchists must also rely on this argument to justify their authoritarian methods " just one more time " , the revolution being for them " the unfreedom to end unfreedom . "
It seems that the only people who reject outright this article of faith are a handful of ( mostly religious ) pacifists .
The question I 'd like to consider here is not whether the end JUSTIFIES the means ( because I , too , tend to feel that it does ) , but rather whether the end is AFFECTED by the means and , if so , to what extent .
That the end is affected by the means should be obvious .
Whether I obtain your watch by swindling you , buying it from you , stealing it from you , or soliciting it as a gift from you makes the same watch " graft " , " my property " , " booty " , or " a donation . "
The same can be said for social change .
Even so strong an advocate of violent revolution as Herbert Marcuse , in one of his rare lapses into sanity , realised this fact :
But despite the truth of Marcuse 's observation , we still find many anarchists looking for a shortcut to freedom by means of violent revolution .
The idea that anarchism can be inaugurated by violence is as fallacious as the idea that it can be sustained by violence .
The best that can be said for violence is that it may , in rare circumstances , be used as an expedient to save us from extinction .
But the individualist 's rejection of violence ( except in cases of self - defence ) is not due to any lofty pacifist principles ; it 's a matter of pure pragmatism : we realise that violence just simply does not work .
The task of anarchism , as the individualist sees it , is not to destroy the state , but rather to destroy the MYTH of the state .
Once people realise that they no longer need the state , it will - in the words of Frederick Engels - inevitably " wither away " ( " Anti-Duehring " , 1877 ) and be consigned to the " Museum of Antiquities , by the side of the spinning wheel and the bronze axe " ( " Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State " , 1884 ) .
But unless anarchists can create a general and well - grounded disbelief in the state as an INSTITUTION , the existing state might be destroyed by violent revolution or it might fall through its own rottenness , but another would inevitably rise in its place .
And why should n't it ?
As long as people believe the state to be necessary ( even a " necessary evil " , as Thomas Paine said ) , the state will always exist .
We have already seen how Kropotkin would usher in the millennium by the complete expropriation of all property .
" We must see clearly in private property what it really is , a conscious or unconscious robbery of the substance of all , and seize it joyfully for the common benefit . " [ 57 ]
He cheerfully goes on to say , " The instinct of destruction , so natural and so just ... will find ample room for satisfaction . " [ 58 ]
Kropotkin's modern - day heirs are no different .
Noam Chomsky , writing in the " New York Review of Books " and reprinted in a recent issue of " Anarchy " , applauds the heroism of the Paris Commune of 1871 , mentioning only in passing that " the Commune , of course [! ] , was drowned in blood . " [ 59 ]
Later in the same article he writes , " What is far more important is that these ideas [ direct workers ' control ] have been realised in spontaneous revolutionary action , for example in Germany and Italy after World War I and in Spain ( specifically , industrial Barcelona ) in 1936 . " [ 60 ]
What Chomsky apparently finds relatively UNimportant are the million - odd corpses which were the direct result of these " spontaneous revolutionary actions . "
He also somehow manages to ignore the fact that the three countries he mentions - Germany , Italy and Spain - were without exception victims of fascism within a few years of these glorious revolutions .
One does n't need a great deal of insight to be able to draw a parallel between these " spontaneous " actions with their reactionary aftermaths and the spontaneous " trashings " which are currently in fashion in the United States .
But it seems the Weathermen really DO " need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows . " [ 61 ]
The question of how to attain the anarchist society has divided anarchists nearly as much as the question of what the anarchist society actually is .
While Bakunin insisted on the necessity of " bloody revolutions " [ 62 ] , Proudhon believed that violence was unnecessary - saying instead that " reason will serve us better . " [ 63 ]
The same discord was echoed on the other side of the Atlantic some decades later when , in the wake of the infamous Haymarket bombing , the issue of violence came to a head .
Benjamin Tucker , writing in the columns of " Liberty " , had this to say about accusations leveled against him by Johann Most , the communist - anarchist editor of " Freiheit " :
" It makes very little difference to Herr Most what a man believes in economics .
The test of fellowship with him lies in acceptance of dynamite as a cure - all .
Though I should prove that my economic views , if realised , would turn our social system inside out , he would not therefore regard me as a revolutionist .
He declares outright that I am no revolutionist , because the thought of the coming revolution ( by dynamite , he means ) makes my flesh creep .
Well , I frankly confess that I take no pleasure in the thought of bloodshed and mutilation and death .
At these things my feelings revolt .
And if delight in them is a requisite of a revolutionist , then indeed I am no revolutionist .
When revolutionist and cannibal become synonyms , count me out , if you please .
But , though my feelings revolt , I am not mastered by them or made a coward by them .
More than from dynamite and blood do I shrink from the thought of a permanent system of society involving the slow starvation of the most industrious and deserving of its members .
If I should ever become convinced that the policy of bloodshed is necessary to end our social system , the loudest of today 's shriekers for blood would not surpass me in the stoicism with which I would face the inevitable .
Indeed , a plumb - liner to the last , I am confident that under such circumstances many who now think me chicken - hearted would condemn the stony - heartedness with which I should favour the utter sacrifice of every feeling of pity to the necessities of the terroristic policy .
Neither fear nor sentimentalism , then , dictates my opposition to forcible methods .
Such being the case , how stupid , how unfair , in Herr Most , to picture me as crossing myself at the mention of the word revolution simply because I steadfastly act on my well - known belief that force cannot substitute truth for a lie in political economy ! " [ 64 ]
It is this issue of economics which generally sorts anarchists into the violent and non-violent wings of anarchism .
Individualists , by and large , are pacifists in practice ( if not in theory ) , whereas the communists tend toward violent revolution . *
Why is this so ?
One reason I think is that individualists are more concerned with changing the conditions which directly affect their lives than they are with reforming the whole world " for the good of all . "
The communists , on the other hand , have a more evangelical spirit .
Like all good missionaries , they are out to convert the unbeliever - whether he likes it or not .
And inevitably this leads to violence .
Another reason communists are more prone to violence than individualists can be found , I think , in looking at the nature of the force each is willing to use to secure and sustain his respective system .
Individualists believe that the only justifiable force is force used in preventing invasion ( i.e. defensive force ) .
Communists , however , would compel the worker to pool his products with the products of others and forbid him to sell his labour or the products of his labour .
To " compel " and " forbid " requires the use of offensive force .
It is no wonder , then , that most communists advocate violence to achieve their objectives .
--------------------------------------
* There are exceptions of course .
It is hard to imagine a more dedicated pacifist than Tolstoy , for example .
On the other side of the coin is Stirner , who quotes with near relish the French Revolutionary slogan " the world will have no rest till the last king is hanged with the guts of the last priest . " [ 65 ]
-------------------------------------
If freedom is really what we anarchists crack it up to be , it should n't be necessary to force it down the throat of anyone .
What an absurdity !
Even so superficial a writer as Agatha Christie recognised that " if it is not possible to go back [ from freedom ] , or to choose to go back , then it is not freedom . " [ 66 ]
A. J. Muste used to say that " there is no way to peace - peace IS the way . "
The same thing is true about freedom : the only way to freedom is BY freedom .
This statement is so nearly tautological that it should not need saying .
The only way to realise anarchy is for a sufficient number of people to be convinced that their own interests demand it .
Human society does not run on idealism - it runs on pragmatism .
And unless people can be made to realise that anarchy actually works for THEIR benefit , it will remain what it is today : an idle pipe dream ; " a nice theory , but unrealistic . "
It is the anarchist 's job to convince people otherwise .
Herbert Spencer - the great evolutionist of whom Darwin said , " He is about a dozen times my superior " - observed the following fact of nature :
" Metamorphosis is the universal law , exemplified throughout the Heavens and on the Earth : especially throughout the organic world ; and above all in the animal division of it .
No creature , save the simplest and most minute , commences its existence in a form like that which it eventually assumes ; and in most cases the unlikeness is great - so great that kinship between the first and the last forms would be incredible were it not daily demonstrated in every poultry - yard and every garden .
More than this is true .
The changes of form are often several : each of them being an apparently complete transformation - egg , larva , pupa , imago , for example ...
No one of them ends as it begins ; and the difference between its original structure and its ultimate structure is such that , at the outset change of the one into the other would have seemed incredible . " [ 67 ]
This universal law of metamorphosis holds not only for biology , but for society as well .
Modern - day Christianity resembles the early Christian church about as much as a butterfly resembles a caterpillar .
Thomas Jefferson would have been horrified if he could have foreseen the " government by the consent of the governed " which today is the hereditary heir of his Declaration of Independence .
French revolutionaries took turns beheading one another until that great believer in " les droits de l'homme " , Napoleon Bonaparte , came upon the scene to secure " liberte , egalite , fraternite " for all .
And was n't it comrade Stalin who in 1906 so confidently forecast the nature of the coming revolution ? :
" The dictatorship of the proletariat will be a dictatorship of the entire proletariat as a class over the bourgeoisie and not the domination of a few individuals over the proletariat . " [ 68 ]
The examples of these ugly duckling stories in reverse are endless .
For as Robert Burns wrote nearly two centuries ago :
" The best laid schemes o' mice and men
Gang aft a -gley ;
An ' lea'e us nought but grief and pain
For promis'd joy . "
69
Why is it that Utopian dreams have a habit of turning into nightmares in practice ?
Very simply because people do n't act the way the would - be architects of society would have them act .
The mythical man never measures up to the real man .
This point was brought home forcefully in a recent letter to " Freedom " by S. E. Parker who observed that our modern visionaries are bound for disappointment because they are " trying to deduce an ' is ' from an ' ought ' . " [ 70 ]
Paper constitutions might work all right in a society of paper dolls , but they can only bring smiles to those who have observed their results in the real world .
The same is true of paper revolutions which invariably have to go back to the drawing board once the reign of terror sets in .
And if communist - anarchists think that their paper social systems are exempt from this , how do they explain the presence of anarchist " leaders " in high government positions during the Spanish Civil War ?
Has n't everyone been surprised at sometime or other with the behaviour of people they thought they knew well ?
Perhaps a relative or a good friend does something " totally out of character . "
We can never completely know even those people closest to us , let alone total strangers .
How are we , then , to comprehend and predict the behaviour of complex groups of people ?
To make assumptions about how people must and will act under a hypothetical social system is idle conjecture .
We know from daily experience that men do n't act as they " ought " to act or think as they " ought " to think .
Why should things be any different after the revolution ?
Yet we still find an abundance of revolutionaries willing to kill and be killed for a cause which more likely than not , if realised , would bear no recognizable resemblance to what they were fighting for .
This reason alone should be sufficient to give these people second thoughts about their methods .
But apparently they are too carried away by the violence of their own rhetoric to be bothered with where it will lead them . *
----------------------------------
* I am reminded here of a Herblock cartoon which came out during the Johnson - Goldwater presidential campaign of1964 .
It pictures Goldwater standing in the rubble of a nuclear war and proclaiming , " But that 's not what I meant ! "
I wonder if the Utopia which our idealists intend to usher in by violent revolution will be what they really " meant " .
------------------------------------
There is but one effective way to rid ourselves of the oppressive power of the state .
It is not to shoot it to death ; it is not to vote it to death ; it is not even to persuade it to death .
It is rather to starve it to death .
Power feeds on its spoils , and dies when its victims refuse to be despoiled .
There is much truth in the well - known pacifist slogan , " Wars will cease when people refuse to fight . "
This slogan can be generalised to say that " government will cease when people refuse to be governed . "
As Tucker put it , " There is not a tyrant in the civilised world today who would not do anything in his power to precipitate a bloody revolution rather than see himself confronted by any large fraction of his subjects determined not to obey .
An insurrection is easily quelled ; but no army is willing or able to train its guns on inoffensive people who do not even gather in the streets but stay at home and stand back on their rights . " [ 71 ]
A particularly effective weapon could be massive tax refusal .
If ( say ) one - fifth of the population of the United States refused to pay their taxes , the government would be impaled on the horns of a dilemma .
Should they ignore the problem , it would only get worse - for who is going to willingly contribute to the government 's coffers when his neighbours are getting away scotfree ?
Or should they opt to prosecute , the burden just to feed and guard so many " parasites " - not to mention the lose of revenue - would be so great that the other four - fifths of the population would soon rebel .
But in order to succeed , this type of action would require massive numbers .
Isolated tax refusal - like isolated draft refusal - is a useless waste of resources .
It is like trying to purify the salty ocean by dumping a cup of distilled water into it .
The individualist - anarchist would no more advocate such sacrificial offerings than the violent revolutionary would advocate walking into his neighbourhood police station and " offing the pig . "
As he would tell you , " It is not wise warfare to throw your ammunition to the enemy unless you throw it from the cannon 's mouth . "
Tucker agrees .
Replying to a critic who felt otherwise he said , " Placed in a situation where , from the choice of one or the other horn of a dilemma , it must follow either that fools will think a man a coward or that wise men will think him a fool , I can conceive of no possible ground for hesitancy in the selection . " [ 72 ]
There is a tendency among anarchists these days - particularly in the United States - to talk about " alternatives " and " parallel institutions " .
This is a healthy sign which individualists very much encourage .
The best argument one can possibly present against " the system " is to DEMONSTRATE a better one .
Some communist - anarchists ( let it be said to their credit ) are now trying to do just that .
Communal farms , schools , etc. have been sprouting up all over the States .
Individualists , of course , welcome these experiments - especially where they fulfill the needs of those involved and contribute to their happiness .
But we can't help questioning the over - all futility of such social landscape gardening .
The vast majority of these experiments collapse in dismal failure within the first year or two , proving nothing but the difficulty of communal living .
And should an isolated community manage to survive , their success could not be judged as conclusive since it would be said that their principles were applicable only to people well - nigh perfect .
They might well be considered as the exceptions which proved the rule .
If anarchy is to succeed to any appreciable extent , it has to be brought within the reach of everyone .
I 'm afraid that tepees in New Mexico do n't satisfy that criterion .
The parallel institution I would like to see tried would be something called a " mutual bank . " *
The beauty of this proposal is that it can be carried out under the very nose of the man - in - the - street .
I would hope that in this way people could see for themselves the practical advantages it has to offer them , and ultimately accept the plan as their own .
I 'm well aware that this scheme , like any other , is subject to the law of metamorphosis referred to earlier .
But should this plan fail , unlike those plans which require bloody revolutions for their implementation , the only thing hurt would be the pride of a few hair - brained individualists .
----------------------------------------
* The reader can judge for himself the merits of this plan when I examine it in some detail later on in this article .

" Unless the revolution itself progresses through freedom , the need for domination and repression would be carried over into the new society and the fateful separation between the ' immediate ' and the ' true ' interest of the individuals would be almost inevitable ; the individuals would become the objects of their own liberation , and freedom would be a matter of administration and decree .
Progress would be progressive repression , and the ' delay ' in freedom would threaten to become self - propelling and self - perpetuating . " [ 56 ]

Herbert Spencer - the great evolutionist of whom Darwin said , " He is about a dozen times my superior " - observed the following fact of nature : " Metamorphosis is the universal law , exemplified throughout the Heavens and on the Earth : especially throughout the organic world ; and above all in the animal division of it .
No creature , save the simplest and most minute , commences its existence in a form like that which it eventually assumes ; and in most cases the unlikeness is great - so great that kinship between the first and the last forms would be incredible were it not daily demonstrated in every poultry - yard and every garden .
More than this is true .
The changes of form are often several : each of them being an apparently complete transformation - egg , larva , pupa , imago , for example ...
No one of them ends as it begins ; and the difference between its original structure and its ultimate structure is such that , at the outset change of the one into the other would have seemed incredible . " [ 67 ]
This universal law of metamorphosis holds not only for biology , but for society as well .
Modern - day Christianity resembles the early Christian church about as much as a butterfly resembles a caterpillar .
Thomas Jefferson would have been horrified if he could have foreseen the " government by the consent of the governed " which today is the hereditary heir of his Declaration of Independence .
French revolutionaries took turns beheading one another until that great believer in " les droits de l'homme " , Napoleon Bonaparte , came upon the scene to secure " liberte , egalite , fraternite " for all .
And was n't it comrade Stalin who in 1906 so confidently forecast the nature of the coming revolution ? :
" The dictatorship of the proletariat will be a dictatorship of the entire proletariat as a class over the bourgeoisie and not the domination of a few individuals over the proletariat . " [ 68 ]
The examples of these ugly duckling stories in reverse are endless .
For as Robert Burns wrote nearly two centuries ago :
Why is it that Utopian dreams have a habit of turning into nightmares in practice ?
Very simply because people do n't act the way the would - be architects of society would have them act .
The mythical man never measures up to the real man .
This point was brought home forcefully in a recent letter to " Freedom " by S. E. Parker who observed that our modern visionaries are bound for disappointment because they are " trying to deduce an ' is ' from an ' ought ' . " [ 70 ]
Paper constitutions might work all right in a society of paper dolls , but they can only bring smiles to those who have observed their results in the real world .
The same is true of paper revolutions which invariably have to go back to the drawing board once the reign of terror sets in .
And if communist - anarchists think that their paper social systems are exempt from this , how do they explain the presence of anarchist " leaders " in high government positions during the Spanish Civil War ?
Has n't everyone been surprised at sometime or other with the behaviour of people they thought they knew well ?
Perhaps a relative or a good friend does something " totally out of character . "
We can never completely know even those people closest to us , let alone total strangers .
How are we , then , to comprehend and predict the behaviour of complex groups of people ?
To make assumptions about how people must and will act under a hypothetical social system is idle conjecture .
We know from daily experience that men do n't act as they " ought " to act or think as they " ought " to think .
Why should things be any different after the revolution ?
Yet we still find an abundance of revolutionaries willing to kill and be killed for a cause which more likely than not , if realised , would bear no recognizable resemblance to what they were fighting for .
This reason alone should be sufficient to give these people second thoughts about their methods .
But apparently they are too carried away by the violence of their own rhetoric to be bothered with where it will lead them .*----------------------------------*
I am reminded here of a Herblock cartoon which came out during the Johnson - Goldwater presidential campaign of1964 .
It pictures Goldwater standing in the rubble of a nuclear war and proclaiming , " But that 's not what I meant ! "
I wonder if the Utopia which our idealists intend to usher in by violent revolution will be what they really " meant " .------------------------------------There is but one effective way to rid ourselves of the oppressive power of the state .
It is not to shoot it to death ; it is not to vote it to death ; it is not even to persuade it to death .
It is rather to starve it to death .
Power feeds on its spoils , and dies when its victims refuse to be despoiled .
There is much truth in the well - known pacifist slogan , " Wars will cease when people refuse to fight . "
This slogan can be generalised to say that " government will cease when people refuse to be governed . "
As Tucker put it , " There is not a tyrant in the civilised world today who would not do anything in his power to precipitate a bloody revolution rather than see himself confronted by any large fraction of his subjects determined not to obey .
An insurrection is easily quelled ; but no army is willing or able to train its guns on inoffensive people who do not even gather in the streets but stay at home and stand back on their rights . " [ 71 ]
A particularly effective weapon could be massive tax refusal .
If ( say ) one - fifth of the population of the United States refused to pay their taxes , the government would be impaled on the horns of a dilemma .
Should they ignore the problem , it would only get worse - for who is going to willingly contribute to the government 's coffers when his neighbours are getting away scotfree ?
Or should they opt to prosecute , the burden just to feed and guard so many " parasites " - not to mention the lose of revenue - would be so great that the other four - fifths of the population would soon rebel .
But in order to succeed , this type of action would require massive numbers .
Isolated tax refusal - like isolated draft refusal - is a useless waste of resources .
It is like trying to purify the salty ocean by dumping a cup of distilled water into it .
The individualist - anarchist would no more advocate such sacrificial offerings than the violent revolutionary would advocate walking into his neighbourhood police station and " offing the pig . "
As he would tell you , " It is not wise warfare to throw your ammunition to the enemy unless you throw it from the cannon 's mouth . "
Tucker agrees .
Replying to a critic who felt otherwise he said , " Placed in a situation where , from the choice of one or the other horn of a dilemma , it must follow either that fools will think a man a coward or that wise men will think him a fool , I can conceive of no possible ground for hesitancy in the selection . " [ 72 ]
There is a tendency among anarchists these days - particularly in the United States - to talk about " alternatives " and " parallel institutions " .
This is a healthy sign which individualists very much encourage .
The best argument one can possibly present against " the system " is to DEMONSTRATE a better one .
Some communist - anarchists ( let it be said to their credit ) are now trying to do just that .
Communal farms , schools , etc. have been sprouting up all over the States .
Individualists , of course , welcome these experiments - especially where they fulfill the needs of those involved and contribute to their happiness .
But we can't help questioning the over - all futility of such social landscape gardening .
The vast majority of these experiments collapse in dismal failure within the first year or two , proving nothing but the difficulty of communal living .
And should an isolated community manage to survive , their success could not be judged as conclusive since it would be said that their principles were applicable only to people well - nigh perfect .
They might well be considered as the exceptions which proved the rule .
If anarchy is to succeed to any appreciable extent , it has to be brought within the reach of everyone .
I 'm afraid that tepees in New Mexico do n't satisfy that criterion .
The parallel institution I would like to see tried would be something called a " mutual bank . " *
The beauty of this proposal is that it can be carried out under the very nose of the man - in - the - street .
I would hope that in this way people could see for themselves the practical advantages it has to offer them , and ultimately accept the plan as their own .
I 'm well aware that this scheme , like any other , is subject to the law of metamorphosis referred to earlier .
But should this plan fail , unlike those plans which require bloody revolutions for their implementation , the only thing hurt would be the pride of a few hair - brained individualists .----------------------------------------*
The reader can judge for himself the merits of this plan when I examine it in some detail later on in this article .----------------------------------------

I am delighted to publish an original essay by friend and Voluntaryist Ken Knudson on the intellectual contradiction that is " communist - anarchism " and the tragic debacle of trying to translate the contradiction into reality .

There 's an old story about a motorist who stopped a policeman in downtown Manhattan and asked him how he could get to the Brooklyn Bridge .
The officer looked around , thought a minute , scratched his head and finally replied , " I 'm sorry , but you can't get there from here . "
Some anarchists are now wondering if you can get to the free society from where we stand today .
I must confess that I , too , harbour some doubts .
But if there is a way , it is incumbent upon all who wish to find that way to carefully examine the important end - means problem .
" The end justifies the means . "
Few people would argue with this trite statement .
Certainly all apologists of government must ultimately fall back on such reasoning to justify their large police forces and standing armies .
Revolutionary anarchists must also rely on this argument to justify their authoritarian methods " just one more time " , the revolution being for them " the unfreedom to end unfreedom . "
It seems that the only people who reject outright this article of faith are a handful of ( mostly religious ) pacifists .
The question I 'd like to consider here is not whether the end JUSTIFIES the means ( because I , too , tend to feel that it does ) , but rather whether the end is AFFECTED by the means and , if so , to what extent .
That the end is affected by the means should be obvious .
Whether I obtain your watch by swindling you , buying it from you , stealing it from you , or soliciting it as a gift from you makes the same watch " graft " , " my property " , " booty " , or " a donation . "
The same can be said for social change .
Even so strong an advocate of violent revolution as Herbert Marcuse , in one of his rare lapses into sanity , realised this fact :
