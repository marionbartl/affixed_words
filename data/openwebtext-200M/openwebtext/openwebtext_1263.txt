The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Wednesday night criticized Rep. Artur Davis ( D - Ala. ) for voting against the Democrats ’ signature healthcare bill .
“ We even have blacks voting against the healthcare bill from Alabama , ” Jackson said at a reception Wednesday night .
“ You ca n’t vote against healthcare and call yourself a black man . ”

The remark stirred a murmur at the reception , held by the Congressional Black Caucus ( CBC ) Foundation as part of a series of events revolving around the 25th anniversary of Jackson ’s run for president .
Several CBC members were in attendance , including Chairwoman Barbara Lee ( D - Calif. ) , who ’d introduced Jackson .
Davis , who is running for governor , is the only black member of Congress from Alabama .
He is also the only member of the CBC to have voted against the healthcare bill earlier this month .
Davis referred to Jackson ’s 1988 run for president in a statement , issued through his office , that said he would not engage Jackson on his criticism .
“ One of the reasons that I like and admire Rev. Jesse Jackson is that 21 years ago he inspired the idea that a black politician would not be judged simply as a black leader , ” Davis ’s statement said .
“ The best way to honor Rev. Jackson ’s legacy is to decline to engage in an argument with him that begins and ends with race . ”
Jackson said later that he " did n't call anybody by name and I wo n't . "
He added that he was n't saying that black lawmakers must vote a certain way .
Instead , they should vote the interests of the people in their districts , and he said the healthcare bill would help Alabama because it's one of the poorest states in the country .
" The poorest people need healthcare protection , " Jackson said .
" They have the highest infant mortality and the lowest life expectancy .
They 're dying from lack of access . "
Other members of the CBC found no fault in Jackson 's words .
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D - Mo. ) was in the audience .
He called Jackson 's criticism of Davis " accurate , " but said he did not hear Jackson say " You ca n’t vote against healthcare and call yourself a black man . "
" If it is an issue that disproportionately impacts black folks , race has to be considered , " Cleaver said .
Jackson , he added , " is expected by his constituency to call balls and strikes . "
Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Calif. ) called the remarks " vintage Jesse Jackson , " but said Davis 's vote against healthcare was consistent with a voting record more conservative than many CBC members .
" Artur Davis has a more conservative constituency , " Waters said .
" Since he 's running for governor of Alabama , he reflects an even more conservative constituency . "
Rep. Sheila Jackson - Lee ( D - Texas ) said each man was doing what he considered the right thing .
" People have a right to vote their constituency , and people have a right to speak their conscience , " Jackson - Lee said .
" Both happened . "
Davis ’s Democratic primary opponent , Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks , highlighted Davis ’s status as the lone African - American vote against the bill .
“ He was the only Black Caucus member to vote against it .
I do n’t get it , ” Sparks said last week , according to The Associated Press .
Sparks is white .
Davis said he voted against the healthcare bill because " House leadership 's approach is not the best we can do . "
He said he preferred a version passed by the Senate Finance Committee because it reduces subsidization of the healthcare industry , taxes high - value health plans instead of wealthy people , and is more effective in getting employers to help with health coverage .
Davis has countered that Sparks ’s position on healthcare has changed over time , saying he ’s being “ deliberately dishonest . ”
The primary will be June 1 .
All of the GOP candidates for governor have been critical of the healthcare legislation , according to the AP .

This film came out of the director ’s frustration with watching the nightly news and hearing generals , politicians and pundits , explaining the political and economic cost of the war in the Middle East , without ever mentioning the human cost .
He wanted to hear about the war by the people affected by it most : doctors , nurses , poets , artists , soldiers , and his personal favorite , musicians .
Michael Franti , world - renowned musician and human rights worker , travels to Iraq , Palestine and Israel to explore the human cost of war with a group of friends , some video cameras and his guitar .
A compelling soundtrack , visual and musical montages and Franti ’s intimate voiceovers make the film speak to the MTV , X , Y & Z generations , as well as the baby - boomers .
A true armchair travel film pulling the audience into these war zones in the company of Michael ’s guitar , eloquence and wit – you feel the humanity , artistic resilience and sometimes horrific experience of what it ’s like to live under the bombs and military occupation .
With its guerrilla style footage captured in active war zones , the documentary is unlike the many academic and politically driven pieces in the marketplace , instead offering the audience a sense of intimate travel and the opportunity to hear the voices of everyday people living , creating and surviving under the harsh conditions of war and occupation ..
Feature Articles - The Armistice
The term " armistice " means a cessation of hostilities as a prelude to peace negotiations .
In the context of the First World War ' the armistice ' is generally referred to in context of the agreement between the Germans and the Allies to end the war on November 11 , 1918 .
However it was by no means the only armistice of the war .
The battle on the Eastern Front was brought to a close in December 1917 ( and followed by the Treaty of Brest - Litovsk ) , as was Romania 's war ( resulting in the Treaty of Bucharest ) .
Germany may have agreed an armistice on November 11 , but Bulgaria called it quits on 30 September of the same year , 1918 .
Turkey and Austria - Hungary - the latter having essentially sparked the war in the first place - concluded an armistice within days of each other , on 30 October and 3 November 1918 ; both were exhausted and could no longer continue to prosecute the war .
However the most significant armistice was signed at 5 a.m. on the morning of 11 November 1918 , and came into effect six hours later at 11 a.m. ( hence the oft - quoted ' eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month ' ) .
Click here for a transcript of the armistice terms .
Initiating the armistice negotiations on 4 October 1918 , the Germans directed peace feelers towards the U.S. government led by President Wilson .
The Germans were keen to conclude a peace based upon Wilson 's famous Fourteen Points .
Wilson was naturally willing to conclude a peace based upon his doctrine for future peace and stability ; however his allies , never particularly keen on the Fourteen Points , raised immediate objections .
Britain , led by Lloyd George , opposed a ban on a policy of blockades ;
France was intent on imposing swingeing reparations upon the ' beaten ' foe .
Wilson compromised by accepting both objections whilst threatening to negotiate a separate peace on behalf of the U.S. if Britain and France continued with their objections .
His ploy successful , details of a proposed settlement were sent to Germany on 5 November by the Supreme War Council .
A major potential stumbling block to peace was Wilson 's insistence upon the abdication of the German Kaiser , Wilhelm II .
This was overcome by German Chancellor Max von Baden 's exasperated decision to announce the reluctant Wilhelm 's abdication to the public on 9 November 1918 ( subsequently made official by the Kaiser 's abdication proclamation on 28 November ) .
On 8 November a German delegation met with Allied Supreme Commander Ferdinand Foch - who was to lead the military negotiations - in the forest of Compiegne , some 65 km north - east of Paris .
The armistice was formally signed in Foch 's railway carriage on 11 November ( in 1940 Hitler exacted revenge by forcing the French to sign an armistice - on German terms - in the same railway carriage ) .
The armistice initially ran for 30 days but was regularly renewed until the formal peace treaty was signed at Versailles the following year .
Should the Germans have deviated in any way from the terms of the armistice the Allies warned that a resumption of hostilities would begin within 48 hours .
The terms of the armistice required the Germans to evacuate German - occupied territories on the Western Front within two weeks .
Allied forces were to occupy the left bank of the Rhine within a month , and a neutral zone established on the right bank .
Notably , all German - occupied territories elsewhere were to be abandoned ; and the treaties already negotiated with Russia and Romania were officially annulled ( the Russian peace treaty in particular had been denounced by Trotsky as annexationist in character ) .
In terms of military equipment , under the terms of the armistice the Germans lost 5,000 artillery pieces , 30,000 machine guns , 3,000 minenwerfer , 2,000 aircraft , 5,000 locomotives , 150,000 railway wagons , 5,000 trucks and its entire submarine fleet .
The majority of Germany 's surface naval fleet were interned ; the remainder were disbanded .
The terms of the armistice were inevitably seen as punitive within Germany .
The country however was in no condition to resume hostilities and so reluctantly accepted the conditions .
The French nevertheless viewed the terms of the armistice - and the Versailles peace treaty that followed in 1919 - as overly lenient , indicating the widely contrasting views of both the armistice and the subsequent treaty .
( Click here to read British General Sir Frederick Maurice 's account of the Allied reasons for accepting peace in November 1918 rather than pursing the German Army into Germany . )
Shortly after the armistice was agreed President Wilson announced details to Congress , and further celebrated the agreement in a Thanksgiving Address at the close of the month .

is that when you get sick , the insurance company can just drop you and refuse to pay .
The practice is known as “ rescission , ” and the Washington Post reported today on the experiences of several patients .
This is my favorite :
For Teresa Dietrich , it was fibroids .
The Northern California real estate agent was left to pay $ 19,000 after Blue Cross said she did not disclose a diagnosis of the benign uterine tumors .
But Dietrich said the doctor who had written “ fibroids ” on her medical record never mentioned his suspicions to her .
The bills destroyed her credit and cost her her home — and , in a comically cruel twist , the surgery proved the doctor was wrong .
“ They said I had a condition I did n’t even have , ” Dietrich said .
“ And they canceled me . ” ( Emphasis mine )
How bad is the problem of insurance companies not wanting to pay ?
California Attorney general Jerry Brown is investigating incredibly high rates of denial by HMOs :
Los Angeles – Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that deputies in his office are launching an independent inquiry into how Health Maintenance Organizations review and pay insurance claims submitted by doctors , hospitals and other medical providers .
This investigation is prompted by reports that California ’s five largest health - insurance providers are denying insurance claims at rates of up to 39.6 percent .
“ These high denial rates suggest a system that is dysfunctional , and the public is entitled to know whether wrongful business practices are involved , ” Brown said .
If a number close to forty percent sounds too high , consider these statistics from the California Nurses Association :
Claims denial rates by leading California insurers , first six months of 2009 : • PacifiCare — 39.6 percent
• Cigna — 32.7 percent
• HealthNet — 30 percent
• Kaiser Permanente — 28.3 percent
• Blue Cross — 27.9 percent
• Aetna — 6.4 percent
Health insurance companies are blaming everyone but themselves as they scramble to perform damage control over this story .
Which reminds me : insurance companies are raising their rates .
In the past few days , 114,000 Michigan households have received bad - news letters from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan , socking individual health insurance subscribers with premium increases averaging 22 % , effective Oct.
1 . Blue Cross could have said , “ Hey , things could have been worse .
We asked for a 56 % rate hike first and dialed it back to 22 % ” — but that probably would have just made folks angrier .
( Emphasis mine )
Blue Cross is what remains of an American experiment with so - called “ co-ops ” — an experiment that failed .
Remind me again : why is private insurance necessary ?
A few weeks ago , I picked up a package of Applegate Farms “ The Great Organic Uncured Hot Dog ” , which uses beef from grass - fed cows .
A package of 8 set me back nearly $ 7.50 , which is WAY more than you will pay for commodity hot dogs at the grocery store .
In fact , it was the most expensive price I ’ve ever paid on a per - hot - dog basis outside of sporting events .
A Chicago - style , or “ salad dog ” , is a mixture of vegetables that have a minimizing effect on the hot dog itself .
Typically you would expect to see cucumber , tomato , onion , roasted pepper , and pickle relish ( at minimum ) .
In this preparation I restricted myself to the first three items .
It was FANTASTIC , even with the bun falling slightly apart .
Certainly some of the taste can be attributed to the hot dog itself , but beyond that the mix of cucumber , pepper jack cheese , and tomato fit in very well .
Ingredients
Rudi’s Bakery organic hot dog buns ( $ 3.50 for a pack of six )
Applegate Farms “ Great Organic Hot Dog ” ( $ 7.50 for a pack of eight )
Cucumber , thinly sliced
Tomato , thinly sliced
Onion , thinly sliced
Yellow mustard
Pepper jack cheese , thinly sliced or grated

Volume Control in xmonad
What you will need to follow along
The goal
import XMonad main = xmonad defaultConfig
I got very jealous of Nicole recently when we were watching some television on her Mac .
The commercials came on and blasted us away ... so she hit a key , and her volume magically dropped , and a beautiful graphic popped up showing the volume level .
When the show came back on , another key put the volume back .
Nice !
So , let 's take the first step in getting xmonad to do that : let 's add some keybindings for volume control and a pop - up showing the current volume level .
We 'll start with the barest of bones configuration , shown to the right with a screenshot from a fictitious 320×240 monitor .
I 'll only put screenshots by configurations that change the visual compared to the last one .
Adding volume control
import XMonad import XMonad .
Actions .
Volume import Data.Map ( fromList ) import Data .
Monoid ( mappend ) main = xmonad defaultConfig { keys = keys defaultConfig `mappend` \c -> fromList [ ( ( 0 , xK_F6 ) , lowerVolume 4 >> return ( ) ) , ( ( 0 , xK_F7 ) , raiseVolume 4 >> return ( ) ) ] }
This is the easiest step .
The XMonad .
Actions .
Volume module in xmonad - extras provides a whole glut of actions for controlling the volume and muting .
For now , we 'll just use these two :
lowerVolume :: MonadIO m => Double -> m Double raiseVolume :: MonadIO m => Double -> m Double
The Double arguments are how many percentage points to raise the volume ; I like 4 .
When you 're doing this yourself , you might also want to bind a key to the toggleMute function , but I personally do n't want that very often , so I decided to skip it .
If you do this , you will probably also want to change lowerVolume 4 to setMute False >> lowerVolume 4 and raiseVolume 4 to setMute False >> raiseVolume 4 .
Now , my keyboard has a great big gap in between the F6 and F7 keys that make those ones super easy to find tactilely , so I chose those keys for volume adjustment ( with no modmask at all ) .
If you stare past the fluff of Haskell 's record syntax , you 'll see that there are really only two load - bearing lines , the ones with xK_F6 and xK_F7 .
To begin with , I just threw away the return value of the volume change command .
Great , now I could control the volume with F6 and F7 !
I was pretty happy with this for a while , but after some testing , I decided that visual feedback really mattered .
So ... let 's play with dzen .
Calling dzen to show the current volume
import XMonad import XMonad .
Actions .
Volume import XMonad.Util.Dzen import Data.Map ( fromList ) import Data .
Monoid ( mappend ) alert = dzenConfig return .
show main = xmonad defaultConfig { keys = keys defaultConfig `mappend` \c -> fromList [ ( ( 0 , xK_F6 ) , lowerVolume 4 >>= alert ) , ( ( 0 , xK_F7 ) , raiseVolume 4 >>= alert ) ] }
It turns out there 's a module for this , too , in xmonad - contrib : XMonad .
Util.
Dzen .
The first thing I wanted to do was make sure that dzen was working properly .
That module provides the dzenConfig return :: String -> X ( ) function to just throw some text up on the screen for a few seconds .
So it 's time to wire things up and stop throwing away the return value from the volume raise / lower actions : let 's send it on to dzen instead .
Of course , the returned value is a Double , so we have to convert it to a String first .
I defined myself an alert function that will display a representation of anything that can be show n .
The result is kind of okay : there 's a bar across the entire top of the screen for a few seconds with the new volume setting .
Prettier , pretty please
import XMonad import XMonad .
Actions .
Volume import XMonad.Util.Dzen import Data.Map ( fromList ) import Data .
Monoid ( mappend ) alert = dzenConfig centered .
show .
round centered = onCurr ( center 150 66 ) >=> font " -*- helvetica-*-r-*-*-64-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" >=> addArgs [ " - fg " , " #80c0 ff " ] >=> addArgs [ " - bg " , " #000040 " ] main = xmonad defaultConfig { keys = keys defaultConfig `mappend` \c -> fromList [ ( ( 0 , xK_F6 ) , lowerVolume 4 >>= alert ) , ( ( 0 , xK_F7 ) , raiseVolume 4 >>= alert ) ] }
Okay , that works ... but it 's pretty ugly .
I wanted to make it a little nicer :
I only want to show the first two significant digits .
After that is pretty much noise as far as I 'm concerned .
So I threw a round on the end of my alert function .
I also wanted to center the dzen on the current screen .
( My fictitious display has only one screen , but we might as well be general here . )
The xmonad - contrib module provides the center function for this purpose .
I chose the 150 and 66 ( after some experimenting ) to match the size of the rendered text ; it 's a hack , but it 's about the best we can do without opening up some fonts within xmonad itself and checking out their metrics .
I fired up xfontsel and picked out a nice big font so that it would be readable .
Just for fun , I set the foreground and background colors , too .
After all that , I finally had a setup that I kind of liked .
Perhaps sometime in the future , when I get some more time to hack , I 'll learn about ghosd and get a truly beautiful volume indicator going . =)

After yesterday ’s voter - approved rape of our marriage rights in Maine , the obvious question to ask is :
How ’d this happen ?
And next :
Who can we blame ?
It ’s a natural instinct .
Surely there must be someone or something out there to direct our anger , our frustration , our disgust .
It ’s the same thing that happened exactly one year ago in California , when Prop 8 took away the M - word from gays and lesbians .
Fingers started pointing , and not in very nice places .
Race and religion were blamed .
So , too , was the “ No On 8 ” campaign , accused of misguided direction and ineffective outreach .
Now here we are in Maine , wondering aloud , “ WTF ? ”
So : WTF ?
How much responsibility does Obama have ?
An obvious candidate for our ire , President Barack Obama has publicly ignored the marriage battle in Maine .
Though he is not a supporter of same - sex marriage , even on the campaign trail he said he wanted states to be able to choose whether to endorse or delete discrimination .
Before the November 2008 election , he voiced — albeit quietly — his opposition to Prop 8 .
This letter is the evidence he ’ll point to , years from now , defending his gay rights record .
But here ’s what happened over the past few weeks : Obama remained painfully silent when we needed him the most .
Sure , his approval ratings are lower than they once were , but Obama retains an amazing ability to rally people to the polls .
Had he maintained his “ fierce advocate ” status and called on Maine voters to defend our rights , we might not be looking at a four - to - five point losing margin .
And yet , we ’ll never know how much Obama ’s voice might have helped .
If he allowed Press Secretary Robert Gibbs to say something about the issue , rather than ignore it entirely , would that have changed things ?
What if he went so far as to star in a television ad for Protect Maine Equality ?
How about if he called on the DNC to back up PME in its fight ?
So unimportant were our rights to the president , he supposedly did n’t even watch the returns .
We like to think Obama ’s stamp of approval could have moved the needle just a little bit .
But we would ’ve ( almost ) settled for him giving a damn , at least in private .
How much responsibility does Gay Inc. have ?
We ’re told to look to organizations like the Human Rights Campaign and GLAAD to see what can be done to further gay civil rights .
Except these two organizations , and their brethren , were horrifyingly silent on Maine .
Yes , there were “ partners ” with PME , and sure , they sent out email blasts to supporters — to raise money for their own organizations .
But wait , what ’s this ?
Our inbox shows the most recent email from HRC’s Joe Solmonese appeared on Oct. 28 — to celebrate good friend Barack Obama ’s signature on the Matthew Shepard Act .
There ’s been nothing about Maine ’s fight .
Today , a single article on HRC ’s homepage reads “ Maine Families Denied Protections in Marriage Vote ” ; the organization says it “ expressed profound sadness and anger at the passage of Question 1 in Maine . ” Crocodile tears ?
Meanwhile , neither HRC nor GLAAD , in a message from president Jarrett Barrios today , mentions Obama ’s name once .
HRC points out the good that did happen last night : Washington ’s Referendum 71 , some triumphs in local elections .
But there is nothing about the Democratic National Committee , or the failures of elected officials , in either message .
It ’s a political correctness move — neither group wants to point out the obvious : that our officials and party leaders purposefully dropped the ball on this one .
And it leaves their supporters wondering : Seriously , where the hell were you on this one ?
Did Protect Maine Equality / No On 1 not do enough ?
This is a very difficult question , but one that must be asked .
The obvious answer is :
Under the leadership of Jesse Connolly , they busted their asses as hard as possible .
We know this to be true .
PME ’s teams on the ground worked endless nights for weeks on end , trying to prepare Maine to become the first state with voter - approved marriage rights .
There was blood , sweat , and tears .
People flew in from around the country to help the effort .
From phone banks to door - to - door canvassing to flyers , PME seemingly did everything right .
But if that ’s the case , does it mean there was just no convincing enough Maine residents that our rights are worth protecting ?
We hasten to believe so .
So where were the cracks ?
On this website , we ’ve faulted PME for its weak advertising campaign .
One television ad after another “ played nice , ” showing normalized families that do n’t deserve to be discriminated against , rather than painting a doomsday scenario of what will happen if Question 1 passes : voters will approve discrimination .
Our criticism was panned by some readers , who claimed Mainers were different , and these soft ads were exactly what appeals to them .
But maybe human instinct is universal after all .
Without a dire call - to - action , what if some of our would - be supporters simply stayed home to let others fight the soft fight ?
The effectiveness of PME ’s advertising campaign may never be known ; that ’s an intangible that polling might try to gauge , but not perfectly .
But its TV ads were the most public forms of outreach from the pro-marriage camp , and our fists were not raised .
Did Stand For Marriage
Maine simply do a better job ?
They must have , right ?
They won , after all .
With the backing of Prop 8 group the National Organization for Marriage and the support of conservative Catholics , S4MM used mostly out - of - state money to create a campaign based on fearmongering and misinformation .
Again , did the ads work more than the actual message of the legislation ?
Maybe .
But it ’s hard to argue their scare tactics did n’t influence a decent portion of Maine voters into saying Yes On 1 .
It ’s becoming clear : NOM has bigot campaigns down to a science .
And they wo n’t end stop with Maine .
What about the media ?
Oh , the left - leaning mainstream media .
Surely they were there to highlight what was at stake in Maine , right ?
No .
And it was n’t just during last night ’s returns that made it clear , when — with the notable exceptions of some CNN segments and Rachel Maddow ’s show — all attention was paid to Virginia and New Jersey , and not a civil rights battle .
Imagine if Maine ’s voters were deciding on interracial marriage ?
Or whether Catholics had the right to marry ?
There would be story after story , “ objective ” of course , but pointing out how nonsensical the issue was :
Of course this nation should n’t endorse discrimination .
While a few Maine newspapers were covering the issue , it did n’t pop up on larger papers ’s radar until the final days before the election .
And even then , stories reporting on anti-gay issues were centered around Virginia .
What does this mean for California ’s Prop 8 repeal ?
Will there be motivation to wait till 2012 ?
It could go either way .
Advocates of waiting until 2012 might say Maine shows that we do n’t have the public with us just yet .
Meanwhile , 2010 repeal supporters will point out that Maine ’s result is just the latest reason why we cannot wait to battle for our rights .
The bigger factor , as always , is money : Donors , big and small , can be swayed either way based on Maine ’s vote ; it ’s all in how you present your case .
What about Rhode Island ?
New Jersey ?
Rhode Island ’s gay marriage fight has always been an uphill battle , because of the Catholic Church ’s influence there .
You thought S4 MM ’s leg up from the church was a big deal ?
Just wait till you get into Rhode Island ’s true Catholic territory , where in - state money will flow more freely .
Unlike Maine , Rhode Island ’s governor actively endorses discrimination .
On our side , failing to learn from Maine ’s mistakes will prove detrimental .
Our opponents waged war with lies and less cash , and still won .
As for New Jersey , without Gov. Jon Corzine serving another term , we ’re left with weeks to get a same - sex marriage bill through the legislature and on his desk .
If that does n’t happen , lawmakers will have a helluva time passing a veto - proof bill while Chris Christie is in office .
And even if that happens , expect Maine redux : a petition drive to give voters a chance to decide on gay marriage .
PLATTSBURGH , N.Y. --
The rise of conservative " tea party " activists around the country has created a dilemma for Republicans .
They are breathing life into the party 's quest to regain power .
But they 're also waging war on some candidates hand - picked by GOP leaders as the most likely to win .

100 % Wind - Powered Island off Maine Financed Using Electricity Co-op
November 17th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
In a nearly unanimous vote just last summer , members of Maine ’s Fox Island Electric Cooperative decided to invest in wind to power the island .
[ social_buttons ]
Today the $ 14.5 million Fox Islands
Wind project officially goes on line with a ribbon - cutting event , marking the completion of Maine ’s first island wind project ; the largest community - owned wind project on the East Coast .
To be able to take advantage of the 30 % Federal Tax Credits for any renewable power that does not emit greenhouse gases ( like natural gas , coal or oil ) , the co-op formed a for - profit subsidiary ; Fox Islands Wind LLC .
The cost to build the three 1.5 - megawatt turbines to supply their community power was $ 14 million .
They raised the funds by getting a $ 9.5 million loan from the USDA and also finding an angel investor , Diversified Communications from Portland ; that invested $ 5 million in return for tax credits .
The community owned coop is betting that wind will deliver them cheaper electricity than the $ 0.30 a kwh they pay now .
Because all the islanders ’ electricity comes 12 miles from the mainland in an underground cable , energy losses raise their electricity prices .
The 4.5 MW wind farm ( of just three turbines ) is expected to be able to cover 100 % of their energy needs , for the 2,000 of them on the two islands , but residents number over 5,000 in the summer during tourist season .
Excess power during winter months will be sold into the grid , so the return on their investment gets even better .
Each member ’s share of a 100 % wind - powered electricity supply for 25 years ?
$ 7,000 .
Not only are the three 1.5 MW wind turbines community owned , but Cianbro , the company installing it is an employee - owned company .
There must be something in the water .
Their job :
Provide support for permitting , engineering and procurement of the turbines
Clear the site ; build the site road and pour the concrete foundations
Erect the three GE 1.5 MW wind turbines , including tower sections , nacelle , hub and blades
Install all the grid interconnections , SCADA and communications systems
There is no profit being made because Fox Island Electric Cooperative is a co-op ; but the island resident members will benefit from having a stable supply of lower priced clean energy which supplies 100 % of their electricity needs .
There might be more tourists next summer , too , as more people come out to see how their neighborhood can make their own clean energy .

She admits that the second pregnancy has taken its toll , saying : " It was hard , I got so much bigger faster .
At my worst point I remember bursting into tears , because I looked like a beach ball with a head and little feet .
Near the end of the hike from Fortuna Bay to Stromness , we came upon a small pond where several dozen Gentoo Penguins were hanging out , trying to stay cool in the almost 70 °F heat .
Several of my fellow passengers were also just hanging out while I ( of course ! ) looked for picture opportunities ... such as taking pictures of Gentoo Penguins ... little did I know that a Skua was about to attack a young adult Gentoo Penguin in a battle to the death .
WARNING : The pictures below are gruesome as they depict the reality of nature ... which can be cruel .
This may have been the actual Skua seen below ... looks pretty mild - mannered ... for now !
2:39 PM - I was photographing these Gentoo Penguins when the Skua first showed up
The Penguins did n't like the Skua nearby and presented a common front plus made a ton of noise - so he flew away .
At 2:48 PM , I took this wide - angle picture and then turned 180° around for some other penguins
The Skua will shortly attack a Penguin on the far side of the pond just past the right side of this picture .
A few minutes later , Paul ( in green ) whispered " Alek , turn around ! " and motioned to what was happening on the far shoreline of the pond ... which quickly got my attention .
2:50 PM - Jim Riesert takes this stunning picture during the initial Skua attack
Sowell admitted his identity as officers began fingerprinting him , police said Six bodies have been found at the home of a convicted sex offender in the city of Cleveland , Ohio , authorities say .
Police discovered the first two bodies on Thursday when they came to arrest Anthony Sowell , 50 , on a rape charge .
A third was found a day later and police have now confirmed three more .
The remains were recovered in the house and inside a grave dug in the backyard .
The suspect , who spent 15 years in jail for attempted rape , was arrested on Saturday not far from his home .
Cuyahoga County Coroner Frank Miller said two of the bodies had been identified as black females , one of whom had died a violent death , the Associated Press reports .
Autopsies had been performed on all six , the coroner 's office said , but no cause of death was announced .

Advertisement Police chief Michael McGrath told a news conference that Sowell had offered no resistance when arrested , following a tip - off , while walking down the street on Saturday at around noon .
The suspect initially denied he was the man authorities were looking for , but admitted his identity as officers began fingerprinting him , police said .
Chief McGrath said the bodies were in " various states of being decomposed " and could have been in the two - storey house for up to six months .
It was such a disgusting sight ... the stench from inside was overwhelming
Lt Thomas Stacho
He said Sowell had initially lived in the property with his aunt and uncle , but that his uncle had passed away and his aunt had gone to a nursing home about a year ago .
Police Lt Thomas Stacho told CNN : " It was such a disgusting sight . "
" I can tell you I stood outside the home for about an hour yesterday , and the stench from inside was overwhelming , " he added .
Neighbours told media that the suspect made a living from looking for scrap metal to sell .
" He was crazy , " said Teresa Hicks , who has known Sowell since school .
" Sometimes he would just go off if he did n't have his way . "
Missing - person reports are being checked dating to June 2005 , when Sowell was released from prison .
Crowds have been gathering outside Sowell 's home , in the city 's East Side , holding posters of missing loved ones .
5 Nov , 2009 : An earlier version of this story stated that Anthony Sowell had been convicted of a 1989 rape .
He was in fact convicted of attempted rape .

' I was in this game for the money , " wrote Andrew Lahde , a hedge fund manager , in a letter to the Financial Times last year as the global economy went into meltdown .
" The low hanging fruit , ie idiots whose parents paid for prep school , Yale and then the Harvard MBA , was there for the taking .
" These people who were ( often ) truly not worthy of the education they received ( or supposedly received ) , rose to the top of companies such as AIG , Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government .
All of this behaviour supporting the aristocracy only made it easier for me to find people stupid enough to take the other side of my trades .
God Bless America . "
The fruit does n't hang much lower than Prince Andrew .
The best education money can buy and an intellect worthy of the gene puddle from which he was fished .
Few look on him for leadership .
But the apparent absence of a filter that might temper the more blatant expressions of his regal privilege , makes him an interesting indicator of class entitlement at times .
" I do n't want to demonise the banking and financial sector .
Bonuses , in the scheme of things , are minute , " he told the Daily Telegraph this weekend .
" They are easy to target .
A number will have abused their privilege of a bonus , so get rid of the excesses , but do n't throw the baby out with the bath water . "
For a man who used £ 30,000 of taxpayers ' money for a 50 - mile helicopter ride so that he could have lunch with Arab dignitaries , the million - dollar bonuses received by bankers probably do seem trifling .
But the rest of us see extortionate rewards for incompetent people not as the " abuse of privilege " but of abusive privilege – wanton venality embedded in a corrupt system .
Bonuses are the most stark illustration of an economic culture that treats those who actually create wealth – workers – with contempt , while handsomely rewarding those who profit from that wealth .
While perfectly competent public sector employees who are doing useful jobs face lay - offs because of the economic crisis , the overpaid people responsible for creating the crisis are getting huge rises .
Resentment is both justified and predictable .
On its own , however , it is not particularly productive .
The furore over AIG bonuses in March , or Royal Bank of Scotland 's former CEO Fred Goodwin 's lavish pension , provided an effective vent for widespread outrage .
Governments joined in their expressions of disgust , as though the issue were one of bad manners , and then floated all sorts of palliatives that they knew would offer no cure .
Today the bonuses are back because banks that were too big to fail are even bigger , having swallowed the minnows and basked in the oligopoly that greeted the survivors .
One of the few things that has changed since this time last year is that we now know just how completely rotten this system is .
So the populist anger at inflated executive pay acted as a diversion from the crisis , rather than tackling the root causes of the popular distress it had caused .
For there is a difference between class envy and class struggle .
The former is rooted in the popular antipathy towards the rich on account of their wealth ; the latter , meanwhile , targets the system that makes some people rich by making others poor .
Envy can lead to struggle .
But it does n't have to .
As a means of propaganda , class envy has its uses .
The sight of David Cameron and Boris Johnson in bow ties as members of Oxford University 's Bullingdon Club – a high society drinking fraternity where members routinely got trashed , then trashed restaurants and often paid for the damage in full , in cash – certainly whets a class - conscious appetite .
But it should never be mistaken for the main dish .
The problem is not that they are toffs , but that their expressed aim is to further the political and economic interests of toffs .
By shifting the focus from the institutional to the individual it is easy to identify a potent symbol while ignoring the substantial flaws that made those symbols possible .
So while we were directing our anger at bankers , banking and finance has returned to its old ways .
This contradiction has been most obvious in the US , where the administration last week ordered swingeing cuts in the boardroom pay of those companies still dependent on the public purse .
But the plan , announced with great fanfare , only actually affects 175 people and even then allows for " exceptions where necessary to retain talent and protect taxpayer interests " .
When asked if he thought it would make a difference , Obama 's pay tsar , Kenneth Feinberg , said : " I hope so , but that would be voluntary .
It 's not the government 's business . "
Voluntary regulation with loopholes for all – have n't we been there before ?
Meanwhile the Federal Reserve has announced plans to crack down on pay deals that are related to excessive risk .
That could make a slight difference , if it were to be properly enforced .
Yet few believe it will be .
But the most plausible reform that would have the greatest effect is to break up the banks by banning them from owning and trading risky securities .
This is not a particularly radical suggestion .
It 's not an alternative to capitalism – just a change in capitalism as we have come to know it .
Versions of it have been championed by , among others , former Fed chairman , Paul Volcker – Obama 's most senior economic adviser – and the Bank of England chairman Mervyn King .
" The banks are there to serve the public , " Volcker told the New York Times last week , " and that is what they should concentrate on .
These other activities create conflicts of interest .
They create risks , and if you try to control the risks with supervision , that just creates friction and difficulties , " and it ultimately fails .
" People say I 'm old - fashioned and banks can no longer be separated from non -bank activity [ but ] that argument brought us to where we are today . "
Back in 1933 , during his first presidential inauguration address , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , aimed to do just that .
" The money - changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilisation .
We must now restore the temple to its ancient truths .
The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit ...
There must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments ; there must be an end to speculation with other people 's money . "
This time , the outcome of our economic crisis has so far been almost exactly the opposite .
The money changers not only remain in their high seats but our governments have bought them cushions , at our expense , that they might perch more comfortably .
The last year has seen not a restoration of ancient truths but a resurrection of decrepit institutions and a decaying ideology .
Pumping public money into their sclerotic veins , we brought them back from the dead .
We have literally paid for the right to be exploited by a system we know does n't work .
The prince was half right .
In " the scheme of things " bonuses are an easy , if legitimate target .
So the sooner we address the scheme of things the better .
A social worker from New York City was arrested last week while in Pittsburgh to participate in the G - 20 protests , then subjected to an FBI raid this week at his home — all for using Twitter .
Elliot Madison faces charges of hindering apprehension or prosecution , criminal use of a communication facility and possession of instruments of crime .
He was posting to a Twitter feed ( or tweeting , as it is called ) publicly available information about police activities around the G - 20 protests , including information about where police had been ordered to disperse protesters .
While alerting people to public information may not seem to be an arrestable offense , be forewarned : Many people have been arrested for the same “ crime ” — in Iran , that is .
Last June 20 , as Iranians protested against the conduct and results of their national election , President Barack Obama said in a statement , “ The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected , and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights . ”
His statement was released in English , Farsi and Arabic , and posted on the White House ’s very own Twitter feed .
His tweet read , “ We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people . ”
U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , and Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , urging her to pressure European nations to restrict sales of eavesdropping technology to Iran .
They wrote : “ Following recent elections , the Iranian government has used a new communications monitoring center to interfere with and suppress internet and cell phone communications as part of efforts to crackdown on Iranian citizens peacefully demonstrating … including voice calls , email , text messaging , instant messages , and web traffic , as well as posts to social networking sites such as Twitter , MySpace and Facebook . ”
The U.S. State Department , impressed with the importance of Twitter to Iranian protests , asked Twitter to delay system maintenance that might have interrupted the service during the Iranian protests .
While Madison optimistically mused , “ I ’m expecting the State Department will come out and support us also , ” his lawyer , respected civil rights attorney Martin Stolar , said : “ This is just unbelievable .
It is the thinnest , silliest case that I ’ve ever seen .
It tends to criminalize support services for people who are involved in lawful protest activity .
And it ’s just shocking that somebody could be arrested for essentially walking next to somebody and saying : ‘ Hey , do n’t go down that street , because the police have issued an order to disperse .
Stay away from there .’ “
Madison , his wife and housemates were roused from sleep during the weekend when the Joint Terrorism Task Force swept into their house , keeping them handcuffed for hours , searching the house and removing computers and other property from everyone in the house .
Madison said the FBI “ for 16 hours , proceeded to take everything , from plush toys to kitchen magnets and lots of books … they took Curious George stuffed animals . ”
Rather than encourage and support the use of distributed , decentralized social networks to strengthen our democracy and dissent ( remember , the Obama campaign itself relied extensively on these online and mobile tools ) , the government seems headed in the opposite direction .
Los Angeles Chief of Police William Bratton recently won acclaim at the annual meeting of the Major Cities Chiefs Association , a professional organization of police executives representing 63 of the largest cities in the United States and Canada .
Bratton has launched “ I Watch LA , ” described as “ a community awareness program created to educate the public about behaviors and activities that may have a connection to terrorism . ”
The iWatch program , despite Bratton ’s assertion otherwise , is about spying on your neighbors and turning them in to the police .
One Iranian twitterer for the virtual news hub Tehran Bureau recalled the June protests in an essay : “ An officer spoke to us through a loud speaker : ‘ Disperse : This is your last warning . ’
The sight of them made my knees tremble , but the wave pushed on and so I went along . ”
He was beaten , bloodied , arrested and held for 20 days .
While Elliot Madison was not physically harmed , his legal battles are just beginning , and his case could prove central to the future of free speech in the mobile , digital age .
It is time for the digital censors here in the U.S. to disperse .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Inside the offices of Tradeworx , an emerging player in the secretive and controversial world of high - frequency trading , it ’s dead quiet as staffers pore over the “ tape , ” financial industry speak for the record of the day ’s transactions .
Employees work at the Tradeworx office in Red Bank , New Jersey , November 17 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mike Segar
Many of the firm ’s 30 employees are not yet 25 .
They were hired straight from college to ensure their thinking and work habits are untainted .
Now they ’re making Wall Street ’s latest fortune , a fraction of a penny at a time .
The only clue that Tradeworx , a six - year - old hedge fund based in Red Bank , New Jersey , is a financial outfit at all are two giant screens that break up the monotony of white walls and grayish carpets .
The physics and computer science graduates are crafting complex computer codes to exploit trading patterns revealed by the tape .
Tradeworx and other firms like it use such algorithms in the lightning - quick trading approach that is altering the landscape of U.S. markets , driving broker - dealers out of business and changing how money managers invest .
High - frequency trading now accounts for 60 percent of total U.S. equity volume , and is spreading overseas and into other markets .
These traders stand ready to buy and sell shares at all times , providing the liquidity that keeps markets moving .
As a result , trading is now cheaper and easier than ever .
Yet critics worry fast trading may undermine the integrity of the U.S. equity market , a bastion of capitalism and corporate America , and could even spark another financial crisis .
They also complain about the money high - frequency firms are making -- and how they are making it .
During last year ’s plunge , when volatility rose , many high - frequency traders earned 10 times their usual profits , executives at several of the proprietary firms told Reuters .
For their part , the fast traders do n’t see what all the fuss is about .
“ We live in a capitalist society , ” said Tradeworx Chief Executive Manoj Narang , 40 , wearing jeans , runners and a Yankees baseball cap .
“ People should expect and be willing to pay a price for the liquidity that they get .
No one should expect that a provider of liquidity is just going to stand there while you bulldoze them into submission , ” Narang said .
Tradeworx started high - frequency trading in January and now accounts for about 3 percent of overall volume in the exchange - traded fund SPDR Trust , which tracks the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index and is one of the most heavily traded securities .
High - frequency traders point to last year ’s steep sell - off as proof of their value in helping the market run smoothly .
While over - the - counter and other markets seized up , exacerbating the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , fast traders continued to buy and sell shares .
Proponents also laud computerized trading for eliminating the shady transactions that often occurred in the past when people were directly involved in trading .
TAPE HOLDS ANSWERS TO DEBATE
Trading today seems less intimate , less human , married as it is to computer code .
The revolution has caught some people off guard , and has led to deep concerns .
Many institutional money managers are uneasy about how the fast traders anticipate their transactions , and worry that there might be information leakage about their trading intentions -- a critical issue for asset managers .
“ High - frequency trading , fundamentally , when you look at what their algorithms are finding , they ’re almost a structured way of trying to front - run , ” said Jim McCaughan , chief executive of the asset management arm of Principal Financial Group , where he oversees about $ 215 billion in assets .
“ That just seems to me ultimately as doing it at the expense of other investors , ” he said .
McCaughan said he had no proof of wrongdoing , yet he suspected it is quite likely the leaking of information may have happened .
“ If it has , it would at best be unfair to other investors and perhaps criminal , ” he said .
A furor over the extent of computerized trading erupted this summer when news of the enormous profits being garnered rankled a public already apprehensive about a crisis rooted in Wall Street -- whose bailout the taxpayer is footing .
Critics fear an errant computer code , similar to the program trading behind the Black Monday crash of 1987 , could engender another deep market plunge .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is taking months to investigate all this .
With high - frequency trading spreading quickly from its U.S. equity base , the regulator ’s response will be crucial for capital markets around the world .
Key to any discussion of high - frequency trading is the tape , which records the price , time , size and order of trades .
It ’s the day ’s financial narrative , and its availability is held up as a major reason why the U.S. equity markets are trusted for their transparency and fairness .
The tape is also highly prized by traders , who base their computer instructions , called algorithms , on this data .
The Nasdaq Stock Market produces about 50 gigabytes of information every day , which is measured in nanoseconds -- or a billionth of a second .
Lotus Capital Management LP of New York earlier this year realized that a competitor was beating it to a trade it had programed by exactly 3 microseconds , day after day .
The loss meant Lotus was forfeiting about $ 1,000 in daily revenue on that particular trading strategy .
Lotus , a quantitative trading firm that uses high - frequency strategies , invested and tinkered , eventually shaving five microseconds from the router and two microseconds from the execution server .
“ By just reading the tape you can see a lot of what the other guys are doing .
You can see who is successful .
So eventually everyone is operating more or less the same strategy , ” said Louis Liu , the 37 - year - old founder of Lotus .
BROKER -DEALER MODEL UNDER FIRE
Operators like Lotus have changed the nature of the business .
Small start - ups can launch with less than $ 1 million , and are creating enormous cost pressures on established broker - dealers and others that can’t keep up , Liu said .
“ That ’s where a lot of the complaints are coming from .
We ’re driving the spreads down and squeezing the profit margins , ” he said .
Legacy operators know what needs to be done , “ but they ’re not willing to cannibalize their existing business , ” he added .
Being nimble is key to success .
Narang said he and his partners at Tradeworx realized a couple of years ago that high - frequency traders were “ eating the lunch ” of its hedge fund business .
In response , Narang moved into fast trading and incorporated those techniques in the hedge fund .
The firm began targeting math whizzes very selectively .
Last year , just six of 1,500 resumes led to jobs at Tradeworx , one of several firms setting up shop in up - and - coming Red Bank , a former manufacturing hub .
Others agree with Liu that the recent cries of foul play and other criticisms of electronic trading are coming from those who have been displaced in the lucrative brokerage business .
“ The broker - dealer business model is dying , and you have massive over - capacity , ” said Harold Bradley , chief investment officer at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City , where he oversees $ 1.7 billion in assets .
“ You do n’t need a dealer to put you and me together through three other brokers in a Nasdaq stock .
There should be fewer people in the business . ”
Several incidents this summer underscored the secrecy and money to be made from high - frequency trading .
The FBI in July arrested a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N computer programer for allegedly stealing trade secrets .
The bank later reported blowout second - quarter earnings , bolstered by $ 10.78 billion in trading income .
When TABB Group estimated $ 21.8 billion was earned annually in high - frequency trading , the media pounced on the issue .
Yet few critics asked how the size of profit compared to the past .
Rosenblatt Securities pointed out that as far back as 1997 , overall trading on the Nasdaq alone may have generated $ 20 billion in annual brokerage revenue , suggesting that profits were already substantial more than a decade ago .
REGULATOR ’S REPORT LOOMS
Proprietary trading powerhouses Getco and Tradebot , hedge fund Citadel Investment Group and trading desks at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc C.N are some of the industry 's prominent names .
Tradebot and Getco , seen as trailblazers in rapid trading , regularly account for a combined 20 percent of the overall U.S. stock market .
Market sources suggest the firms each trade more than 1 billion shares a day .
Tradeworx trades some 80 million shares per day .
With worries over systemic risk growing , the SEC has jumped into the fray .
It has proposed a ban on so - called flash orders and wants to crack down on the scores of anonymous trading venues known as dark pools .
The regulator plans to issue a report early next year that officials said would focus on whether markets reliant on high - frequency trading are more or less efficient for long - term investors , including those trading small - and mid-cap stocks .
Most fears of a blow - up surround what is known as naked sponsored access , in which brokers allow traders use of their identification to directly trade on exchanges , saving the traders valuable time .
Critics also say the fast traders are less willing to take the other side of trades outside of large - cap stocks , reducing the amount of liquidity in smaller companies .
Politicians also are stirring the pot .
Senator Ted Kaufman has warned high - frequency trading could lead to market chaos and systemic risk .
In October , SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro told Reuters the regulator “ will not hesitate to propose regulatory approaches ” if concerns are “ significant .
The SEC recently hired Richard Bookstaber , a well - known former risk manager at Morgan Stanley MS.N , Salomon Brothers and hedge fund Moore Capital Management , to work in a newly created division designed to identify risks in financial markets .
Bookstaber indicated on his blog in August that he is not particularly worried that high - frequency trading or the use of algorithms will lead to a blow - up .
“ I do n’t think the risk is as big as many are making it out to be , ” he wrote .
Institutional investors mostly complain about alleged unfair advantages and that their trades are being “ gamed . ”

A high cancellation rate for orders has sparked suggestions that the algorithms are deployed to glean information from pending order flows , and then based on that knowledge , race ahead to scoop up trades .
More than 90 percent of orders submitted to the New York Stock Exchange by high - frequency firms are canceled , according to an NYSE Euronext NYX.N official .
Overall , the average daily trade volume of NYSE - listed stocks has more than tripled in five years as of 2008 .
The head trader of a European money manager with more than $ 100 billion in assets said high - frequency traders profit through pattern recognition software to anticipate a trade .
“ It ’s a certain knowledge of what ’s coming .
It ’s not like they ’re guessing what ’s going to happen , they ’re not speculating , ” said the trader , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
And he added emphatically : “ They know . ”
Detractors also question the amount of money the high - speed traders make , especially after holding a stock for only a few seconds .
They wonder what purpose such quick turnover serves .
The market “ is not trading on fundamentals anymore .
It makes no sense , it ’s very frustrating for traders , ” said Alan Valdes , director of floor trading at NYSE member Kabrik Trading .
“ It ’s all programs . ”
‘ NO BARRIER TO ENTRY ’
The criticism has frustrated high - frequency traders , who are increasingly going public to defend their business .
Several said they expect little impact from any new regulation , and expressed confidence that their role in the marketplace would be preserved .
Fast traders are proud they make their money through a battle of wits , believe in the work ethic and do not rely on chummy business ties .
There is talk of forming an association , presumably to quell complaints and educate the public about their business .
“ If you were on Wall Street in the 1990s ... you would need to take guys out to dinner and build relationships , otherwise you could n’t get at the order flow .
And now , if you ’re good ... there ’s no barrier to entry , ” said Cameron Smith , general counsel at Houston - based technology and trading firm Quantlab Financial LLC , which does high - frequency trading .
“ That is a really incredible improvement to the Wall Street environment , ” he said .
“ That ’s how we want markets to work . ”
A sign of the critical role the fast traders have assumed came to the fore last year after the SEC briefly banned the short - selling of financial securities .
Spreads widened and trading volume declined as high - frequency traders cut back on their presence to adjust algorithms .
After the ban was lifted , the high - frequency players came back .
Spreads started collapsing and volume picked up , said Todd Mackedanz , head trader at Fisher Investments , the firm founded by billionaire investor Ken Fisher based in Woodside , California .
“ With that said , they do in a sense play a fairly important role in the marketplace , ” Mackedanz said .
Fisher Investments , like other institutional investors , has set tight price limits and is careful about whom it trades with to try to ensure it gets the best execution possible .
Many investors fear that high - frequency trading may fall prey to bad habits .
In 1994 , for instance , an academic study found that a large number of Nasdaq stocks were traded with spreads that were double the minimum , raising the question of whether dealers colluded to maintain wide spreads .
Jean - Marie Eveillard , a legendary investor on Wall Street , said that high - frequency trading strikes him as suspect .
But Eveillard said in an e-mail message that he had no particular insight other than this : “ If in a good mood , I say Wall Street is nothing but a vast promotion machine .
If not , it ’s a den of thieves .
So there is always the possibility of front running , insider trading , market manipulation . ”
HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING STRATEGIES
Any big market move creates ripples on which high - frequency traders feast .
Correlation strategies -- like selling the S&P 500 index exchange traded fund when a blue - chip company misses earnings expectations -- are left to high - frequency players with the most horsepower .
Others are relegated to more complicated techniques , poring over historic trading records in various regions and asset classes .
Market making is the dominant technique , with the top - tier “ ultra high - frequency ” firms -- those trading more than 1 billion shares per day and holding positions for seconds -- relying heavily on gathering the rebates exchanges pay them for posting orders .
If a trader 's bid of $ 15.80 for Bank of America BAC.
N shares is matched , that person might immediately post an offer for the same price , hoping to capture two rebates while breaking even on the spread .
The result , according to several independent proprietary firms , is a flooding of the 50 some U.S. trading venues with orders , and near - immediate execution for investors -- even if the high - frequency trader on the other side of the trade walks away with one - tenth of a penny per share , on average .
A misunderstood dynamic of high - frequency trading is that it thrives off volatility , thereby reducing it .
The clear winners in the revolution are small investors , who have seen their trading costs fall remarkably and markets price shares far more efficiently .
" Most of our clients really do n't spend a lot of energy worrying about the last penny on a trade , or the last two pennies , " Charles Schwab , founder of Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O , the largest U.S. discount brokerage , said last month during a Web cast business update .
“ We think the liquidity components are perfectly satisfactory . ”
SECRECY AND SUCCESS
The 2000 decision to price quotes in decimals of a dollar was probably the most important in a series of U.S. rule changes in the last dozen years that sowed the seeds of high - frequency trading .
A spread of 25 cents for a Nasdaq stock was not uncommon 15 years ago , when market makers and floor specialists had fixed commissions and wooed clients to win business .
The late 1990s introduction of alternative trading venues was another regulatory turning point , as well as a 2005 “ trade - through ” rule that ensured investors get the best U.S. bid or offer , no matter where it was .
Transactions are dramatically faster , and the duration of time long - term investors own securities has been shortened .
Eighteen months is now considered very long , compared with two or three years about half a decade ago .
Another complaint that haunts high - frequency trading is secrecy -- not just around their firms ’ strategies but even who they are .
A number of firms declined to be interviewed by Reuters .
“ People think that high - frequency trading firms ... are secretive because they ’re doing something untoward , ” Narang said .
“ Really the reason they ’re secretive is because as soon as they spill the beans other people can compete with what they ’re doing . ”
All Wall Street firms want to stay under the radar screen , said Robert Olman , president of Alpha Search Advisory Partners , an executive search firm for hedge funds and prop shops .
“ Once you ’re successful , once you have a system that ’s making money , you become very secretive because it ’s very easy for one of your guys to leave and replicate it , ” he said .
That ’s the reason behind Coca - Cola Co ’s closely guarded formula for making Coke , he said .
“ What are the exact ingredients and proportions of Coca - Cola ?
Is there something wrong going on at Coca - Cola ? ” he said .
“ That ’s the point .
It ’s replication , ease of replication .
The barriers to entry , to competing , are not too high . ”
A shopkeeper from Bethlehem who was branded a terrorist in Sacha Baron Cohen 's film Bruno is seeking $ 110 m ( £ 67.5 m ) in damages .
Ayman Abu Aita is suing Baron Cohen , US talk show host David Letterman and others for libel and slander according to a lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia federal court last week .
The actor and comic Baron Cohen plays a gay Austrian fashion journalist in the film , which was released in the UK in July .
Keen to become what he calls " the most famous Austrian since Hitler , " Bruno travels to the middle east , and in a short interview with Abu Aita , asks to be kidnapped in an attempt to become famous .
A caption labels Abu Aita as a member of the militant al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigade , the armed wing of the Fatah movement .
He is a member of the board of the Holy Land trust , a non-profit organisation that works on Palestinian community - building .
Cohen was interviewed on David Letterman 's talkshow in the US , and said finding a " terrorist " to interview for the movie took several months and some help from a CIA contact .
He said he had feared for his safety during the interview with Abu Aita , which he claimed took place at a secret location .
According to the lawsuit , however , the interview with Abu Aita took place at a hotel chosen by Cohen in a part of the West Bank that was under Israeli military control .
The film 's distributor , NBC Universal , and the director , Larry Charles , are also named in the proceedings .
Abu Aita case is that before the film he " enjoyed a good reputation for honesty and a peaceable nature " in his community .
His lawyers write that any accusations or insinuations that Abu Aita is or ever was associated with the al - Aqsa Martyrs '
Brigade , or any other terrorist activity , is " utterly false and untrue . "
His US lawyer , Joseph Peter Drennan , said Abu Aita was never offered a release to sign to appear in the film .
" This is an important lawsuit because it is about the dignity of a specific person .
It is about his reputation , about his standing in the community . "
Drennan said he expects a hearing in late January .
Hatem Abu Ahmad , Abu Aita 's Arab - Israeli lawyer , said Baron Cohen made millions " on the back of my client . "
His 2006 film Borat also attracted lawsuits , including one for $ 30 m from two residents of the Romanian hamlet where Borat 's " home town " scenes were filmed .
Most of the cases were thrown out .
Bennet willing to sacrifice seat over health vote
Sen. Michael Bennet ( D - Colo . ) said Sunday that he will vote for landmark health care reform legislation even if it means he will be defeated at the polls next November .
" If you get to the final point and you are a critical vote for health care reform , and every piece of evidence tells you , if you support that bill , you will lose your job , would you cast the vote and lose your job ?
" CNN's John King asked Bennet on the " State of the Union " program .
" Yes , " said Bennet , a former Denver public schools chief who was appointed to the Senate by Colorado 's governor when President Barack Obama tapped Ken Salazar to be interior secretary .
King warned Bennet that the video of his vow would be sequestered in the event he is voted out next year .
" All right .
That tape will be held -- I hate to tell you that , but that tape will be held right now , " the CNN host said .
I met a Parisian woman in London in my early 20s who looked every inch the French film star .
She told me she had a boyfriend back home and a lover on the side .
She was perfect .
There was no doubt in my mind that I would get her into bed .
My confidence with women had moved seamlessly from awkwardness to arrogance in a few short , promiscuous years .
While lying next to her after sex I went through the well - worn routine of amazement , emptiness and dread .
This toxic combination of emotions always led to the eject button .
I watched her walk down the street in the blazing sunshine feeling proud at yet another conquest , bemused that I was letting such an amazing woman walk away and fully committed to the next encounter .
I 'm sensitive ; to people , places , sounds , everything .
Discovering how to use this sensitivity to my advantage was key to getting what I wanted with women .
I 'd walk up to the best - looking woman in the street and nervously start talking .
I 'd be exactly how I felt : fundamentally shy , sweet and honest .
The threat of humiliation and rejection was intoxicating .
What truly disturbed me was my ability to use my honesty to get so many women into bed under the guise that I was interested in them long term .
Back then it was never going to be anything other than sex .
I got blamed for my behaviour .
Blacklisted as a " typical bloke " .
" You 're all the bloody same . "
I was confronted , shouted at , slapped , punched , threatened with a shotgun , a handgun and an oversized knife .
All it did was make the hit of success that much sweeter .
I was always clear at the beginning of each encounter : " I 'm not available for a relationship , I like you , think you 're gorgeous , smart and I want to sleep with you . "
It never ceased to amaze me how often this worked .

I had a limited number of nights with each woman in which to get commitment - free , adrenalin - fuelled sex without reprisal .
After the second night a bond would form .
If we were greedy enough to pursue a third , trouble would follow .
I 'd brace myself for the wrath of the woman who'd entered the affair eyes wide open who nearly always flipped to bitter anger when I chose to stick to our " deal " .
There was little or no culpability from the women I slept with .
We were consenting adults who'd made a choice .
They seemed set on being the innocent victim , marking me the predatory abuser .
As long I could keep my emotions shut down I could deal with the fall - out .
Living in Ireland in my early 30s I finally met my match in the guise of a beautiful 19 - year - old whose emotional damage and alcoholic Jekyll - and - Hyde personality beat mine hands down .
It was the best sex I 'd ever had .
And with it came more grief and stress than I 'd ever experienced .
I went insane with lust and obsession .
I fled the country lovesick , empty and distraught .
Soon after arriving back in England I met a woman on a train .
I watched her sashay down the carriage aisle with her coffee in her hand displaying a dress code that said quite simply , " I 'm game " .
Within five hours she was at my flat .
We were together a year .
I was convinced I loved her .
The foundation of the relationship was good sex .
When my initial passion began to wane I found it hard to say no to her advances .
When I did she reacted badly and I ended the relationship within a week .
I could do this ; open up very quickly , an unusual and appealing trait , but I 'd also learnt to shut down at the slightest hint of trouble .
I realised in retrospect that as long as the sex was regular , my train lover felt loved .
I could n't face the pressure of having to carry on performing like a sex monkey so she could feel that kind of love .
The simple and sad fact was at the end of this relationship we both felt the same , unloved .
I re-entered the world of the single man looking for sex at every turn .
I objectified women in bed , in magazines and on the screen .
There was a lurking sense of the absence of morality and human decency in my behaviour but as long as I kept a constant stream of women in my life , the potentials , actuals and the fantasies , I could keep the creeping demons of guilt and shame at bay .
One evening I was on the phone to a former sex partner whom I 'd dumped three months before .
She lured me into a bizarre sex texting game that I thought was private .
She 'd decided to teach me a lesson in front of a group of female friends who were following and advising her every response .
When she told me what she 'd been doing , how much she detested me and what her friends thought of me , the humiliation burnt deep enough to break through my denial about the effects of my behaviour .
Freaked out and desperate , I sought help .
I went to therapy and joined a recovery group for people trying to stop addictive sexual behaviours .
It was a powerful place to be .
Although clearly on my knees with pain and shame , I spent the first few months trying to convince myself there must be some mistake ; surely I was in the wrong place ?
As I listened to the other people talking honestly about their behaviours and got myself some support , I began to gradually thaw out from decades of the emotional anaesthesia brought on by my addiction to sex .
I was horrified at how painful the process was .
I remember thinking " I can't do this " .
I was unable to walk to the shops without melting down into an anxiety attack .
Behind the white noise of doubt something quieter and stronger told me I could do it .
Over months , I began to discover ways to forgive myself .
It began by looking at my face in the mirror every day for two years .
I would look into my eyes and tell myself I was OK ; I deserved to be alive .
I held the daily gaze despite the voice that beamed doubt and hatred back at me .
Then the grinding , repetitive affirmations about being a decent , loving human being with something to give back to the world .
I grew to believe it .
I then began the slow , painful process of making amends to the women I 'd harmed .
This was a scary part of my recovery involving hard , broken - glass honesty .
I was screamed at to ' fuck off ' by one woman .
Approaching a former sex partner with an apology had to be clean and free from any childish desire to let her know " I was good , now better " .
It had to be about her , not me .
If there was any doubt about my motivation or that they did n't want to have anything more to do with me , I would n't approach them .
The times I was able to make clear and real amends were powerful healing experiences I cherish .
I carried on going to the support groups ; made friends with people I would normally cross the road to avoid and began to look deeper into why I 'd been running so hard for so long .
My addiction to sex was , in part , my way of dealing with the abuse I experienced when I was 12 by a man old enough to be my father when my real father was in prison .
I 'd buried this under the sincere belief that because I was consenting I had no justifiable complaint – another barrier of denial .
I contacted the police and went through excruciating interviews in a bid to track down my abuser .
We never found him .
The process was enough to lay the ghost to rest .
I write and run writing workshops for a living .
I 've found a way to use my experiences in sex addiction and ongoing recovery to work with others in the same situation .
Three years after I got into recovery meetings I was approached to run a writing workshop in a sex offender prison .
I wondered if I 'd see my abuser .
Standing in the main wing waiting to be taken to the classroom was a turning point in my life .
I realised something had come full circle ; something had healed .
If I could do that , I could do anything .
My slow sexual healing led to genuine confidence and self - esteem .
I began to feel brave enough to start looking for a long - term relationship .
I got into progressively healthier , much more honest sexual relationships with women .
In my sixth year of sex addiction recovery I met the woman who would become my wife .
It was no fairy - tale ending .
I 'd learnt to stop my sexual acting out but embarking on a long term relationship was a terrifying prospect .
This straight - talking northern lass was able to spot and deal with the remaining fragments of my old ways .
There was no way I was going to get her into bed until it was clear to her , and me , that I genuinely loved her .
Normally I 'd have been off in search of greener , easier pastures .
With my new - found sexual sobriety I decided to stick with this street - smart , blindingly honest woman .
What my wife helped me realise was that the women I 'd been with had chosen to accept my passionate advances as a sign of love , as a sign they were loveable .
When I cut the affairs short it said they were n't .
My wife understood this , held a firm boundary and loved me clean and clear .
It was the making of our relationship .
I read that women seek sex through intimacy and men seek intimacy through sex .
We 're looking for the same thing , but have different ways of finding it .
Myself and the women I 'd slept with had settled for a lot less than we were worth .
Today , I put as much energy into my recovery as I did my addictive sexual behaviour .
I go to my recovery meetings weekly .
I attend a men's group , have mentors and mentor others .
I work with sex offenders and help lead the recovery meetings that , in a nutshell , saved my life .
It is still very hard work at times .
But most of the time , I love it .
Sex was a separate , dark and destructive part of me , set up as a child to keep me safe and separate from a world I saw as dangerous .
At last , I 'm integrating my sexuality into my life in a way that is boundaried , healthy and genuinely loving .

For those of you who hoped – or worried – that the Obama administration would mean a big cut to defense spending , think again .
The Office of Management and Budget " has approved a nearly $ 60 billion increase in the Pentagon 's base budget between fiscal years 2011 and 2015 , " InsideDefense.com reports .
That includes an extra $ 15 billion for the next fiscal year – " a 2.7 percent increase after inflation .
This boost " would bring non-war related military spending in FY - 11 to $ 556.4 billion . "
The decision is n't final - the President has n't approved of it , yet .
But if the extra cash is okayed , it wo n't be used to pay for more tanks or fighter jets , InsideDefense.com notes .
" A sizable portion of the additional funds would pay for unforeseen DOD health care bills . "
UPDATE : The Defense Department claims personnel costs will run about $ 136 billion .
The Progressive Policy Institute 's Jim Arkedis says that 's way , way off .
" The real price tag is much bigger : $ 301.1 billion each year , 121 percent higher than the Pentagon ’s figure .
In other words , if you want major savings in defense spending , cutting weapons systems and the ever - elusive ' waste , fraud and abuse ' wo n’t take you far enough . "

The Baucus Bill : The Worst Policy in the Bill , and Possibly in the World
Baucus 's bill retains the noxious " free rider " provision on employers .
Rather than a simple employer mandate that forces every employer over a certain size to provide health - care insurance or pay a small fee , the free rider approach penalizes employers for hiring low - income workers who are eligible for subsidies .
That will create an incentive to do one of two things :
Do n't hire low - income workers ( hire a teenager looking for a job rather than a single mother , or hire a housewife looking for a second job rather than an unemployed breadwinner ) , or hire illegal immigrants .
And it actually gets worse .
The employer pays more if the low - income worker needs subsidies for his family as opposed to just himself .
So it not only discriminates against low - income workers , but it particularly discriminates against low - income parents .
Single mothers will get the worst deal , as they have lower incomes , and as you might expect , children who need health care .
The penalty itself is a bit confusing , and if anything , even worse than one might imagine :
The employer will pay the lesser of A ) the average subsidy in the exchange times the number of subsidized workers or B ) $ 400 times the total number of workers .
Two examples should clarify this :
Baucus Corp has 100 employees and does not offer health - care coverage .
Thirty of the employees receive subsidies on the exchange .
The average subsidy that year is $ 5,000 .
Baucus Corp woulds pay $ 400 times 100 employees , as $ 40,000 is less than $ 150,000 ( $ 5,000 times 30 employees ) .
Each of those low - income employees is costing Baucus Corp $ 1,333 more than an employee who did n't need subsidies .
Now imagine that Baucus Corp. only has five employees who need subsidies , and the average subsidy that year is $ 5,000 .
In that scenario , Baucus Corp would pay $ 25,000 rather than $ 40,000 , because $ 25,000 is less than $ 40,000 .
Each low - income worker now costs Baucus Corp.
$ 5,000 more than a worker who does n't need subsidies .
So in the scenario where Baucus Corp. has a lot of low - income workers , they cost a huge amount overall because they 're multiplied against the total number of workers .
In the scenario where Baucus Corp. has a few low - income workers , they cost a huge amount individually because they 're multiplied against the average subsidy cost .
No matter how you look at it , the policy makes it profitable for employers to discriminate against hiring low - income workers .
It is not only the worst policy idea in the bill , but one of the worst policy ideas I 've ever seen .
Update : Originally , this post did n't include one of the penalty options , as I was basically confused on how it worked and thought it would apply too rarely to be worth mentioning .
I reread the section , though , and corrected the post to offer a fuller picture of this no good , very bad , horrible policy .

Florida coach Urban Meyer has been fined $ 30,000 by the Southeastern Conference for public comments he made regarding a call he believes officials missed during last week 's game against Georgia , the conference announced Friday .
It 's the first time the SEC has fined a coach under bylaws the conference toughened late last month , following a spate of public comments by SEC coaches questioning calls and criticizing officials .
" Coach Meyer has violated the Southeastern Conference code of ethics , " commissioner Mike Slive said .
" SEC bylaw 10.5.4 clearly states that the coaches , players and support personnel shall refrain from public criticism of officials .
The league 's athletics directors and presidents and chancellors have made it clear that negative public comments on officiating are not acceptable . "
Meyer , in a statement , said he respected the decision and apologized .
" As I stated last week , I have great respect for Commissioner Mike Slive and the Southeastern Conference and I respect this decision , " Meyer said .
" There was no intent to criticize an official after being asked about a situation that occurred last Saturday and I apologize for my remarks . "
On Wednesday , Meyer said he believed SEC officials missed a late hit on quarterback Tim Tebow in Saturday 's game against Georgia .
Meyer said the crew calling the game should have flagged Bulldogs linebacker Nick Williams for knocking Tebow to the ground well after he had gotten rid of the football .
He did n't mention the play until asked about it Wednesday , possibly trying to avoid drawing punishment from the league .
He also prefaced his comments by saying he has " great respect " for SEC officials and the way the league handles complaints .
The SEC decided to stop handing out reprimands for ripping officials -- and start handing out fines and suspensions -- after three coaches in less than a week were reprimanded last month .
Slive , in his eighth season with the conference , was given full discretion by the league 's athletic directors and presidents to hand out the punishment on a case - by - case basis .
The change in league bylaws was unanimously approved by the conference 's university presidents and athletic directors .
The SEC 's officiating , and public complaints by Tennessee 's Lane Kiffin and Mississippi State 's Dan Mullen , has drawn plenty of unwanted attention for the league .
An officiating crew was suspended last month after it called penalties the league said were not supported by video evidence in the LSU - Georgia game Oct. 3 and the Arkansas - Florida game Oct. 17 .
The SEC publicly announced the suspensions , an unprecedented move by the conference .

Spain 's autonomous region of Extremadura has sparked a bit of a rumpus by issuing an educational leaflet entitled Pleasure is in your hands , detailing the best way to achieve solo satisfaction .
The offending literature is part of a € 14,000 campaign aimed at raising sexual awareness among the region 's 14 to 17 - year - olds , and although the initiative covers a range of issues , the right wing has chosen to focus its predictable criticism on the masturbation guide .
The Partido Popular's * local opposition leader Hernández Carrón slammed it as a waste of money and an insult to young people 's intelligence .
He insisted that if teens " do n't how to masturbate or whether they should masturbate or not , that 's a personal matter for the young person , which should be dealt with at home " .
He demanded those responsible for the outrage be held to account for making Extremadura " the laughing stock of Spain " .
The public appear to agree .
Down at La Vanguardia newspaper , one commenter notes : " Are youngsters today so thick that they have to use a leaflet to learn how to crack one off ?
We used to teach ourselves , and it did n't cost the government a penny . " ®
Bootnote
* The PP 's leader , Mariano Rajoy , has yet to blame president José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero for the Extremadura outrage .
This is a bit surprising , since he blames the poor bloke for everything else - from the global economic crisis to some Madrid pensioner 's pet cat getting stuck up a tree .
And yet , there are no consequences .
It 's unlikely anyone will ever stand trial for the slaughter of countless innocents in Iraq - but at least the truth is coming out in England .
If only it would happen here :
Military commanders are expected to tell the inquiry into the Iraq war , which opens on Tuesday , that the invasion was ill - conceived and that preparations were sabotaged by Tony Blair 's government 's attempts to mislead the public .
They were so shocked by the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion that they believe members of the British and US governments at the time could be prosecuted for war crimes by breaching the duty outlined in the Geneva convention to safeguard civilians in a conflict , the Guardian has been told .
The lengths the Blair government took to conceal the invasion plan and the extent of military commanders ' anger at what they call the government 's " appalling " failures emerged as Sir John Chilcot , the inquiry 's chairman , promised to produce a " full and insightful " account of how Britain was drawn into the conflict .
Fresh evidence has emerged about how Blair misled MPs by claiming in 2002 that the goal was " disarmament , not regime change " .
Documents show the government wanted to hide its true intentions by informing only " very small numbers " of officials .
The documents , leaked to the Sunday Telegraph , are " post- operational reports " and " lessons learned " papers compiled by the army and its field commanders .
They refer to a " rushed " operation that caused " significant risk " to troops and " critical failure " in the postwar period .
One commander said the government " missed a golden opportunity " to win support from Iraqis .
Another commented : " It was not unlike 1750s colonialism where the military had to do everything ourselves " .
One , describing the supply chain , added : " I know for a fact that there was one container full of skis in the desert " .
[...]
Significantly , the documents support what officials have earlier admitted – that the army was not allowed to prepare properly for the Iraq invasion in 2002 so as not to alert parliament and the UN that Blair was already determined to go to war .
The documents add : " In Whitehall , the internal operational security regime , in which only very small numbers of officers and officials were allowed to become involved [ in Iraq invasion preparations ] constrained broader planning for combat operations and subsequent phases effectively until Dec 23 2002 . "
Blair had in effect promised George Bush that he would join the US - led invasion when , as late as July 2002 , he was denying to MPs that preparations were being made for military action .
The leaked documents reveal that " from March 2002 or May at the latest there was a significant possibility of a large - scale British operation " .
The dinosaur was approximately 70 cm from nose to tail
A new species of dinosaur has been identified 30 years after its fossilised remains were discovered .
Fruitadens haagarorum , researchers say , is one of the smallest dinosaurs known to science .
In the Royal Society journal Proceedings B , the researchers say that the dinosaur weighed less that 1kg .
The fossils have been housed at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County since being discovered in Colorado in 1979 .
According to the researchers , the tiny dinosaur was agile and a fast runner .
It lived in the Upper Jurassic period , about 150 million years ago .
It was a member of a group of dinosaurs called the ornithischians , which were largely plant - eating creatures that included the far more imposing Triceratops and Stegosaurus .
It would have darted between the legs of some of the largest known long - necked sauropods , such as Brachiosaurus .
A study of its tiny jawbone revealed that the animal was likely an omnivore
The study that identified the diminutive creature was led by Richard Butler from the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontology in Munich , Germany .
He told BBC News that examination of the dinosaur 's teeth had revealed Fruitadens was probably an omnivore - eating smaller animals as well as vegetation .
" This is unusual for that group - most of them were strict herbivores , " he said .
" But if you 're small , it 's hard to feed on just vegetation , as it's difficult to digest . "
Bigger animals with much larger guts were better able to survive on a plant - only diet .
The genus nameFruitadens refers to the area of Fruita in Colorado , where the fossils were first discovered .
" Fruitadens comes from a series of rocks , the Morrison Formation , which palaeontologists have studied intensively for 130 years , and from which dozens of dinosaur species are already known , " said Dr Butler .
" Yet it is still possible to discover completely unique and remarkable species .
If dinosaur ecosystems were that diverse , who knows what astonishing beasts are waiting for us to discover ? "

A blast from a heat gun has turned most of the black tile in this image white .
Anyone who has ever stepped barefoot onto blacktop pavement on a hot sunny day knows the phenomenon very well :
Black surfaces absorb the sun ’s heat very efficiently , producing a toe - scorching surface .
In the wintertime , that can be a good thing : A dark roof heats up in the sun and helps reduce your heating bill .
But in summertime , it ’s definitely a bad thing :
Your house gets even hotter , and your air conditioning has to work harder .
In most places , the summertime penalty is greater than the wintertime gain , it turns out , so that ’s why many people , including U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu , strongly advocate switching to white roofs .
It ’s no small matter .
In fact , Chu says that turning all the world ’s roofs white would eliminate as much greenhouse gas emissions in 20 years as the whole world produces in a year .
But some critics point out that in northern cities , the gain in summer could be outweighed by the loss in winter .
The ideal situation , then , would be to get the advantage of white roofs when it ’s hot and black roofs when it ’s cold .
Now , there may be a way to have both .
A team of recent MIT graduates has developed roof tiles that change color based on the temperature .
The tiles become white when it ’s hot , allowing them to reflect away most of the sun ’s heat .
When it ’s cold they turn black and absorb heat just when it ’s needed .
The team ’s lab measurements show that in their white state , the tiles reflect about 80 percent of the sunlight falling on them , while when black they reflect only about 30 percent .
That means in their white state , they could save as much as 20 percent of present cooling costs , according to recent studies .
Savings from the black state in winter have yet to be quantified .
The team , which the students call Thermeleon ( rhymes with chameleon , because of its color - changing property ) , was one of the competitors in this year ’s Making and Designing Materials Engineering Contest ( MADMEC ) , a competition for teams of MIT students ( or 2009 graduates ) .
Now in its third year , the contest this year was specifically devoted to projects aimed at improving energy efficiency through innovative uses of materials .
The final showdown was held Wednesday night , and the Thermeleon team took first place , earning $ 5,000 in the process .
Nick Orf PhD ’09 , a member of the Thermeleon team , explains that he and his teammates originally tried to develop a color - shifting roof tile using a system of mixed fluids , one dark and one light , whose density would change with temperature : the dark substance would float to the top when it was cold , and white would float when it was hot .
But the system proved too complicated , and instead they hit on a simpler , less expensive method .
Now , they use a common commercial polymer ( in one version , one that is commonly used in hair gels ) in a water solution .
That solution is encapsulated — between layers of glass and plastic in their original prototype , and between flexible plastic layers in their latest version — with a dark layer at the back .
When the temperature is below a certain level ( which they can choose by varying the exact formulation ) , the polymer stays dissolved , and the black backing shows through , absorbing the sun ’s heat .
But when the temperature climbs , the polymer condenses to form tiny droplets , whose small sizes scatter light and thus produce a white surface , reflecting the sun ’s heat .
They are now working on an even simpler version in which the polymer solution would be micro-encapsulated and the tiny capsules carried in a clear paint material that could be brushed or sprayed onto any existing surface .
The tiny capsules would still have the color - changing property , but the surface could easily be applied over an existing black roof , much more inexpensively than installing new roofing material .
Although they have not yet made specific plans for forming a business to commercialize their concept , Orf says the team members are determined to pursue the project and develop it into a marketable product .
Because the materials are common and inexpensive , team members think the tiles could be manufactured at a price comparable to that of conventional roofing materials — although that wo n’t be known for sure until they determine the exact materials and construction of their final version .
The biggest remaining question is over durability , and answering it will require spending some time to do accelerated testing by running the material through repeated hot - cold cycles .
Hashem Akbari , leader of the Heat Island Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California , is a long - time advocate of white roofs as an energy - saving measure .
He says that some other groups , including a team at the University of Athens , have done research on the use of color - changing materials for roofs , but that in those tests , “ the cost and durability has been a serious issue . ”
The Thermeleon team hopes to address those concerns .
“ It ’s got to stand up to very harsh conditions , ” Orf says .
“ Those sorts of tests would have to be done before we ’ll know if we have a viable product . ”

Fisichella poses in Ferrari team kit at the factory Giancarlo Fisichella will drive for Ferrari for the rest of the 2009 Formula 1 season before taking a new role as their reserve driver in 2010 .
The Italian , 36 , will replace Luca Badoer as stand - in for the injured Felipe Massa for the final five races .
" It has always been an ambition , " said Fisichella , who has been released from his contract with Force India .
Force India are yet to name a replacement for Fisichella with reserve driver Vitantonio Liuzzi the favourite .
Fisichella , who formerly raced for Minardi , Jordan , Benetton , Renault and Sauber , will begin his Ferrari career on home soil at the Italian Grand Prix on 13 September .
Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali confirmed the appointment saying : " We considered what could be his role inside the team in the near future , also taking this year 's experiences into account .
He will be the reserve driver in 2010 .
" We have chosen Fisichella because we can expect him to make a valuable contribution in this final part of the season .
606 : DEBATE
Now we will see how good a driver Fisichella is , since we can compare him to Kimi
Prakhar1
" He has shown , throughout his long career , that he is fast and competitive and we are therefore proud to be able to run an Italian driver in our home race . "
Force India team principal Mallya had insisted on Tuesday that he would turn out his regular team for Monza .
But after extensive discussions with Ferrari , Mallya has agreed to release Fisichella from his contract , which was due to expire at the end of the season .
" For any Italian driver , a Ferrari race seat is a long - held dream and for Giancarlo it was no exception , " Mallya said .
" No - one should stand in the way of this .
" The agreement will secure Fisichella 's long - term future with Ferrari and it would be incorrect to jeopardise this .
" We would like to stress that we have not agreed any financial settlement with Ferrari and would like to thank Giancarlo for all his help over the past one - and - a - half seasons and for our first world championship points . "
Fisichella 's parting gift to Force India was second place at the Belgium Grand Prix , handing the team their first podium and points in their second season in F1 .
Even before his impressive performance at Spa - Francorchamps , the 36 - year - old had been tipped to replace Badoer , who has struggled since his promotion from Ferrari reserve driver .
Badoer was drafted in to replace Massa , who suffered serious head injuries at the Hungarian Grand Prix , after legendary seven - time F1 champion Michael Schumacher was forced to shelve his comeback plans .
I hope I have helped Force India grow up and be on the right path to achieve their own ambitions
Giancarlo Fisichella
While Massa is targeting a return in 2010 , the Italian team ran out of patience with Badoer , who qualified last at both the European and Belgian GPs .
While Kimi Raikkonen claimed Ferrari 's first win of 2009 in Spa , his team - mate trailed in last , nearly 48 seconds slower than the driver in front .
" We wish to thank Luca Badoer for the team spirit he demonstrated in these circumstances , " added Domenicali .
" It is a shame he was unable to show his true worth in these last two races , tackled under conditions which anyone would have found difficult . "
Fisichella , a veteran of more than 200 grands prix , will be expected to be much more competitive as Ferrari prepare to race in front of their enthusiastic home fans in Monza .
" I am grateful to Vijay Mallya for allowing me this opportunity , " said Fisichella , a three - time race winner .
" For Vijay to have allowed it to become a reality is very generous and I hope in my turn I have helped Force India grow up and be on the right path to achieve their own ambitions . "

From WikiLeaks
October 5 , 2009
By Mail Online [ 1 ]
The Ministry of Defence was left embarrassed tonight after its internal guide to preventing leaks appeared on the internet .
The Defence Manual of Security sets out tactics for preventing Chinese and Russian intelligence services from using blackmail or hi-tech gadgets to obtain sensitive information .
It also describes methods of countering the threat from ' subversive or terrorist organisations ' and investigative journalists .
The three - volume , 560,000 - word guide - marked ' Restricted ' - was released on the Wikileaks website , which campaigns for freedom of information .
But the MoD insisted the publication did not pose ' significant security concerns ' because it dates from 2001 .
The document branded Chinese intelligence activity ' widespread ' , with a ' voracious appetite for all kinds of information ' .
While China was 'at least a generation behind the West ' in key military areas , it was trying to ' acquire illegally the technology that will enable them to catch up ' .
' The real danger is that they will then produce advanced weapons systems which they will sell to unstable regimes , ' the manual stated .
' They have a track record of doing so .
The consequences for the world 's trouble spots and any UK involvement there could be disastrous . '
The guide said Beijing 's technique was to ' make friends ' rather than ' run agents ' .
' Although there are Chinese ' intelligence officers ' , both civilian and military , these fade into insignificance behind the mass of ordinary students , businessmen and locally employed staff who are working ( at least part - time ) on the orders of various parts of the State intelligence gathering apparatus . '
The Chinese were described as ' expert flatterers ' , who were ' well aware of the ' softening ' effect of food and alcohol ' .
' Under cover of consultation or lecturing , a visitor may be given favours , advantageous economic conditions or commercial opportunities .
' In return they will be expected to give information or access to material .
Or , at the very least , to speak out on China 's behalf ( becoming an ' agent of influence ' ) . '
The document also warned that blackmail was commonly used .
' Sexual involvement should be avoided , as should any activity which can possible be construed as illegal , ' it said .
' This would include dealing in black market currency or Chinese antiques and artefacts , straying into ' forbidden ' areas or injudicious use of a camera or video recorder . '
On the Russian intelligence threat , the manual insisted : ' We know it sounds like a spy movie , but as well as having wide networks of agents and informers , the FSB ( Russian security service ) makes extensive use of sophisticated technical devices .
' In the main hotels all telephones can be tapped and in some rooms visual or photographic surveillance can be carried out , if necessary using infrared cameras to take photographs in the dark .
' It is perfectly possible for the FSB to ensure that the visitor is placed in such a room .
There is also a wide range of technical devices , which can be used outside and even in places such as restaurants and cars .
' These technical devices pick up indiscreet talk which could be of use to the FSB . '
The guide highlighted investigative journalists as a threat , alongside terrorist groups and curious members of the public .
' The consequences of leaks of official information are considered serious when they undermine government policy or cause embarrassment to the government , ' it stated .
According to the manual , threats to security of official information were 'less likely to arise from positive acts of counter - espionage , than from leakage of information through disaffected members of staff , or as a result of the attentions of an investigative journalist , or simply by accident or carelessness ' .
A MoD spokeswoman said : ' We can confirm that the Wikileaks website has published an old version of the Defence Manual of Security ( Joint Service Protocol 440 ) dating from 2001 .
' The document is marked Restricted as current MoD policy is to keep our security policies and procedures private but the publication of an old version of this document does not raise significant security concerns . '

It 's not often that an appellate court decision reflects so vividly what a country has become , but such is the case with yesterday 's ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Arar v. Ashcroft ( .pdf ) .
Maher Arar is both a Canadian and Syrian citizen of Syrian descent .
A telecommunications engineer and graduate of Montreal 's McGill University , he has lived in Canada since he 's 17 years old .
In 2002 , he was returning home to Canada from vacation when , on a stopover at JFK Airport , he was ( a ) detained by U.S. officials , ( b ) accused of being a Terrorist , ( c ) held for two weeks incommunicado and without access to counsel while he was abusively interrogated , and then ( d ) was " rendered " -- despite his pleas that he would be tortured -- to Syria , to be interrogated and tortured .
He remained in Syria for the next 10 months under the most brutal and inhumane conditions imaginable , where he was repeatedly tortured .
Everyone acknowledges that Arar was never involved with Terrorism and was guilty of nothing .
I 've appended to the end of this post the graphic description from a dissenting judge of what was done to Arar while in American custody and then in Syria .
In January , 2007 , the Canadian Prime Minister publicly apologized to Arar for the role Canada played in these events , and the Canadian government paid him $ 9 million in compensation .
That was preceded by a full investigation by Canadian authorities and the public disclosure of a detailed report which concluded " categorically that there is no evidence to indicate that Mr. Arar has committed any offense or that his activities constituted a threat to the security of Canada . "
By stark and very revealing contrast , the U.S. Government has never admitted any wrongdoing or even spoken publicly about what it did ; to the contrary , it repeatedly insisted that courts were barred from examining the conduct of government officials because what we did to Arar involves " state secrets " and because courts should not interfere in the actions of the Executive where national security is involved .
What does that behavioral disparity between the two nations say about how " democratic , " " accountable , " and " open " the United States is ?
Yesterday , the Second Circuit -- by a vote of 7 - 4 -- agreed with the government and dismissed Arar 's case in its entirety .
It held that even if the government violated Arar 's Constitutional rights as well as statutes banning participation in torture , he still has no right to sue for what was done to him .
Why ?
Because " providing a damages remedy against senior officials who implement an extraordinary rendition policy would enmesh the courts ineluctably in an assessment of the validity of the rationale of that policy and its implementation in this particular case , matters that directly affect significant diplomatic and national security concerns " ( p. 39 ) .
In other words , government officials are free to do anything they want in the national security context -- even violate the law and purposely cause someone to be tortured -- and courts should honor and defer to their actions by refusing to scrutinize them .
Reflecting the type of people who fill our judiciary , the judges in the majority also invented the most morally depraved bureaucratic requirements for Arar to proceed with his case and then claimed he had failed to meet them .
Arar did not , for instance , have the names of the individuals who detained and abused him at JFK , which the majority said he must have .
As Judge Sack in dissent said of that requirement : it " means government miscreants may avoid [ ] liability altogether through the simple expedient of wearing hoods while inflicting injury " ( p. 27 ; emphasis added ) .
The commentary about this case from Harper 's Scott Horton perfectly captures the depravity of what our Government has done -- and continues to do -- to Arar .
His analysis should be read in its entirety , and he concludes with this :
When the history of the Second Circuit is written , the Arar decision will have a prominent place .
It offers all the historical foresight of Dred Scott , in which the Court rallied to the cause of slavery , and all the commitment to constitutional principle of the Slaughter - House Cases , in which the Fourteenth Amendment was eviscerated .
The Court that once affirmed that those who torture are the " enemies of all mankind " now tells us that U.S. government officials can torture without worry , because the security of our state might some day depend upon it .
I want to add one principal point to all of this .
This is precisely how the character of a country becomes fundamentally degraded when it becomes a state in permanent war .
So continuous are the inhumane and brutal acts of government leaders that the citizens completely lose the capacity for moral outrage and horror .
The permanent claims of existential threats from an endless array of enemies means that secrecy is paramount , accountability is deemed a luxury , and National Security trumps every other consideration -- even including basic liberties and the rule of law .
Worst of all , the President takes on the attributes of a protector - deity who can and must never be questioned lest we prevent him from keeping us safe .
This is exactly why I find so objectionable and dangerous the ongoing embrace by the Obama administration of these same secrecy and immunity weapons .
Obama had nothing to do with the Arar case -- all the conduct , and even the legal briefing , occurred before he was President -- but he has taken numerous steps to further institutionalize the core injustice here , including in cases that are quite similar to Arar : namely , that the Executive can use secrecy and national security claims to shield himself from the rule of law , even when he 's accused of torture and war crimes .
That 's exactly what happened here , yet again .

Identically , Judge Calabresi -- one of the most respected and non-ideological appellate judges in the country -- accused the majority of " utter subservience to the executive branch . "
Surely that 's true , but it is n't only the Arar majority that is guilty of that .
It is the nation as a whole -- drowning in infinite claims of " state secrets " and executive immunity and war necessity and the imperatives of " looking forward " -- that has meekly acquiesced to the pernicious idea that the President in an allegedly national security context must never have his actions disclosed , let alone judicially scrutinized and held accountable , no matter how criminal , brutal and inhumane those actions are .
**********************
Here 's Judge 's Sack 's description of what was done to Arar in Syria , which accords perfectly with what the Canadian investigation found -- this is what our Government ( both the executive and judicial branches ) has continuously insisted it can purposely cause to happen without any accountability or even transparency ( pp. 13-15 ) :
Judge Sack 's equally horrific description of exactly what the U.S. did to cause all of that to happen to Arar is here .

Fresh allegations of abuse by the UK military in Iraq do not warrant a new public inquiry , the Armed Forces Minister Bill Rammell has said .
He told the BBC the claims were taken seriously and would be investigated but that allegations did not mean facts .
He said a special unit within the Ministry of Defence , overseen by him , had been set up to examine the claims .
Lawyers for former Iraqi detainees want an inquiry into 33 abuse claims , which include the rape of a 16 - year - old boy .
' Sexually humiliated '
Mr Rammell said there should not be a wider public inquiry because each case first had to be examined and disciplinary action taken if there was evidence of wrongdoing .
He said : " There is no credible evidence that endemic abuse was a coherent part of the way our military operated . "
The " vast , vast majority " of the 120,000 British soldiers who had served in Iraq had adhered to " the highest standards of behaviour , " he added .

Earlier , Mr Rammell told the BBC seven of the allegations had come in within the last month , and the rest date back " significantly beyond that period " .
A public inquiry is already under way into the death of Iraqi civilian Baha Mousa , who died in British custody with 93 separate injuries .
A report by the Independent newspaper said 33 cases of alleged abuse had now come to light .
One claimant alleges he was raped by two British soldiers in 2003 , while others say they were stripped naked , abused and photographed , the Independent said .
Another detainee said that when he was arrested he was kicked and hit , and an electric baton was used on parts of his body .
' Random detentions '
A fellow Iraqi , detained in 2006 , claimed he was sexually humiliated .
The lawyers said that since the British withdrawal from Basra in the summer , they had heard a host of allegations of abuse dating back to 2003 .
Mr Rammell added : " While there have been instances when individuals have behaved badly , only a tiny number of individuals have been shown to have fallen short of our high standards . "
A legal letter was given to the MoD last week by the Iraqis ' lawyer , Phil Shiner .
Mr Shiner is asking for a judicial review of the cases .
I met this boy and it was extremely difficult taking his statement because he broke into tears many times and I had to comfort him
Mazin Younis
He said : " I have it on good authority that there are hundreds of cases that are going uninvestigated .
" But if you are an Iraqi and terrible things have happened to you then how would you know that we have a judicial system in this country to deal with it ?
" My guess is that many of them will remain buried . "
Mazin Younis , the Iraqi human rights campaigner who has been compiling the allegations , said many alleged victims waited years before coming forward because they were afraid of what would happen if they complained .
" They all feared that the British would come back and punish them .
Now the British are out , " he told the BBC .
He said many people were detained at random and abused .
" The norm , kind of is for a large number of troops - 50 to 100 - to raid a house , take all the men with them .
" When I say take them they will be beating , kicking them and hooding them . "
Mr Younis said some of the alleged cases were similar to cases of sexual humiliation seen at the US detention centre Abu Ghraib and that only a full public inquiry would establish what had really happened .
He described meeting the 16 - year - old boy who said he had been raped by two soldiers .
" I met this boy and it was extremely difficult taking his statement because he broke into tears many times and I had to comfort him , " he said .

Who 's afraid of the big bad bad wolf , uh , I mean Tiger ?
Certainly not Greg McElroy .
And why should he be ?
Are you familiar with LSU 's pass rush ?
Guess what team rates near the bottom of the SEC in sacks this season ?
You guessed it .
Tied for last is LSU with only 11 sacks in eight games .
And guess which team rates as one of the best in the SEC in allowing the fewest sacks ?
There you go , you guessed it , Alabama .
Will Greg McElroy have the time to look over the field to find his second and third options ?
You bet .
And with that time , will the defensive backs be too covered to get the completions ?
Not with history on the side of Alabama .
LSU was supposed to fix its defensive problems with the hiring of John Chavis , but Alabama has feasted on Chavis secondaries in the past and that was with an Eric Berry in the secondary .
In fact , Alabama has a four - year record of having a receiver log a 100 - yard - plus game against that feared Chavis defense .
But is n't this secondary supposed to be full of great athletes and top recruits ?
Yes , but they have completely underwhelmed opponents .
They are among the bottom of the SEC in rankings .
With a healthier Colin Peek and all of the other receivers ready for another breakout game , McElroy now has the chance to shine in a highly anticipated nationally televised game .
But overall , they are a good team are n't they ?
Well aside from playing a complete game against an Auburn team that is n't setting the world on fire lately , they have n't exactly had an easy time against some of the mediocre teams in the SEC .
Remember , a goal line stand was necessary to beat lowly Mississippi State and they barely got by a 4 - 4 Georgia team .
And as for the Florida game , they were simply pathetic , only scoring three points the entire game .
With Alabama having a similar , if not better defense , it would be hard to believe that they will score much more against the Tide defense .
Yes , this is truly a time for Alabama to shine against an opponent that is just not up to the same standard as Alabama , and it could easily the breakout game that Alabama fans have been wanting to see from Greg McElroy .
Having to dig up a goal line stand to beat the lowly Mississippi State Bulldogs and a less that inspiring 20 - 13 win over a 4 - 4 Georgia team hardly inspires confidence .
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - European Union leaders named Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy , who is little known outside his own country , as the bloc ’s first president on Thursday to lead efforts to make it more influential on the world stage .
Belgium 's Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy ( L ) and EU Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton of Britain are congratulated after Van Rompuy and Ashton were elected as EU President and EU foreign policy chief respectively in Brussels November 19 , 2009 .

They also chose Baroness Catherine Ashton , a Briton little known even in her own country , as EU foreign affairs chief under a deal that kept out more established figures such as Tony Blair , and raised questions about how the bloc plans to lift its profile .
The appointments are intended to bolster the EU ’s standing and help it to match the rise of emerging powers such as China following the global economic crisis , but neither Ashton nor Van Rompuy is a familiar figure outside Europe .
“ I believe my experience will speak for itself .
Am I an ego on legs ?
No I ’m not .
Do I want to be seen to be out there saying everything all the time ?
No I do n’t .
Judge me on what I do and I think you ’ll pleased with the outcome , ” Ashton told reporters .
Von Rompuy promised to move “ step by step ” to help Europe out of “ exceptionally difficult times , a period of anxiety , uncertainty and lack of confidence . ”
Van Rompuy , 62 , and Ashton , 53 , are compromise candidates who plan to use quiet diplomacy and consensus .
At least initially they will not have the weight in foreign capitals that a better - known figure such as Blair , a former British prime minister , would have had .
Agreement on the positions took weeks , undermining efforts to present the bloc as a united force , partly because Britain had demanded Blair should be president .
The breakthrough came when Prime Minister Gordon Brown dropped that demand and backed EU Trade Commissioner Ashton as foreign affairs chief and vice - president of the EU ’s executive European Commission instead .
POLITICAL BALANCE
The role of president of the council of EU leaders was created under the Lisbon treaty , which takes effect on December 1 and creates a diplomatic corps to be headed by Ashton .
She replaces Spaniard Javier Solana .
The White House said Washington had no stronger partner than Europe in advancing security and prosperity around the world .
“ These two new positions , and related changes to take effect on December 1 as a result of the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty , will strengthen the EU and enable it to be an even stronger partner to the United States , ” it said .
EU leaders had sought a political balance to satisfy member states and the European Parliament , whose approval is needed for Ashton .
This was achieved by appointing a center - right president and a center - left high representative for foreign affairs .
Van Rompuy , who will not need the assembly ’s approval , won plaudits for holding together Belgium ’s fragile coalition government after becoming prime minister less than a year ago .
Ashton , a former member of the House of Lords , Britain ’s upper house of parliament , has little foreign affairs experience .
But she has made a good impression as trade commissioner .
“ I ’m one of those people that believe that characters can grow into jobs , ” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said .
Blair had long been the front - runner but many other states wanted a candidate more likely to lead by consensus , and Germany and France joined forces to block his candidacy .

They remain powerful forces in the EU although they have none of the top jobs which also include a Portuguese , Jose Manuel Barroso , as European Commission President .
Barroso will now complete the line - up of the Commission under him and Ashton .
Deals are sure to have been made on some of the jobs during the consultations on the top jobs led by Sweden , which holds the EU presidency for the rest of this year .
EU diplomats said it was now all but certain that former French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier would be commissioner for the EU ’s internal market , one of the most powerful and most sought - after positions in Barroso ’s team .
Failure to agree on the top jobs would have highlighted divisions in a bloc representing nearly 500 million people , and undermined the goal of boosting the EU ’s image abroad .
In backing Ashton , the leaders also answered calls by many EU officials for a woman to have one of the Union ’s top posts .

Update ( 3 March ) : The Guardian reports ....
In the case of Binyam Mohamed , you imply that the government has refused to disclose material related to his case because it would embarrass the government .
Again , this is not true .
As Mr Mohamed 's legal representatives have themselves said , it is through this government 's efforts that this material was provided to them for use in Mr Mohamed 's defence .
We have no objection to this material being disclosed publicly .
But we believe that the decision to do so is for the US , because the material is from the US .
Far from being a threat , it was solicited [ by the Foreign Office ] .
The Foreign Office asked for it in writing .
They said : " Give us something in writing so that we can put it on the record . "
If you give us a letter explaining you are opposed to this , then we can provide that to the court .
This afternoon a British court issued an important and long - awaited ruling in the case of Binyam Mohamed , a British resident tortured in Pakistan and then detained at Guantanamo Bay .
The court ordered the British Government to present documents , demanded by Mohamed 's lawyers , that established not only the torture but also US and British complicity in the " enhanced interrogation " .
The British Government had maintained that , because the documents contained information which originated with their US counterpart , its revelation could jeopardise the US - UK intelligence relationship .
In the last hour , I have heard British Foreign Secretary David Miliband maintain in two radio interviews that he would be happy to release the documents but that Washington has insisted they be withheld .
Therefore , before getting into the details and implications of his argument --- for example , that any decision of a British court should be set aside because of the demands of the " intelligence " relationship , indeed that torture must not be investigated if there is a US - UK intelligence dimension --- let 's re-state : Miliband is lying .
Reprinted below is our entry from March 2009 , after an earlier court decision reluctantly accepted the withholding of the documents .
Then as now , Miliband trotted out the line that the decision was up to the Americans ; unfortunately , his cover was blown by a State Department official who revealed that the Brown Government had asked Washington to make that statement to the court .
That way , the material would still not see the light of day but the British Government could claim that it was not hiding evidence alleging London 's own involvement in the torture of Mohamed .
---- David Miliband , the foreign secretary , is to be questioned by senior MPs over what he and his officials knew about the ill - treatment and secret interrogation of Binyam Mohamed , the former UK resident recently released from Guantánamo Bay .
The move was announced yesterday by the Commons foreign affairs committee , which said it also intends to investigate other key issues where recent evidence has thrown up uncomfortable questions for ministers to answer .
They are allegations of British complicity in torture in Pakistan , in the US practice of rendering terror suspects to countries where they risked being tortured , and in the transfer of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The foreign secretary will not be able to refuse to testify before the Commons foreign affairs committee , which was set up to monitor the activities of his department .
I thought of using the English euphemism " economical with the truth " , but that does n't capture the brazen statement of the Foreign Secretary yesterday regarding alleged British complicity with the torture of detainees .
Having refused to appear before a Parliamentary committee invstigating the charges , Miliband and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith chose instead to write to The Observer of London .
Here 's a key extract from the letter :
Which would merely be a case of passing the buck rather than lying shamelessly , were it not for this revelation by a former State Department official in The Observer two weeks earlier .
He commented on the American letter which asked for the Mohamed evidence to be kept secret : Foreign Secretary , if you 're going to lie while avoiding an inquiry into torture , could you at least give us enough respect not to do in the same newspaper which busted you in the first place ?
Rachel 's interview was sparked by a Christian Science Monitor story , " Biblical anti-Obama slogan : Use of Psalm 109:8 funny or sinister ?
The story 's lead :
There ’s a new slogan making its way onto car bumpers and across the Internet .
It reads simply : " Pray for Obama : Psalm 109: 8 " A nice sentiment ?
Maybe not .
The psalm reads , " Let his days be few ; and let another take his office . "
Presidential criticism through witty slogans is nothing new .
Bumper stickers , t- shirts , and hats with " 1/20/09 " commemorated President Bush ’s last day in office .
But the verse immediately following the psalm referenced is a bit more ominous : " Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow . "
I did some Googling and this slogan is available on t- shirts , on bumper stickers , on coffee cups , on just about any merchandise you can think of .
And while some find humor in this , Schaeffer sees grave danger .
A partial transcription of Schaeffer 's comments :
The situation that I find genuinely frightening right now is that you have a ramping up of Biblical language , language from the anti-abortion movement , for instance , death panels and this sort of thing , and what it 's coalescing into is branding Obama as Hitler ... as something foreign to our shores , we 're reminded of that he 's born in Kenya , as brown , as black , above all , as not us .
He is Sarah Palin's " not a real American . "
But now it turns out that he joins the ranks of the unjust kings of ancient Israel , unjust rulers to which all these Biblical allusions are directed , who should be slaughtered , if not by God , then by just men .
So there 's a direct parallel here with Timothy McVeigh 's t- shirt on the day of the Oklahoma City bombing in which he said the tree of liberty had to be watered occasionly by the blood of tyrants .
And that quote we saw again at a meeting at which Obama was present being carried on a placard by someone carrying a loaded weapon .
Schaeffer says this Biblical sloganeering , combined with a daily diet of hyped - up scaremongering from right wing outlets like Fox , is tantamount to " trawling for assasins . "
This is serious business .
It 's unAmerican , it 's unpatriotic and it goes to show that the religious right , the Republican far right , have coalesced into a group that truly wants revolution and if it turns out to be blood in the streets , so be it .
Schaeffer stresses that these messages should n't be dismissed , especially in light of the fact the threat level against Obama is 400 percent higher than at any other time in 52 years .
This bumper sticker simply says to them , ' It 's open season . '
Schaeffer notes that no one in the GOP leadership or the evangelical community is doing anything to tamp down on this rhetoric ... this from a community that routinely denounces Islamic leaders for not speaking out more forcefully against terrorism .
" Where the hell are you ? " he asks .
" And be it on your head if something happens to our president ... Until they speak out , they 're culpable . "
I urge you to watch this interview in full to truly understand what our president is up against , and to heed Schaeffer 's final plea :
Obama supporters had better start speaking up in support of him and not sniping at him all of the time because he's not moving towards change as fast as we'd like in every area .
This is serious stuff .
The chips are down , he has real enemies -- some of them are violent -- and as far as I 'm concerned it 's time to support our president , stand with him and not only wish him the best , but pray for his safety in the face of these religious maniacs ....
There are not many steps left on this insane path .
UPDATE : A great suggestion from Regina in a Sears Kit House :
We can not stand idly by , while this fringe bunch takes and keeps the stage .
I think each of us should write a letter to the editor and if we belong to a faith community , tell our rabbi , pastor , priest , mullah , that we need them to be very clear about respect and caring for everyone .
We need lessons in the difference between disagreement and dislike .
Somehow there are enough people who do n't get the difference to make difference dangerous .
I hope DKos people talk about this tomorrow .
I saw TRMS tonight too , and found it unspeakably scary .
We should discuss and debate policy , but we must protect the man and I daresay , his family .
UPDATE 2 : It seems that both CafePress and Zazzle.com are selling this merchandise ( h/t karenc13 ) .

Let 's keep bugging them .
BREAKING NEWS : Ypu guys did it !
Zazzle has just posted the following message on their website :
Dear Zazzle Member or Concerned Citizen —
Today , there has surfaced a great deal of discussion and debate over certain products in the Zazzle Marketplace which reference text from Psalm 109 in combination with reference to President Barack Obama .
We at Zazzle are aware of the issue , and would like to take this opportunity to respond in a unified and public fashion to all parties and viewpoints .
Zazzle puts great value on its Marketplace as a forum for discussion and debate of the issues of our day .
We are proud of the fact that no matter how arcane or apparently esoteric a subject may be , there can often be found Zazzle products pertaining to it .
We are particularly sensitive to Zazzle as an open forum for the expression and debate of political viewpoints .
The rigorous debate and discussion of political issues , including candidates for political office , our elected leaders , and pending and actual legislation , is something that drives the very democracy that in turn allows for our freedom as citizens to make these expressions in the first place .
With that in mind , it is only after great thought that we have determined that these products , in the context of the full text of Psalm 109 , may be interpreted in such a way as to suggest physical harm to the President of the United States .
In deference to the Office of the President of the United States , and in accordance with federal law prohibiting the making of threats against the physical wellbeing of the President of the United States , Zazzle has therefore determined that these products are in violation of the Zazzle User Agreement and not appropriate for inclusion in the Zazzle Marketplace .
We have begun efforts to remove them from our website , and we will be vigilant to the publication of similar products moving forward .
Zazzle will continue to allow and encourage the submission of products that express disapproval or approval of the President ’s policies and actions , but Zazzle will not permit products that may be interpreted to suggest violence toward the President .
Sincerely ,
The Zazzle Team
GREAT WORK !
Zazzle is also accepting comments on their decision here .
UPDATE 3 : Thanks to Stuart Heady for this one .
He e-mailed staff@fredstates.com , the e-mail listed at the bottom of UpYoursObama.com , which sells a lot of the designs seen on Cafe Press and Zazzle .
More from Stuart .
Perhaps we can make this person a little uncomfortable .
domainreg@smnet.com
( 1+ / 0 -) This is the email address for the administration contact listed on WHOIS for UpYoursObama.com , the main originator for content that people have been complaining to Cafe Press and Zazzle about .
Theresa Taylor is listed as the owner and is listed only by a PO Box in Santa Monica .
I just emailed domainreg@smnet.com to point out that a lot of buzz has been generated by the campaign to call for Obama 's assassination , apparently being promoted on this website and perhaps they should look into it - especially since they might be getting some unwanted attention from the Secret Service , et al .
I recommend everyone send something similar to them .
FINAL UPDATE : For those who do n't feel like digging through more than 1200 comments , I want to highlight some amazing investigative work by Stuart Heady , mahakali overdrive and foggycity .
The relevant thread is here : unmasking the people behind UpYoursObama.com .
It is fascinating reading and the upshot is that the person behind this website and the Psalms 109 merchandise has been reported to the Secret Service .
In fact , this entire thread has been sent to the SS .
Kudos to them for helping make our president a little safer today .
I also want to thank all of the many people who commented here .
There are some fantastic ideas for combatting this poisonous and dangerous rhetoric -- far too many to list here in an update .
It would be great to collect them all in some kind of action diary .
I 'm tired of watching this venom being spewed day after day and doing nothing .
Back in July of this year , we previewed a device that was supposed to add stereoscopic depth to any PSP game , even video files .
We expressed some skepticism at the company 's claims , and the product has since been delayed until January of next year .
RealView recently sent Ars Technica what seems to be a production model of the device , and now that we have the thing in our hands ... it 's actually very cool .
The product will retail for around $ 40 , which seems steep for what amounts to a lens and a chunk of plastic .
When you slide your PSP into the case , there is a rubber mat that you put between the plastic and the PSP to allow later models to fit in snugly .
The whole thing kills some of the portable nature of the system , but once the screen flips up and you see what it can do , you may not mind : there is actual depth added to the images , and the screen appears larger without sacrificing brightness or resolution .
The effect was particularly apparent in racing games , and it added a very impressive dimension to both Gran Turismo PSP and MotorStorm : Arctic Edge .
The games looked bright , clear , and above all there was a nice 3D effect given to the track and the cars on it .
The marketing materials described a " depth- enhancing " screen that is " similar to a 3D experience . "
The product delivers what it promises .
Of course , there 's no magic involved here .
Flight sim fans have been doing this for years
While RealView Innovations is cagey about the processes that actually make this product possible , only talking about technology " first developed for the medical world , " a little bit of digging was all it took to the get to the secret .
By adding a fresnel lens to a standard monitor , you 're able to both magnify the image and add the illusion of depth to the picture .
There are companies that sell oversized fresnel lenses for this purpose , and simulation gamers have long known about the effect .
" This all got started when Tom Kopke mentioned that it might be possible to have a flight simulator display with a more realistic , 3 - dimensional sense of depth by mounting a fresnel lens in front of the monitor .
This sounded implausible to me at first ... but Tom is a physicist who works on simulator display systems for the U.S.
Navy so I had to take his proposition seriously , " Rick Lee writes in an explanation of the effect .
" [ Kopke ] explained that the lens allows you to view the monitor with your eyes focused out nearer to infinity instead of two feet in front of your face ....
In the science of simulation , this is called a ' collimated display . ' "
A do - it - yourself fresnel set up for racing games ( Source
This lead to many racing and flight simulation enthusiasts creating DIY fresnel lens setups , including the monstrous three - monitor , three - lens set up used for racing games .
The size of the lens , as well as the distance it 's kept from the screen , determines the strength and efficacy of the effect .
What RealView Innovations has done is create a fresnel lens of the perfect size for a PSP , and it has taken care of the placement to get the maximum effect out of your PSP .
The case may be bulky , but the lens is held in place by a small plastic button , and swings out when you tap it .
It 's true that you could create something very similar for the same or less money , but you 're paying for a product that is n't made of duct tape and cardboard .
Is that worth $ 40 ?
That depends on you , but the effect is more compelling than it sounds on paper , and it 's going to be hard to go back to playing the games on a standard screen .
Side scrolling games and most movies do n't seem to get much use out of the effect , but racing games are improved by it , and the package with the case and the lens is well constructed .
You 'll be able to see for yourself when the product is launched this January .
We were skeptical going in , but racing fans or even just optics enthusiasts are going to have fun here .
Now if you 'll excuse me , I have to order a larger fresnel for my computer monitor ...

Eight people were in custody Saturday after a crowd of angry protesters broke windows and threw burning torches at UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau 's campus residence in protest of fee hikes and budget cuts , authorities said .
As many as 75 people - some of them carrying torches - surrounded the mansion , known as University House , on the north side of campus off Hearst Avenue at about 11:15 p.m.
Friday , police said .
The crowd , including a man taken into custody in a university protest a day earlier , chanted , " No justice , no peace , " and began smashing planters , windows and lights .
Several hurled their torches at the building , said campus spokesman Dan Mogulof .
Birgeneau was sleeping at the time and was awakened by his wife , Mary Catherine , Mogulof said .
They were frightened , but unharmed , he said .
" These are criminals , not activists , " Birgeneau said in a statement issued Saturday morning .
" The attack at our home was extraordinarily frightening and violent .
My wife and I genuinely feared for our lives . "
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger condemned the attack Saturday as a form of terrorism .
" California will not tolerate any type of terrorism against any leaders , including educators , " Schwarzenegger said .
" The attack on Chancellor Birgeneau 's home is a criminal act and those who participated will be prosecuted under the fullest extent of the law . "
The demonstrators had marched earlier Friday night from Wheeler Hall to the chancellor 's home .
Most of the protesters ran away when police arrived , but some of them threw torches and other objects at officers and patrol cars , Mogulof said .
UC Berkeley police arrested Cal students Zachary Bowin , 21 , and Angela Miller , 20 , on suspicion of rioting , threatening an education official , attempted burglary , attempted arson of an occupied building , vandalism and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer , Mogulof said .
Six nonstudents , Julia Litmancleper , 20 , of San Francisco ; John Friesen , 25 , of Fullerton ( Orange County ) ; Donnell Allen , 41 , of San Francisco ; David Morse , 41 , of Oakland ; Laura Thatcher , 21 , of Rolling Hills Estates ( Los Angeles County ) ; and James Carwil , 31 , of Brooklyn , N.Y. , were arrested on the same charges .
Most of the eight remained in custody Saturday in lieu of $ 132,500 bail and were scheduled to appear in court Monday or Tuesday .
The incident came a day after university police arrested 66 people - including Friesen - in connection with a four - day protest last week at Wheeler Hall .
The building was also the site of a Nov. 20 occupation and clash between protesters and officers from several law - enforcement agencies .
Ever since the financial crisis , there has been a movement toward forcing financial institutions to behave in a more consumer - friendly manner .
To this end , Congress is considering the overdraft fees banks charge as a follow - up to credit card regulation reform .
Soon , banks may be required to let you opt out of overdraft protection on top of providing full disclosure on other fees .
With the prospect of legislation regarding overdraft fees looming large , some banks are already modifying their overdraft policies .
Bank of America ( Stock Quote : BAC ) , Chase ( Stock Quote : JPM ) and Wells Fargo ( Stock Quote : WFC ) are among the banks that will waive overdraft fees if you are less than $ 10 over your limit .
Additionally , many banks will no longer approve ATM and other transactions that take you over your limit .
You do n’t have to wait on banks to avoid overdraft fees , however .
Here are three moves that can help you beat bank fees :
1 . Use a credit union or small local bank .
Because they ca n’t compete on a national scale , many credit unions and small local banks compete in other ways — with lower fees and personalized customer service .
Credit unions are known for having low fees and account minimums .
Plus , chances are that you will find the process for opting out of overdraft protection less onerous at a smaller bank or credit union .
2. Link your checking account to another account .
Many banks allow you to link your checking account to a savings account or to a line of credit .
This can save you money in terms of per-transaction charges , as well as offering a lower interest rate in some cases .
Instead of showing you as overdrawn , your checking account automatically transfers money from the linked account to cover the charges .
It 's important to note that there may be a monthly limit on transfers from a savings account , so you will still need to be careful .
If you are linking to a line of credit , make sure you pay back the small loan as soon as possible to minimize the interest you are paying .
Understand that , in some cases , a linked line of credit comes with an annual fee of $ 15 to $ 35 .
3. Separate your expenses into different accounts .
Another tactic to reduce the chances of an overdraft is to use different accounts .
Use one checking account ( linked to a savings account or line of credit ) for your major bills , and try to make sure that it is funded .
Your second account should be for the everyday purchases and not have overdraft protection .
That way , if you are out of money in that account , the transaction is denied .
In the end , the best way to avoid money - wasting overdraft fees is to keep track of your finances and have enough in your account .
But it never hurts to have a backup plan .

So as it turns out , even the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has its own SWAT team .
You do n't need to know .
You can't know . "
That 's what Kathy Norris , a 60 - year - old grandmother of eight , was told when she tried to ask court officials why , the day before , federal agents had subjected her home to a furious search .
The agents who spent half a day ransacking Mrs. Norris ' longtime home in Spring , Texas , answered no questions while they emptied file cabinets , pulled books off shelves , rifled through drawers and closets , and threw the contents on the floor .
The six agents , wearing SWAT gear and carrying weapons , were with — get this - the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
Kathy and George Norris lived under the specter of a covert government investigation for almost six months before the government unsealed a secret indictment and revealed why the Fish and Wildlife Service had treated their family home as if it were a training base for suspected terrorists .
Orchids .
That 's right .
Orchids .
By March 2004 , federal prosecutors were well on their way to turning 66 - year - old retiree George Norris into an inmate in a federal penitentiary — based on his home - based business of cultivating , importing and selling orchids ..
Mr. Norris ended up spending almost two years in prison because he did n't have the proper paperwork for some of the many orchids he imported .
The orchids were all legal — but Mr. Norris and the overseas shippers who had packaged the flowers had failed to properly navigate the many , often irrational , paperwork requirements the U.S. imposed when it implemented an arcane international treaty 's new restrictions on trade in flowers and other flora .
The judge who sentenced Mr. Norris had some advice for him and his wife : " Life sometimes presents us with lemons . "
Their job was , yes , to " turn lemons into lemonade . "
ACCESS to a fast Internet connection has become more than a convenience .
It ’s being enshrined in some countries as a legal right of all citizens .
Finland , for example , announced last week that it was moving up its timetable to next year from 2015 for guaranteeing broadband access to all , according to YLE , the Finnish broadcasting company .
Congress is clearly irritated that the United States has not done well in the international broadband Olympics .
Other countries have national plans to accelerate the diffusion of broadband ; America does not .
So Congress has given the Federal Communications Commission a mandate to produce a plan with specific recommendations by next February .
We should n’t get caught up , however , in a space - race panic .
We ’ve actually done surprisingly well making a broadband connection accessible to a vast majority of American households .
No less than 96 percent of households either subscribe to or have access to broadband service , according to an F.C.C. task force , which presented a status report to the commission last month .
The report does not play up the fact that almost all homes have , or could have , broadband service .
Nor does it highlight the actual median speed of 3 megabits a second among households that now have broadband , ( which is based on data that probably understates the speeds substantially ) .
The authors seem happily caught up in the thrill of playing an international game of catch - up .
Women won the right to vote in 2005 and became MPs in 2009
Kuwaiti women will be able to obtain their own passport without the consent of their husbands , following a ruling by the country 's constitutional court .
The court , whose decisions are final , said the previous requirement was in violation of guarantees of freedom and gender equality in the constitution .
The decision came about when a woman complained her husband had prevented her from leaving the country .
The country 's first female MPs were elected in May 2009 .
The article abolished by the court dated back to Kuwait 's 1962 passport law which required a husband 's signature on a woman 's passport application .
Aseel al - Awadhi , one of the new MPs , welcomed the passport law ruling as a " victory for constitutional principles that puts an end to this injustice against Kuwaiti women " .
Government housing
It is the latest gain for women in the oil - rich Gulf state which has made a number of strides towards gender equity in recent years .
The presence of female MPs followed the granting of equal political rights in 2005 .
Women voted for the first time in 2006 - albeit in segregated polling booths - in a by - election where they made up 60 % of eligible voters .
Kuwaiti women enjoy more freedoms than in neighbouring Saudi Arabia , where there is strict gender segregation and women are not allowed to drive cars .
Women activists welcomed the passport ruling but say they still need equal access to government housing and the right to pass citizenship to their children .

Skunkman Sam's Secret Dry Sift 2009
So here we are again one year later to re inspire ...
This year i was able to photograph some Sleestack dry sift ... and judging by the shape and form of the heads , i would say this stuff was much younger resin than last years .. ( last years looked less inflated and more crinkly heads )
Anyway enjoy these first few pics for now ..
i took a few so i will go thru and try and upload more later ...
Lets keep this thread on track ... we know you dont like its a secret , we know you think its lame ... but lets keep the posts in this thread on target ..
Show us your dry sift ... lets see if someone out there can produce a dry sift this clean with their method .
Peace

Well its been a year since i posted the pictures of sam 's incredible dry sift quality .
One full year has gone by and some great discussion was created in the thread .
Sure it was full of posts by people complaining about the fact its a secret and blah blah blah .. but if you pick apart from those posts the actual informative posts ... it was a really great thread .

A proposal to use “ algae pontoons ” that could capture carbon emissions along urban arteries was declared the winner as the winner of WPA 2.0 , a competition sponsored by the UCLA Architecture and Urban Design think tank cityLAB .
Riffing off the intentions of the original 1930s Works Progress Administration , the competition looked for ways that public works projects could be reimagined and redefined
for the country ’s future–especially in the light of the $ 150 billion planned to
be allocated to utilities and infrastructure development in the U.S .
“ Carbon T.A.P.// Tunnel Algae Park ” was designed by PORT Architecture +
Urbanism , with offices in Chicago and New York , and works like a carbon - emissions recycling center that creates greenspace at the same time .
The pontoons would attract carbon dioxide from cars and other vehicles and use them in bio - fuel production , and the areas containing the algae would be turned into a vast urban park that included wetlands , aquatic and avian habitats and recreational facilities like bike lanes and promenades .
The proposal included a plan for implementation as a “ algal - architecture ” corridor that follows the Brooklyn - Battery Tunnel between Brooklyn , Governors Island , and Manhattan , along a route that the city ’s famous development czar Robert Moses proposed for cars in 1936 .
A symposium held at the National Building Museum yesterday featured the presentations of all six finalists and the announcement of the winner .
But here ’s the really exciting part :
These finalists are forging a direct link with the government officials who can put their proposals into action since representatives from the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) , the Office of Urban Affairs , U.S. General Services Administration ’s Design Excellence Program , and the National Endowment for the Arts were all present as well .
Today , cityLAB will march these proposals up to the Capitol and present them to the various government agencies as future ideas for U.S. infrastructure .

With demonstrators being arrested every day and non-traditional media , plus some mainstream media , being kept out of discussions , the climate change talks in Copenhagen are teetering on the precipice of outright failure .
While some progress has been made , even the arrival of the chiefs of more than 100 governments Friday , including President Barack Obama , seems unlikely to accomplish in less than 24 hours what has n't been achieved in two weeks of talks or the months of preparation for them .
Meanwhile , long - time environmental advocate Bill McKibben revealed in a Daily Kos diary Thursday afternoon , and traditional media subsequently have reported , leaked documents from the United Nations call into serious question governments ' claims that they are aiming for carbon dioxide cuts that would hold average global temperatures to a rise of 2 °C over the next century .
Instead , the cuts could allow a temperature rise of 3 °C or 4°C , with more than 550 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
That 's well above the 350 ppm scientists believe is a ( relatively ) safe level .
The document assesses the legally binding emissions - reduction pledges of the 36 countries that are signatories to Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol , as well as voluntary actions of some non-Annex I Parties .
It was leaked to the TckTckTck climate change advocacy alliance and posted on - line .
The document was drafted by the UN secretariat running the Copenhagen summit and is dated 11 pm on Tuesday night .
It is marked " do not distribute " and " initial draft " .
It shows a gap of up to 4.2 gigatonnes of carbon emissions between the present pledges and the required 2020 level of 44 Gt , which is required to stay below a 2C rise .
No higher offers have since been made .
" Unless the remaining gap of around 1.9- 4.2 Gt is closed and Annexe 1 parties [ rich countries ] commit themselves to strong action before and after 2020 , global emissions will remain on an unsustainable pathway that could lead to concentrations equal or above 550 parts per million , with the related temperature rise around 3 C , " it says .
It does not specify a time when 3C would be reached but it is likely to be 2050 .
The analysis is based on the 2009 World Energy Outlook report from the International Energy Agency .
C'mon , just 1° ?
What 's the big deal ?
According to the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change [ pdf ] , 2° is bad enough , but 3° would mean 170 million additional people afflicted by coastal flooding and 550 million suffering from hunger .
That 's equivalent to the entire population of North America and Central America , plus Venezuela and Colombia .
Forestalling this possibility would require pledges to make far deeper cuts in carbon emissions than have so far been elicited at the conference , which ends tomorrow .
The head of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Rajendra Pachauri , said earlier in the week that even with a 1.5 °C rise , problems could be immense .
" Some of the most vulnerable regions in the world will be worst affected .
These will be the largest countries in the developing world .
They have little infrastructure that might protect them from climate change .
The tragedy of the situation is that those countries that have not at all contributed to the problem of climate change will be the ones most affected , " he said .
" Some parts of the world , which even with a 1.5C rise , will suffer great hardship and lose their ability to lead a decent and stable form of existence .
If we are going to be concerned about these communities , then maybe 1.5C is what we should be targeting .
But if we can find means by which those communities can be helped to withstand the impact of climate change with substantial flow of finances , then maybe one can go to 2C . "
McKibben , the founder of 350.org , which advocates for keeping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at 350 ppm , told the Guardian : " In one sense this is no secret – we 've been saying it for months .
But it is powerful to have the UN confirming its own insincerity . "
In his Daily Kos diary , McKibben pointed out that what the leaked document reveals is n't exactly news as far as what governments have proposed .
They " do n't even come close to meeting their own goals , " he said .
" Outside parties have demonstrated this for weeks - Climate Interactive 's model yields a temperature increase nearer 4 degrees . "
That would come from a CO2 level of 770 ppm .
For the record , that kind of increase , according to the Stern Review , could , among other things , put 300 million additional people at risk of coastal flooding , reduce agricultural yields in Africa by 35 % and cause even more massive die - offs of species already dying at unprecedented rates .
Mike MacCracken , Chief Scientist for Climate Change Programs with the Climate Institute in Washington , D.C. , thinks even that may not tell the whole story .
In the Daily Kos Climate Change Reality blogathon this past weekend , MacCracken pointed out in his Sunday diary before these documents were leaked :
Unfortunately , even the most optimistic of IPCC ’s emissions scenarios result in the CO2 concentration rising to more than 500 ppmv ( and effectively even higher due to the warming contributions of increases in the concentrations of other [ greenhouse gases ] ) .
Less ambitious efforts to control emissions are projected to lead to a CO2 concentration of 700 – 1000 ppmv .
As a result , returning atmospheric composition to a state compatible with the present climate will essentially require going to very near zero emissions for CO2 and other long - lived gases , with much of the reduction achieved by 2050 and the rest by 2100 .
In a blog post - How Føcked Are We ? - at the on - line environment magazine Grist , McKibben wrote : " [ T ] his entire conference is an elaborate sham , where the organizers have known all along that they ’re heading for a very different world than the one they ’re supposedly creating .
It ’s intellectual dishonesty of a very high order , and with very high consequences . "
But Clinton - era Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Tim Wirth , Senator John Kerry and the White House all agree that a føcked agreement coming out of Copenhagen is better than none .
Fort Hood Shooting ' Oddities '
By Lori Price , www.legitgov.org
Updated : 15 Oct 2010
Fort Hood soldier ordered to erase video of shootings -- In US civilian courts , destruction of evidence can be a crime .
15 Oct 2010 A US soldier who captured a deadly 2009 rampage at Fort Hood with his cell phone camera testified Friday that he was ordered to erase the video by his commanders .
The video could have provided key evidence at the trial of Major Nidal Hasan , a US Army psychiatrist who faces 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder .
Lead defense attorney John Galligan asked witness Private Lance Aviles if he had taken a video of the shooting with his cell phone and if he deleted the footage at the instruction of his superiors .
" Yes , sir , " Aviles replied .
Obama administration subpoenaed in Fort Hood probe 19 Apr 2010 Two U.S. lawmakers subpoenaed the Obama administration on Monday for information sought in a congressional probe of last year 's shooting rampage [ false flag ] at Fort Hood , Texas , that left 13 soldiers dead and an Army psychiatrist charged with murder .
Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman , an independent [ sociopath ] , and Susan Collins , the panel 's top Republican , took the action after the departments of Justice and Defense failed to provide the materials by Monday 's deadline .
' Three people are involved .
That , by definition , means it is a conspiracy . '

Friend of Fort Hood gunman ' killed in attack on Yemen hideout '
26 Dec 2009
An American - born radical Islamist , believed to have links to the Fort Hood gunman accused of killing 13 colleagues last month , may have been among 30 militant leaders killed when Yemeni aircraft bombed suspected al - Qaeda hideouts .
Anwar al - Awlaki , who reportedly corresponded by e-mail with Major Nidal Malik Hasan before the shooting at the Texan base , was thought to have been attending an al - Qaeda meeting in Rafadh when the airstrikes took place on Thursday .
At least 34 [ alleged ] members of the terror organisation were killed , according to the Yemeni Embassy in Washington .
A similar number were killed in a raid last week .
Obusha opens new war front ; lamestream media focuses on bogus terror incidents to provide popular support for ' war on terror : ' U.S. - aided attack in Yemen thought to have killed Aulaqi , 2 al - Qaeda leaders 25 Dec 2009 Yemeni forces , backed by the United States , launched a major attack Thursday on a meeting of senior al - Qaeda [ al - CIAduh ] operatives thought to include the Yemeni American cleric linked to the suspect in the Fort Hood shootings [?!? ] , U.S. and Yemeni officials said .
U.S. officials believe that the cleric , Anwar al - Aulaqi , was probably killed in the assault , as were two al - Qaeda leaders , according to a senior Obama administration official .
One of those leaders was the head of the terrorist network 's operations on the Arabian Peninsula and once served as Osama bin Laden 's personal secretary ; the other was a Saudi national and former detainee at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Yemeni officials , tribal leaders and eyewitnesses said it was not clear whether Aulaqi and the al - Qaeda leaders were killed or wounded in the strike [ so they can be re-killed another day ] .

" Anwar al Awlaki is suspected to be dead ( in the air raid ) , " said the Yemeni official , who asked not to be identified .
Yemen said 30 militants were killed in the strike in the eastern province of Shabwa .
The gunman in the November 5 shooting at the Fort Hood , Texas army base , Major Nidal Malik Hasan , had contacts with Awlaki late last year , U.S. authorities believe .

That would be impossible .
Even if he had two semi-auto pistols [ according to reports he used a 9 mm and a .357 revolver to gun down over 40 people ] he would still have had to stop to reload and someone would have jumped his ass .

CLG Exclusive : Fort Hood : ' This story stinks to high heaven . '
SFC , who spent ten years at Fort Hood , comments on Ft. Hood events 09 Nov 2009 I spent 10 years at Ft Hood .
There is no way this ' official ' story is legitimate .
No way would a room full of combat vets allow this one shooter to get off over 100 rounds !
And , it is not normal for the outside security guards to be there .
They are at the MP station , and at the main gates .
This means the room full of soldiers processing must have been pinned down ; multiple shooters is the only plausible scenario .
this sounds like MAJ Hasan has been used , and perhaps is a patsy .

The manager of the complex , John Thompson , said the other soldier , John Van de Walker , allegedly keyed Hasan 's car and also removed and tore up a bumper sticker that read " Allah is Love . "
Thompson said Van de Walker had been in Iraq and was upset to learn that Hasan was Muslim .
A report filed with Killeen police on Aug. 16 indicates that Hasan 's vehicle , a 2006 Honda Civic , had been scratched by an unknown object causing an estimated $ 1,000 worth of damage .
The report indicates that Van de Walker , 30 , was arrested on Oct. 21 and charged with criminal mischief .

Militia groups are accused of trying to brainwash the young
Hundreds of people in Somalia have been forced to watch Islamist militants executing two people accused of spying .
People in Merca said al - Shabab militia patrolled the town with loudspeakers , demanding they attend the executions .
The militants also ordered schools to close for the day as they were keen for children to watch the two men being shot dead by a firing squad .
Most of those at the execution , on a patch of open ground , are reported to have been women and children .
It is becoming something of a pattern for al - Shabab to encourage young people to engage in violence .
It recently organised a quiz for young men in the southern town of Kismayo .
The prizes included AK - 47 assault rifles , hand grenades and anti-tank mines .
The aim , said al - Shabab , was to stop young men from wasting time , and to focus on important things like defending their territory and their religion .
At the prize - giving ceremony , which was attended by hundreds of people , the militants urged parents to teach their children to handle weapons at an early age .
Somali children 's rights groups say al - Shabab is intent on brainwashing the young to believe in violent Islamism .
In this way , it can ensure it has a steady supply of recruits , ready to fight for its aim of establishing extreme Islamist rule , not only in Somalia but far beyond its borders .

This morning Matt Mullenweg announced on his blog that WordPress.com has enabled posting and reading blogs via the Twitter API .
Now any Twitter app that supports a custom API URL ( Tweetie is one such ) can be used to either post updates to a WordPress.com blog , or to read updates from blogs to which one has subscribed .
Dave Winer calls the move by Automattic , WordPress.com 's parent company , " deeply insidious , " and notes that 10 years ago he did a similar thing in his Manila blogging platform when the Blogger API came out .
Winer opines that Automattic 's move has made the Twitter API into an open standard , due to WordPress.com 's large base .
Winer notes ( in a comment on the above - linked post ) , " The fun starts if they [ Word Press ] relax some of the limits of the Twitter API and fix some of the glaring problems . "
In troubled times , it is important to try to maintain a certain level of serenity .
Right now we citizens have quite a lot on our plate and there is no reason to go completely crazy about the least little thing .
For instance , at that right - wing tea-party rally in Washington last week , it seemed a little weird when Jon Voight warned the crowd that if President Obama was n’t stopped , the United States would wind up with a health care system like New Zealand’s .
At the time , I could not help wondering what New Zealand ever did to Jon Voight .
Also if he ’s made any movies since the one where he got eaten by a really big snake .
But you did not see me getting all carried away about it .
I am not even going to rant about the fact that when Sean Hannity reported on the rally for Fox News , he marveled at the huge turnout .
Which actually did not exist but sure seemed to be there when he showed film lifted from an earlier and much larger protest .
The treaty signed between Queen Victoria and my ancestors in 1899 covered an area of northern Canada three - and - a - half times the size of Great Britain .
It guaranteed that my people " shall have right to pursue their usual vocations of hunting , trapping and fishing throughout the tract " .
Today , however , hunters stay away from the few moose that still roam the forests near our small community , afraid that the meat will poison their children .
I remember drinking from the lake as a small child .
Now , when I return to my homeland with my own young daughter , we 're told not to swim because it 's too toxic .
This is the legacy of Canada 's tar sands development in a place where my people have always lived and which is home to dozens of other First Nation communities living downstream from the sprawling tar pits .
And while our people may be among the first to pay for the excesses of squeezing our earth for its last drops of oil , we wo n't be the last .
Global financiers betting on the tar sands are killing our last , best chance at maintaining a livable climate for everybody .
As cheaper , more conventional global crude oil supplies continue to decline , an unprecedented glut of investment dollars is sloshing into the tar sands .
Industry analysts expect more than $ 100 bn ( £ 60 bn ) to be invested in doubling tar sands oil production by 2020 .
Fully developing these sticky oil deposits will require clear - cutting or degrading largely intact primary boreal forests covering an area the size of England .
Extracting and processing just one barrel of tar sands oil requires the energy equivalent of three barrels of natural gas and two to four barrels of water , and results in a carbon footprint up to five times greater than conventional crude .
So who 's behind the unprecedented expansion in the tar sands ?
Who are the ruthless business people throwing money at the dead - end industry poisoning our planet and trampling the rights of my community and others ?
Look no further than the mirror .
UK taxpayers can count themselves among the biggest financial backers of the planet 's most polluting industrial projects due to their majority ownership of the Royal Bank of Scotland .
Since UK taxpayers bailed out RBS after it imploded one year ago , it has underwritten more than £ 1.6bn in debt for companies operating in the tar sands .
Today , on the anniversary of RBS becoming majority - owned by the public , 40 public figures from the UK have signed a letter to Alistair Darling , the chancellor , urging him to stop the bank from using public money to finance tar sands development , and other fossil fuel projects around the world that are having devastating impacts on the climate , local habitats and communities .
Proceeds from these deals are funding some of the most aggressive and controversial expansion projects in the tar sands .
Backed by £ 1bn in debt underwritten by RBS this year , ConocoPhillips aims to expand production from its three tar sands projects eightfold by 2015 .
These are the same projects at issue in a lawsuit brought by the Beaver Lake Cree Nation seeking an injunction to end the wholesale destruction of their ancestral lands , and citing more than 17,000 infringements of the community 's constitutionally protected treaty rights .
RBS also underwrote $ 378 m ( £ 299 m ) in debt issued by Norway 's Statoil in March of this year , just two months before the Norwegian parliament considered a motion to suspend the company 's tar sands projects due to climate concerns .
As world leaders come together two weeks from now in Copenhagen , we all should take a moment to consider the way ahead .
Do we go the well - worn path of big oil , ever further into the last pristine corners of the earth for our last fossil - fuel fix ?
Or do we forge a new path , towards a future that honours the land and the legacy of our ancestors ?
I hope the UK will put its money where its mouth is by pulling RBS 's business out of the tar sands .
A dazed Matt Bradley is helped to the locker room after getting punched by Dan Carcillo during a game at the Wachovia Center on December 5 , 2009 .

( Philadelphia , PA ) – Philadelphia Flyers forward Dan Carcillo was suspended for four games by the National Hockey League for his actions during a game on December 5 at the Wachovia Center .
Carcillo was issued 29 penalty minutes on a single play , when he engaged in an altercation with the Captials ’ Matt Bradley and was ejected from the game .
General manager Paul Holmgren issued the following statement on Sunday regarding the suspension : “ Decisions come down from the league … do I agree with them all ?
No .
I certainly do not agree with this one .
We do not have a lot of recourse in this situation .
Dan will serve his suspension , and we will move on .
” Carcillo ’s penalty , in which he knocked down Bradley with a single punch while both players were dropping their gloves , resulted in a nine - minute power play for the Capitals , in which they scored three times en route to an 8 - 2 victory .
“ Everything happened pretty quick , I saw him drop his gloves , so I started punching him , ” Carcillo told CSNPhilly.com after the game .
“ He kind of came at me the shift before .
He was talking to me before .
I thought we were going to fight .
I do n’t know why he waited so long to drop his gloves .
” In 26 games this season , Carcillo has two goals and three assists for five points and 87 penalty minutes .
He will be eligible to return on December 14 , when the Flyers visit the Boston Bruins .
SHUNYI , Beijing 
One is named Obama , another goes by Son of Bush .
They charge tens of thousands of dollars for sex .
Convoys of luxury cars , driven by fans , greet the most expensive studs at airports .
Meet the canine gigolos — the purebred Tibetan Mastiffs that have become the latest symbol of China 's growing wealth .
Pet ownership is booming in a nation where dogs and cats are featured as part of meals and animal abuse remains widespread .
But none carries the cachet of the Tibetan Mastiff , one of the largest dog breeds , which can weigh 180 pounds .
Last month , a Nanjing breeder paid $ 234,000 for his purebred pooch , reported the Yangtze Evening Times .
In September , a young woman in Xian paid $ 600,000 for her pet , according to the Xian Evening News .
Both led airport welcomes with long convoys of pricey automobiles .
" It 's like gambling , as people think they can earn large sums from expensive dogs , but the reality is that it 's very hard to breed a top quality purebred Tibetan Mastiff , " Beijing breeder Zhao Yanjun says .
Others buy to show off their status .
" Like men around the world , Chinese like to own big dogs as it shows ' I am successful , I want to dominate more women and big dogs , ' " Zhao says .
In the USA , $ 5,000 is the upper limit for a show quality puppy , says Martha Feltenstein , president of the American Tibetan Mastiff Association .
In China , prices have leapt this year amid a nationwide " Tibetan Mastiff fever " that shows little sign of cooling .
From the frozen steppes and remote monasteries of Tibet to the gated communities of China 's urban rich , this guardian dog has come a long way .
Movie stardom beckons , too , in two feature - length animations .
Tibetan Mastiff , a Sino - Japanese adaptation of a popular novel , premieres next year .
In 2011 , Tibetan Rock God , based on rock star Zheng Jun 's comic book , will follow the hero , Metal , from a Tibetan temple to the Chinese capital .
The dog has changed breeder Zhao 's fortunes .
The former chicken farmer , 48 , bought his first Tibetan Mastiff in 1990 and earns up to $ 440,000 a year at his Oriental Treasure breeding center near Beijing .
" They are beautiful , loyal , fierce and run like a lion , " he says of the breed , which has a bear - like head and shaggy mane .
Despite enticing offers , Zhao promises never to sell Son of Bush , out of loyalty to his favorite , Bush , who died last year at 11 .
" I will never be a high official , but I had fun shouting ' Bush , over here ! ' " jokes Zhao , who also named and raised Putin , Sharon and several others named for world leaders .
Obama , worth almost $ 300,000 , was born to a dog Zhao sold to Chinese actor Wang Fei .
Zhao says
Wang charges up to $ 30,000 per breeding session with Obama .
The top dog among breeders is a celebrity himself .
With his " Ma Family Army " of record - breaking female runners , track coach Ma Junren conquered the athletics world in the 1990s .
As he pushed his charges through midnight marathons on the high - altitude Tibetan plateau , Ma discovered the region 's native Mastiffs .
Ma is still trying to represent his country by pushing for China 's full membership in the Fédération Cynologique Internationale ( FCI ) , the World Canine Organization .
It 's a tough sell , Ma admits , as the FCI is concerned by China 's low level of vaccinations , the culling of dogs to prevent rabies and the eating of dog meat .
Those worries are well - justified , says Jeff He , China communication manager for the International Fund for Animal Welfare ( IFAW ) , an advocacy group .
Culling continues in some areas , he says , even though vaccination and education are more effective .
" The No. 1 threat to companion animals is the lack of animal welfare legislation in this country , " he says .
Respect for animal rights is growing , says Qin Xiaona , chairwoman of Beijing 's Capital Animal Welfare Association , but the absence of laws slows progress , she says .
Last month , Qin rushed to nearby Tianjin to help rescue 800 mostly stolen cats that were locked in cages en route to diners in south China 's Guangzhou .
Qin opposes the " Tibetan Mastiff fever . "
" They are wild animals , it 's cruel to let them leave their habitat , " she says .
" We should send all of them back to their habitat . "
In New York , mastiff owner Feltenstein complains that Chinese traders are importing the large breed into the USA for new owners who simply find them " too much dog , " leading to a " huge rescue problem , " she says .
" It 's unfortunate that the Han Chinese are profiting from these dogs and exploiting them , and breeding in other breeds to make them more ferocious , " Feltenstein says .
At American Tibetan Mastiff Association shows , winners parade before a large snow lion flag , a symbol of the Tibetan independence movement that is banned in China .
In response to reports that the purebred Tibetan Mastiff was under threat in its homeland , the China National Kennel Club ( CNKC ) has sent dozens back to Qinghai province since 2005 and encouraged local authorities to stop their annual cull , says Zhang Xiaofeng , CNKC representative in Beijing .
Market forces are helping increase and improve the Mastiff population , he says .
Owner and breeder Zhang Liyan rejects any argument against domesticating the breed .
" Unlike other dogs , the Tibetan Mastiff can be like your son , not just a friend , " she says at her Big Sister Zhang breeding center near Beijing .
" I can't sell my bigger dogs as they become part of the family , " says Zhang , 50 , a former restaurant owner who travels to the Tibetan plateau each year .
" When I was young , no one could afford to raise pets , or have a big enough house .
But now society has developed , and people are richer . "
Scientists in Brazil say they have developed a technique for absorbing industry - produced carbon dioxide before it reaches the atmosphere .
The half - centimeter ceramic spheres were developed at the chemistry department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) in Belo Horizonte in south - eastern Brazil .
The inventors told Tierramérica that they believe this is the best method for capturing CO 2 , because the ceramic balls absorb and neutralize the CO 2 before it is released .
When the CO 2 interacts with the sphere material , a high - temperature reaction takes place , said researcher Jadson Belchior .
“ The absorption is n’t instantaneous .
It occurs as a function of time and temperature .
They are the two major variables we can control : a more rapid emission process at higher temperatures , or slower emission at lower temperatures , ” he said .
The duo are keeping the specific composition of the balls a secret and are seeking patents , but they seem a little defensive .
In the Tierramérica interview , “ All of the records indicated that the material we were using , subjected to a certain temperature , would not be effective for absorbing carbon dioxide , ” said coresearcher Geraldo Lima .
Lima and Belchior claim the balls can absorb 40 % of the CO 2 that comes in contact with it , and say they hope to boost that number to 60 % .
Belchior contrasted their approach to CO 2 - capture approaches .
He said , “ In the case of the technology developed for capturing the gas that is already in the atmosphere , it is a correction , because the gas was already released , ” and the pollution has already occurred .
Another advantage , and “ the main point of the proposal , ” according to Lima , is that when each sphere becomes saturated with CO 2 , it is reused for other purposes , for example , as a raw material in the chemical , plastic or textile industries .
“ The resulting residue is carbon dioxide in its gaseous form , which can be packed in cylinders , or its molecules used to make a different molecule through chemical reactions , ” Lima said .
“ Here we have a double environmental function .
Other techniques do n’t have a way to dispose of the CO2 , they just store it . ”
Preliminary tests show that the ceramic material can be reused up to 10 times .
Experiments conducted by researcher Geison Voga Pereira found that each kilogram of the special ceramic can absorb up to 500 grams of CO 2 .
They think their innovation also can add a new wrinkle to the emerging CO 2 capture and credits market , and predict that their spheres may be able to generate revenues 10 times investment costs .
They envision the spheres being used in the exhaust stacks used in , for example , steel , coke and cement industries .

The row over the sacking of Professor David Nutt is deepening , with a bevy of boffins calling for scientific government advisers to be treated with respect and allowed to speak as they see fit .
The group of former and current advisers has sent the " Statement of Principles for the Treatment of Independent Scientific Advice " to government departments .
It asks that advisers , who often do their government work for free , should retain academic freedom even if sitting on an advisory committee .
Independent advisory bodies should be free from political interference , not dismissed for disagreeing with government policy and represented by an independent press office .
Thirdly the group ask that their advice is properly considered and if likely to be rejected then the committee should have the chance to comment privately before the final decision is made .
The statement added : " It is recognised that some policy decisions are contingent on factors other than the scientific evidence , but when expert scientific advice is rejected , the reasons should be described explicitly and publicly . "
The statement is signed by over 20 very senior scientists including Lord Rees of Ludlow , president of the Royal Society , Professor Chris Rapley , director of the Science Museum , Professor David Hand of the Royal Statistical Society , Professor Colin Blakemore and Professor Sheila M Bird .
The full letter is available here , as a pdf .
Lord Rees of Ludlow , president of the Royal Society , writing in the Times said : " A clear statement from the top of government is required to reassure scientists in the advisory structure that what they are doing is important and that their independence is respected . "
Home Secretary Alan Johnson , who started this row a week ago , is today receiving a letter from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee asking for his account of the events leading up to Nutt 's sacking . ®

Last week we revealed the final top ten in our Best of 2009 list , with — yup , as some of you guessed on the group shoutbox three weeks ago — Lady GaGa in top place with her album The Fame .
With roughly 6 million more scrobbles than # 2 artist The Killers had with Day & Age , she definitely earned her spot !
Perhaps unsurprisingly , she ’s also top of the chart for most unwanted scrobbles thanks to the love - it - or - hate - it “ Poker Face . ”
We also put up a data download for those of you interested in remixing or visualising the 2009 data .
We ’d love to hear about your creation too , so do n’t forget to post about it in the web services forum when you ’re done .
All the scrobbles that ’re fit to print
To have a bit more fun with the dataset ourselves , we traded pixels for picas at Last .
HQ for a week and created a newspaper edition of the list !
In addition to the Top 40 , the newspaper includes some local data visualisations for London and New York based on listening in those cities .
We were able to make this thanks to the lovely folks over at Newspaper Club , a new London start - up dedicated to helping people print their own newspapers .
If you ’re out of our newspaper delivery squad ’s range , have no fear : here are downloadable A3 poster versions of the newspaper centrefold visualising month - by - month listening trends for both New York and London .

It ’s got comics , a music crossword , and our favourite — a crabcore connect - the - dots .
Scrobbling in the name of
Moving from one set of charts to another , the race for UK Christmas # 1 has been a hotly debated one this year .
For the last 4 years the # 1 spot has been taken by the winner of X - Factor , a reality show much like Pop Idol , driven by the infamous Simon Cowell .
Bored with the years of “ X - Factor monotony ” , a husband and wife team set up a Facebook campaign to get Rage Against the Machines ’s Killing in the Name to number one .
People started buying the single en masse , and thanks to our exciting modern world of downloads and live updating charts on iTunes , Amazon and other retailers , people realised that the competition was actually achievable .
Hundreds of thousands of people who had before ignored the UK official charts were suddenly inundating the BBC Radio 1 ’s website to get the chart scores , and tuned in to the radio to hear the results first .
Much to everyone ’s disbelief , Rage managed to pull way out in front of X - Factor winner Joe McElderry , bringing in 50,000 more copies sold than Joe , and totalling 500,000 downloads .
The betting industry allegedly lost an estimated £ 1 million , and the single has risen 127 places on our own Top Tracks chart to come in at number 7 for this week .
Last.fm users joined in the campaign :

It 's been plagued by everything from liquid helium leaks to wayward baguettes , but the mega - physics experiment known as the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is finally ready to start smashing protons into each other .
Particle collisions could begin in two weeks .

The LHC is a 27 - kilometer underground tunnel designed to accelerate atomic particles and smash them into each other .
The goal is to see what happens when such particles interact with tremendous amounts of energy , the way they might under extreme conditions in outer space .
The results of LHC experiments will reveal a lot about the origins of our universe , and the composition of matter within it .
CERN , the Swiss facility where the enormous underground experiment is located , has announced that test beams in the LHC have zoomed around most parts of the accelerator without incident :
Particles are smoothly making their way around the 27 km circumference of the LHC .
Last weekend ( 7 - 8 November ) , the first bunches of injection energy protons completed their journey ( anti-clockwise ) through three octants of the LHC 's circumference and were dumped in a collimator just before entering the CMS cavern .
The particles produced by the impact of the protons on the tertiary collimators ( used to stop the beam ) left their tracks in the calorimeters and the muon chambers of the experiment .

One of the coolest parts about accelerators is that when the microscopic particles smash into the walls , they are moving so fast that they leave long tracks in their wakes .
( Researchers can gain information from examining these tracks . )
If everything keeps moving smoothly , we could see some particle - on - particle smashage as early as two weeks from now .
As long as the world does n't end , we 're going to get some long - awaited answers to our questions about our universe .

On Sunday Roll Call had an important heads - up about the next steps in the Senate health care debate .
While we wait for Harry Reid to perfect his Hamlet imitation , it 's worth a read .
McConnell told reporters last week ...
" Once it ’s on the floor , what is a reasonable amount of time to spend in the United States Senate debating one of the most important issues we could ever have before us ? "
McConnell said Republicans are going to " insist " on several weeks of debate and argued an issue like health care — equivalent to 20 percent of the national economy — deserves more than the four weeks accorded the most recent farm bill and at least as much time as the seven weeks given the No Child Left Behind education reform effort and the eight weeks given to an energy bill earlier this decade .
At least eight weeks of debate .
How do they plan to accomplish this ?
Doing that is going to take some time , and the process of amending bills during a floor debate — which can include demanding a 60 - vote threshold for all amendments — could provide the minority ample opportunity to slow things down .
Republicans could also benefit from some built - in delays , including the fact that Democratic leaders have said they ’d like to wait for a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate on the bill before beginning debate .
At least eight weeks : 56 days .
In that time we may expect six thousand eight hundred seventy - two Americans to die from their stalling tactics .
The Senate HELP Committee passed its version of health care reform on July 15th .
Baucus ' Gang of Six negotiations bought Sen. Snowe 's vote on October 14th .
That 's 91 days , and in that time eleven thousand one hundred sixty - seven Americans died from lack of health insurance .
Sen .
Harry Reid is insisting that the CBO score his merged health care bill before he submits it to floor debate , where Mitch McConnell is planning on those eight weeks or more of debate .
The clock started ticking on October 15th , after Baucus ' bill passed .
So far seven hundred thirty - six Americans have died while Harry Reid has been " leaning toward talking about the public option , " as he put it today .
How many more will die while he leans ?
Are Republicans ( and Democrats ) so insensitive as to not care about all these thousands of dead Americans while they dither and argue and collect their health insurance bribes ?
Perhaps not .
Maybe they just do n't understand .
[ DAVID ] GREGORY :
You know , it 's interesting , Senator Kyl , in that vein , in terms of this kind of moral imperative , you and other Republicans have said this healthcare reform should be opposed , and one of the major reasons you cite is how much money it costs , how much it could potentially add to the deficit , although the president says it 'll be deficit - neutral .
And yet when you talk about the war in Afghanistan and the commanders should have more of their troops , I 've never heard you say that that should be deficit - neutral , that war costs should somehow not break the bank .
Why is that disparity there ?
SEN .
KYL : David , no country can afford to scrimp and save or try to win a war on the cheap .
The president himself has said that the war in Afghanistan against these terrorists who killed over 3,000 American on September 11 , 2001 , is a war of necessity .
You have to win it .
And Americans throughout our history have sacrificed when war has called for us to do that .
GREGORY : And is it a , is it a necessity to tackle the fact that there are more and more Americans who die because they do n't have access to health insurance ?
SEN .
KYL : I 'm not sure that it 's a fact that more and more people die because they do n't have health insurance ; but because they do n't have health insurance , the care is not delivered in the best and most efficient way .
Maybe Sen. Kyl is right .
Maybe all Americans must sacrifice to declare war on those terrorists who killed over [ sic ] 3,000 Americans .
Maybe all Americans ought to declare war on those terrorists who are killing that many every three and a half weeks by inaction and delay rather than action .
Tick tick tick , ladies and gentlemen .

Public sex tents ?
Now there 's an idea that should have been shot down the second it was announced from the mouth of a member of the " leather community " in response to complaints about public sex at Folsom Street Fair and its smaller sibling fair , Up Your Alley .
Instead , it appears that at least one of our local leaders ( Supervisor Bevan Dufty ) has agreed to take the matter " under advisement . "
Since our local leaders are having trouble speaking the obvious , we will : Public sex is not appropriate at Folsom Street Fair or anywhere else .
Even in San Francisco .
ESCONDIDO , Calif .  Darrell Littleton calls them “ his guys , ” but he does not trust them .
One got drunk and exposed himself to a jogger in a public park .
Another was a fire captain until he molested his 13 - year - old stepdaughter , went to prison and lost his wife , his job and his home .
Now the man sleeps behind a drive - through restaurant .
Mr. Littleton is a parole agent , and “ his guys , ” about 40 in all , are paroled sex offenders .
On a September morning , as he does each day , Mr. Littleton fired up his laptop computer to check on his charges ; the signals from their global - positioning ankle bracelets trace dotted trails cutting through a Google satellite map .
Mr. Littleton tracks them , calls them frequently and shows up unannounced to make sure they are behaving themselves .
But they still struggle to stay straight .
One of his parolees recently harassed a teenage prostitute , and Mr. Littleton had to “ violate him ”  revoke his parole and return him to prison .
Another promised Mr. Littleton that once he is off parole in a few months , and no longer subject to random drug testing , he is going to resume his marijuana habit .
And before the day was over , another parolee would emerge as a suspect in a sexual assault on a 9 - year - old girl .
“ Twenty is really the ideal caseload for my guys , ” Mr. Littleton said as he drove a high - riding pickup truck on one of several parolee visits he had planned that day .
“ With that kind of caseload , I could spend more time in the field and less in the office .
With these guys , you do n’t want them to know you ’re coming .
You need to watch them when they do n’t know they ’re being watched . ”

A series of high - profile crimes involving parolees in California highlight the challenges of keeping track of them in a state that discharges more than 120,000 inmates annually , more than any other .
I was watching hentai at my college roommates house and I asked if I could use his fleshlight , he said fine and I could hardly get it in it was so full .
I left the room to wash off and ended up running into his ( 37 years old ) mom who is insane and a nympho , one thing led to another and we ended up having sex .
She is now pregnant .
I ejaculated onto her neck but I am worried that there is a possibility she could have got pregnant from her sons semen which was fresh on my penis .
Should I be worried about this ?
It would really freak him out .
If you say something , does it automatically make it so ?
Clearly , that 's what TechCrunch 's Michael Arrington thinks .
Today , he proclaimed that " The Google Phone Is Very Real .
And It 's Coming Soon . "
The story outlines what TechCrunch has " absolutely confirmed " and then knits together a series of assumptions and possible clues into what appears to be a quilt of unattributed fabrication .
Arrington , who is not a journalist ( and has never professed to be one ) , regularly talks to financial guys , with close ties to virtually every major technology company .
He 's also plugged into these same companies at even higher levels .
Oh , and he also invests in companies he writes about .
At times , this can make his information incredibly prescient and also highly self - serving .
The problem is , no one can tell the difference .
If Arrington is a Google investor or stock holder , then this kind of story could be a boon for his holdings .
If he 's an investor in LG ( which he thinks will build the Google phone ) and not Samsung ( which he thinks wo n't ) , then saying so could help boost LG stock and , in turn , his own holdings .
( No , I do n't know if he has stock with either company , but as he states at the end of this long article that defends his impartiality , he started investing again somewhere in the last few years . )
I 'm sure there are those that will consider my rant sour grapes .
They 'll say that Arrington is a brilliant guy who knows things that I do n't and I 'm just frustrated .
Maybe there 's some truth to this .
Really , though , I 'm angrier about the fact that Michael Arrington can write a story with guesses and possible inside information and get away with it .
If I read the story right , he did n't even bother to call Google , LG , or Samsung for confirmation or even to have them say " no comment . "
At least then we'd know he was trying .
Arrington , of course , does n't have to try .
He is our industry 's favorite enfant terrible .
He can say and do virtually anything he wants .
If he wants to abolish embargoes between companies and journalists , he 'll simply say and do so .
If he wants to write based on rumor and not call it that , he can do it .
If he wants to make logical and illogical leaps in his articles , he can do that , too .
The point is there are no rules for Arrington .
I have no illusions that any of this is going to change any time soon .
Arrington 's TechCrunch
Web site network is going strong .
He has some great beat bloggers who break hot stories hours , if not days , before anyone else .
That 's why his site is so popular .
But readers need to understand that Arrington 's motives for any of his content are murky at best .
I do n't think he 's about delivering the best and most reliable information to his audience .
He wants to be big , he wants to be important , and he wants people to visit TechCrunch and read its feeds .
He wants companies paying fealty to him and the aura he exudes .
And he gets all of these things even when he gets it completely wrong .
With the Google phone , I truly believe he 's simply trying to make something so .
Our phone expert Sascha Segan does n't believe the Google Phone rumor and agrees with me that Arrington usually has less - than - altruistic motives for anything he writes .
The irony here is that Michael Arrington is also trying to play the other side of the fence .
He 's been working on the CrunchPad tablet since 2008 , but he has yet to deliver anything more than vapor .
It 's good vapor , though .
The non-existent product has even managed to win an award .
No one knows whether the product will arrive this week , next week , next month , next year , or ever .
Arrington does n't talk to anybody about it , except his trusted minions , and he 'll hand deliver whatever he does make to his bestest friends only .
He 's gotten a pass , mostly , for this failure to launch , but as Arrington continues to try and dream into reality all sorts of tech nonsense , I wonder how long he can count on that .
Second -Class Medicine Germans Unhappy with Alternative Swine Flu Vaccine for Politicians
Damage control is the name of the game in Berlin on Monday as politicians rush to deny that they are receiving a better , safer swine flu vaccine than ordinary Germans .
The first of 50 million doses arrived in Germany on Monday .
On a monthly basis , retail sales increased 1.4 % from September to October ( seasonally adjusted ) , and sales are off 1.7 % from October 2008 .
Excluding auto sales and parts , retail sales rose 0.2 % in October .
The increase in October was mostly a rebound from the decline in September .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows retail sales since 1992 .
This is monthly retail sales , seasonally adjusted ( total and ex-gasoline ) .
This shows that retail sales fell off a cliff in late 2008 , and appear to have bottomed , but at a much lower level .
The red line shows retail sales ex-gasoline and shows there has been little increase in final demand .
The second graph shows the year - over - year change in retail sales since 1993 .
Real retail sales declined by 1.7 % on a YoY basis .
The year - over - year comparisons are much easier now since retail sales collapsed in October 2008 .
Retail sales bottomed in December 2008 .
Here is the Census Bureau report :
The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for October , adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and trading - day differences , but not for price changes , were $ 347.5 billion , an increase of 1.4 percent ( ±0.5 % ) from the previous month , but 1.7 percent ( ±0.5 % ) below October 2008 .
Total sales for the August through October 2009 period were up 1.5 percent ( ±0.3 % ) from the same period a year ago .
The August to September 2009 percent change was revised from - 1.5 percent ( ±0.5 % ) to - 2.3 percent ( ±0.3 % ) .
It appears retail sales have bottomed , but there has been little pickup in final demand .
Haikyoing is kind of an addiction .
Every time I get back from a long haikyo weekend , trudging through dusty overgrown schoolhouses and factories , I say to myself - ‘ that ’ll do , pig ’ .
But then a few weeks or months later I ’m always out there again , doing much the same thing , striving for a more authentic experience , a more exciting explore , more mind - blowing shots .
Sometimes I get it and sometimes I do n’t , and resultingly sometimes the articles I post here find a larger audience and sometimes they do n’t .
Here you can find the most popular posts of the year , sorted not by me but by you , the readers of this site , according to how much you voted a post up or down via social media buttons , how much you linked to it , and chiefly how many of your eyeballs looked it over .

Osarizawa is one of only three of my more recent haikyo explores ( along with number 9 and number 2 ) to make it onto this list , which surprised me .
It was shot with my Nikon d90 dSLR , whereas all the others were shot with a Canon Powershot compact camera .
It was a more recent explore , so it ’s true that it has n’t had the time the others have to be seen - though a popular website i09.com borrowed shots from it with a linkback .
That sort of thing probably helps my Google Pagerank , but clearly did n’t send that many click - throughs .
It makes me wonder if people are more interested in straight up explores and documentation of explores than they are of more artistic ( I hope ) shots .
I ’m interested to hear what you think in the comments .
One of my favorites .
It ’s true that there is only really one photo in this post - the shot of the Osarizawa Chemical Pools from various angles .
There was other stuff there , an excellent factory on a hill , but shooting it and showing its grandeur proved very tough - it was just too long , with too much nothing stuff either side of it .

The only other post shot with d90 to make it into the top 10 .
I was beginning to shoot more regularly in HDR , using a cable release to bracket shots smoothly .
The interior was very dark , as the whole structure was completely surrounded by thick overgrowth , so exposing the brighter shots fully could take up to 30 seconds .
It was probably this haikyo that made me realize most I needed to get a wider angle lens .
I wanted to capture all of the interior rooms , but was just unable to do so , bounded by the limits of the walls and rooms themselves .
I still got shots I ’m pleased with , but acquiring wide - angle ( Tokina 11 - 16 mm ) since then has really opened things up .

I ’m surprised this is on here , though it did gather a number of linkbacks on various minor blogs .
I think its appeal is more in the garish nature of the decorations in each room than from the fact that it is a haikyo .
Love Hotels , Soaplands , these things generate more interest than haikyo do for obvious reasons - so any time my path crosses with them I tend to get a bit of a spike .
I tinkered with the shots I got from my Powershot camera a fair bit , to try and best show the wallpapers and bed artifacts at their utmost garish , with as little distraction from the ruin as possible .
Some ruin is graceful and worthy , while others is just a bunch of plastic bags , empty drink cartons , and half - burnt porn - not very photogenic .
I tried to chop most of it out .

Amazing place , loved it , wish I ’d had my d90 and better knowledge of photography when I went , as it ’s unlikely I ’ll return .
Quite a trek to go there just to see it .
Not much to say about shooting it , other than in low light was very tricky , especially in the mammoth hall .
I ’m not sure if I had a tripod then , but in every contained space I did all I could to open windows and doors to let in natural light .
We arrived at night and explored under cover of darkness .
That was great , nail - biting fun .

My second time back to Sports World ( see the third time here ) , hoping to ‘ do it justice ’ .
I was n’t using HDR then , but did manage to capture some great shots of the water tubes , a whole side of the park I did n’t see on my first trip there .

A long - standing favorite on the site , with the most comments of any post I ’ve put up - I think because it ’s one of perhaps two haikyo ( the other being the Negishi Grandstand– 29 comments ) to have a connection to the English - speaking , American world .
Soldiers served or were involved with them both , and can come to respective pages on my site and remember the good old days .
Antennae , shot through the fence .
I was surprised at first by this trend , then felt quite warm and cosy inside that the explore I ’d done had had this unintended consequence , of bringing up some good memories and even acting a little bit like a friends reunited kind of thing .

One of my earliest explores , packing only the Canon Powershot compact camera , this post is also the all - time most popular post on my site , with 58,000 page views .
It all happened very suddenly too- some Japanese news site linked to me and sent almost all that traffic to me over the course of a few days .
For a brief while I felt famous , riding high .
It ’s funny how a tiny slice of exposure can do that for you .
For the week following , as the spike trailed off , I entered a phase we could only call withdrawal .
That ’s a problem of rampaging ups , there ’s always a down to follow them .
Much better is a steady , gradual ascent , where you can always keep your feet on the ground .
In line with that , general viewing stats on my site have increased steadily over the nearly two years it ’s been active , approaching 40,000 per month :
It looks low in December cos we ’re only a third of the way through .
The massive spike in 2008.08 was the Queen Chateau .
Which leads me to clarify , this top 10 is not only of places explored in 2009 , but simply of the most popular explores on the site in 2009 .
The three month spike in early 2009 was when I had a lot of quirky Japan content , weird conveni products , cosplay girls , stuff like that , and was posting it every day .
Anybody think I should go back to that breakneck pace ?

I ’m surprised to find this one in the top 10 , let alone so near the top .
I ca n’t really explain it .
It ’s not as gaudy as the Akasaka Love hotel , nor as ruined as the Pearl Love Hotel , or as impressive a hotel as the Shin Shu Kanko .
It was great to explore though , so perhaps that ’s why ?
Few of the shots stand out .
Perhaps it attracted someone ’s attention and got a lot of linkbacks , that ’s all I can guess .

My second time back to Nichitsu with the d90 , seeking out the brain in a jar in the Doctor ’s Office ( reportedly now stolen ) .
Somewhat surprisingly that post is not in the top 10 , though it was quite anticipated .
Perhaps though , at number four and coming after three other posts on roughly the same topic , people had got a bit tired of Nichitsu .
Either way , the Elementary School takes second place .

There ’s a lot of stuff in Ashio .
Some of it is plain to see , though fenced off , like the Degawa power station , the main factory , the mine hubs .
The shrine though is a little harder to find , set back up an overgrown path , shrouded from view by a screen of trees , up a steep hill .
It is one of the haikyos , along with love hotels and soaplands , unique to Japan .
Shrine .
It drew several link - backs from places as diverse as gamer ’s message boards ( it looks just like Silent Hill ! ) and geocaching sites ( perhaps because there was something like a geocache in the second shrine , a plastic bag with notebooks and pens that served as a kind of haikyo guestbook ) .
I do n’t know if it would top my personal top 10 list , but it would certainly be up there .
Faded out apartments
Well , that ’s the 2009 top 10 .
I ’m all ears to hear your thoughts , comments , theories , as to how the list shook out like this .
Where are the other Iwate mines ?
Where ’s the bowling alley and Keishin hopsital ?
Also I ’ll welcome any suggestions , if you ’d care to make them , on what I can do to improve this site , make it more accessible , make it more of what you ’d like to see .
2009 was a good haikyo year , let ’s hope for more in 2010 !
You can see all the haikyo on this site in the Ruins / Haikyo Gallery .
Buddha - killer Becky and I have been in a bit of a back - and - forth lately about a peculiar phenomenon we ’ve been observing : the preponderance lately of hip young Christians ( and even Quakers ) getting worked up about the atheist , materialist , Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek .
( May the bodhisattvas of multiculturalism forgive my leaving out the diacritical marks . )
Last year , at the American Academy of Religion meeting , I remember being amazed to discover that an enthusiastic paper on Zizek began with a prayer .
What followed was a young , optimistic , good - looking evangelical pastor explaining why Zizek points the way toward a genuine “ postmodern ” Christian theology .
And at this year ’s AAR , the man himself was present .
He called himself “ unconditionally a Christian ” — insofar as being a Christian means being an atheist .
( Adam Kotsko ’s significant Zizek and Theology points to Zizek ’s resonance with the “ death of God ” theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Thomas J.J. Altizer , so it was fitting that he shared the stage that day with Alitzer .
Not that identification with one of theology ’s greatest has - beens is any advertisement for his relevance . )
It ’s like they — the theologians — do n’t believe him .
Pretty straight out , Zizek ’s books attack pretty much all the cherished convictions of traditional Christian thought and culture : love of neighbor , social hierarchy , mercy , meekness , and even basic theism .
Let there be no mistake , there has truly been a move toward Christianity in his recent books — a celebration of Christianity , indeed , with a muscular exclusivism , at the expense of other religions ( following Hegel ’s reasoning ) , that would make most polite Christians today blush .
Zizek ’s “ theological turn , ” like that of Terry Eagleton , amounts to no less than an attack on how theology is normally done .
Like Terry Eagleton ( and even Antony Flew ) , however , people with more conventional theological predilections have flocked to him as an ostensible bridge that their Christianity might cross into secular culture .
If they cherish their convictions , however , I ’d warn them against doing so .
What this contingent represents is a desire to do something quite different with theology — to replace church with a bureaucracy ( Zizek ) or a revolution ( Eagleton ) or a minimalist positivism ( Flew ) .
My advice for theologians concerning Zizek : fight him !
That ’s what he wants .
And that ’s what his thinking — so rich , so surprising , and so irreverent to necessary reverences — deserves .
( See , e.g. , my discussion of Adam Kirsch ’s attack on Zizek last year at the New Republic . )
Returning to Zizek ’s books again lately , I find in them more and more an attitude that can only be called theological — an analysis of living gods .
But these are not the gods any respectable Christian theology should want .
These are the gods of Christianity ’s ruins , its graveyard , and accepting them means accepting the basic premise that the whole religion is a joke that its adherents are too dense to get .
But if that ’s not a problem for you , then by all means , help yourself to this brilliant , alluring figure .
Whether you are a consistent morning person , or a person who would normally wake up at a later time but are trying to train yourself to get going earlier in the day , there are certain tried and true tips that will get you moving in the morning .
Here are 17 tips that will help you become the morning person you truly want to be !
1 . Make sure that you have a really good reason to wake up early .
This is the most important thing when it comes to rising at an early hour .
If there is no motivating factor , you would probably just stay in bed .
Make sure your reason is a good one .
It helps to make a list .
2 . Get stuff done in the AM .
Make sure that you give yourself specific tasks to accomplish .
If you do n’t accomplish your tasks , you will be less likely to get up early next time .
Make sure that you use your time effectively .
3 . Make sure that you catch enough ZZZ ’s the night before .
If you are tired during the day , then getting up early may be causing more problems than it is fixing .
Make sure that you get a full night ’s rest .
Go to sleep earlier , so then you can wake up early and feel rested !
4. Calculate how much sleep you will need .
Make sure that you give yourself enough time to begin to get ready for bed so that you can wind down properly and still get enough sleep .
Everyone needs a different amount of sleep , find what works for you !
5. Sleep Better .
Many people need to sleep “ better , ” not just longer .
Make sure that you have a high quality pillow and a relaxing environment .
6 . Do n’t hit snooze !
Make sure that you put your clock far enough away so you have to get up .
Do n’t listen to the voice in your head that tells you to sleep in !
Get up when you plan on to .
7 . Get straight out of bed !
When that alarm sounds , get a move on !
The longer you stay in bed , the more likely it is that you will sleep in .
8 . Use an alarm clock .
Make your alarm loud , annoying and hard to turn off !
9 . Get yourself on a good routine .
Get your morning routine down pat .
Make sure that you stick to early rising , even on the weekends .
10 . Reward yourself .
Give yourself a small incentive in the morning .
Some time to relax or have a cup of coffee and have a quiet moment is always a good place to start .
11 . Know what you lose by sleeping late .
Make sure you understand why you are waking up early and what will happen negatively ( less personal time , staying late at the office ) if you sleep in .
12 . Do n’t allow yourself to sleep in .
Schedule important things early in the morning so you have to be up and at ‘em .
13 .
Have an early wake up buddy .
Develop a friend support system .
If all of you vow to wake up early , you can help each other stick to the goal .
14 . Create a reward for achieving this goal .
A reward creates confidence and motivation .
15 . Keep records .
Mark down how many times you choose to sleep in to help you realize that it ’s not “ just this one time ” .
16 . Applaud yourself for everything you got done .
You deserve it !
17 .
Try to avoid the stimulants that affect your sleep schedule , namely caffeine and alcohol , which completely destroys your sleep and quality of your sleep , which actually touches on your waking time .
" Just Compensation " Can Lead to More Government Takings
We are trapped in a world with far too few IRS audits .
Law - abiding tax payers hate being audited and their representatives in Congress have heard the message loud and clear — strangling the ability of the IRS to conduct field examinations .
The problem with the current state of affairs is that non-law - abiding tax payers find it far too easy to avoid paying their fair share .
Barry Nalebuff and I have a new column in Forbes ( Winning the Audit Lottery ) that suggests a fairly simple solution to this regulatory failure .
The IRS should start compensating people for the inconvenience of an audit .
The idea is the brainchild of ( my coauthor ) Joe Bankman , who has estimated that a “ payment of $ 3,000 per audit would overcompensate almost all taxpayers . ”
The idea is also discussed in this interesting article by Sarah Lawsky .
What really interests me about Bankman ’s idea is that requiring the government to pay for its takings might lead to more takings .
This is very different from the way we usually think about the impact of compensation :
A central idea behind the Constitution ’s Takings Clause is to reduce government ’s inclination to take too much .
A government that is forced to compensate for the exercise of its eminent domain power is less likely to engage in value - reducing land grabs .
But requiring compensation might increase the willingness of government to take .
As Barry and I wrote :
The big hope is to end the stranglehold that anti-IRS forces have on compliance efforts .
. . .
Absent compensation , Congress has vetoed efficient audit programs–setting the audit rates far below their optimal level .
Here ’s a rare case where forcing the government to pay for something is likely to increase its demand .
The government , in deciding whether to take , is in some ways on both sides of the market , acting as both a buyer and a seller .
The normal intuition that the just compensation requirement will dampen government ’s demand to take conceives of the government as a buyer .
But in a representative government , the amount of takings will be partly determined by the willingness of representatives to sell at a particular price .
When the selling price is zero — as with current tax audits , government as representatives of sellers may choose to sell very little .
( This possibility was to my knowledge first seen in Bruce A. Ackerman ‘s classic Private Property and the Constitution . )
Could Compensation Cause Wrongful Imprisonment ?
The possibility that compensation will cause more taking leads to truly perverse possibilities .
For example , in 2008 a Florida statute went into effect compensating individuals who have been wrongfully incarcerated $ 50,000 a year .
( Amazingly , our Constitutional requirement of just compensation does not apply because government has not taken the liberty of the wrongfully incarcerated as long as he or she received a sufficiently fair trial ! )
The audit compensation logic suggests that offering this compensation might actually lead to an increase in wrongful incarceration .
In a world without compensation , citizens might require that the criminal justice system take extra care to make sure that the innocent are not imprisoned .
But in a world with up to $ 2 million in compensation , citizen - voters may instruct their representatives that they are not as concerned about having error - free adjudication and , on the margin , they can live with a few more wrongful incarcerations .
Let me be clear : I do n’t think it is likely that compensation requirement will lead to much of a change — one way or the other — on the number of wrongful convictions .
Bureaucrats deciding whether or not to take might not really care whether government has to pay compensation .
Indeed , the potential insensitivity of government takings to the cost of compensation has led some advocates to argue for additional judicial scrutiny and oversight .
For example , because the Fifth Amendment prohibits taking of “ private property … for public use , without just compensation , ” some people would like to have courts only allow takings that independently satisfy a “ public use . ”
The Supreme Court rebuffed one such effort in its 2005 Kelo v. New London decision , which upheld the exercise of eminent domain by New London , Connecticut , to condemn homes in a 90 - acre blue - collar residential neighborhood :
The city planned to lease the land for $ 1 for 99 years to a private developer so that the developer could build a waterfront hotel , office space , and higher - end housing as well as “ a number of traditional public uses , like a marina , a walkway , a proposed Coast Guard Museum , and public parking for the museum and the adjacent Fort Trumbull park . ”
( Just last Monday , Pfizer announced that it was closing the anchor R&D headquarters which was envisioned as the anchor of the development . )
But the audit story teaches that the Kelo plaintiffs might have been better off if the takings clause did not require just compensation .
In a world without compensation , the land owners might have been better able to rouse political resistance to the ill - fated plan ( just as audit victims have effectively organized to almost completely extinguish the field audit ) .
Uncompensated takings are so unfair that you might need a really good public reason to justify imposing the concentrated burden .
Just Charges for Government Givings ?
An analogous perversity arises in the analysis of government “ givings . ”
A government giving ( as coined by Avi Bell and Gideon Parchomovsky in a classic Yale Law Journal article ) is a circumstance where a government action bestows a benefit on a private citizen .
While the Constitution requires just compensation after a government taking , it does not require a “ just charge ” after a government giving .
One example of a just charge is when a government levies a special assessment on property owners who benefit from new sidewalks being installed on their land .
Without “ just charges ” we might worry that government would not have adequate incentives to bestow benefits on its citizens ; that government would undergive .
But in deciding whether to impose a special assessment in conjunction with a giving , the government is acting now not only as a seller but also as representatives of buyers .
A constitutional duty to impose just charges might lead to fewer givings as citizens instruct their representatives that they can do without sidewalks if they are going to be charged for them .
This is just a flip of the original audit idea .
In assessing the impact on government takings ( and givings ) of mandating compensation ( and charges ) , we need to not only assess the first - order bureaucratic impact of the cash flow , but the political blow - back when constituents call their representatives .
Ever since the guilty verdict was handed down against the defendants in the Pirate Bay trial , what would happen next had been surrounded by uncertainty .
Accusations of bias were leveled at both the original trial judge , and two of the judges set to handle the appeal .
Today the Supreme Court handed down its decision - there will be no retrial .
In April this year , all four defendants in the Pirate Bay trial were found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison and a fines of $ 905,000 each .
Of course , the defense did n’t accept the decision , and went on to file for an appeal .
The appeal was scheduled to start last month but like most things in this case , it became surrounded in controversy .
According to defense lawyer Per E Samuelsson , two of three judges could be susceptible to bias due to their membership in pro-copyright groups .
Ulrika Ihrfelt was a member of the Swedish Copyright Association ( SFU ) and Christina Boutz a member of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property ( SFIR ) .
The same kind of bias accusations were earlier leveled at Judge Tomas Norstrom who presided over the original trial .
The defense felt that if it could get a decision that Norstrom was biased , then the original case would have to be tried all over again , rather than going straight to appeal .
Samuelsson submitted his complaints to the Court of Appeal , but it subsequently ruled that the judgment of the two appeal judges would not be swayed by their involvement in the pro-copyright groups .
Then , somewhat predictably , Samuelsson announced he would appeal this decision and take the question of bias to the Supreme Court .
Today the decision on that appeal was announced .
The Supreme Court ruled that the defense will be allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court on the issue of bias in the case of the two appeal judges .
They will not , however , be able to appeal the decision in the case of Judge Tomas Norstrom , despite him being a member of the same copyright groups .
Ove Nilsson of the Supreme Court admitted that it “ may seem a bit strange ” that Norstrom ’s case ca n’t be appealed , but those are the rules .
The appeal of the original case is due to be heard in 2010 .
All eight classes of Star Wars : The Old Republic have been revealed , leaving me only one question :
What the hell is a Sith Inquisitor ?
I get that they 're supposed to be a more badass version of a Sith Warrior with different ranged abilities .
But if that 's the case , would n't all players playing as Sith Warriors graduate to Inquisitors after playing long enough ?
Jedi Consular — the other new class revealed — confuses me less .
" Consular " sounds like a political position ; one you 'd have to train for specifically as opposed to a rank you achieve over time .
So I guess I 'll be playing on the Jedi faction simply to avoid asking myself uncomfortable questions .

What Is It ?
Star Wars :
The Old Republic is a massively multiplayer online game set way , way back in the ancient history of the galaxy far , far away .
The Sith and the Jedi are rival factions and apparently things are getting explosive between the two .
Enough so that players who choose to play on one faction side or the other will have plenty to shoot at , lightsaber cut or otherwise inconvenience on various planets in the Star Wars universe .
The classes are Jedi Consular / Sith Inquisitor , Jedi Knight / Sith Warrior , Smuggler / Bounty Hunter , Trooper / Imperial Agent .
Companion characters will figure heavily into gameplay , as will storytelling ( come on , it 's BioWare ) .
Space travel has yet to be revealed or discussed .

What We Saw
I played through about 95 % of a quest we 'll call " The Tomb of Tulac Horde " because I 'm not sure what its official name is , but that just about sums it up .
I was in the role of a Sith Inquisitor acolyte with a nice rack and red hair — and I was role playing her with an attitude problem that somehow did n't get her Force - choked even once during the play through .
The quest involves going into a tomb to collect three tablets and returning to your Sith master .
Additionally , you could accept a quest to activate something in the tomb called the Red Machine for some other dude standing outside the tomb .
Also , you could talk to and accept another quest involving mind - raping a Jedi being held in a Sith dungeon , but I was told by a LucasArts representative not to pursue that quest .
How Far Along Is It ?
It 's hard to say with so limited an experience .
Furthermore , no release date has been suggested and while names have been collected for the closed beta , there 's no word on how that 's progressing .
I think I was playing on a very unfinished product on account of some missing text , the fact that I was n't allowed to explore very much and the part where I was playing an MMO strangely devoid of other players .

What Needs Improvement ?
I can't tell the difference between Sith Warrior and Inquistor : Just looking at the list of powers suggests that the class difference between Warrior and Inquisitor is supposed to exist .
But while playing my big jugged female character , I just did n't feel any different from a Sith .
I shocked people , I drained life force , I cut ‘em up with lightsabers .
How is this different whether I 'm a Warrior or Inquisitor ?
Wow , is the whole galaxy a size D or just the Sith chicks ?
I 'm not as annoyed as I am bemused by the boobs I saw in Old Republic .
I almost missed half of what my acolyte was saying during the opening quest cinematic because I was watching her bosom stay oddly stationary while the rest of her body would shift when she sighed in boredom at her boss .
Then , I practically ran into the bosom of another Sith female just trying to walk out the door .
Finally , the Sith who assigned me the Jedi mind - rape quest I was n't permitted to explore must 've been using the Dark Side to keep her rack from sagging .
Seriously , they took up one third of the screen in some camera angles during her quest - assignment cinematic .

What Should Stay The Same ?
Excellent Voice Work :
This is where BioWare really feels different than other MMOs to me .
Every character I talked to had a different voice and sounded like they could actually act .
It definitely speaks to the quality of the product LucasArts is encouraging BioWare to produce .
Good Use of Camera Angles : During cinema scenes , the camera would cut angles – much like they do in Mass Effect cut scenes .
It kept things interesting and gave me more opportunities to look at things other than my character 's chest .
Also , they did n't over - use it , which is crucial to its success as a storytelling tool .

Hey , It 's A Star Wars MMO :
The quest involved navigating a series of rooms around an open space .
The enemies were all slime - filled worms , reprogrammed droids or escaped Sith slaves .
There was also a larger worm near the Red Machine — but it died just as quickly with a quick life drain followed by a lightsaber ground pound .
Overall , the experience felt exactly like I 'd expect an MMO to feel .
The controls worked exactly like you 'd expect them to ( WASD to move , M for map , numbers or clicking for attacks , etc. ) , the menu system was familiar and it was n't hard to master the combat once you got used to lightsaber fighting .
Old hats of MMOs will have zero trouble adjusting and the rest of us will overcome the learning trauma for the sheer joy of swinging a lightsaber around .
Final Thoughts
I 'm happy I got to see the game , but I 'm sad that it was such a limited experience that basically amounts to your average fetch quest in any other MMO ( only with more story behind it and higher production values ) .
Also , I would 've really liked to see that Jedi mind - rape quest because that sounded like it would yield more of the BioWare dialogue I 'm addicted to .
Advertisement
But , from what little I saw , I can say that it 's coming along .
And no matter how many times I see that E3 trailer , it still looks badass .
They actually let us re-watch it in LucasArts ' super - huge theater with surround sound .
LucasArts Old Republic Producer Jake Neri actually cautioned me when I headed for the third row back from the screen , " Do n't sit there , you 'll throw up . "
It was awesome .

The mayor of London , Boris Johnson recently said that the recycling and reusing of old products including mobile phones should be common sense practices that more people should be doing .
The mayor also said that people should be taking practical action to cut down on the amount of waste they are creating .
The Mayor was speaking on the topic as £ 12 million is about to be approved by the London Waste and Recycling Board for a new green energy facility .
Also a further 5 million is expected to be invested in the Recycle for London program which will cut down on the amount of waste that is sent to landfill over the next 3 years .
The Recycle for London campaign said that old mobile phones contain many toxic components so it ’s important they are disposed of correctly through recycling .

Cereal crops this year are expected to be the second largest ever , after a record harvest in 2008 .
Brett Favre is number one leader of passing touchdowns and the other active player on this list beside Peyton Manning , so the statistics may be out of date when you read this .
Favre was a scholarship player for the University of Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles ( 1987 - 90 ) where he still holds many records .
He was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the 1991 NFL draft in the second round as the 33rd overall pick , but was not a favorite of head coach Jerry Glanville and received little playing time .
He only threw four passes his rookie season : two interceptions including a pick - 6 and two incompletions .
He was trading to the Green Bay Packers after the season and the Favre dynasty blossomed .
He played for the Packers for 16 seasons , leading them to two Super Bowls but only winning one ( Super Bowl XXXI ) .
After the 2007 season , Favre announced his retirement , but after a few months of retired life he returned to professional football for the New York Jets ( 2008 ) .
He played there one season before again retiring .
Once again , before the 2009 season , Favre announce he still wanted to play again and joined the Minnesota Vikings as QB .
During the 2009 season , Brett Favre became the only QB to beat all 32 teams in the National Football League .
As of this time he has completed 6,083 of 9,811 pass attempts for 69,329 yards , 497 touchdowns , and 317 interceptions in 289 games .
He currently has a career QB rating of 86.6 , been selected to 10 Pro-Bowls , and is a six time All - Pro selection .
Favre is a sure fire future Pro Football Hall of Famer -- if he can ever stay retired long enough .
We 've obtained a copy of Tim Donaghy 's book , Blowing the Whistle , which purports to expose the NBA 's " culture of fraud " and which Random House was set to publish next month — until , a source says , the league threatened to sue .
Advertisement
The book is the former referee 's account of his time in the NBA and the events that led to his conviction , in 2007 , on charges that he relayed inside information on NBA games — including several that he was working — to a professional gambler .
Blowing the Whistle falls somewhere between a confessional and an indictment , both of his former colleagues and their employer .
In the book , Donaghy alleges , among other things , that referee Dick Bavetta spoke unabashedly about his role as the NBA 's " go - to guy . "
Donaghy cites Game 6 of the notorious 2002 Western Conference finals , between the Lakers and the Kings — a game that NBA conspiracy theorists still talk about as if it were basketball 's grassy knoll .
Donaghy , who was not assigned to the game , reports that Bavetta " openly talked about the fact that the league wanted a Game 7 . "
We 'll have excerpts later today .
Donaghy is currently in a federal detention center near Tampa , a week away from his release .
About 10 months ago , he shopped the book to Triumph Books , an imprint of Random House , according to a source close to Donaghy .
Triumph , the source says , " put forth a huge effort to verify every statement in that book . "
( Triumph 's editorial director , Tom Bast , declined to comment . )
Two weeks ago , Blowing the Whistle was ready for printing ; 60 Minutes had plans to interview Donaghy in conjunction with the book 's publication .
Then the NBA came calling .
" They came after Random House and threatened a lawsuit , " the source says , " and Random House just rolled and decided to not go with it .
It 's really that simple . "
To his knowledge , no one at the NBA had actually read the book .
Advertisement
" Which is why , " he goes on , " Triumph was so intrigued as to why the parent company decided to not go with it .
Because there was no logical reasoning other than an open threat .
It just does n't make sense .
If they had come down and said , ' There are some specific things that are flat - out lies or they 're wrong and we think there are fabrications or something , ' then there 'd be some basis to say , ' OK , we need to back up and double - check this . '
But this was just an open comment .
And so we do n't know what the specific basis of that potential suit might 've been . "
The book no longer has an Amazon page ; it 's cached here .
Meanwhile , Donaghy is looking for another publisher .
He may even self - publish .
" It 's dead right now , " the source says .
" The whole thing has fallen flat on its face .
...
Obviously , the NBA has got some people running scared . "
That which we feared most hath come to pass : Mean , anonymous people are being forcefully purged from the internet , with lawsuits .
First the skankblogger affair , and now it 's happening again !
Uh , sort of .
The latest case : A decorating firm in Queens called Holiday Image has asked a court to force Google to reveal who made a Gmail account in the company CEO 's name , then sent fraudulent emails to clients of the company badmouthing the company itself , and its clients .
Well !
We are not lawyers but that one sounds a lot more like " fraud " than does the Liskula Cohen case , where a pissed rival girl made an anonymous blog calling Liskula a skank .
That one just sounded like " dumb . "
But the type of dumb that should be protected by free speech !
The bigger issue here is that if Google plans to roll over and reveal the identity of anyone doing something anonymously on the internet that pisses someone else off , we 're all screwed .
Here 's another case that 's a little more serious , courtesy of someone who is a lawyer —
Anne Salisbury , who defended skankblogger Rosemary Port in the Liskula Cohen case .
She notes a case in California , where a developer is suing to get Google to reveal the identities of an investigative group of journalists who wrote stories about a bribery scheme the developer was involved in :
Google has taken the position that unless it receives a written
" motion to quash " the subpoena , it will release the information to the
developer 's attorneys .
Many people in the free speech community are
alarmed at this potentially dangerous incursion , because of the belief
that vigorous , honest discourse will be stifled by fear of retribution
if personal , identifying information can be so easily obtained .
The problem is not anonymous insult artists or their victims .
The problem is Google .
Why do n't you just shut up , Google ?

I saw a recent press release about one of Sheldon Jacobson ’s projects that investigates vaccination issues for H1N1 .
What is interesting about the press release is that it actually promotes the field of operations research .
Maybe the grassroots efforts to promote OR are working !
You can read the press release for yourself , but check out the plug for OR :
Jacobson ’s field is Operations Research ( OR for short ) .
OR is a combination of a multitude of tools , including aspects of engineering , computer science , mathematical modeling and algorithms , and statistical analysis .
It also utilizes tactics like probability theory , game theory , decision analysis , and simulation to find optimal solutions to complex problems .
OR ’s countless applications have led Jacobson to conduct research in areas as far - flung as aviation security , automobile fuel consumption , NCAA basketball tournaments , and predictions for presidential elections …
“ When one does research , it is an opportunistic situation .
You are constantly bombarded with challenges in life and society , and there are wonderful problems that can be addressed by using engineering , computer science , and specifically , operations research . ”
Hopefully , this is part of a trend that helps increase the awareness of our field .

Agnosticism , Atheism , Non-religious
Introduction
Agnosticism is the faith system associated with material science ( physics ) and strict mathematical logic .
It is a non-exclusive faith system in that it can be paired with any other number of religious beliefs at the user ’s discretion .
Agnosticism holds that while spiritual things may exist , there is no conclusive evidence to be found in the material world for believing so .
This is strictly distinct from another faith system , atheism , which holds that there is conclusive evidence to be found in the material world for believing that an intelligent spiritual force does not exist .
There are some atheists who believe that while nothing intelligent exists in the spiritual realm , there is a spiritual realm nonetheless ; these people are pantheists .
A few people think nothing of spirituality at all ; this group might be called non-religious .
Agnosticism
Belief in spirits almost always includes a belief that the spiritual realm and the physical realm will , on occasion , interact with each other .
Agnosticism is a faith system which actively seeks this interaction .
A person who looks for evidence of the interaction is an agnostic ; if the evidence is convincing , then presumably the agnostic would change belief system to whichever religion exposed the interaction between realms .
If the evidence is not convincing , then the agnostic would remain agnostic .
Note that an agnostic is not an atheist , but that an agnostic might convert to atheism in the same way that conversion to any other religion is possible : the agnostic would need to find convincing evidence supporting the adoption of that faith system .
Atheism
There are no universally known scientific tests for disproving the existence of spiritual things ; therefore , atheism is a religion based on faith .
There are atheists who have found sufficient evidence of spiritual things despite knowing that there are no deity figures within the spiritual realm .
These atheists are not categorized , but some religions which have branches teaching of an all - pervading non-sentient force include Buddhism , Hinduism , various primal faith systems , and branches of Neo- paganism such as Druidism , Shamanism , and Wicca .
Many people who are professed atheists are upset due to perceived injustices perpetuated by religious organizations .
A common belief of atheists is that all known religions must be invalid by virtue of their causing mankind more harm than good .
There are statistical tests for supporting this claim ; however , such tests will never be conclusive and will always have a certain obvious degree of subjectivity in their interpretation .
Some atheists chose their belief out of simple personal preference , preferring not to elaborate on causality .
This habit can be found in all religions , and is not unique to atheists .

I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race . "

Non-religion
Some people have a total lack of faith system , neither believing nor disbelieving in a spiritual realm but they are few and far between .
The fact that these people are so rare is a matter of intense curiosity .
There is strong evidence supporting the notion that there is something inherent in the human design which makes practically all people question whether or not a spiritual realm exists , if they doubt its existence at all .
BAY CITY , Texas �( CNNMoney.com ) --
At a Texas power plant , two men in head - to - toe yellow jumpsuits are perched above a pool filled with still , crystal - clear water -- and nearly 20 years worth of nuclear waste .
The 40 - feet deep pool , about the size of an Olympic - sized swimming pool , is the current home to thousands of uranium - filled fuel rods -- the radioactive byproducts of a nuclear reactor .
The men are using a robotic arm to position the rods sitting at the bottom of the pool .
Pools such as this one are a temporary solution to a very long term problem : the hotly contested debate over what to do with the country 's nuclear waste .
Storing nuclear waste on site in pools , or in what 's called " dry casks " outside the plant , seems an acceptable solution for the next several decades at existing plants .
But nuclear waste remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years , far longer than the manmade pools are likely to survive .
With global warming concerns and rising power demand , the idea of using more nuclear power is gaining traction .
The Texas plant is among dozens nationwide that have applied to build more reactors .
But some say a more permanent solution should be found before more new plants are built .
" The industry wants to build now and worry about the waste later , " said Edwin Lyman , a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists .
But to build " dozens or hundreds of new plants when we do n't have any plausible means forward on waste disposable is irresponsible . "
Reduce , reuse , recycle
Recycling the waste , as the French do , is often held up by lay people and politicians in the United States as a solution to this country 's waste problem .
When waste is recycled , the uranium and plutonium can be separated out from used nuclear fuel and fed back into a reactor .
Critics hate it because the process of separating out the plutonium enriches the element to something closer to what 's needed to build a nuclear bomb .
Supporters like it because it reduces the need to go out and mine new uranium for fuel .
But recycling is n't an ironclad solution for waste .
It may reduce the amount of high level waste left over -- the French say it reduces it by a factor of eight , but others like Lyman argue it 's more like a factor of two .
Either way , there is still some waste leftover .
" There 's no process that does n't have waste at the end , " said Steven Kraft , senior director of used fuel management at the industry 's own Nuclear Energy Institute .
Or as Jonathan Burton , an expert in nuclear waste at the consultancy Accenture , put it , " There 's only one solution that 's OK , and that 's geologic disposal . "
A mountain of nuclear waste
Geologic disposal , or burying the stuff deep in the earth , had been the government 's plan for decades .
Although other methods of disposal were studied -- sending it into outer space , burying it in the polar ice sheets -- storing it in the earth was thought to be the best solution , according to the government 's research .
By the early 1980s the government had decided to build a long term storage site for nuclear waste , and began collecting billions of dollars from electric utilities toward that end .
In 1987 it started looking solely at Yucca Mountain , a site on federal land some 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas that was thought to have solid rock formations , essential for containing the waste for long periods of time .
In 2002 the government formally designated the site as its repository .
Construction has begun , although now it 's mostly just series of tunnels into the earth .
But Nevada residents never liked the plan , and were vocal about their opposition .
When Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) became Senate majority leader in 2006 , the site 's future came into question .
Some critics also pointed to the geology at Yucca Mountain , saying the rocks were more porous than previously thought and noting the volcanic activity in the area .
Although the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is still reviewing the permit to store waste at the site and those in the industry hope it can still be built , the Obama administration now says Yucca Mountain is no longer an option .
More than 25 years in the making , and the project seems dead .
Accenture 's Burton believes an underground storage facility is still a possibility : " From an engineering perspective , I have every reason to believe one is , " he said .
Burton said it 's prudent to build more plants as long as we 're confident another repository can be built .
Energy Department said Secretary Steven
Chu will be appointing a blue ribbon panel shortly to figure out what to do with nuclear waste .
That could mean reverting to the previous list of repository candidates , which named at least 10 other sites in states including Maine , Washington , New Mexico and North Carolina .
It might also mean the space or polar ice cap idea is back on the table , but the spokesperson declined to comment .
Whatever the case , it should n't take another 25 years to reach a solution .
The short answer : the Democrats in the Senate .
Let me tell you why .
The filibuster
In the United States Senate , one Senator can hold up legislation using the filibuster rule .
In order to stop a filibuster , it takes 60 votes .
Senate tradition held that the filibuster would only be used in extraordinary circumstances .
Thanks to Republicans , that ’s no longer the case .
Any and all Democratic legislation is now subject to filibuster .
Rather than needing a simple majority to pass legislation in the Senate , you now need 60 votes .
In the current Senate there are roughly 55 Democrats who are willing to vote for robust health care reform , including some kind of public insurance plan .
Definitely enough to pass the Senate if it were operating under normal majority rule .
However , getting to 60 votes is a big problem .
You need the support of the most conservative members of the Democratic Party ( like Ben Nelson , Mary Landrieu and Blanche Lincoln ) , and Republicans like Joe Lieberman * and Olympia Snowe .
In order to garner their support the bill would have to be neutered to bolster their “ centrist ” credentials .
They could n’t very well vote for a pure Democratic plan .
So , neutered the bill was .
But it did n’t have to be this way .
End the filibuster
Democrats in the Senate could have embraced majority rule to and fulfilled their promises to pass strong health care reform that we so desperately need .
The Senate filibuster rule could have simply been removed by 50 Democratic Senators and the Vice President , using what is known in Washington as the Nuclear Option .
Senate rules can and have been changed in the past .
It used to require 67 votes for end a filibuster .
In 1975 that rule was changed to bring it down to 60 .
Now , since it is standing in the way of Americans and quality affordable health care ( and just about every other promise Obama and the Democrats made to the American public ) it should go .
So , while the five or so Senate holdouts , like Lieberman and Nelson , are responsible for gutting the health care bill , it ’s the rest of the Democrats in the Senate who gave them that power by not ending the filibuster .
Ultimately they are the ones at fault .
Of course , it ’s not too late to change the rules .
They can and should do it now , before they pass this neutered health care legislation , and before Lieberman and Nelson get their hands on the climate change bill , or the financial regulation bill .
If they do n’t change the rules , we should wonder if Democrats are incompetent or if neutered legislation is the real goal .
* Lieberman is n’t technically a Republican .

Once again , and we are not learning !
La Repubblica of last Thursday [ 1 ] and other Italian newspapers have reported on a “ computer ” error that temporarily brought thousands of accounts at the national postal service bank into the red .
It is a software error , due to a misplacement of the decimal points in some transactions .
As usual the technical details are hazy ; La Repubblica writes that :
“ Because of a software change that did not succeed , the computer system did not always read the decimal point during transactions ” .
As a result , it could for example happen that a 15.00 - euro withdrawal was understood as 1500 euros .
I have no idea what “ reading the decimal point ” means .
( There is no mention of OCR , and the affected transactions seem purely electronic . )
Only some of the 12 million checking or “ Postamat ” accounts were affected ; the article cites a number of customers who could not withdraw money from ATMs because the system wrongly treated their accounts as over - drawn .
It says that this was the only damage and that the postal service will send a letter of apology .
The account leaves many questions unanswered , for example whether the error could actually have favored some customers , by allowing them to withdraw money they did not have , and if so what will happen .
The most important unanswered question is the usual one : what was the software error ?
As usual , we will probably never know .
The news items will soon be forgotten , the postal service will somehow fix its code , life will go on .
Nothing will be learned ; the next time around similar causes will produce similar effects .
I criticized this lackadaisical attitude in an earlier column [ 2 ] and have to hammer its conclusion again : any organization using public money should be required , when it encounters a significant software malfunction , to let experts investigate the incident in depth and report the results publicly .
As long as we keep forgetting our errors we will keep repeating them .
Where would airline safety be in the absence of thorough post - accident reports ?
That a software error did not kill anyone is not a reason to ignore it .
Whether it is the Italian post messing up , a US agency ’s space vehicle crashing on the moon or any other software fault causing systems to fail , it is not enough to fix the symptoms : we must have a professional report and draw the lessons for the future .

President Barack Obama has a problem .
In February , the Obama administration , siding with former President George W. Bush , tried to kill a lawsuit that sought to recover what could be millions of missing White House e-mails in a stunning reversal of Obama ’s rhetoric about Bush secrecy on the campaign trail .
Two advocacy groups had sued the Executive Office of the President , including one of the groups that helped derail former House Speaker Tom DeLay .
They said that large amounts of White House e-mail documenting Bush ’s eight years in office were missing , and that the government needed to undertake an extensive recovery effort .
The emails were seen as crucial as the “ deleted ” days include ones in the run up to the Iraq war and the outing of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson .
ADVERTISEMENT
In March , the groups suspended their lawsuit , noting that the Obama team was willing to negotiate a settlement .
Since then , little progress has been made .
“ It ’s very frustrating , ” says Anne Weismann , Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington chief counsel , told Mother Jones for an article Wednesday .
“ Here we are , nine - plus months after [ Obama ’s inauguration ] , and we ’re really not any closer to feeling the missing emails have been restored .
It ’s kind of nutty to me that it ’s taken them so many months . ”
“ Among the plaintiffs ’ biggest gripes , ” writes Mother Jones ’ Nick Baumann , “ is that the Obama team is using the Bush administration ’s strategy — a flawed one , the groups say — to resurrect the missing emails .
The White House has hired private contractors to conduct a statistical analysis of its archived email to determine on which days messages are unaccounted for .
But that ’s not standard private - sector practice in these sorts of cases , says Weismann .
It ’s far more common for businesses that have lost emails to restore their backup tapes and compare those results with their archives , she says .
The two administrations have spent at least $ 9.4 million on their effort to recover the emails , more than double that which was originally appropriated for the task .
Citizens for Ethics says they really do n’t know where the money ’s gone .
The Bush administration had told CREW they ’d located 38 boxes of documents that might be relevant to their Freedom of Information Act request , but the Obama administration has released very few pages .
During its first term , the Bush White House failed to install electronic record - keeping for e-mail when it switched to a new system , allegedly resulting in millions of messages that could not be found .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Bush White House “ discovered the problem ” in 2005 and rejected a proposed solution .
The exact number of missing e-mails is unknown , but several days on which e-mails were not archived covered key dates in a Justice Department inquiry into the roles of Vice President Dick Cheney and his aides in leaking the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
Ironically , Cheney ’s office is missing emails from the very day President Bush told reporters he ’d “ take care of ” whatever staff member had actually leaked the CIA agent ’s name .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If there is a leak out of my administration , I want to know who it is , ” Bush said Sept. 30 , 2003 .
“ And if the person has violated the law , the person will be taken care of . ”
No e-mails were archived on the very day the probe was announced and White House officials were ordered to maintain anything that could become evidence in the investigation that ended the conviction of I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Cheney ’s former chief of staff , on perjury and obstruction of justice charges .
ADVERTISEMENT
Emails are missing from at least some of 473 days of Bush ’s presidency .
The White House did not respond to Baumann ’s request for comment .

The Irish government has unveiled one of the most severe budgets in the Republic 's history .
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan announced pay cuts for public sector workers , as part of efforts to achieve savings of 4bn euros ( $ 5.9bn ; £ 3.6 bn ) .
Taoiseach Brian Cowen will have his pay reduced by 20 % .
" Those at the top will lead by example , " Mr Lenihan said .
The Irish economy will shrink by 1.25 % in 2010 , he forecast .
He had previously estimated a contraction of 1.5 % .
The economy is expected to shrink by 7.5 % this year , confirming a previous reading .
" Our economy is still in a weakened condition , and our self confidence as a nation has been shaken , " Mr Lenihan said .
" The government 's strategy over the last 18 months is working and we can now see the first signs of a recovery here at home and in our main international markets . "
Richard Bruton , finance spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael party , called the budget " jobless and joyless " .
He added that the proposed cut in the Taoiseach 's pay was " simply a sham " and did not take into account previous adjustments .
The real cut was much lower than 20 % , he said .
Planned savings
Mr Lenihan announced savings in 2010 of : • 1bn euros on the public sector pay bill .
Public servants will face pay cuts , ranging from 5 % on those earning 30,000 euros to 15 % on those earning more than 200,000 euros • 760 m euros on social welfare • 980 m euros on day - to - day spending programmes • 960 m euros on investment projects .
But he said the pay cuts in the public sector would not apply to existing public service pensioners .
He also reduced the rates of child benefit by 16 euros per month , bringing the lower rate to 150 euros per month and the higher rate to 187 euros per month .
And he introduced a carbon tax , equivalent to 15 euros per tonne .
Other taxation measures include switching to a simpler income tax system with just two charges on wages , and bringing VAT down to 21 % from 21.5 % .
Excise on beer , wine and spirits was reduced , but there was no change in tobacco tax .
Corporation tax - which has been a draw for foreign investors in the Irish Republic over the last few years - was held at 12.5 % .
Lowering the deficit The Irish deficit currently stands at 12 % of GDP .
European Union ( EU ) rules state that countries are expected to keep their budget shortfalls below 3 % of GDP .
While this government was partly responsible for the current economic mess we find ourselves in , this tough budget reflects the ' real - economic ' and is the only way to a real recovery
Steven Nestor , Dublin , in reaction to the announcement

But Mr Lenihan said if it were not for action taken by the government , the situation could have been much worse .
" The government over the past 18 months has made budgetary adjustments of more than 8bn euros for this year , " he said .
" Had we not done so , the deficit would have ballooned towards 20 % of GDP - a level at which the very financial survival of this country would have been at risk . "
He went on to say that he expects the deficit to come down over the next few years - to 11.6 % next year , 10 % in 2011 and to reach 2.9 % in 2014 , thereby reaching the EU target .

Squad stands to attention with lowly “ green shirts ” sent to the back of the line
Steve Watson ,
Prisonplanet.com
Wednesday , Dec 8 , 2009
In the wake of reports that Explorer Scouts are being “ trained in post - 9/11 law enforcement methods “ , a group of youngsters have been captured on video working in tandem with police in St. Petersburg , Florida , at a christmas fair .
We Are Change activists spotted the group roaming the streets during the parade , clearly wearing clothing adorned with police insignia .
When the group were asked what they were doing at the parade , the lead scout became extremely secretive about their association with the local police department and attempted to hide their badges and jackets .
The group described themselves as “ very similar ” to academy police , and told the activists that they were “ looking for lost kids ” .
“ We are affiliated with them but we do not have the powers of police … we are a part of the department I guess . ” the leader of the group told We Are Change , adding that they routinely ride along with officers on active duty .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The young girl seemed to back track after continued questioning , later stating “ it is a volunteer organisation , it has nothing to do with the police . ”
However , the squad of 14 - 19 year olds stood to attention , military style , when a police officer arrived on the scene , with lowly “ green shirts ” ordered to take the back of the line .
“ If we went into Martial law or a state of emergency , they ’re here to protect everyone else . ” one of the other members of the group said when asked why he wanted to be affiliated with the police .
When asked if they had heard of the Hitler Youth , the at - first voluntary but later mandatory youth corps brigade that succeeded the Boy Scout movement In Nazi Germany , the scouts replied that they had .
Police officers in St. Petersburg refused to answer questions regarding the squad of scouts .
Watch the video :
This activity dovetails with several recent reports detailing how the Department of Homeland Security is actively enlisting both the Explorer Scouts and the Girl Scouts .
Programs being run by the DHS are training Scouts how to conduct armed raids on discontented American citizens , described as “ terrorists ” and “ drug dealers ” by Homeland Security .
One of the “ terrorists ” that the Boy Scouts were trained to kill in one scenario , according to the New York Times report on the story , was actually a disgruntled U.S. war veteran .
In the mock training scenario , the Boy Scouts were ordered to , “ Put him on his face and put a knee in his back , ” by a Border Patrol agent , who added “ I guarantee that he ’ll shut up . ”
We have also received reports detailing how the police and even the military are engaging with Scouts at jamboree events where they demonstrate “ chase and takedown ” scenarios along with mock SWAT raids .
At one event in Wisconsin , the National Guard unveiled a combat simulator and invited Scouts to ride through the streets of Baghdad and try to differentiate citizens from terrorists , saving the former and executing the latter .
Seeing the Scouts in tandem with police will also increase concerns that President Barack Obama ’s promised “ national civilian security force ” is gradually being formed from such groups .

James Kuhn , an incredible artist , is the man behind these unique face paintings .
An interesting part about this project is that he paints on his own face , a new mask every day for a year .
That is 365 totally different designs , everything from cartoons to his favorite foods .
Here you can see some of his mask , that represents a dog , a slice of watermelon , a bird , etc. Kuhn even painted Conan O’Brien on his face .
He started with the project one day he missed work because he was snowed in , and his inspiration came from photo exhibitions of a picture that he saw one day .
If you like paint art you should take a look at these pictures that capture how paint behave in water .

From what I can tell , Accenture is a solid company .
But the Daily News columnist Mike Lupica raised a good point when I spoke with him last week : “ If Tiger Woods was so important to Accenture , how come I did n’t know what Accenture did when they fired him ? ”
According to its
Web site , Accenture is “ a global management consulting , technology services and outsourcing company , ” but who cared about any fine print ?
It was Tiger , and Tiger was it , and no one was to worry about the details behind the mutually advantageous image - mongering .
One would like to assume that Accenture ’s failure to see or heed any warning signs about a man appearing in 83 percent of its advertising is an anomalous lapse .
One would like to believe that business and government clients did n’t hire Accenture just because it had Tiger ’s imprimatur .
But in a culture where so many smart people have been taken so often , we ca n’t assume anything .

Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
As cons go , Woods ’s fraudulent image as an immaculate exemplar of superhuman steeliness is benign .
His fall will damage his family , closest friends , Accenture and the golf industry much more than the rest of us .
But the syndrome it epitomizes is not harmless .
We keep being fooled by leaders in all sectors of American life , over and over .
A decade that began with the “ reality ” television craze exemplified by “ American Idol ” and “ Survivor ”  both blissfully devoid of any reality whatsoever  spiraled into a wholesale flight from truth .
The most lethal example , of course , were the two illusions marketed to us on the way to Iraq  that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and some link to Al Qaeda .
That history has since been rewritten by Bush alumni , Democratic politicians who supported the Iraq invasion and some of the news media that purveyed the White House fictions ( especially the television press , which rarely owned up to its failure as print journalists have ) .
It was exclusively “ bad intelligence , ” we ’re now told , that pushed us into the fiasco .
But contradictions to that “ bad intelligence ” were in plain sight during the run-up to the war  even sometimes in the press .
Yet we wanted to suspend disbelief .
Much of the country , regardless of party , did n’t want to question its leaders , no matter how obviously they were hyping any misleading shred of intelligence that could fit their predetermined march to war .
It ’s the same impulse that kept many from questioning how Mark McGwire ’s and Barry Bonds ’s outlandishly cartoonish physiques could possibly be steroid - free .
In the political realm , our bipartisan credulousness has also been on steroids in this decade , even by our national standards .
Many Democrats did n’t want to see the snake - oil salesman in John Edwards , blatant as his “ Two America ” self - contradictions were if you cared merely to look at him on YouTube .
Republicans incessantly fell for family values preacher politicians like David Vitter , John Ensign and Larry Craig .
Fred Thompson was seen by many , in the press as well as his party , as the second coming of Ronald Reagan .
Karl Rove was widely hailed as a mastermind who would assemble a permanent Republican majority .
Bernie Kerik was considered a plausible secretary of homeland security .
Eliot Spitzer was viewed as a crusader of uncompromising principle .
But these scam artists are pikers next to the financial hucksters .
I ’m not just talking about Bernie Madoff and Enron ’s Ken Lay , but about those titans who legally created and sold the securities that gamed and then wrecked the system .
You ’d think after Enron ’s collapse that financial leaders and government overseers would question the contents of “ exotic ” investments that could not be explained in plain English .
But only a few years after Enron ’s very public and extensively dissected crimes , the same bankers , federal regulatory agencies and securities - rating companies were giving toxic “ assets ” a pass .
We were only too eager to go along for the lucrative ride until it crashed like Tiger ’s Escalade .
After his “ indefinite break ” from golf , Woods will surely be back on the links once the next celebrity scandal drowns his out .
But after a decade in which two true national catastrophes , a wasteful war and a near - ruinous financial collapse , were both in part byproducts of the ease with which our leaders bamboozled us , we ca n’t so easily move on .
This can be seen in the increasingly urgent political plight of Barack Obama .
Though the American left and right do n’t agree on much , they are both now coalescing around the suspicion that Obama ’s brilliant presidential campaign was as hollow as Tiger ’s public image  a marketing scam designed to camouflage either his covert anti-American radicalism ( as the right sees it ) or spineless timidity ( as the left sees it ) .
The truth may well be neither , but after a decade of being spun silly , Americans ca n’t be blamed for being cynical about any leader trying to sell anything .
As we say goodbye to the year of Tiger Woods , it is the country , sad to say , that is left mired in a sand trap with no obvious way out .

Larry King Live Carrie Prejean Stops Interview VIDEO
was a guest on Larry King Live last night and was quickly at odds with the CNN anchor .
Prejean , who agreed to appear on the show to talk about her new book Still Standing , did n't like the line of questioning by King , who asked about the reason for her recent settlement with the Miss California USA pageant .
According to reports , pageant organizers came into possession of a explicit tape that they threatened to leak .
The tape was made by Prejean for her boyfriend when she was a teenager .
Speculation is that she backed away from her lawsuit to keep the tape from going public .
Things continue to heat up today because of a new revelation .
The ex-boyfriend , the recipient of 15 - 20 tapes , has come forward to talk about the situation - LISTEN HERE .
King asked , " Why settle since you had a fight to carry on ? "
She said , " Larry , it 's completely confidential and you 're being inappropriate .
Yeah , I think you are being extremely inappropriate right now , and I 'm about to leave your show . "
Prejean proceeded to remove her mic shortly after Larry took a viewer call from a man who announced , " Hi , I 'm a gay may and I love pageants . "
Her agreement prior to the show stated she would not be open to taking any on air phone calls .
After a commercial break , Prejean did return but the conversation from that point on was bland and unremarkable .
Check out the video skirmish below and follow up reporting by Anderson Cooper on 360 .

Tags : Asylum seekers , Australian politics
Some of those who want to see a more humane approach to asylum seekers argue that they should be brought to Christmas Island for processing , rather than shunted off to detention centres in Indonesia .
But such calls are deeply misguided .
Asylum seekers taken to Christmas Island would be incarcerated in a camp modelled on Guantanamo Bay , and denied basic rights like access to the legal system .
Despite this barbarity , the pervasive assumption , even among many who stand for refugee rights is that mandatory detention is necessary , even if it ’s just minimal to allow for “ processing ” .
In fact , Australia is the only country in the world to practise mandatory detention .
The policy is the key plank in a long - standing system of state - orchestrated human rights abuse perpetrated upon refugees by successive Australian governments , both Labor and Liberal .
To mandate that all unauthorised asylum seekers be detained is itself a breach of the UN Convention on Refugees and a gross human rights abuse .
But more importantly , it needs to be pointed out that things have not always been this way , that thousands of refugees in fairly recent history have arrived here by boat without detention .
And the sky did not fall in .
It was only as recently as 1992 , under the Keating Labor government , that mandatory detention was established .
Before this , detention of asylum seekers was an option to be used with the discretion of Immigration officials .
There was no policy of mandatory detention in response to unauthorised boat arrivals in the late 1970s .
From 1976 to 1982 , around 2,000 people arrived here on boats from Vietnam .
They were part of a mass exodus of almost one million refugees , fleeing the devastation of ongoing war and the persecution of Vietnam ’s ethnic Chinese population .
Australia set up a program to resettle Vietnamese refugees languishing in camps throughout South - East Asia , and almost 95,000 were settled here in the next ten years .
But it was a decidedly selective process , whereby Australian Immigration officials would choose those refugees deemed most suitable : in other words , those most ready to contribute to the Australian economy through having valued skills or English language abilities .
The burning question though was what to do with the 2,000 people who got here under their own steam on leaky boats .
Leading ALP figures Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlam made their thoughts clear , arguing consistently that Australia should accept none of the so - called “ boat people . ”
Foreshadowing future ALP government policy , Whitlam even called for them to be “ disembarked into custody ” – i.e. mandatory detention – pending their removal from Australia .
But as was the practice in those days , the “ boat people ” were n’t sent to the desert to be locked in detention centres .
They were transferred directly to Migrant Hostels in the suburbs .
Here , they were free to come and go , to look for work , and even to study at local colleges .
They had health checks while they waited for the Housing Commission to find them a place to live , and for the Immigration Department to organise their permanent residency .
Lan , who arrived as a 6 - year - old “ boat person ” with her family , recounted her story :
We arrived in Melbourne in 1978 with almost nothing .
We lived in a migrant hostel in Nunawading , which was quite nice .
I particularly remember the food .
We used to have our lunch packed for us and I still remember picking up my lunch in a paper bag before school .
Many migrants were n’t accustomed to Australian food but we all appreciated that at least there was food .
Compare this to the words of a Woomera detainee , writing in 2002 :
Imagine .
They put a person in a small room in this condition .
That cage is all things for him .
He wastes his time , all days and nights , with depression , and fear , with sleeplessness and night dreams , without any good news about future , exactly like living between death and life .
People are asking god a hundred times , please kill me god .
Mandatory detention is a vile form of torture , reserved for people who are already vulnerable .
The whole regime needs to be junked and replaced with a system that grants human beings the basic rights of freedom , independence , housing and employment .

Some user - contributed software may be found in ccl : contrib ; .
Clozure does n't maintain these contributions .
The #$ reader macro will now try to look up foreign variables if it can't find a constant definition .
This makes it OK to say , e.g. , #$NSFontAttributeName ( whereas before it was necessary to remember that it was # &NSFontAttributeName ) .
PATHNAME-ENCODING -NAME ( ticket :358 )
It appears that Apple is n't going to provide a way to set the gsbase MSR on x86 - 64 , so we have given up and now dedicate a general - purpose register for thread - local storage on Darwin / x8664 .
This reduces foreign - function call overhead substantially .

It would be so cool if you had blood dripping from your mouth with a figure in the background who you could photoshop into the frame .
It is one thing when a few analysts say that commercial real estate , that $ 3 trillion elephant in the room , is going to experience trouble starting next year .
It is another thing when billionaire investor Wilbur Ross comes out and states that commercial real estate is going to crash and burn .
We ’ve been looking at commercial real estate for sometime and the U.S. Treasury has already had talks regarding a preemptive CRE bailout called “ Plan C . ”
The commercial real estate sector is even more fragile than residential real estate because commercial space is a direct reflection of the health of the economy .
In other words , how much office space do you need without workers ?
How many strip malls can you fill without shoppers ?
Not many .
Commercial real estate is also financed in a unique way where loans are refinanced typically on five year terms .
Many are coming due starting next year .
Friday ’s multiple bank failures , 9 in one day and a cost of $ 2.5 billion to the FDIC fund , was the most closures in one day since the recession started .
Even with this giant number , most of the assets at FDIC insured banks sit with a few banks :
The FDIC insures over 8,000 banks covering $ 13.3 trillion in assets .
In reality , 100 banks hold over $ 10 trillion of those assets .
The banks that are failing typically do not fall in the top 100 .
And many of these recent bank failures are starting to show signs of commercial real estate fatigue .
Ross summed up the overall scenario well :
“( FT ) All of the components of real estate value are going in the wrong direction simultaneously , ” said Ross , one of nine money managers participating in a government program to remove toxic assets from bank balance sheets .
“ Occupancy rates are going down .
Rent rates are going down and the capitalization rate – the return that investors are demanding to buy a property – are going up . ”
There is some form of twisted irony in the above .
The government has tunnel vision focus on residential real estate .
The Federal Reserve has bought nearly $ 1.25 trillion in GSE MBS thus keeping mortgage rates at historical lows .
Not enough ?
What about a nice $ 8,000 tax credit ?
Still need more ?
What about going with FHA insured loans that only require 3.5 percent down ?
In other words , the government has stepped into the vacuum left by the toxic mortgage lenders .
So we should n’t be surprised when FHA insured loans , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac loan portfolios start showing historic amounts of defaults .
Yet the consequence of pushing many renters to homeownership , is you speed up the crash in commercial real estate .
We should be honest and admit that not everyone can be a homeowner .
And this is okay .
They can rent .
Nothing wrong with that .
But now we are seeing enormous apartment vacancy rates because we are temporarily shifting some into homes they cannot afford .
They will only default later as we have seen with the current decade long housing bubble .
Commercial real estate is a gigantic line item of the FDIC insured banks :
In fact , if you add up nonfarm residential , construction and equipment , and commercial / industrial loans the number is approximately $ 3 trillion .
Contrast this to the $ 2 trillion in more conventional residential loans .
In other words , this has the potential of being bigger than the residential downturn .
Commercial real estate values took longer to fall than residential property values , but not only have they caught up , they have surpassed the percentage amount of declines :
With many of these loans coming due in the next few years , the question will focus on the ability of companies to get the loans refinanced .
But who will take on a loan of an empty commercial building ?
For residential property , the government for better or worse has a big mechanism through Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and FHA insured loans to buy up these loans .
The government currently backs 95 percent of all residential mortgages .
It is the market .
Yet with commercial real estate , there really is n’t a government mechanism fortunately ( that is , unless the U.S. Treasury plows through with Plan C and starts bailing out this industry ) .
The FDIC and other agencies are trying to jump out in front of this freight train .
Maybe it is n’t call Plan C but something is in the works :
“ ( AP ) WASHINGTON – Banks must accurately identify their potential losses when modifying troubled commercial real estate loans under federal guidelines issued Friday .
Regulators have warned that rising losses on commercial real estate loans pose risks for U.S. banks , with small and mid-size banks especially vulnerable .
Nearly $ 500 billion in commercial real estate loans are expected to come due annually over the next few years .
Agencies including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , Federal Reserve and Office of Thrift Supervision released the new guidelines for banks , which emphasize that modifying loans in a prudent fashion is often in the best interest of both the bank and the creditworthy commercial borrower .
Under the guidelines , loans to creditworthy borrowers that have been restructured and are current wo n’t be classified as high risk by regulators solely because the collateral backing them has declined to an amount less than the loan balance . ”
This will be a fascinating challenge here .
Jean Paul Getty had it right when he said , “ If you owe the bank $ 100 that ’s your problem .
If you owe the bank $ 100 million , that ’s the bank ’s problem . ”
And the banks have a gigantic problem .
You can expect workouts but what can you workout with a property that is completely vacant ?
Is there any price point that will work ?
We are going to find out soon enough .
The commercial real estate debacle is coming in line with the appearance of a stabilization in the residential market .
The CRE debacle has the potential to destabilize the market again .
Expect to see more banks go under because of horrible CRE loans .

An international team of environmental scientists led by the University of Pennsylvania has shown that sea - level rise , at least in North Carolina , is accelerating .
Researchers found 20th - century sea - level rise to be three times higher than the rate of sea - level rise during the last 500 years .
In addition , this jump appears to occur between 1879 and 1915 , a time of industrial change that may provide a direct link to human - induced climate change .
The results appear in the current issue of the journal Geology .
The rate of relative sea - level rise , or RSLR , during the 20th century was 3 to 3.3 millimeters per year , higher than the usual rate of one per year .
Furthermore , the acceleration appears consistent with other studies from the Atlantic coast , though the magnitude of the acceleration in North Carolina is larger than at sites farther north along the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic coast and may be indicative of a latitudinal trend related to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet .
Understanding the timing and magnitude of this possible acceleration in the rate of RSLR is critical for testing models of global climate change and for providing a context for 21st - century predictions .
" Tide gauge records are largely inadequate for accurately recognizing the onset of any acceleration of relative sea - level rise occurring before the 18th century , mainly because too few records exist as a comparison , " Andrew Kemp , the paper 's lead author , said .
" Accurate estimates of sea - level rise in the pre-satellite era are needed to provide an appropriate context for 21st - century projections and to validate geophysical and climate models . "
The research team studied two North Carolina salt marshes that form continuous accumulations of organic sediment , a natural archive that provides scientists with an accurate way to reconstruct relative sea levels using radiometric isotopes and stratigraphic age markers .
The research provided a record of relative sea -level change since the year 1500 at the Sand Point and Tump Point salt marshes in the Albemarle - Pamlico estuarine system of North Carolina .
The two marshes provided an ideal setting for producing high - resolution records because thick sequences of high marsh sediment are present and the estuarine system is microtidal , which reduces the vertical uncertainty of aleosea - level estimates .
The study provides for the first time replicated sea - level reconstructions from two nearby sites .
In addition , comparison with 20th - century tide - gauge records validates the use of this approach and suggests that salt - marsh records with decadal and decimeter resolution can supplement tide - gauge records by extending record length and compensating for the strong spatial bias in the global distribution of longer instrumental records .
The study was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coastal Ocean Program , North Carolina Coastal Geology Cooperative Program , U.S. Geological Survey and National Science Foundation .
The study was conducted by Kemp and Benjamin P. Horton of the Sea - Level Research Laboratory at Penn , Stephen J. Culver and D. Reide Corbett of the Department of Geological Sciences at East Carolina University , Orson van de Plassche of Vrije Universiteit , W. Roland Gehrels of the University of Plymouth , Bruce C. Douglas of Florida International University and Andrew C. Parnell of University College Dublin .
The Changing Culture of a New Guinea Village
The intriguing country of Papua New Guinea is a remarkable natural wonder that offers great excitement for travelers to explore .
The country is made up of a cluster of 600 islands that stretch in one long string along southeastern Asia .
These islands are filled with wonderful natural surroundings that include jungles , water and amazing wildlife .
Because of this vast offering and sprawling layout , Papua New Guinea is known for its tribal diversity , with some 700 languages being spoken there .
While some may believe this overwhelming amount of diversity can be too much , it instead offers one of the most unique opportunities for visitors to examine the amazing culture of the country .
In this release , photos collected for one purpose – to show the uniqueness of the tribe of Papua New Guinea and its traditions , as well as the impact they are experiencing .

Rep. Ron Paul and Ben Bernanke are locked in a clash of titans .
Paul , the 74 - year - old House libertarian from Texas with the high - pitched voice , has fought for decades to kill off the Federal Reserve .
ADVERTISEMENT
Bernanke , the mild - mannered ex-Princeton professor and chairman of the bank , is waging a high - stakes battle for the Fed ’s reputation .
And he ’s doing everything possible to knock out Paul .
The fight is still in the early rounds .
But with the full House expected to vote this week to give government auditors more power to scrutinize the Fed , Paul has the upper hand .
The Senate is a much more difficult round for Paul , though a similar stew of liberal and conservative support is starting to simmer in the upper chamber behind the Republican ’s wonky auditing measure .
Bernanke and Paul have never met one - on - one behind closed doors , Paul ’s office said .
The battle has taken place in public — on blogs , with grassroots activists and during congressional hearings .
Bernanke has testified against the provision , given lengthy media interviews , written op - eds and attempted to lift the cloud of secrecy that hangs over the bank .
The Fed is audited , he argues , but allowing government scrutiny of interest rate decisions will politicize the Fed .
Opening the door to congressionally requested audits would compromise the market ’s confidence in the bank .
Paul , a longstanding supporter of a new gold standard , made his case formally in his recently published book , End the Fed .
The 2008 presidential candidate ’s crusade is no longer a quixotic quest .
He is a prime beneficiary of the grassroots anger this year against government bailouts for Wall Street .
First introduced in February , Paul ’s bill to audit the Fed has gained 317 co-sponsors , a shocking three - quarters of the House .
The bill has not won over many Democrats in leadership , but it has picked up several committee chairmen , including Reps .
Bart Gordon ( Tenn. ) , Jim Oberstar ( Minn. ) and John Spratt ( S.C. ) .
Rep. Alan Grayson Alan Mark GraysonFlorida's Darren Soto fends off
Dem challenge from Alan Grayson Live results : Arizona and Florida hold primaries The Hill 's Morning Report : Frustration mounts as Republicans blow up tax message MORE ( D - Fla. ) , a prominent Paul ally on the bill , has provided a huge boost to the effort with his firebrand strain of liberal politics .
Grayson has publicly slammed the Fed , going so far as calling its top lobbyist a “ K Street whore ” before apologizing .
Paul himself said the full force of “ lobbyists for the Fed ” is stacked against him .
As the popularity of the Paul - Grayson measure rose this year , Bernanke ’s fell .
Praised by many economists for taking the necessary steps to right the economy over the last year , his overall public approval has soured .
A Rasmussen poll in November showed that just 21 percent of those surveyed thought Bernanke should be reappointed .
Meanwhile , 79 percent of those polled said auditing the Fed is a good idea .
Republicans have jumped behind Paul , who stood out in last year ’s GOP presidential primary for his outspokenness against the Iraq war .
“ There needs to be Fed independence and accountability for those dollars to at least look back at those decisions , ” said Rep. Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyGOP seeks to redirect criticism over Trump tax returns The Hill 's Morning Report - Sponsored by JobsOhio - Showdown : Trump - Biden debate likely to be nasty Top House Republican calls for probe of source of NYT Trump tax documents MORE ( R - Texas ) .
But the political value is plain as Republicans argue the government is taking too large a role in the economy .
“ The Fed becomes for Republicans a very convenient , always controversial , always misunderstood , very specific whipping boy that they can ride to potential victory in 2010 and 2012 , ” said a Washington - based financial lobbyist .
Bernanke has the normally powerful Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) in his corner .
But as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , Frank could n’t eke out a compromise .
ADVERTISEMENT
Frank rarely loses battles , but an attempt — with Rep. Mel Watt ( D - N.C. ) — at a deal on the audit issue simply fell short at the committee level .
Liberal activist Robert Borosage , who is campaigning against Bernanke ’s nomination for a second term , said the compromise effort was nothing more than “ the establishment alternative . ”
The committee voted 43 - 26 in favor of Paul ’s amendment as 15 Democrats on the panel bucked Frank .
The vote drew a bright line between the senior Democrats atop the committee and the freshman and sophomore members .
“ I think some of the newer members are in the most vulnerable districts , ” said Rep. Brad Miller ( D - N.C. ) , a Paul - Grayson co-sponsor who instead joined Frank in voting against the Paul amendment .
“ They were certainly getting the calls that I was getting , and they were reading the politics differently . ”
Frank and Paul are both veterans of the House , and while they are on nearly opposite ends of the political spectrum , they have a mutual respect .
The two have worked closely on an Internet gaming measure .
Many Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill say that Frank , despite his partisan rhetoric , is a pragmatist .
“ I never felt [ Frank ] was against me , ” Paul said .
Frank said last week the language would n’t be changed when the House heads for the vote .
Ten of the 13 House members on the Rules Committee are among Paul ’s backers , including Chairwoman Louise Slaughter ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ Absent some change in the way the public is reacting , I do n’t see any changes , ” Frank said .
“ I think there is this tension within the Republican Party .
A lot of their people who traditionally have a lot of influence are troubled by this , but they may be cowed by the anger at the Fed . ”
In the Senate , Paul has found support from Sens. Jim DeMint , the conservative Republican from South Carolina , and Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersTrump , Biden clash over health care as debate begins Biden calls Trump a ' liar ' and a ' clown ' at first debate Biden mocks Trump campaign debate claims : ' I 've got my earpiece and performance enhancers ready ' MORE , the Independent from Vermont who calls himself a proud socialist .

Cross cultural evidence that excessive income inequality increases rates of death & sickness , infant mortality , imprisonment , mental illness , child abuse , teenage births , failure at school , family breakup and drug abuse
It has recently become possible to compare the scale of income differences in different societies and see how the social fabric of any given society is affected by how much inequality there is .
Research using this data carried out since the early 1990s shows that many of the most pressing health and social problems are worse - sometimes much worse -- in those societies that suffer the greatest inequality .
Simply stated , those societies with the biggest income differences between rich and poor suffer a much larger range of health and social problems .
The web pages that are found at the link below outline the latest evidence and tell you where to find more detailed summaries and research reports .
A straight forward outline of all the material can be found in a book written by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett , called The Spirit Level , published by Penguin , available at Amazon and any good book store .
Health , homicides and beyond
A review of 168 studies summarizes the evidence internationally among rich and poor countries as well as for regions , states , and cities within many different countries .
The tendency for more unequal societies to have worse health has been found for many different health indicators , including age - specific death rates , infant mortality , life expectancy , and illness .

For latest update on Typhoon Parma , click here
The Philippines suffered from catastrophic flooding from last week ’s assault by Tropical Storm Ketsana bringing death to at least 277 .
Most of the flooding problems were in and around Manila and Luzon but other parts of the country received very heavy rainfall .
The armed forces of the Philippines are being mobilized as the island nation is now bracing for the impact of a much much stronger storm .
Typhoon Parma is now forecast to strike the northern provinces of the Philippines by Friday .
It is rapidly increasing in strength and is forecast to possibly become Super Typhoon Parma as it moves across the northeastern portion of the Philippines .
At that time , winds are expected to be at 125 kts with gusts to 140 kts .
That converts to maximum sustained winds of 145 mph with gusts to 160 mph .
That would be equivalent to a category 4 hurricane .
As of 12Z Oct 1 , the storm had a very low central pressure of 933 mb .
On the one hand , these provinces are some distance from Manila and the storm was forecast to move relatively quickly .
That would mean that the country has very little time to prepare .
While the initial landfall is away from Manila and Luzon , the mountainous parts of the country will enhance the rain potential and mudslides will be problematic .
What is troubling is that the latest forecast track has changed .
Previously , the forecast suggested an even stronger typhoon brushing along the northeastern provinces before heading to Taiwan .
The storm has encoutered some dry air intrusion and that is the reason for the lower forecast intensity .
But , the steering has been altered and now the storm is expected to slow down and kinda wrap around the northern tip of the Philippines .
Should this happen , rainfall throughout the northern half of the island nation will be quite extreme .
Potentially , this could make a terrible disaster even worse .
Further , if Typhoon Parma develops fully , it will be heading toward the maximum destructive potential sporting an emormous storm surge .
I ’m not certain of the topography of the shelf and coast but I would say a surge of 10 - 20 feet would not be out of the question .

1. FOR METEOROLOGISTS .
2. 12 HOUR SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS .
A. TYPHOON ( TY ) 19 W ( PARMA ) HAS WEAKENED OVER THE PAST 12 HOURS
TO A TYPHOON .
RELATIVELY DRIER AIR OVER THE CENTRAL PHILIPPINES ( AS
SEEN IN THE 011200Z SOUNDING FROM RPMT ) IN THE MID LEVELS HAS CAUSED
EROSION OF THE CENTRAL CONVECTION , LOWERING DVORAK INTENSITY
ESTIMATES FROM PGTW AND KNES TO 5.5 WITH RJTD REMAINING AT 7.0 .
THE SYSTEM HAS ALSO ENCOUNTERED MODERATE TO HIGH VERTICAL WIND
SHEAR ( 20 T0 30 KNOTS ) ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
NORTH OF THE SYSTEM .
THESE TWO FACTORS CAUSED A LOSS OF DEEP
CONVECTION AROUND THE CENTER .
RECENT ANIMATED INFRARED AND WATER
VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS BEGINNING
TO RECOVER .
THE SYSTEM HAS CONTINUED TRACKING ON THE SOUTHWESTERN
PERIPHERY OF THE SUB - TROPICAL RIDGE TOWARDS NORTHEASTERN LUZON .
3. FORECAST REASONING
A. THE FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE
THE LAST PROGNOSTIC REASONING BULLETIN .
B. TY 19W IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TRACKING TOWARDS THE
NORTHEASTERN COAST OF LUZON , MAKING LANDFALL NEAR TAU 48 BEFORE
CROSSING INTO THE LUZON STRAIT NEAR TAU 72 .
THE SYSTEM WILL
RECOVER INTENSITY , ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT EXPECTED TO RE-INTENSIFY TO
SUPER TYPHOON STRENGTH .
AVAILABLE NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN
FAIR AGREEMENT WITH THIS TRACK , WITH THE NOTABLE OUTLIERS OF THE
GFDN , JGSM , AND GFS MODELS .
GFDN TAKES A MORE WESTERLY COURSE INTO
CENTRAL LUZON BEFORE CROSSING INTO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA NEAR TAU 48 .
GFS AND JGSM NEITHER MAKE LANDFALL , WITH JGSM TURNING NORTH -
NORTHWESTERLY AFTER TAU 12 AND ASSUMING A MORE WESTERLY COURSE AFTER
TAU 48 .
GFS TURNS NORTH - NORTHWESTERLY
AFTER TAU 24 , AND RECURVES
AFTER TAU 72 .
THE REMAINING NUMERICAL MODELS ( NOGAPS , TCLAPS , WBAR ,
EGRR AND ECMWF ) MAKE LANDFALL NEAR TAU 48 BEFORE BIFURCATING .
WBAR
AND TCLAPS TURN NORTHWARD INTO THE LUZON STRAIT , WHILE NOGAPS , EGRR
AND ECMWF TURN WESTWARD INTO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA .
C. AFTER TAU 72 , TY PARMA WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS IT
CONTINUES TO INTERACT WITH NORTHERN LUZON’S TOPOGRAPHY .
ONCE IT
CROSSES INTO LUZON STRAIT , IT WILL REMAIN AT STRONG TYPHOON
INTENSITY .
DURING THIS PERIOD , TYPHOON PARMA WILL SLOW DOWN ITS
FORWARD MOTION AS A BREAK IN THE STEERING RIDGE DEVELOPS AND
POSSIBLE INTERACTION WITH TYPHOON 20W ( MELOR ) COMMENCES .
AVAILABLE
NUMERIC TRACK GUIDANCE ARE IN FAIR AGREEMENT UP TO TAU 48 AS
DISCUSSED ABOVE .
AFTER TAU 72 THE TRACK SPEEDS REMAIN SLOW , WITH
THIS FORECAST FAVORING THE NOGAPS , EGRR AND ECMWF SOLUTION OF A
TURN INTO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA .
THE EXTENDED FORECAST FOR TY 19 W
REMAINS COMPLICATED BY POSSIBLE INTERACTION WITH TY 20W TO THE EAST

Last Thursday I received an email from David Meier , Associate Advisor at the MotleyFool concerning Debt - Deflation .
David asked if I had any comments on his article Debt - deflation : Just the beginning ?
Here is a partial listing :
The debate rages on .
Is inflation or deflation the bigger threat ?
There are lots of people -- lots of smart people -- on both sides of the debate and they present lots of good arguments .
One thing that I have not seen -- and maybe I just missed it -- was an analysis using Irving Fisher 's debt - deflation framework .
So I decided to put one together myself and to inject my understanding of what Bernanke is try to do to stop deflation from taking hold .
The question I keep coming back to , especially as I read more about the situation Japan faced ( I 'm reading everything I can by Richard Koo , including his book " The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics . "
And just to make sure I am not being one - sided , I am countering my fears of deflation with " Monetary Regimes and Inflation " by Peter Bernholz , which should arrive next week .
Without further ado , below is my research on debt - deflation .

Misunderstanding Japan's Lost Two Decades
Real Lesson of Japan's Lost Decades
Illusion of Stimulus
I know Christina Romer best for her misinterpretation of what happened in 1937 - 38 .
She believes that the fallback into full - scale depression from ' depression light ' ( as evidenced by unemployment in 1938 almost returning to the highest levels of the depression trough 32/33 ) is proof that it was a mistake to tighten policy ( fiscal and monetary ) too early .
In other words , according to her , if the Fed had continued pumping as furiously as possible , then everything would have been alright .
In reality , the entire inflationary mini - boomlet - within - the - depression was simply an illusion .
' GDP growth ' that is bought with monetary pumping and feckless fiscal spending only misdirects and ultimately consumes even more scarce capital .
Fiscal stimulus may temporarily give the impression of a recovery , but it is not a genuine recovery .
It makes things worse .
The moment the pumping is abandoned , the true state of affairs is simply unmasked .
That is what happened in 37/38 - a slight tightening of monetary policy revealed the fact that the mini- boomlet was as unsound as its predecessor boom in the years prior to the ' 29 crash .
It would not have been possible to hide this reality forever .
There is nothing , absolutely nothing , that government intervention can achieve in terms of ' fixing ' the economy .
The choice was in either abandoning the unsound policy and the unsound investments it produced , or careen toward a complete destruction of the currency system .
Once again , I stand amazed at how people can look at this , and look at Japan , and look at the housing bubble / bust sequence , and still believe that monetary pumping and deficit spending are viable tools of economic policy when a bust occurs .
It really boggles the mind , reminding me of Einstein 's definition of insanity , ' doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result ' .

Michael Shedlock has an awesome takedown of ECRI ’s claim that its indicators ( a ) have successfully predicted turning points in the past ( b ) point to a sold recovery now .
I ’d add that this is a really , really bad time to be relying on conventional indicators .
Why ?
Basically , because in a zero - interest rate world — the three - month rate was .066 % last I looked — especially one that ’s suffered from a collapse of the shadow banking system , conventional indicators do n’t mean what they usually mean .
Increases in the monetary base are n’t especially expansionary .
The yield curve more or less has to slope up , even if no recovery is expected .
And so on .
So historical correlations , to the extent that they exist — and as Shedlock points out , ECRI is claiming a much better record than it really has — ca n’t be counted on to prevail .
There ’s really no alternative to making fundamental analyses of the macro situation .
Keynesian Model Broken Beyond Repair
The crisis policy devised by John Maynard ( Lord ) Keynes , which seemed to work well during World War II and in postwar reconstruction , met its nadir in 1975 .
Contrary to Keynesian theory , formalized in the Phillips Curve argument that inflation and mass unemployment are mutual trade offs , double digit inflation and record unemployment made further deficit spending an impossible policy .

I learned a lot about the cost of health care when I had a hybrid general surgery practice in California 's rural San Joaquin Valley .
My practice consisted of uninsured women with breast cancer combined with a smaller percentage of cosmetic patients whose cash payments for " vanity care " subsidized the treatment of women unable to pay for needed medical treatment .
Although patients seeking cosmetic services tend to be healthy , I evaluated them like any other patient .
I asked about medical history , allergies , medications and genetic disorders .
Upon questioning Sherry S. , a pretty 46 - year - old seeking wrinkle relief , I learned that four of her immediate family members had been diagnosed with breast or colon cancer before the age of 50 .
Alarmed , I asked why she had not had the recommended screening mammogram for more than four years .
She said that she knew already that her risk for developing breast cancer was likely higher than that of most women .
" But I do n't have insurance , " she replied .
A screening mammogram could be obtained for about $ 90 and was discounted or free at local facilities every October for " Breast Cancer Awareness Month . "
She smiled when I proposed a deal : if she were to get a screening mammogram within sixty days of her treatment , I would offer a discount on what she paid me for cosmetic services .
" I 'll think about it , " she said , then shelled out over $ 400 for BotoxTM injections that took me ten minutes to administer .
Five months later , when she returned for her next wrinkle treatment , she reported that she still had not obtained a mammogram .
I encountered patients who gladly paid upwards of $ 1000 in cash for laser hair removal treatments .
The paperwork filled out during their initial consultation asked them to indicate whether or not they had health insurance .
Several hair removal patients reported being covered by Medi-Cal , the government funded health coverage for California 's low - income population .
A friend of mine sells private health insurance plans .
He told me of the 39 - year - old father of two whose family was quoted a monthly insurance premium of $ 250 .
" Are you kidding ? " he said , refusing the coverage .
" That 's almost as much as my boat payment ! "
When serving in the Rural Health Center in my community , my colleagues and I offered free or discounted care for a large number of patients .
Many were covered by Medi-Cal or one of dozens of state programs paid for by the taxpayers of California .
The following items were commonly seen on patients or carried by their dependent children , who were also covered by subsidized programs : Cell phones and " BlackBerry " PDAs , including just - released models with a price tag of $ 400 , plus an ongoing monthly service fee of $ 65 - $ 150
iPods and portable DVD players
GameBoys and handheld electronic games
Artificial fingernails requiring maintenance every two weeks at a cost of $ 40 - $ 60 per salon visit
Elaborate braided hair weaves , $ 300 per session plus frequent maintenance
Custom - designed body art , including tattoos covering the entire torso , neck and arms , as well as body jewelry piercing every skin surface imaginable - and a few unimaginable ones .
Custom tattoo work , particularly the " portrait - type " and " half sleeve " art popular in this area , runs from $ 100 - $ 300 per hour and can require up to 20 hours of work , depending on the complexity of the design .
[ Author 's note : in three years , I performed over a dozen operations as the result of complications related to infected or abnormally healed body piercings .
Breast abscesses were the most common pathology , followed by cauliflower - shaped keloid scars that interfered with function .
Blood - borne diseases can be contracted during amateur and prison tattoos and piercings , and patients self - reported Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C and HIV infections .
Treatment of the complications of body art among my patients was largely covered by Medi-Cal or left unpaid . ]
From the office I shared with another doctor at the clinic , I had a clear view of the patient parking lot .
It was not unusual for me to see clinic patients drive away in late model SUVs or cars customized in the style popular in my area .
I was given an education about the after - market accessories I saw daily , including " mag " wheels , chrome trim , spinning hubcaps and fancy custom paint jobs .
Gasoline prices were particularly high in central California at that time .
I overheard patients and their children chatting as I wrote in their charts .
Many had an excellent command of the plotlines of cable television shows aired only on premium channels .
Basic cable in my area cost over $ 50 per month , with premium channels extra .
I also overheard the front desk clinic staff members explain politely to angry patients that they did , in fact , have to make $ 5 co-pays for an office visit or meet their $ 20 " Share of Cost " on a $ 600 bill as required by Medi-Cal .
Like many of my colleagues in rural communities with few resources , I did care for patients who actually lived in poverty .
For them , luxury meant keeping the utilities on and having clean clothes for a rare visit to the doctor .
In California 's Central Valley , " dirt poor " is not just a phrase .
But these patients , who rewarded me in ways that do n't fit in the lines on any tax return , were outnumbered by others who considered health care a lower budget priority than decorated skin and expensive toys .
Individuals in this country have a right to decide how -- and how not -- to spend their money .
But that right does not include accepting entitlements without sharing responsibility .
Doing so contributes to the high cost of care that burdens every unsubsidized patient .
If individuals prefer to buy luxury items rather than pay for their healthcare needs , that preference should not be rewarded while taxpayers struggle to foot their own bills .
Dr. Linda Halderman was a Breast Cancer Surgeon in rural central California until unsustainable Medicaid payment practices contributed to her practice 's closure .
She now serves as the healthcare policy advisor for California 's Senator Sam Aanestad while continuing to provide trauma and emergency services in rural communities .
Barack Obama is travelling to Asia this week and has promised to say something about the exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar .
It would be good if some enterprising journalist asked him why the US is worried about the Chinese dumping their dollars , and why US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner recently said that the US is committed to a strong dollar .
As a matter of accounting , a " strong dollar " is the same as an " undervalued yuan " .
So it makes no sense to be worried about the great " power " that the Chinese are holding over us – that they can dump a few hundred billion dollars of their reserve holdings and cause the dollar to fall .
A fall in the dollar would be just what Obama and others are looking for when they ask the Chinese to allow their own currency to rise .
This would stimulate the US economy by reducing the US trade deficit .
It is also just what we need to resolve the long - term problem that our trade deficit represents .
Although the US trade deficit has been cut in half during the current recession , it will once again swell as the economy recovers unless the dollar is reduced to a more competitive level and stays there .
The US manufacturing sector , including the National Association of Manufacturers and some union leaders , understand this very well .
But they have relatively little political clout .
The interests that dominate economic policy - making in the US are mainly in the financial sector , as we can see by the hundreds of billions of dollars of no-strings - attached government subsidies they have gotten in this recession , and the $ 21bn in executive compensation that will be paid out by Goldman Sachs , which is particularly well represented within the US government .
A strong dollar is good for them , because it makes anything they want to buy overseas cheaper , and of course it lowers inflation by keeping imports cheap .
The more than five million manufacturing jobs lost over the last decade are just collateral damage for Wall Street .
Since this conflict of interest between Wall Street and the rest of the country has been resolved in favour of the guys with the big bonuses , what we end up with is a spectacle of scapegoating .
It is easy to blame the Chinese for the overvalued US dollar ( itself an official US policy ) and the US trade deficit .
While it is true that the Chinese could allow their currency to rise against the dollar , it is also true that the US Treasury has the ability to influence the international value of our own currency – just like China and many other countries do .
Although the Chinese currency is not freely convertible , our government could push down the dollar against other major currencies , which would generate more pressure on the Chinese currency .
It is also worth noting , as Justin Lin Yifu , the World Bank 's chief economist , pointed out this week , that only about one - third of the US trade deficit for the years 1990 - 2007 is with China .
With respect to the Chinese holdings of dollar - denominated assets , China is holding a lot of longer - term US government bonds , such as US 10 - year Treasuries .
If the Chinese government were to sell off a lot of these , it would drive up long - term interest rates in the US .
Since our mortgage rates and other long - term lending rates tend to move with long - term Treasuries , this could obviously have a negative impact on the US economy .
But it must be emphasised that this is a different issue from the dollar falling .
Is this threat of a Chinese sell - off of longer - term US Treasuries something that we should worry about ?
Not really .
First , the Chinese government does not want to hurt the US economy , which still absorbs about 20 % of Chinese exports .
One reason China has accumulated long - term Treasuries was to help push down long - term rates in the US , to support growth and demand for its exports during the 2001 - 2007 expansion in the US .
( Some economists have even tried to blame the Chinese for the housing bubble , since these purchases helped push mortgage rates down during the bubble years .
But the housing bubble was , even more than the overvalued dollar , a result of deliberate US policy . )
Second , the Fed can counteract unwanted increases in long - term Treasury and mortgage rates , as it has already done during this recession .
Deficit hawks and other fear - mongers in the US have also used the Chinese accumulation of US debt as another weapon to try and persuade people that we must sacrifice growth and employment during a deep recession , in order to avoid further debt accumulation .
This too , is a dangerous misconception .
Unfortunately our economic problems are made in the United States , and it is here in Washington that they will need to be fixed .
Schumacher , 41 in January , won five successive F1 titles from 2000 - 04 Ferrari have insisted they will not prevent Michael Schumacher making a Formula 1 return with another team .
The seven - time world champion has been a consultant for Ferrari since retiring in 2006 and said recently he would stay in the role for another three years .
But Ferrari chief Luca di Montezemolo says his position is " not binding " .
Schumacher , 40 , has been linked with a move to Mercedes , who have taken over world champions Brawn and already signed driver Nico Rosberg for 2010 .
Schumacher was on the brink of a racing return with Ferrari in August to deputise for the injured Felipe Massa .
Those plans were abandoned following medical checks on a neck injury the German suffered in a motorcycle accident earlier this year .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG
My information is increasingly that Schumacher 's return as Nico Rosberg 's team - mate is looking like a done deal
With that neck problem now understood to be fully healed , Schumacher is thought to be close to completing a sensational return to the sport with German giants Mercedes .
" If he takes another road , our agreement will no longer be valid .
You can't work with a competitor and with us at the same time , " said Ferrari president Montezemolo .
" I still have n't spoken to him about it .
He is only a dear friend , not a team member .
He is a consultant for our road cars . "
Schumacher agreed a new role with Ferrari over the summer , cutting his links with the F1 team to become an ambassador , consultant and test driver for the company 's road cars .
Now Mercedes are understood to want him to launch their return to F1 following the takeover of Brawn .
Countryman Rosberg , 24 , has already been signed up , but the team 's second driver has yet to be confirmed , although they have also been linked with Nick Heidfeld .

" I hope that my team - mate will be sorted out pretty soon and at the moment the rumours are very strong for Michael Schumacher , " said Rosberg , who drove for Williams between 2006 and 2009 .
" I have no idea if it is true or not but obviously if he would join that would be an absolutely fantastic move . "
German newspaper Bild reported that Schumacher , who turns 41 in January , had already agreed a deal , thought to be worth 7 m euros , with Mercedes in principle .
Should he return , Schumacher would go head - to - head with fellow world champions Jenson Button , Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso .
Button , who won the 2009 title with Brawn , will drive for McLaren in 2010 , alongside fellow Briton and 2008 champion Hamilton .
Alonso , champion in 2005 and 2006 , will spearhead Ferrari 's challenge following his move from Renault .
Button has already told BBC Sport that Ferrari , Mercedes and Red Bull are the teams most likely to trouble McLaren next season .

NGC 6240 :
Never Before Seen : Two Supermassive Black Holes in Same Galaxy
The Chandra image of NGC 6240 , a butterfly - shaped galaxy that is the product of the collision of two smaller galaxies , revealed that the central region of the galaxy ( inset ) contains not one , but two active giant black holes .
Previous X - ray observatories had shown that the central region was an X - ray source , but astronomers did not know what was producing the X - rays .
Radio , infrared , and optical observations had detected two bright nuclei , but their exact nature also remained a mystery .
Chandra was able to show that the X - rays were coming from the two nuclei , and determine their X - ray spectra .
These cosmic fingerprints revealed features that are characteristic of supermassive black holes - an excess of high - energy photons from gas swirling around a black hole , and X - rays from fluorescing iron atoms in gas near black holes .
Over the course of the next few hundred million years , the two supermassive black holes , which are about 3000 light years apart , will drift toward one another and merge to form one larger supermassive black hole .
This detection of a binary black hole supports the idea that black holes grow to enormous masses in the centers of galaxies by merging with other black holes .
NGC 6240 is a prime example of a " starburst " galaxy in which stars are forming , evolving , and exploding at an exceptionally rapid rate due to a relatively recent merger ( 30 million years ago ) .
Heat generated by this activity created the extensive multimillion degree Celsius gas seen in this image .
Note on Cosmic Look - Back Time :
The finite speed of light means that we must always be out of date , no matter how hard we strive to keep up with the times .
Thus , the seemingly simple question - what is happening right now on the Sun ?
- cannot be answered by an observer on Earth , because it takes light 8 minutes to reach Earth from the Sun .
For distant galaxies , the light travel times are even longer , so our information about the galaxy NGC 6240 , which is 400 million light years away , is 400 million years out of date !
One consolation is that if astronomers on NGC 6240 are observing our Milky Way galaxy , they are likewise 400 million years behind the times - our times , that is .
As Albert Einstein said , " The past , present and future are only illusions , even if stubborn ones . " more
Aussie whistle blower Stu Dickinson got it badly wrong when he repeatedly penalised the All Blacks in their disputed match against Italy on Saturday ( Sunday NZT ) , referees ' boss Paddy O'Brien has admitted .
Coach Graham
Henry asked for clarity and has been given that , along with a public apology , from IRB referees ' boss Paddy O'Brien , who has admitted referee Dickinson made a series of mistakes during the Milan match , which ended in a 20 - 6 win for the All Blacks .
In what is a major off - field victory for the All Blacks , Kiwi O'Brien travelled to the New Zealand team 's London hotel today to essentially tell Henry and his coaches " you were right " .
O'Brien told Stuff.co.nz , in an exclusive interview prior to his meeting with Henry and scrum expert Mike Cron , that Dickinson should not have taken such drastic action against the All Blacks at scrum time in the test at the San Siro .
In a rare display of transparency , O'Brien has conceded that Dickinson 's performance was sub-standard , and that he has been told so in no uncertain terms .
O'Brien said a review of match footage clearly indicated the Italian tighthead prop ( Martin Castrogiavanni and later Salvatore Perugini ) was " boring in " on the All Black loosehead and that Dickinson 's repeated penalising of the New Zealanders was " completely wrong " .
Invercargill - based O' Brien said the best example took place in the last 10 minutes , when out of the eight scrums , Italy should have been penalised seven times .
He said the actions of the tighthead props were " purely illegal . "
" Up here they 're crying that it should have been a penalty try .
It should have been a penalty first scrum to the All Blacks . "
O'Brien 's words will at least be reassuring for the New Zealanders ahead of Saturday 's test against England .
After the match Henry said the area needed " clarity " and on their arrival in London , assistant coach Steve Hansen said referees were " guessing " on their decisions at the set piece .
Italy coach Nick Mallett complained that the All Blacks got off lightly for their scrum infringements , even though Neemia Tialata was sinbinned late in the match from one of the penalties .
But O'Brien has made it clear that Henry was right and Mallett wrong when it came to their reading of events at the San Siro .
" We 've got to be fair to teams , " O'Brien said .
" If the referee is not accurate we 've got to put our hand up .
We need to educate that referee and get him better , because that scrummaging on Saturday was not up to international standard . "
O'Brien said Dickinson had been given a DVD that makes it clear where he went wrong and a strong message he needs to lift his game .
He has been advised to undertake " scrum coaching " and also told his performance will be taken into account for future appointments .
The IRB 's referees ' boss said Dickinson 's rulings had particularly impacted on young All Black loosehead Wyatt Crockett , who complained during and after the match about the Italian infringments .
" You 've got a young guy trying to launch his test career and get things right and the referee is inaccurate .
Then it 's our problem , " said O'Brien .
" We 've got to deal with the ref , which we will , just like Graham deals with a player who is not playing well . "
All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith said today the team was going about its front - row work " as usual " though he had noted the " publicity " around the scrummaging .
" We 're pretty confident in our front row , " said Smith .
" They had a torrid time at the weekend , and if you look at the tape some of it was difficult to play against .
It was a bit dangerous for our loosehead prop a couple of times , but they got away with it . "
The All Blacks will introduce an entirely new front row to meet England this weekend , with Owen Franks set to step in for Tialata as tighthead alongside regular frontliners Tony Woodcock and Andrew Hore .
Tialata has started the first three tests of the tour , and will be given a chance to freshen up a little ahead of the massive contest against France next week .
The Newswire has been suspiciously devoid on depressing remake news as of late .
Is it because Hollywood has decided to shun derivative , mercenary remakes and " reimaginings " in favor of embracing originality , creativity and startlingly new , innovative scripts ?
Fuck no , as evidenced by the recent news that ABC has just ordered a pilot for a newfangled version of Charlie 's Angels , the " classic " jigglesploitation adventure series that made Farrah Fawcett a star and helped ease millions of teenaged boys through the pain of adolescence .
Josh Friedman , who recently adapted The Terminator for the small screen , will write and Executive Produce the pilot alongside original producer Leonard Goldberg and Drew Barrymore , who produced and starred in the film adaptation and its sequel .
According to an article in Variety , this actually marks the third time producers have tried to bring back Charlie 's Angels .
Spelling tried to resurrect the series in the late eighties under the title Angels 88 and Lost creator Carlton Cuse wrote a pilot for a Charlie 's Angles remake that was n't picked up .
While the third ( or fourth , or fifth ) time be a charm ?
Being fans of cute girls kicking ass we remain , as always , cautiously optimistic .
While most green attention has been focused on wind , solar and other renewable resources , a team at MIT has proposed an alternative power plant that would use natural gas , but would n't emit carbon dioxide .
Crucially , the new plants would n't burn natural gas , they 'd feed it to solid oxide fuel cells , electrochemical devices that convert the energy stored in the gas into electricity through a chemical reaction that 's more efficient than traditional combustion .
Theoretically , the plant would be able to turn heat into electricity with an efficiency of 74 percent , as compared with just 50 percent at the very best natural gas plants ( .pdf ) .
And what 's left over is n't the mix of gases that traditionally goes up a power plant 's smokestack , but relatively pure water and carbon dioxide .
" Because we 're keeping the nitrogen out of there , it 's very , very easy to take the CO2 out , " said MIT engineer Tom Adams , co-author of a paper in the Journal of Power Sources on the new plant design .
Though some of the scientists who have been working on solid oxide fuel cells for a long time do n't think the MIT model is realistic , it does showcase some of the advantages of solid oxide fuel cells that could make them a major part of the low - carbon energy future .
Specifically , solid oxide fuel cells make capturing carbon dioxide emissions easier and less expensive compared to other ways of using fossil fuels .
" The basic point is that we 're able to avoid the CO2 - capture penalty , " Adams said .
Adams and his co-author , MIT engineer Paul Barton , have built on a decade - long effort by the Department of Energy : The Solid Energy Conversion Alliance , a consortium of heavy - hitting fuel - cell scientists and companies like Siemens coordinated by the National Energy Technology Laboratory , has been working to develop solid oxide fuel cells for commercial use .
The group has been steadily progressing towards building fuel - cell power plants .
Right now , solid oxide fuel cells like the ones described by Adams are nearing commercialization by Siemens , but at the kilowatt scale , not the megawatt scale .
But Adams believes megawatt prototypes could be operational by 2012 .
Fuel cells might not sound like the hottest field in energy , but that might be because you 're thinking about the wrong kind of fuel cell .
" You say fuel cells and it's like the kiss of death , " said Michael Tucker , a chemical engineer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who is researching new ways of making fuel cells .
" But that 's because [ people ] associate the fuel cell with two things : the hydrogen economy , which does n't exist , and PEM fuel cells , the hydrogen kind . "
PEM , or polymer electrolyte membrane , fuel cells can convert hydrogen into electricity with the help of a catalyst at fairly low temperatures .
They were supposed to be used largely in transportation to power cars .
Whatever their merits , they have n't had the impact that some analysts predicted years ago .
But solid oxide fuel cells are different .
While they are conceptually less attractive because they run at high temperatures ( more than 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit ) and high pressures ( 10 times atmospheric pressure ) , they do n't require the fragile membranes and expensive catalysts made from precious metals like PEM cells do .
Despite this savings , the cost of solid oxide fuel cells is still too high , which is a major deterrent to their adoption .
" There needs to be a benefit to overcome cost differential , " said Tucker .
" You need to offer something better , and cheaper . "
Right now , projections by backers of solid oxide fuel cells show that if they were able to manufacture them in large numbers , they'd be commercially competitive , Tucker said .
But it 's hard to know if those projections are realistic .
Despite all the technical advances and DOE - directed research , cheap fuel cells still are n't really on the market .
" There is a reason that you can't buy one , " said Tucker .
" No one wants one at the cost that they can manufacture it at . "
He 's working on a new way of making the fuel cells largely out of stainless steel instead of the ceramic commonly used .
This could be radically cheaper than the current technology , which would make it competitive with standard power sources .
Natural gas has had an up - and - down career in the American energy supply .
After massive growth throughout the 1950s , the mistaken perception that natural gas was fairly scarce stalled its adoption for electricity production .
Now , new finds and extraction methods mean that natural gas is often viewed as a bridge fuel from the oil and coal of the past into some energy future based on renewable and / or nuclear power
Still , natural gas burned in a regular power plant produces between one - third and one - half the carbon dioxide emissions of a coal plant .
And it 's very difficult to separate out the carbon dioxide from the rest of the flue gases that come out of the combustion process .
It may be cleaner , but it 's certainly not as CO2 - light as nuclear or solar power .
Solid oxide fuel cells are composed of a stack of three ceramic layers : the anode , an electrolyte and a cathode .
Oxygen atoms pick up electrons in the cathode and travel through the electrolyte to the cathode , where the charged oxygen atoms are combined with hydrogen to produce electricity and water .
Higher - efficiency fuel cells would make using natural gas as clean as possible .
But what form an eventual fuel - cell plant with carbon capture would take is not yet clear .
Scott Samuelsen , director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the University of California , Irvine , criticized the MIT paper for making assumptions that underestimated fuel cells while overstating the benefits of their theoretical power plant .
" The analysis that is conducted here is a bit naive , " Samuelsen said .
One special property of solid oxide fuel cells is that they can use any fuel stuck into them , an ability known as internal reformation .
But Adams ' model does not incorporate this ability .
Instead , it adds a step to transform natural gas into a different gas mixture , heavy in hydrogen and carbon monoxide before it goes into the fuel cell , without accounting for the energy needed in that process , Samuelsen said .
" The paper ignores the internal reformation capabilities , " Samuelsen said .
" It 's like taking the heart out of the patient and describing how the patient behaves . "
Adams countered that some data shows that putting natural gas directly into the fuel cells can lead to carbon deposit buildups that reduce efficiency and cause the cells to die earlier .
Though he noted that many researchers were trying to solve exactly this problem , his team preferred to work around that problem in their model plant instead .
Tucker also took issue with some of the assumptions in the paper .
He thought they were too optimistic about both the cost of solid oxide fuel cells and the price of carbon that could flow out of any climate legislation .
But he said that researchers at his own lab and elsewhere were trying to come up with ways of making fuel cells cheaper .
Even if fuel - cell power plants that capture the carbon dioxide they produce began to spring up across the country in the coming years , they 'll have to store all that CO2 somewhere .
Carbon dioxide sequestration research continues , but serious doubts have been voiced by energy researchers , like Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba , about the volume of material that the carbon capture and sequestration industry would have to handle .
To sequester just 10 percent ( .pdf ) of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions would require building an industry " that would have to force underground every year the volume of compressed gas larger than or ( with higher compression ) equal to the volume of crude oil extracted globally , " Smil wrote in 2008 paper .
Some of that CO2 could be diverted to industrial processes that need it , like brewing or enhancing oil recovery in depleted fields .
And fuel - cell power plants could fit elegantly into such a future system because , unlike traditional turbines , their efficiency is not dependent on their size .
Fuel cells work well at whatever size fits the need for power on the site .

The first full analysis of a 4.4 - million - year - old early human paints a clearer picture of what the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees may have looked like , which is not , after all , that much like a chimp at all .
The ancient Ardipithecus ramidus ( " Ardi " , as the most complete female specimen is known ) is described in 11 research papers published online today in Science .
The prodigious research effort combines Ardi's fossils with those from many other Ar. ramidus individuals — both male and female — found near the Awash River in the Afar Rift region of Ethiopia .
Ar. ramidus , although likely millions of years more recent than the so - called missing link between chimpanzees and humans , represents " coming as close as we 've ever come to that last common ancestor , " Tim White of the University of California , Berkeley , one of the studies ' lead authors , said in a recorded interview for Science .
Ardi is , in fact , " so rife with anatomical surprises , that no one could have imagined it without direct fossil evidence , " wrote C. Owen Lovejoy , a professor of anthropology at Kent State University in Ohio , and his colleagues in a summary of one of the papers .
Among the surprises : Ardi's jaw and limbs show she was a forest - dwelling omnivore , not a fruit - eater like today 's chimps or an open savanna–dweller like other early hominids .
Ardi had a brain about the size of a modern chimp 's relative to body size ( about a third the size of a modern human's ) .
And Ar. ramidus 's foot is strikingly unlike that of a modern chimpanzee , the authors of another paper ( led by Lovejoy ) explain .
For a primitive cousin who likely stood at only about 120 centimeters and weighed about 50 kilograms , Ardi is likely to make a big impact in the field of paleoanthropology .
For instance , Ardi's physical form also has implications for many other ancient animals , including the controversial six-million - to seven - million - year - old Sahelanthropus tchadensis , discovered in Chad in 2001 .
The similarities in skull size and shape among these two species now has prompted the researchers of one of the new papers ( led by Gen Suwa , a professor at the University of Tokyo ) to conclude that S. tchadensis was , indeed , an early hominid , rather than a female ape as others have suggested .

Fragile fossils
First announced 15 years ago with only scant tooth and jaw fragments , Ar. ramidus had remained a relative paleoanthropological secret amidst growing literature on other early hominids , such as the well - known Lucy , a 3.2 - million - year - old Australopithecus afarensis .
For the new papers , an international team of researchers assembled and described the more than 110 pieces of Ardi 's skeleton , including portions of the skull , hands , feet , arms , legs and pelvis , and those of other Ar. ramidus specimens and surrounding plants and animals .
" It 's an amazing amount of material , " says Carol Ward , an associate professor and integrative anatomy specialist at the University of Missouri–Columbia ( M.U. ) .
" That in itself is astonishing . "
The recovery efforts themselves took some " heroic efforts , " says Brian Richmond , of George Washington University 's Center for the Advanced Study of Hominid Paleobiology ( CASHP ) , in Washington , D.C. Poorly fossilized , many of the bones would crumble with a normal human touch , so they were carefully removed , cast and scanned .
Long before the fossils were unearthed , they sustained quite a bit of damage , leaving the skull and the pelvis crushed and distorted .
Close study and computer modeling helped researchers put the pieces back together , but , Richmond notes , " it takes a substantial amount of reconstruction , " and a bit of guesswork to assemble the body — and movements — of a creature long extinct .
By hand or by foot
Perhaps one of the biggest questions that remains in the field of human evolution is how the modern two - legged gait came to be , and Ardi complicates some common assumptions made in the past by anthropologists .
Today 's chimpanzees and gorillas get around on the ground by walking on the hind feet and the knuckles of their hands , leaving many to speculate that early humans may well have done the same .
" It has long been assumed that our hands must have evolved from hands like those of African apes , " Lovejoy and his co-authors wrote in one paper summary .
Other early specimens have lacked sufficient hand bones to establish if they were transitioning from knuckle walking , note the authors of one of the papers .
The more complete hands of Ardi , however , throw another wrench into this theory .
The stiff but strong hands of modern great apes are well - adapted to navigating life in the treetops .
Humans , however , have weaker but more flexible hands , allowing for better dexterity and tool use .
The hands of Ar. ramidus were indeed strong enough to hang from tree branches but do n't show any indication of knuckle - walking , and in some ways they may have been more flexible than our own , Lovejoy and co-authors note .
So does that mean that Ardi was walking on two legs ?
By the time Lucy came along about 3.2 million years ago , her cadre was already fairly well - adapted to bipedal walking ( although not quite so well as modern humans ) .
The researchers suggest that Ardi was , in fact , an upright walker and that " Ar. ramidus could walk without shifting its center of mass from side to side , " a hallmark of latter hominids , wrote Lovejoy and his colleagues .
M.U.'s
Ward is not convinced that Ardi was quite as steady on her feet as the authors suggest .
After examining some of the figures , Ward notes that the specimen 's knees may actually have been spaced farther apart , making Ardi less able to flow from one foot to another without making the large adjustment of body weight .
She is not alone in her skepticism .
" There is precious little to indicate that it was an upright walker , " Richmond says , which actually surprised him , noting that there is other evidence of bipedality going back some four million years ago ( work on fossils of Orrorin tugenensis even suggests bipedality going back some six million years ) .
He also cites the lack of a knee joint as an unknown key to the species 's locomotion capabilities .
Its hips do , however , appear to be moderately adjusted to accommodate some upright walking .
But they were not as similar to modern human hips as those of Australopithecus .
And the feet , although more primitive than a chimpanzee's , " certainly would have been capable of bipedal walking , " Richmond says , although the presence of a large grasping toe and other aspects make it less well - suited to getting around upright .
Perhaps more fossil evidence will help to clarify the path from the tree branch to the savannah , but in the meantime , Ardi has brought some welcome new evidence to the field , Ward notes .
" The question is no longer , ' Why did our ancestors stand upright ? ' " she says .
" It 's , ' Why did they never drop down on all fours when they came out of the trees ? ' "
Forest dweller
Challenging long - held assumptions about where — and why — early humans dropped down from the trees and stretched their legs , Ar. ramidus appears to have lived not in a savanna but in a forest .
Previous excavation of early humans has often been in areas in which ancient deluges had mixed various biomes and layers together , providing a convoluted picture of each individual 's original environment , U.C. Berkeley 's
White et al. wrote in one of the new papers .
Ethiopia 's Afar Rift location , however , had experienced no such archaic amalgamation , providing paleoanthropologists with a clearer picture of Ardi 's world .
Analysis of the area 's geology and other nearby fossils revealed ancient fig and hackberry trees as well as new species of mammals and birds .
These findings , along with the dearth of grassland - dwelling species , such as the larger hoofed species found elsewhere , led the authors of one of the papers ( led by Giday WoldeGabriel , a geologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico ) to propose that the area " was humid and cooler than it is today , containing habitats ranging from woodlands to forest patches , " they wrote in a summary .
Given that they did inhabit a largely wooded area , however , means that ground - based travel was probably secondary , Ward says .
" The most important way of getting around for these animals was climbing trees . "
Nevertheless , it raises questions as to why these animals may have started perambulating upright before later hominids moved onto the grasslands , whereas ancestors of chimpanzees and other great apes eventually retreated deeper into the forest .
Social speculations
What can the outlines of Ardi's frame reveal about the daily lives of this species ?
Researchers found an important indicator in the canine teeth from male Ar. ramidus specimens .
Modern male chimpanzees and gorillas have long , sharp canine teeth , which they use in fights with other males to obtain female mates .
Ar. ramidus — and to an even lesser extent , humans — do n't have such fearsome teeth .
In the papers , Lovejoy suggests that this may be a sign of the absence of such male - to - male competition and aggression over female mates and perhaps an indication that the males were starting to be more involved in the rearing process .
These ancient Ar. ramidus males also appear to have been nearly the same size of the females , another indication that they likely had a different social system than modern chimpanzees , whose aggression - based hierarchy had long been the foil for early hominids .
As White noted in his interview , the absence of these two key gender differences seems to be “ signaling a new social structure . ”
Others in the field agree that these two signatures are likely indicators of a different type of mating system than the one seen in modern African apes .
However , recreating the details of a social system purely on fossil evidence is tricky , if not impossible , says Michael Plavcan , an associate professor of Anthropology at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville .
Some new world monkeys , for example also show little sexual body size or canine tooth dimorphism and pair off for life — “ the family counsel ’s animal of the year , ” says Plavcan — others , with similar characteristics are , he explains , “ intensely promiscuous . ”
Next steps
Like any significant scientific discovery , Ar. ramidus raises more questions than it answers .
" It 's going to keep generations of students busy , " CASHP 's Richmond says of the research .
It will also likely usher in a change in the common understanding that modern humans descended directly from chimpanzees — as popularized by the illustrated " quadrupedal monkey to upright man " sequence .
Accepting the new view of human evolution that the Ardi analyses suggest , says Ward , will mean " tearing that [ depiction ] up and throwing it out the window . "
This new evidence calls into question many assumptions that have been made about Homo sapiens 's assumed privileged evolution .
Indeed , if anything , Ardi reveals that chimpanzees , too , have been on quite an evolutionary odyssey in the past seven million to 10 million years .
It also points the way toward more work outside of Ardi 's clan .
" This just highlights the need for more research to find the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans , " Richmond says .
" Ultimately we want to know where we first came from and what were the factors that let us take our unique steps toward humanity , " he says .
But the fossil record will have to be the final arbitrator .
" I think at this point it 's premature to make conclusions about the common ancestor without having evidence , " he says .
Indeed , even
White noted that it is still too early to say for sure exactly how these evolutionary lines are related and how the hominids came to start walking upright .
The analysis of Ardi gives new poignancy to the notion , set forth nearly 150 years ago by Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley , that there was likely a common ancestor quite different from both modern humans and great apes .
Darwin knew ,
White noted in the recorded interview that , " the only way we 're really going to know what this last common ancestor looked like is to go and find it . "

One World Spokane will offer a Thanksgiving dinner from 2 to 5 p.m. today , nourishing Spokane ’s underprivileged as it has for the past year .
The nonprofit restaurant in the East Central neighborhood provides fresh , organic food to people who typically do n’t have access to that fare .
Instead of a menu with set prices , patrons pay what they can .
As many as 20 people a day eat there free , either because they volunteer their time or because they ca n’t afford to pay .
One World gets by on a shoestring budget , making what happened there earlier this month all the more troubling .
During a busy weekend , someone went into an upstairs office of the building at 1804 E. Sprague Ave. and took $ 1,200 in cash – about a month ’s worth of gross receipts and money the restaurant could hardly afford to lose .
The theft wo n’t deter One World from its mission , however .
“ It ’s not a natural thing to start accusing people , ” chef Virlinda Severance said .
She said she ’s resisting the urge to look at the people around her with suspicion .
“ There are a lot of people who are good , honest citizens who come here to help out , ” she said .
The loss was discovered early Nov. 16 .
Police were called , but the officer who took the report said the case is not likely to be solved .
The money was not locked up , Severance said – a practice that will change .
One World Spokane opened in 2008 with the idea of offering organic food in a café set up like a community kitchen .
The cooking is done adjacent to the tables , and patrons order what they like , including the size of portions .
They then contribute a donation they think is fair .
Donations typically run from $ 5 to $ 15 .
The restaurant offers a free daily special for people who ca n’t afford to pay , and volunteers at the restaurant eat for free .
Tuesday ’s lunch menu included bulgur wheat and split peas for its free entrée , along with a kale and tofu stir - fry or trout in white wine sauce .
Severance said she wants the public to know about the restaurant and to consider dropping by for a meal or making a donation to help the eatery overcome the loss .
“ It ’s really sad , ” she said , “ that somebody would be so inconsiderate of an organization that is trying to help people . ”

Convicted Child Molestor Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr. On The Lam in Texas Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr. is believed to be armed and dangerous .
Nov. 30 , 2009  --
A convicted child molester who was supposedly confined to a wheelchair overpowered two prison guards today , handcuffed them , stole their weapons and walked off wearing one of their uniforms .
Arcade Joseph Comeaux Jr. , 49 , is serving a life sentence for several charges – including indecency with a child – and was en route from the Estelle Unit in Huntsville , Texas , to the Stiles Unit in Beaumont , Texas , when he escaped just after 9 a.m .
Michelle Lyons , the director of public information for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , told ABCNews.com that Comeaux took the two transport officers hostage with a " firearm " of his own , somehow using it to " force the driver to stop the vehicle . "
The escapee then took the officers ' weapons , handcuffed them together in the back of the van they had been driving and fled on foot , according to Lyons .
He left his own weapon behind , but took the officers ' weapons with him - a 12 - gauge shotgun and two semiautomatic pistols , said Lyons .
The officers were found shortly after unharmed .
Comeaux is believed to be wearing a grey correctional officers ' uniform and black boots that he took from one of the officers .
He also has both the officers ' firearms in his possession , said Lyons , who encouraged anyone who sees him to call police because Comeaux is considered to be dangerous .
Lyons said that Comeaux used a wheelchair in prison – he " claimed it was necessary for his mobility " – and added , " Since he fled on foot , that 's obviously in question . "
The van in which Comeaux and the two officers were in had a metal screen dividing them , but Lyons did not elaborate on how the escapee might have overcome the barrier .
She would also not comment on why Comeaux was being moved from one prison to another .
Described as a 6 - feet tall and weighing approximately 200 pounds , Lyons warned that Comeaux knows the area where he escaped well and could have family nearby .
Texas Prison Escapee Is Believed to Be Armed and Dangerous
" Beyond the crimes for which he was serving , certainly an escape is a desperate act , " Lyons told ABC's Texas affiliate KTRK .
" It should certainly be assumed that he is going to do whatever he can to avoid being taken back into custody . "
According to Lyons , the escapee has been in and out of the Texas prison system for the last 30 years .
He initially was imprisoned on February 1979 on three 10 - year sentences for rape of a child , aggravated rape of a child , and burglary of a building with the intent to commit theft .
He was later released on mandatory supervision in August 1983 .
His supervision was revoked and he returned to prison in May 1984 with a new charge of indecency with a child , given a new 20 year sentence .
He was later released on mandatory supervision in June 1991 .
Between 1991 and 1998 , Comeaux was in and out of prison on parole violations until he finally returned to prison in June 1999 to serve a life sentence for aggravated sexual assault .
He has been incarcerated since .
In 1999 , Comeaux stabbed his wife during a visit , using his wheelchair to pin her against a wall while he stabbed her .
His wife survived , but another inmate who tried to break up the attack also suffered stab wounds , and Comeaux was convicted of additional assault charges and received two additional life sentences .
Lyons said that prison officials will conduct an investigations to determine , among other details , how Comeaux was able to obtain a firearm while in custody .

The awesome power of Chuck Norris
Piffle , suggests one astrophysicist , at least when it comes to explaining what force could have permanently bent a ring in our Milky Way Galaxy within the last 60 million years .
The real explanation may be the power of an invisible wrecking ball made of dark matter — a cloud of the enigmatic physics particles born in the fiery aftermath of the Big Bang and weighing as much as 10 million suns .
Left behind by this " Dark Matter Clump " cataclysm was a tilted swirl of newborn stars circling within the galaxy called the " Gould Belt , " which incidentally may have sent comets hurtling towards Earth , suggests astrophysicist Kenji Bekki of Australia 's University of New South Wales in a recent Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society journal .
In the study , Bekki offered a new explanation for the Gould Belt , which 19th - Century astronomers first noted .
It circles more than 3,000 light years outside the center of the Milky Way ( where a light year equals 5.9 trillion miles ) at a 20 - degree tilt from the galaxy 's rotating spiral arms .
In 1997 , the astronomer W. G. L. Poppel pointed out that astronomers could not explain where all its young stars , perhaps 2 million of them less than 60 million years old , came from using common explanations of star formation .
" The point is that the sun is immersed in the Gould Belt , " Poppel added , suggesting we might want to know how all these young stars came to surround our 4.6 billion - year - old sun .
Since then , Bekki notes , researchers such as Juerg Diemand at the University of California , Santa Cruz , have reported hundreds of dense dark matter clouds that may zoom near the sun 's neighborhood of the galaxy .
So what is dark matter ?
Astronomers have only detected it by its gravitational pull on galaxies ; it is literally dark , which makes it impossible to see with telescopes and leads them to believe that so - called " weakly - interacting massive particles " ( WIMPS , in a bit of physics humor ) — exotic physics particles much like neutrinos that only rarely electromagnetically interact with normal atoms — comprise the bulk of the stuff .
Most likely , dark matter was cooked up and clumped together in the primordial chemistry of the Big Bang some 13.7 billion years ago .
Despite its darkness , the gravitational tug of dark matter suggests there is about five times more of it than normal matter , the stuff of stars , planets and people , in the universe .
" In the new scenario presented in the ( study ) , the Gould Belt is one of the stellar substructures formed from high - speed , off - centre collisions between giant molecular clouds , which are believed to be the birth place for stars and dark matter clumps orbiting the Galaxy , " Bekki writes .
Using computer models to test a collision between a dark matter clump and a hydrogen gas cloud merely 1 million times heavier than the sun , he finds that within 45 million years the dark matter 's gravity would have indeed spawned a tilted ring of infant stars looking much like the Gould Belt .
" This is a very promising result , " says astrophysicist Varoujan Gorjian of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" The Gould 's Belt result gives a new tool to try to see if our idea of how dark matter may be distributed in a galaxy is correct , " he adds , " since we can't actually observe dark matter itself we need to see the secondary effect that those clumps may have .
The Gould 's Belt model makes a good case that in fact dark matter may reside in clumps . "
And what about those comets from the distant Kuiper comet belt beyond Pluto hurtling toward Earth ?
The study shows the distance between the sun and the massive dark matter cannonball could have been as close as 326 light years away , Bekki says by e-mail , so that the gravitational force of the Dark Matter Clump can be stronger than that of the sun in the very outer part of the solar system .
The Kuiper belt would be significantly perturbed owing to this .
As a result of this , a lot of comets would intrude into the inner part of the solar system ( possibly to the Earth ) after the dark impact .
Take that , Chuck Norris .
Just imagine the sky lighting up with new stars more than 30 million years ago .
" This is pure speculation , " Bekki adds .
But if the Milky Way has 20 dark matter clumps hanging around , he reckons that a Gould Belt - like star ring likely forms from dark matter collisions every billion years or so .
And about 0.1 % of hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy started this way .
Concludes the paper : " The Gould Belt is not just a magnificent stripe of stars in the night sky but also a fossil record containing profound physical meanings of a dramatic event which would have happened in the solar neighborhood . "

The world is going to hell in a global warming handcart .
Maybe Mary MacKillop can save us .
After all , someone who can cure inoperable cancer 60 years after she has died should n’t find getting the major capitalist powers to agree on ways to address climate change too hard .
So come on Mary , get Obama and Wen Jiabao to agree on real , binding and transparent targets to reduce greenhouse gases by 50 percent by 2020 .
And while you are at how about a Pauline conversion for Tony Abbott , Ian Plimer and their hangers on in the media ?
There is a more serious point in all of this .
Many people believe this saintly and godly mysticism .
Many many more , it must be said , than believe or understand socialism .
Why ?
The struggle of humanity to understand the material reality around us has been one of our grand projects .
Of course that understanding is warped through the divisions of class society , but capitalism now provides us with the material base to transcend class and need and build a truly human society , a heaven if you like on earth .
The rise of capitalism and the enlightenment accompanying it saw the old religious mysticisms retreat in the face of knowledge .
But mysticism regrouped and became an integral part of the ideology of a capitalism establishing and stabilising its rule in Europe and the United States at various times in the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries .
The material base for this regrouping was not just the needs of capital .
Religion , Janus like , in fact appeals to both contending classes .
But for workers the very nature of their position in capitalism – the alienation from their own products and the creation of an external world of commodities – mirrors itself in the religious fetishism of god in heaven while humans are trapped on earth in the unrelenting production of goods and services for profit .
God is the fetishism of the human spirit expressing itself under capitalism in wage slavery .
To appeal to a society divided along class lines god becomes both boss and worker .
Capitalism witnessed the social democratisation of god .
He is now the Gough Whitlam of paradise .
The profound alienation we as workers experience opens up our lives to non-material explanations of the world .
Marx put it much better when he wrote :
Religious suffering is , at one and the same time , the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering .
Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature , the heart of a heartless world , and the soul of soulless conditions .
It is the opium of the people .
In other words , like opium , it gives pain relief .
And like opium it does n’t address the causes of pain but rather masks them .
We on the left ca n’t ignore the more than 60 percent of workers who believe in god or a spiritual being .
It is these workers who in remaking the world will remake themselves .
That means understanding the attraction of a long dead woman [ or replace Mary MacKillop with another piece of mysticism here ] to many workers in society .
It means , as Lenin wrote , that we are concerned with creating the paradise of the here and now , as many workers will be at some stage too .
When the oppressed arise , we must be on their side , even if they do believe in Mary MacKillop .
It is their power as workers that is the driving force of change and one we socialists want to relate to .
We can only do that by understanding religion and the religious , not dismissing them .

Israeli settlers in the South Hebron Hills of the West Bank harassed a Palestinian family walking home , then beat and robbed two internationals who accompanied them .
The two young parents and their three small children were returning from the nearby city of Yatta to their home village of Tuba .
At 11 am they encountered two members of Christian Peacemaker Teams ( CPT ) just south of the village of At - Tuwani .
After the peace workers warned the Palestinians about the settlers seen earlier in the morning , the family chose a longer path toward Tuba , accompanied by the CPT members .
As the group crossed Mashakha Hill , they saw four settler men on a ridge 50 metres above them , reports CPT .
The settlers ran toward the Palestinians and began to circle them .
A fifth settler , masked and hooded , appeared from the valley below .
When the Palestinian man told them he was only trying to walk home , a settler pushed him .
As the CPT workers attempted to step between the Palestinians and settlers , the settlers pushed them to the ground , hit and kicked them , and stole their two video cameras .
The settlers then walked to the illegal settlement outpost of Havot Ma’on ( Hill 833 ) , where they disappeared among the trees 20 minutes later .
The Palestinian family reached their home safely .
For decades , residents of Tuba Village had a direct road to the village of At - Tuwani , and onward to the regional economic hub of Yatta .
The Israeli settlement of Ma’on and its neighbouring illegal outpost of Havat Ma’on were built directly on that road , blocking all Palestinian traffic and forcing villagers onto long dirt paths through the hills , adding as much as two hours to a journey .
Christian Peacemaker Teams has maintained a continuous full - time presence in At - Tuwani since 2005 , supporting Palestinian freedom of movement under the threat of settler violence .
CPT places trained volunteers in locations of violent conflict around the world at the invitation of local peacemakers .
According to the Geneva Conventions , the International Court of Justice in the Hague and numerous United Nations resolutions , all Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories are illegal .
Most settlement outposts are considered illegal under Israeli law .
Nearly 500,000 Israelis now live in more than 100 settlements built on occupied territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
This evening the United States has voiced its " dismay " over Israel 's approval of 900 additional housing units at a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the move will make it " more difficult " to revive Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
TOKYO , Nov. 8 ( UPI ) -- Japan 's top court has affirmed the death sentences of two men convicted in a fatal sarin gas attack on a subway station , officials said .
The Second Petty Bench of the Supreme Court rejected appeals by Toru Toyota , 41 , and Kenichi Hirose , 45 , who were convicted of murder in the 1995 sarin attack that killed 12 people .
Toyota and Hirose were members of a doomsday cult known as the AUM Shinrikyo .

" It was an indiscriminate mass murder committed systematically for the purpose of defending the cult as an organization .
The consequences were extremely grave , " the court said in its decision Friday , The Mainichi Daily News reported Sunday .
Toyota , Hirose and six others were convicted of stabbing holes in plastic bags containing the nerve agent sarin and then leaving the bags inside a station and on trains .
Toyota and Hirose argued they should be spared death sentences because they were under the influence of AUM Shinrikyo cult leader Chizuo Matsumoto , 54 , who also has been sentenced to death .

A bunch of folks have been submitting the recent Patently - O post by Martin Goetz , the guy who claims to have the first " software patent , " defending the concept of software patents .
The argument boils down to pretty much the same argument we 've heard a thousand times before : that what people create in software is no different than what they create in hardware -- it 's just a different method of doing the same thing , and thus , software should be patentable .
To some extent , I agree .
Unlike some , I 'm not in favor of making a specific " exemption " for software as not being patentable ( though , I do question why or how something should be covered by both copyrights and patents , and also am curious how you can patent basic mathematics ... but those are questions for another time ) .
Honestly , in reading through his arguments , what struck me is that there is no explanation for why even computer hardware should be patentable .
It 's just taken for granted that computer hardware patents must be good , and since software is the equivalent of what 's done in hardware ( not really true in many cases , but ... ) , software patents must be good .
But should n't the original question be whether or not the hardware itself requires patents and whether or not that helps to " promote the progress of science and the useful arts " ?
Goetz never bothers to explain how any of these patents promote progress .
And , of course , the bigger point is whether or not it 's really true that software is just a different way of doing what you can do in hardware .
In some cases , that 's true .
In other cases , it 's not .
Most software today is not just a different way of doing things that could be done in hardware , but involve things that could n't be done without software .
How do you offer wireless email without any software ?
How do you do " one - click shopping " without software ?
What the article is really arguing is that because you could build software - functionality into hardware , you should be able to patent it , but perhaps that never should have been allowed to be patented in the first place ?

NIWA issued a response statement regarding the charges leveled by The NZ Climate Science Coalition here :
http://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/climate/news/all/niwa-confirms-temperature-rise
They say :
Warming over New Zealand through the past century is unequivocal .
NIWA ’s analysis of measured temperatures uses internationally accepted techniques , including making adjustments for changes such as movement of measurement sites .
For example , in Wellington , early temperature measurements were made near sea level , but in 1928 the measurement site was moved from Thorndon ( 3 metres above sea level ) to Kelburn ( 125 m above sea level ) .
The Kelburn site is on average 0.8 °C cooler than Thorndon , because of the extra height above sea level .
I ’m not too impressed , especially when you see where the weather station for National Institute of Water and Atmosphere ( NIWA ) is , right on the rooftop next to the air conditioners :
Here is the station survey : NIWA_station_survey ( PDF ) and the Google Earth KML file
Thanks to : Dieuwe de Boer who did a good portion of station surveys in New Zealand last year .
The NZ Climate Science Coalition responds :
NIWA ’s explanation raises major new questions
The NIWA climate controversy took a new twist tonight with the release of new data from the government run climate agency .
Reeling from claims that it has massaged data to show a 150 year warming trend where there is n’t one , NIWA ’s chief climate scientist David Wratt , an IPCC vice - chair on the 2007 AR4 report , issued a news release stating adjustments had been made to compensate for changes in sensor locations over the years .
While such an adjustment is valid , it needs to be fully explained so other scientists can test the reasonableness of the adjustment .
Wratt is refusing to release data his organisation claims to have justifying adjustments on other weather stations , meaning the science cannot be reviewed .
However , he has released information relating to Wellington temperature readings , and they make for interesting reading .
Here ’s the rub .
Up until 1927 , temperatures for Wellington had been taken at Thorndon , only 3 m above sea level and an inner-city suburb .
That station closed and , as I suspected in my earlier post , there is no overlap data allowing a comparison between Thorndon and Kelburn , where the gauge moved , at an altitude of 135 metres .
With no overlap of continuous temperature readings from both sites , there is no way to truly know how temperatures should be properly adjusted to compensate for the location shift .
Wratt told Investigate earlier there was international agreement on how to make temperature adjustments , and in the news release tonight he elaborates on that :
“ Thus , if one measurement station is closed ( or data missing for a period ) , it is acceptable to replace it with another nearby site provided an adjustment is made to the average temperature difference between the sites . ”
Except , except , it all hinges on the quality of the reasoning that goes into making that adjustment .
If it were me , I would have slung up a temperature station in the disused location again and worked out over a year the average offset between Thorndon and Kelburn .
It ’s not perfect , after all we are talking about a switch in 1928 , but it would be something .
But NIWA did n’t do that .
Instead , as their news release records , they simply guessed that the readings taken at Wellington Airport would be similar to Thorndon , simply because both sites are only a few metres above sea level .
Airport records temps about 0.79C above Kelburn on average , so NIWA simply said to themselves , “ that ’ll do ” and made the Airport / Kelburn offset the official offset for Thorndon / Kelburn as well , even though no comparison study of the latter scenario has ever been done .
Here ’s the raw data , from NIWA tonight , illustrating temp readings at their three Wellington locations since 1900 :
What ’s interesting is that if you leave Kelburn out of the equation , Thorndon in 1910 is not far below Airport 2010 .
Perhaps that gave NIWA some confidence that the two locations were equivalent , but I ’m betting Thorndon a hundred years ago was very different from an international airport now .
Nonetheless , NIWA took its one - size - fits all “ adjustment and altered Thordon and the Airport to match Kelburn for the sake of the data on their website and for official climate purposes .
In their own words , NIWA describe their logic thus .
Where there is an overlap in time between two records ( such as Wellington Airport and Kelburn ) , it is a simple matter to calculate the average offset and adjust one site relative to the other .
Wellington Airport is +0.79 °C warmer than Kelburn , which matches well with measurements in many parts of the world for how rapidly temperature decreases with altitude .
Thorndon ( closed 31 Dec 1927 ) has no overlap with Kelburn ( opened 1 Jan 1928 ) .
For the purpose of illustration , we have applied the same offset to Thorndon as was calculated for the Airport .
The final “ adjusted ” temperature curve is used to draw inferences about Wellington temperature change over the 20th century .
The records must be adjusted for the change to a different Wellington location
Now , it may be that there was a good and obvious reason to adjust Wellington temps .
My question remains , however : is applying a temperature example from 15 km away in a different climate zone a valid way of rearranging historical data ?
And my other question to David Wratt also remains : we ’d all like to see the metholdology and reasoning behind adjustments on all the other sites as well .

An extensive study made with ESO 's Very Large Telescope deepens a long - standing mystery in the study of stars similar to the Sun .
Unusual year - long variations in the brightness of about one third of all Sun - like stars during the latter stages of their lives still remain unexplained .
Over the past few decades , astronomers have offered many possible explanations , but the new , painstaking observations contradict them all and only deepen the mystery .
The search for a suitable interpretation is on .
" Astronomers are left in the dark , and for once , we do not enjoy it , " says Christine Nicholls from Mount Stromlo Observatory , Australia , lead author of a paper reporting the study .
" We have obtained the most comprehensive set of observations to date for this class of Sun - like stars , and they clearly show that all the possible explanations for their unusual behaviour just fail . "
The mystery investigated by the team dates back to the 1930s and affects about a third of Sun - like stars in our Milky Way and other galaxies .
All stars with masses similar to our Sun become , towards the end of their lives , red , cool and extremely large , just before retiring as white dwarfs .
Also known as red giants , these elderly stars exhibit very strong periodic variations in their luminosity over timescales up to a couple of years .
" Such variations are thought to be caused by what we call ' stellar pulsations ' , " says Nicholls .
" Roughly speaking , the giant star swells and shrinks , becoming brighter and dimmer in a regular pattern .
However , one third of these stars show an unexplained additional periodic variation , on even longer timescales -- up to five years . "
In order to find out the origin of this secondary feature , the astronomers monitored 58 stars in our galactic neighbour , the Large Magellanic Cloud , over two and a half years .
They acquired spectra using the high resolution FLAMES / GIRAFFE spectrograph on ESO 's Very Large Telescope and combined them with images from other telescopes [ 1 ] , achieving an impressive collection of the properties of these variable stars .
Outstanding sets of data like the one collected by Nicholls and her colleagues often offer guidance on how to solve a cosmic puzzle by narrowing down the plethora of possible explanations proposed by the theoreticians .
In this case , however , the observations are incompatible with all the previously conceived models and re-open an issue that has been thoroughly debated .
Thanks to this study , astronomers are now aware of their own " ignorance " -- a genuine driver of the knowledge - seeking process , as the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates is said to have taught .
" The newly gathered data show that pulsations are an extremely unlikely explanation for the additional variation , " says team leader Peter Wood .
" Another possible mechanism for producing luminosity variations in a star is to have the star itself move in a binary system .
However , our observations are strongly incompatible with this hypothesis too . "
The team found from further analysis that whatever the cause of these unexplained variations is , it also causes the giant stars to eject mass either in clumps or as an expanding disc .
" A Sherlock Holmes is needed to solve this very frustrating mystery , " concludes Nicholls .
Note
[ 1 ] Precise brightness measurements were made by the MACHO and OGLE collaborations , running on telescopes in Australia and Chile , respectively .
The OGLE observations were made at the same time as the VLT observations .
This research was presented in two papers : one appeared in the November issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ( “ Long Secondary Periods in Variable Red Giants ” , by C. P. Nicholls et al. ) , and the other has just been published in the Astrophysical Journal ( “ Evidence for mass ejection associated with long secondary periods in red giants ” , by P. R. Wood and C. P. Nicholls ) .
The team is composed of Christine P. Nicholls and Peter R. Wood ( Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics , Australia National University ) , Maria - Rosa L. Cioni ( Centre for Astrophysics Research , University of Hertfordshire , UK ) and Igor Soszyński ( Warsaw University Observatory ) .
Eleven Eastern governors are expected to approve a blueprint for slashing carbon dioxide emissions from cars -- and perhaps home furnaces -- before January , according to state officials , potentially sparking a widespread shift to residential heaters that burn wood pellets .
Officials in states from Maine to Maryland are preparing the outlines of a regional plan that would limit the amount of greenhouse gases a unit of fuel , like a gallon of gasoline , could emit .
That 's meant to prompt oil companies , refiners and motorists to use cleaner fuels made from trash and plants and renewable electricity .
Emission reduction targets are not yet established , but officials are basing preliminary calculations on a goal of cutting carbon 10 percent by 2020 .
That 's identical to California 's pioneering low - carbon fuel standard .
The Eastern program could be strikingly different in one way :
More than 1 million homes in the region are heated with oil , more than anywhere else in the country .
It could be a controversial task to regulate the fuel that keeps New Englanders warm during long winters .
But the alternative is just as troubling : Oil - burning furnaces consume more fossil fuel there than diesel - driven trucks .
If heating emissions are not reduced , they could undermine the clean fuel standard -- and perhaps make the states unable to meet their existing global warming goals .
" A critical decision will be whether to limit the program just to transportation fuels or whether to also include heating fuel , " said Michelle Manion of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management , a nonprofit research group involved in designing the plan .
' Difficult ' to cut emissions without addressing heat
In Massachusetts alone , about 963,000 homes -- almost half -- rely on oil heat .
They consume 2 billion gallons of carbon - rich fuel every year , accounting for almost 20 percent of the nation 's heating oil .
New England burns 4.6 billion gallons of the stuff annually .
That amounts to almost 15 percent of the region 's petroleum use .
So there 's concern that if heating oil is not included in the fuel standard , the 11 states might not be able to meet their individual emission reduction targets .
All of them have promised to cut carbon .
" We are looking at whether we would be able to meet our goals without including home heating oil , " said Rebecca Ohler , a supervisor with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and a participant in the plan 's design .
" I do think it would be difficult . "
Another contributor , Ellen Pierce , an analyst with Connecticut 's Department of Environmental Protection , said heating oil is " a significant contributor to air emissions . "
" It 's something we should look at , " she added .
Limiting emissions from transportation fuel is already daunting .
Adding furnace fuel vastly increases the complexity of whom to regulate and how .
Scores of additional businesses would fall under the watch of state regulators , probably prompting stronger opposition when state legislatures begin considering the plan for approval .
Politicians could become squeamish if the fuel standard is perceived to hike home heating bills during Northern winters .
' Cheaper ' heat could mean widespread upgrades
But that may not be the case , said Nancy Seidman , deputy assistant commissioner for climate strategies with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection .
" If folks switch to wood or a different fuel , then in some cases , it may be cheaper or more efficient , " she said .
The report emphasizes the states ' home - grown opportunities .
Wood pellets could be culled from the forests and manufacturing sites of Pennsylvania , New York and other states , reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracting , refining and transporting oil around the world .
But that raises an infrastructure question .
Thousands of homes might have to replace oil furnaces with wood - burning heaters .
Other options exist , like using renewable electricity to heat homes , switching to natural gas or running oil furnaces on cleaner mixes of biofuels .
" The use of woody biomass and electricity as substitutes , combined with increased natural gas use for space heating , provides near - term low carbon fuel options for the Northeast , " according to a 233 - page analysis ( pdf ) released last month by the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management .
That assertion could cause waves .
Energy is expensive in New England , and residents could find new costs associated with replacing furnaces unappetizing .
State officials are just beginning to model the economic effects of the plan .
Oil sands could cause havoc
The Energy Consumers Alliance of New England supports state initiatives aimed at replacing heating oil with low - sulfur diesel , a cleaner fuel .
But the program 's main thrust is to reduce the cost of oil by pooling the buying power of 17,000 households .
That 's not exactly an incentive to produce less emissions .
" The green they 're interested in saving is their own , " said Phil Lindsay , who runs the group 's oil program .
The plan could be up and running in two years , said coordinator Manion .
The governors from all 11 states -- including big polluter Pennsylvania -- are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding this year that establishes the broad strokes .
Each state would then have to approve the program through legislation or executive order .
If emissions were reduced 10 percent by 2020 , that would prevent 30 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere every year .
That 's without cleaning up home heating systems .
Even so , it 's still a bigger impact than that of the nation 's first regional cap - and - trade program , the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , which is reducing emissions from 233 East Coast power plants .
If home heating is not regulated , it could spur an influx of high - carbon petroleum from Canada 's controversial oil sands , analysts warn .
Refiners could direct Canadian bitumen into residential oil tanks , even as that emission - heavy fuel is being blocked from entering cars by the low - carbon fuel standard .
That could undermine emission targets , and the " carbon intensity of the region 's fuel supply could rise significantly , " according to the states ' official analysis .
Currently , about half a percent of the region 's home heating supply comes from Canadian oil sands .

Four parties responsible for the widespread bootleg version of Microsoft 's Windows XP in China have been found guilty and sentenced to spend as much as three and a half years in a Chinese prison .
China has long been linked with international cyber crime and foreign malware .
However , according to Xinhua -- the official news agency of the People 's Republic of China -- the hundreds of thousands of other cases of online deviance pales in comparison to the bootlegged " Tomato Garden " version of Windows XP .
Biggest Piracy Case in Chinese History
Created in 2004 , the Tomato Garden has had a hemorrhaging spread throughout China , and has been dubbed ' the biggest software piracy case in Chinese history ' according to Xinhua news agency .
The illicit software was created by Hong Lei and distributed via tomatolei.com , where it was consumed by the millions .
Lei was able to turn his situation profitable thanks in large part to the earnings made from a number of advertisements found on the site .
Unfortunately for Microsoft , the hacked version of Windows XP Tomato Garden caused a crippling effect on program authentication and certification barriers .
( Source : yahoo.com )
BSA Cracks Down on Piracy
In June 2008 , the Business Software Alliance ( a coalition set up to rid the world of commercial piracy ) stumbled upon tomatolei.com and complained to Chinese authorities .
Now , Lei finds himself facing a three and a half year prison sentence via a court ruling in Suzhou , located in eastern China .
( Source : hollywoodreporter.com )
Another one of Lei's accomplices was handed the same prison sentence while the two remaining parties each received two year sentences .
The four may consider themselves fortunate , however .
As founding fathers of the " biggest software piracy case " in the history of the globe 's most populated nation , their situation is exacerbated by pressure from Washington to make examples out of online deviants .
Now , more than ever , China must prove to the world their seriousness when attempting to stamp out abuse of copyrighted and patented products .
It is not known if the four intend to appeal the court ruling .

Someone convinced the record and movie and TV industries that there is way of letting someone listen to audio or watch video over the internet without making a copy .
They call this " streaming " audio , and compare it to radio , and contrast it with " downloading " , which they compare to buying a CD .
The idea that you can show someone a movie over the internet without making a copy has got lots of people in policy circles excited , since it seems to " solve the copyright problem " .
If services such as Hulu , Last.fm and YouTube can " play you a file " instead of " sending you a file " , then we 're safely back in the pre-Napster era .
You can sell subscriptions to on - demand streaming , and be sure that your subscribers will never stop paying , since they do n't own their favourite entertainment and will have to stump up in order to play it again .
There 's only one problem : Streaming does n't exist .
Oh , OK .
Streaming exists .
It is a subset of downloading , which comes in many flavours .
Downloading is what happens when one computer ( a server , say ) sends another computer ( your PC , say ) a file .
Some downloads happen over http , the protocol on which the web is based .
Some happen over BitTorrent , which pulls the file from many different locations , in no particular order , and reassembles it on your side .
Some downloads take place over secure protocols like SSH and SSL , and some are part of intelligent systems that , for example , keep your computer in sync with an encrypted remote backup .
Streaming describes a collection of downloading techniques in which the file is generally sent sequentially , so that it can be displayed before it is fully downloaded .
Some streams are open - ended ( like the video stream coming off your CCTV camera , which is n't a finite file , but rather continues to transmit for as long as the CCTV is up and running ) .
Some travel over UDP , a cousin of the more familiar TCP , in which reliability can be traded off for speed .
Some streaming servers can communicate with the downloading software and dynamically adjust the stream to compensate for poor network conditions .
And of course , some streaming software throws away the bits after it finishes downloading them , rather than storing them on the hard - drive .
It 's this last part that has the technologically naive excited .
They assume that because a downloading client can be designed in such a way that it does n't save the file , no " copy " is being made .
They assume that this is the technical equivalent of " showing " someone a movie instead of " giving them a copy " of it .
But the reason some download clients discards the bits is because the programmer chose not to save them .
Designing a competing client that does n't throw away the bits – one that " makes a copy " – is trivial .
All streaming involves making a copy , and saving the copy just is n't hard .
Does this matter ?
After all , if the entertainment industry can be bought off with some pretty stories about a magical kind of download that does n't make a copy , should n't we just leave them to their illusions ?
What harm could come from that ?
Plenty , I fear .
First of all , while streaming music from Last.fm is a great way to listen to music you have n't discovered yet , there 's no reason to believe that people will lose the urge to collect music .
Indeed , the record industry seems to have forgotten the lesson of 70 years ' worth of radio : people who hear songs they like often go on to acquire those songs for their personal collections .
It 's amazing to hear record industry executives deny that this will be the case , especially given that this was the dominant sales strategy for their industry for most of a century .
Collecting is easier than it has ever been : you can store more music in less space and organise it more readily than ever before .
People will go on using streaming services , of course .
They may even pay for them .
But people will also go on downloading .
Streaming wo n't decrease downloading .
If streaming is successful – that is , if it succeeds in making music more important to more people – then downloading will increase too .
With that increase will come a concomitant increase in Big Content 's attacks on the privacy and due process rights of internet users , which , these days , is pretty much everyone .
If you want to solve the " downloading problem " you can't do it by waving your hands and declaring that a totally speculative , historically unprecedented shift in user behaviour – less downloading – will spontaneously arise through the good offices of Last.fm .
There are more problems , of course .
Streaming is an implausible and inefficient use of wireless bandwidth .
Our phones and personal devices can be equipped with all the storage necessary to carry around tens of thousands of songs for just a few pounds , incurring a single cost .
By contrast , listening to music as you move around ( another factor that has been key to the music industry 's strategy , starting with the in - car eight - track player and continuing through the Walkman and iPod ) via streams requires that you use the scarce electromagnetic spectrum that competing users are trying to get their email or web pages over .
Count the number of earbuds on the next tube - carriage , airplane or bus you ride , multiply it by 128 kbps ( for a poor quality audio stream ) and imagine that you had to find enough wireless bandwidth to serve them all , without slowing down anyone 's competing net applications .
Someday , every 777 might come with a satellite link , but will it provide all 479 passengers with enough bandwidth to play music all the way from London to Sydney ?
What 's more , streaming requires that wireless companies be at the centre of our daily cultural lives .
These are the same wireless companies that presently screw us in every conceivable way : charging a premium for dialling an 0870 number ; having limits on " unlimited " data plans ; charging extra for " long distance " text messages .
They 're the same wireless companies whose hold - queues , deceptive multi- year contracts , surprise bills , and flaky network coverage have caused more bad days than any other modern industry .
Why would we voluntarily increase our reliance on expensive , scarce wireless bandwidth delivered by abusive thugs when we are awash in cheap , commodity storage that grows cheaper every day and which we can buy from hundreds of manufacturers and thousands of retailers ?
Especially when every streaming song creates a raft of privacy disclosures – your location , your taste , even the people who may be near you and when you 're near them – that are far more controllable when you listen to your own music collection .
Finally , there 's the cost of going along with the gag .
The more we pretend that there is a technical possibility of designing a downloader that can't save its files , the more incentive we create for legal and technological systems that attempt to make this come true .
The way you hinder a downloader from saving files is by obfuscating its design and by creating legal penalties for users who open up the programs they use and try to improve them .
You can't ever have a free / open source downloader that satisfies the desire to enforce deletion of the file on receipt , because all it would take to remove this stricture is to modify the code .
An incentive to obfuscate code , to prohibit third - party modifications and improvements , and to weld the bonnet shut on all the world 's computers wo n't actually stop downloading .
But it will have anti-competitive effects , it will reduce privacy , and it will slow down innovation , by giving incumbents the right to control new entrants into the market .
Hard problems can't be solved with technical denialism .
The market has spoken : people want to download their music ( and sometimes they want to stream it , too ) .
The supposedly for - profit record labels could offer all - you - can - download packages that captured the law - abiding downloader , and then they could retain those customers by continuing to make new , great music available .
It 's been 10 years since Napster , and the record industry 's hypothesis that an all - you - can - download regime can't work because users will download every song and then unsubscribe from the service is not borne out by evidence .
The fact is that most downloaders find cheap , low - risk music discovery to be a tremendous incentive to more consumption , as they discover new music , new artists , new songs and new genres that tickle their fancies .
Selling customers what they desire is fundamental to any successful business .
If Big Content can't figure out how to do that , then we can only pray for their hasty demise , before they can do too much more damage to humanity 's most amazing and wonderful invention : the internet .

For months , Crooks and Liars has documented an often overlooked but inescapable truth of the contentious health - care reform debate : Health care is generally worst in those red states where the Republican political leadership is most opposed to reform .
( For example , see here , here , here and here . )
Only now , after the narrow House vote this weekend , did CNN look at the Republican Senators committed to blocking health care for their residents who need it most .
Monday 's " Keeping Them Honest " segment hosted by Anderson Cooper came three days after Texas Governor Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich in a Washington Post op - ed proclaimed the Lone Star State a model for health care policy .
But as Cooper finally discovered , Texas " lawmakers voting against health care reform " happen to represent " the state with the worst number of people covered by health insurance . "
RANDI KAYE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , here 's what we found out today .
There are more uninsured in red states than there are in blue states , which is interesting since all Republican senators are expected to vote against the public health care option .
As for Texas , which leads the nation with a staggering 25 % of its population uninsured , the human toll of Republican obstructionism is devastating :
COOPER : And what about Texas ?
The state with the most uninsured , I mean --- with the most uninsured ?
KAYE : And also the children there , too , as well are also uninsured .
And if you look at the numbers for Texas , one quarter of Texas ' entire population is without health insurance .
That 's six million Texans , Anderson .
The state 's children are in really bad shape , too .
The Census Bureau says , about 1.3 million children in Texas are without health insurance which is more , actually , than 18 percent .
So if you look at those numbers , 18 percent in Texas compared to the U.S. , 10.3 percent of children in the U.S. without health insurance …
COOPER : So if -- in Texas if the rate of uninsured dropped to like the national average , what does that mean for people there ?
KAYE : It would be pretty significant , it turns out , Anderson .
If Texas could reduce its uninsured rate from 25 percent to 15 percent to match the national average , another 2.4 million people in Texas would be covered .
That 's a lot of people .
That 's a lot of people , indeed .
But the tragedy in Texas hardly ends with its swollen rolls of uninsured .
As I recently detailed , Texas ranked 46th in the Commonwealth Fund 's 2009 scorecard of state health care performance .
Among the poster children for the failure of red state health care , Rick Perry 's state brought up the rear across the five areas measured .
And when it comes to health care access and equity , Texas is dead last .
Of course , Texans have plenty of company among their red state brethren when it comes to dismal health care .
The Commonwealth Fund 's analysis tells the tale .
While nine of the top 10 performing states voted for Barack Obama in 2008 , four of the bottom five ( including Arkansas , Mississippi , Oklahoma and Louisiana ) and 14 of the last 20 backed John McCain .
( That at least is an improvement from the 2007 data , in which all 10 cellar dwellers had voted for George W. Bush three years earlier . )
Meanwhile , back in Washington , the opposition to health care reform legislation from the two Texas Senators appears to be directly proportional to their constituents ' misery .
As CNN 's Randi Kaye concluded :
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison 's people told us that she is in favor of health care reform but against the public option .
Hutchinson calls the bill the House just passed over the weekend a quote , " terrible bill that hijacks our health care system . "
The senator says she will quote , " Do everything in her power to prevent this bill and anything remotely similar to it from passing the senate . "
Instead , she says medical malpractice reform and tax credits for people who purchase insurance will lead to more affordable health insurance .
Texas ' other senator Republican Senator John Cornyn wants competition and choice .
He has said a government - run single payer system , Anderson , would drive insurers out of the market and limit competition .
Sadly for John Cornyn's mythmaking , a " government - run single payer system " is not part of the legislation either passed by the House or now in front of the Senate .
But as CNN belatedly discovered , everything – including the lies over its tattered health care system - is bigger in Texas .
Bartiromo asks some good questions , including “ are banks adequately capitalized today ? ”
“ No way ” says Whitney .
She adds : “ I do n’t know what ’s going on in the market right now ‘ cuz it makes no sense to me . ”
The fundamentals are n’t there .

Paris vidé de ses classes populaires ?
Paris gentrifié ?
Que nenni !
Invité fin novembre sur Europe 1 , le maire de la capitale , Bertrand Delanoë , vantait au contraire l’évolution de Paris : « La société parisienne change : bonjour la diversité sociale , générationnelle .
Paris avait perdu 200 000 habitants entre 1980 et 2000 .
Et aujourd ’hui … » Jean - Pierre Elkabbach le coupe :
« Et aujourd ’hui , les classes moyennes se barrent , parce que c’est trop cher !»
Riposte du maire : « Vous dites n’importe quoi .
Regardez les enquêtes de l’Insee , la dernière montre que Paris s’est rajeunit , que les familles reviennent .
Nous avons gagné 55 000 habitants . »
DESINTOX
Regardons donc la dernière enquête de l'Insee à laquelle se réfère Delanoë , qui agrège les données des deux derniers recensements ( 2006 et 1999 ) , et constatons que les choses sont un peu plus complexes .
Delanoë a raison sur la croissance de la population .
La ville , qui perdait des habitants depuis des décennies , en regagne depuis 1999 .
Le chiffre de 55 000 est exact .
Dire que cela passe par un « retour des familles » n’est pas évident .
Le solde migratoire de la ville demeure négatif , même s’il l’est de moins en moins .
Il y a davantage de gens qui quittent Paris que de gens qui y rentrent .
La croissance de la population tient au solde naturel , c'est à dire aux naissances .
Il est enfin difficile de donner raison à Delanoë concernant la diversité sociale dans une ville ou les prix de l’immobilier à l’achat ont triplé en dix ans .
Entre 1999 et 2006 , la part des cadres ou professions intellectuelles dans la population parisienne de plus de 15 ans est passé de 21,6 % à 26 % ( contre une évolution de 6,6 à 8,1 % au niveau national ) .
Même tendance pour les professions intermédiaires , qui ont crû de 14,2 à 15,1 % .
A l’inverse , la part des ouvriers baisse sur la période ( de 6,4 % à 5,3 % , pour une évolution de 14,9 % à 13,9 % pour l’ensemble du territoire ) ainsi que celle d’employés ( de 15,1 à 13,8 % , alors qu’au niveau national , cette population a augmenté de 16,6 à 16,8 % ) .

There is nothing more annoying than accidentally tapping the touchpad on the notebook while typing .
This causes the cursor to jump to a random place in the document , and before you know it , you are typing text in the middle of another sentence .
Some notebooks allow you to temporary disable the touchpad , but if your mobile companion does n't have this feature , the syndaemon utility provides a simple yet effective solution to the problem .
When activated , the utility disables the touchpad when it detects keyboard activity and enables it as soon as you stop typing .
In fact , syndaemon is much more convenient in use than a dedicated hardware switch on your notebook , as the utility enables and disables the touchpad automatically .
So even if your notebook does have a touchpad switch , you can still benefit from using syndaemon .
On Ubuntu and its derivatives , syndaemon is installed by default , so you can run it by executing the syndaemon command in the terminal .
The utility supports a few parameters .
The -d parameter starts syndaemon as a daemon in the background , while the - i parameter lets you specify the time in seconds before syndaemon kicks in and disables the touchpad ( the default value is 2 seconds ) .

Kirúgták a T - Mobile pénteki leállásán poénkodó Vodafone - os marketingest .
A Vodafone menedzsere lett a Twitter első ismert magyar áldozata .
A T - Mobile a pénteki leállása alatt nem tudott kommunikálni , így egész délelőtt fogalma sem volt az országnak arról , hogy a szolgáltató hálózatán miért csak akadozva lehet telefonálni .
A T - Mobile egy Twitter - üzenetben közölte : " A hálózati problémával kapcsolatban lesz hivatalos tájékoztatás .
Türelmeteket kérjük ! "
Frappánsan reagált erre a Vodafone hivatalos Twitterét kezelő marketinges : " OK , csörögjetek ránk ;) RT " A Vodafone először közölte , hogy nincs köze a válaszokhoz , majd később úgy értékelte , hogy a twitterező menedzser engedély nélkül és sportszerűtlenül nyilatkozott a versenytárs problémájáról : " A viselkedése ellentétes a tisztességes versennyel , és úgy ítéltük meg , hogy ezért elbocsátás jár " - mondta az Indexnek Suba János a Vodafone kommunikációs igazgatója .

No .

No one gets done with Ayn ( rhymes with " mine " ) Rand .
It is not in one 's power to do so .
That boy ( or you , or I ) can dismiss the books as a " phase " and attempt to busy ourselves with the kind of degenerate " stylists " Rand scorned ( Faulkner , Nabokov ) .
But none of us can escape the shadow of the lone straight shaft of the Taggart Building tumescing in the distance .
1 . An association bolstered by Howard Roark 's flaming orange hair .
This is because there are boys and girls among us who have never overcome the Randian infection .
The Galt speech continues to ring in their ears for years like a maddening tinnitus , turning each of them into what next year 's Physicians ' Desk Reference will ( undoubtedly ) term an _ Ayn Rand _ Asshole ( ARA ) .
They constitute a relatively small percentage of Rand readers , these ARAs .
But they make their reading count .
Thanks to them , the Rand Experience is no longer limited to those who have read the books .
It 's metastasized .
You , me , all of us , we 're living it .
Because it 's the ARA Army of antigovernment - antiregulation puritans who have spent the past three decades gleefully pulling the cooling rods out of the American economy .
For a while , it got very big and very hot .
Then it popped .
And now the rest of us have to spend the next decade scaling the slippery slopes of the huge suppurative crater that was left behind .
Feeling fisted by the Invisible Hand of the Market lo these past fifteen months ?
Lost a job lately ?
Or half the value of your 401( k ) ?
Or a home ?
All three ?
Been wondering whence the too - long - ascendant political and economic ideas and forces behind Greenspanism , John Thainism , blind Wall Street plunder , bankruptcy , credit - default swaps , Bernie Madoff , and the ensuing Cannibalism in the Streets ?
Then you , sir , need to give thanks to Ayn Rand Assholes everywhere — as well as the steely loins from which they sprang .
does that moniker " Ayn Rand Asshole " strike you as a contrivance ?
Do you disbelieve the proposition that a person could read Atlas Shrugged almost purely at the level of injunction — taking the things John Galt says and does as straight as a biblical literalist takes the eye of the needle ?
Then meet Michael Malice .
No , really .
That 's his name .
He 's a New York City author and blogger who calls himself both a genius and an " elitist anarchist . "
What 's that mean ?
It means that if a panhandler asks him for a little money or food , Malice says , " I could , but then you might live longer , so you see my dilemma . "
While setting up Eclipse on my development station in order to compare it to NetBeans I encountered the following error :
A Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) or Java Development Kit ( JDK ) must be available in order to run Eclipse .
No Java virtual machine was found after searching the following locations : c: \Program Files\Eclipse\jre\bin\javaw.exe ' javaw.exe ' in your current path
I have Java installed , and it is working properly .
It was a big pain to get working properly the first time with NetBeans so I was worried that if I tweaked it to work with Eclipse I may end up with it not working in either .
I took a peek into many of the config files for Eclipse and did n’t see an option to set the path for javaw.exe , so I made use of my Google - Fu skills and found the following solution :
Right Click Eclipse.exe and select Create Shortcut
Right Click the new shortcut and select Properties
At the end of the target path , add the parameter - vm and then the path to your javaw.exe
ie : “ C: \Program Files\eclipse\eclipse.exe ” -vm C:\Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin
and then the path to your javaw.exe ie : “ C: \Program Files\eclipse\eclipse.exe ” -vm C: \Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin
Hit
Ok , then run Eclipse from your new shortcut
Problem solved !

But are they locking the barn door after the horse - men have cantered out ?
Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadr was buried face down under rubble , blinded by shrapnel and crippled , at the time the Pentagon alleges he threw a grenade that fatally wounded a U.S. soldier , according to classified photographs and defence documents obtained by the Star .
The pictures , which were taken following a 2002 firefight in Afghanistan and have never been made public , show the then 15 - year - old Canadian covered in bricks and mud from the roof of a bombed compound .
The body of an adult fighter – the unnamed man Khadr 's lawyers contend could have thrown the grenade that killed U.S. Sgt. Christopher Speer – lies beside him .
The photographs were part of an 18 - page submission presented earlier this year by Khadr 's former military defence team to an Obama administration task force investigating Guantanamo .
While the defence 's argument that it was physically impossible for Khadr to have thrown the grenade first surfaced at a Guantanamo hearing last year , the military judge would not release the photos or declassify the written submissions .
The Pentagon is expected to announce in the next three weeks whether Khadr 's case will be transferred to a Washington , D.C. , criminal court , or go before a military commission .
The Toronto - born captive had been charged with five war crimes , including murder for Speer 's death , under the Bush administration 's Military Commissions Act .
His case was suspended when U.S. President Barack Obama took over the White House and vowed to shut Guantanamo .
But the evidence contained in the defence document raises doubts as to whether Obama 's multi-agency task force would proceed with murder charges against Khadr .
" Omar is actually innocent of the allegation , " write Khadr 's military - appointed lawyers , Cmdr. Walter Ruiz and Michel Paradis , along with his Canadian lawyers , Nathan Whitling and Dennis Edney .
" Omar suffered blinding shrapnel wounds and severe injuries to the legs during the course of a U.S. bombardment that crippled him before the attack . "
The documents note that a soldier stood on top of Khadr 's body before realizing someone was buried .
Layne Morris , one of the soldiers injured in the 2002 firefight , is frustrated at the time it has taken to decide Khadr 's fate .
In a telephone interview from Utah on Wednesday , he said he does n't personally need a trial – " I 've had closure , if that 's what you can call it . "
But he added he would be disappointed if Khadr is n't held accountable for Speer 's death .
" Whether he pulled the trigger or threw the grenade or not , I think he was part of it .
" I think there needs to be a trial so people can say , ` Here 's what happened and here 's how it turned out , ' instead of just going on in limbo forever , which it seems to be doing now . "
Morris was airlifted from the scene because of an eye wound before Khadr was captured .
His injury forced him to retire from the army .
Guantanamo's chief prosecutor , U.S. Navy Capt .
John Murphy , said in an interview with the Star on Wednesday that Obama 's task force is privy to all the classified evidence and interrogators ' notes and he remains confident Khadr will be charged with murder .
Murphy , along with prosecutor Jeff Groharing , also briefed the task force this spring .
" There is a substantial likelihood of conviction based on the evidence , " Murphy said , declining to address questions about the photographs or information that had not yet been made public .
Murphy noted that two prosecution witnesses – a female interrogator identified only as Interrogator 11 and FBI agent Robert Fuller – had already testified that Khadr confessed to throwing the grenade .
But one of the greatest challenges facing Obama 's task force in deciding these cases is whether statements made during interrogations will be discounted in court as the product of torture .
U.S. Special Forces shot Khadr twice in the back during his capture , and he was brought to the American - operated prison in Bagram , Afghanistan , in critical condition .
During the three months before his transfer to Guantanamo , he was interrogated more than 40 times for up to eight hours a day .
His chief interrogator , Joshua Claus , was later court - martialled in connection with the death of an Afghan taxi driver at Bagram .

Khadr claims that during his questioning he was threatened with dogs , hung by his wrists or put in stress positions , despite his injuries .
He also alleges he had a hood placed over his head and then soaked with water until he began to suffocate , and had LED lights shone into his eyes , injured by shrapnel .
" Though critics of the Bush administration have at times been too quick to use the word , this can only be described as torture , " his lawyers argue in their submission .
Aside from Khadr 's statements , the prosecution 's case also includes an 18 - minute video that briefly shows Khadr taping together wires for what look like improvised explosive devices , which have accounted for the deaths and maiming of hundreds of NATO fighters in Afghanistan .
The Pentagon also claims he planted land mines ( which the defence documents contend Khadr helped U.S. forces " recover without incident " ) .
Khadr 's family has also been a major factor in his case .
His father , Egyptian - born Canadian Ahmed Said Khadr , was a reputed financier for Al Qaeda and was associated with Osama bin Laden and his second in command , Ayman al Zawahiri .
He allegedly " loaned " Omar , his second youngest son , as a translator to associates within the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group in the summer of 2002 .
The Pentagon claims Omar trained with the group for a month before his capture .
Pakistani forces killed Omar 's father in October 2003 .
Prosecutors claim this evidence supports terrorism charges .
But to try Omar Khadr , the Pentagon will have to overcome issues of the Canadian 's age at the time of the alleged crimes – a concern that Radhika Coomaraswamy , the United Nations ' Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict , has reportedly stressed during recent meetings on Khadr 's case with White House officials .
While juveniles are often charged in criminal proceedings , Khadr was captured during an armed conflict , and international law stipulates that minors should be rehabilitated rather than prosecuted .
( The last prosecution of a child soldier was in the 1940s , following World War II . )
Khadr 's lawyers argued to the task force that Khadr is a perfect candidate for rehabilitation , and they note that an Ottawa parliamentary committee has already approved a plan for him that would integrate mental , spiritual and social programs – and place legal restrictions on his freedom and access to family members .
Retired U.S. Army Brig.- Gen. and psychiatrist Stephen Xenakis is likely one of the people who now knows Khadr most intimately , having spent hours talking with him at Guantanamo in the past two years as part of a court - ordered assessment .
" He 's a very decent young man , very , very decent , " Xenakis told the Star .
" Kind - hearted , thoughtful , sensitive , and you look at him and you see this kid has had a tragic experience .
" Right now we do n't talk about politics or ideological stuff .
My sense is that he disavows all of that .
" Those are early childhood experiences , ( and ) they 've been edited in his head so many different ways . "

The current health care debate in the United States is complicated .
Trade - offs between heath care expenditures , lifestyle choices and life expectancy have been suggested but seldom clearly demonstrated .
The U.S. spends on average more than $ 45,000 per year on health care for every 80 year old , while the Europeans spend $ 12,000 for the same age group .
U.S. octogenarians have a 20 percent less chance of dying than Europeans in the next year .
But , more than 30 percent of the U.S. population is obese , compared to less than 10 percent of Europe 's population .
" Many of the lifestyle choices that we make as adults have negative health consequences , " said Paul Fischbeck , professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University .
" But once we reach retirement age , it appears that differences in the medical systems start to favor the U.S. "
The costs of U.S. policy are staggering .
If the U.S. had the same per capita health expenditures for retirees as Germany or the United Kingdom , our country 's total health care costs for all citizens would be about 40 percent less .
" The differences between U.S. and Europe in health care expenditures could not be starker , " Fischbeck said .
" Starting at age 65 , per capita U.S. expenditures skyrocket , resulting in many hundreds of billions of dollars being spent over our European counterparts after matching population sizes . "
Tough health care policy decisions revolve around cost - benefit trade - offs .
A variety of factors would have to be weighed if the country shifted the emphasis from care for the elderly to polices that favor earlier preventive and lifestyle choices .
" A shift in policy could lead to more people reaching age 65 , but once there , facing a higher chance of dying , " Fischbeck said .
" In fact , if the U.S. had Germany 's death rates , we would see 150,000 more annual deaths of those over 80 . "
A new Web site , www.DeathriskRankings.com, developed by researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon allows users to explore differences in the probability of dying across European countries and U.S. states for men and women of different ages and races .

" When our risk data is coupled with health care cost estimates from other sources , surprising results are found , " Fischbeck said .
" It is only by comparing the reduction of risk associated with the additional costs that good policy choices can be made . "
The research shows that prostate cancer , which has few lifestyle risk factors , is a much greater killer in Europe .
In 11 European countries ( including Sweden , Norway , Switzerland , Denmark , Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) a man in his 70s has a higher chance of dying from prostate cancer than a man in Mississippi , the U.S. state with the highest risk .
When compared to residents of Hawaii , the U.S. state with the lowest prostate cancer risk , Europeans are two to three times more likely to die from prostrate cancer .
The tables are reversed when comparing the diabetes death risk for men in their 70s , a risk highly related to lifestyle choices and obesity .
Fifteen European countries ( including Greece , the United Kingdom , Norway , Germany and France ) have lower risks than Iowa , the U.S. state with the lowest risk .
Louisiana , the U.S. state with the highest risk , has a risk that is 10 times greater than Iceland , the lowest risk European country for diabetes .
Similar risk comparisons are possible for women .
The risks for breast cancer are lower in the U.S. For 50 - , 60 - or 70 - year - olds , four to eight European countries ( including Denmark , Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) have a higher risk of dying of breast cancer than either New Jersey or Louisiana , the two U.S. states that tie with the highest risk .
But for lung cancer , the results are opposite .
For 80 - year - old women , 14 European countries have lower lung cancer death risks than Utah , the U.S. state with the lowest risk , which also has a very low smoking rate .
In fact , 42 U.S. states have a higher lung cancer risk than Iceland , the European country with the highest risk .
Nevada , the state with the highest lung cancer risk for 80 - year - old women is eight times higher than for Spain , the European country with the lowest risk .
Where is it better to live to reach certain milestones ?
For men and women under 65 , the risks of dying before 65 are higher in the U.S.
But for men older than 56 and woman older than 75 who want to make it to 85 , the U.S. is the better location .
" When it comes to health care , there are no easy choices .
We hope that adding data to the debate will help make the final policies better , " Fischbeck said .
Book review
The best mad scientist autobiography this year , perhaps the only one , is Tony Zuppero 's To Inhabit the Solar System .
Better still , it 's free and in time for holiday reading .
It 's a long but definitely not windy 391 pages .
In it , Zuppero confirms everything - bad , weird , insane , amusing or simply astonishing - you might have always suspected about US government crazy weapons and the world of aerospace .
" Tony Zuppero , one of [ a few ] would - be nuclear rocketeers , tells those stories as he recalls them , with sometimes alarming candor , humor , and disappointment , " opined Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists after linking to the memoir on his secrecy blog .
Zuppero 's dream begins in 1968 with the scientist inspired by one of Freeman Dyson 's well - traveled crackpot ideas - that of powering a spaceship to the nearest star at one per cent of the speed of light , using atomic bombs .
( Sci - fi authors Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle famously employed one in their alien invasion novel , Footfall . )
Working for a government lab , Zuppero asks to view the classified plans , called Orion , for the Dyson space ship .
" I was scrutinizing the drawing [ of the space ship ] , " he writes .
" It showed a really dinky and clearly horribly inefficient atomic bomb propulsion device .
Nothing like what Freeman Dyson drew ...
The design seemed to be really dumb , like something one of my fraternity brothers would draw up inbetween periods of getting drunk . "
With the bloom only slightly off the rose , Zuppero visits a bunker full of thermonuclear bombs to see the basis for his dream 's propulsion .
But the bombs are way too big , he observes , and there 's no way to get three million of them on a spaceship to the stars .
Freeman Dyson should have seen the bomb room , Zuppero writes .
To continue his work on the Orion rocket , Zuppero needs it justified by attachment to weapons analyses .
A boss first asks if it 's possible to tow an unshielded nuclear reactor behind an airplane so it spews radioactivity over the Soviet Union or Vietnam .
The scientist 's mind freezes and he 's asked to analyze a different project .
Would it be possible to blow up the entire Soviet Union with a launch - to - arrival time of two minutes , so there could be no possibility of retaliation on warning ?
This would be 5000 megatons or more , something the weapons shops of the United States could actually build , even though it would be monstrously large .
The technical dilemma was how to get it there fast .
Using even more atomic bombs .
The reader immediately sees where this is going .
Impractical .
Zuppero is blunt , often humorously so , immediately describing one of his bosses as a Nazi .
The scientist is so frank because he is an " Aspie " , he explains - " Autistic , Like Mongoloids and Other Weird People " according to one subchapter .
Likening himself to Mr Spock , he concedes that he sometimes says things which are inappropriate .
In the context of the book , it is a bit of an understatement .
After this preamble , Zuppero is " fired " into a job on spy satellites , one meaningless to his undying goal , to design a rocket which can get out into the solar system .
To do this , Zuppero needs fuel and gas stations in space , and the answer to that is water .
With a nuclear - heated steam rocket , he can travel the solar system , filling up at near Earth comets .
He even provides a map of them .
This puts him in contact with more interesting people , in particular the delightfully named Crazy Roger , a colonel in the US Air Force who pays Zuppero for an analysis based on his rocket idea .
Roger was head of Timber Wind , a special Strategic Defense Initiative project to build nuclear - powered rockets .
The Federation of American Scientists uncovered Timber Wind in the early Nineties and the outcry over it - including a proposed test launch out of Vandenberg which , if it misfired , could potentially toss a nuclear reactor into New Zealand - eventually killed it .
It is retold in the chapter , " Crazy Roger 's Secret Nuclear Rocket " .
In effect , this was a flying nuclear reactor , one that some assumed would be an orbiting radioactive garbage scow , raining down waste in places with unfortunate luck .
Even though space travel of the kind dreamed about decades ago had died , To Inhabit The Solar System is perfectly suited for movie - making , possibly as art house fare .
Replete with unusual characters and characterizations , good portions of it are laugh out loud funny , sometimes unintentionally so .
One learns that being in space is a bummer , spaceships a bit like combined orbiting vomitoriums / outhouses .
" This is not sci - fi , " Zuppero tells readers right off .
Zuppero presents the reader with a collection of photos of ice moons he thinks humans could inhabit but believes " we are still the wrong species " : it 's too expensive and " we 're broke " .
In the end the dream passes him by , but he clearly had a hell of a time chasing it .
You can read To Inhabit The Solar System here ( pdf ) .
Just read a Puck Daddy interview with one of the new co-owners of the Panthers , Stu Seigal .
It is an interesting read , if you get caught up in the whole non-traditional hockey market debate .
He claims that Florida is a hockey market due to the fact that there are so many people from the north that retire there or visit there .
My favorite line is :
" We 're also a huge market for tourism , and when we have games against teams like Montreal and Toronto and New York , we have a huge number of people in our building cheering for the visiting team . "
So ... the only way a team survives in the market is by filling your building with fans of the opposite team ?
And that makes you a hockey market ?
I do n't think so .
Fill it with crazy people , willing to go shirtless and paint their faces and we can talk .
Fill it with people who know who Kovalchuk is and who he plays for .
Fill it with people who know who Getzlaf is .
Fill it with people who can name three players currently on the Panthers roster , and then maybe , just maybe , we can talk .
Fill it with people who can name an NHL player other than Alexander Ovechkin , Sidney Crosby , or Evgeni Malkin , and we can talk .
Make the jump , join the conversation , or just call me names .
Editor 's note : I am expecting an exemption for those fans that sit in the Club Level at the X .
They have about as much hockey knowledge as my 16 month - old - daughter .
I do not doubt for a second that there are some ravenous fans down there .
There are always loyal fans no matter where you put a team .
We had a team here in Minnesota a few years back , the Minnesota Fighting Pike .
They lasted a year .
It was a new sport , played in an odd way , with rules that people were unfamiliar with .
I would be willing to bet they lost a ton of money .
No one in Minnesota knew who or what they were .
I went to one game , and I was hooked .
I was ready to be a season ticket holding arena football fan .
They folded before I got the chance
So , even arena league football in Minnesota had a chance to be successful .
Not one time however , do I remember them making the case that people from Texas come to Minnesota all the time , so this team will be successful .
Now , to his credit , Seigal does admit that they have done a bad job of converting those hockey fans in the area into Panthers fans .
I am not certain how one goes about doing so .
Just because I move to Florida ( which I hope never has to happen ) does not make me want to cheer for the Panthers .
Canadian hockey fans are fiercely loyal , as are most fans from the northern US .
Again , not trying to take away from the markets in so called " non-traditional " markets that have made it work .
I got myself in a bit of hot water last season when I interviewed the writers over at Preds on the Glass .
They schooled me on the fan base in Nashville , and made many very clear , very potent arguments about the fierce loyalty they have for their Predators .
I have had conversations with many bloggers from around the NHL , and would never want to insult anyone of them , nor the team they passionately love .
I would never want to alienate our friends over at Litter Box Cats .
I know there are passionate , loyal , desperate hockey fans all over the world .
I know that there are people in Florida , maybe even in Tampa ( yes a shot at the Bolts too ) , who know who Ilya Kovalchuk is .
Now , find 17,999 more , and we can start to chat about Florida being a hockey market .
Is Florida the next Phoenix ?
I do n't know about that .
Phoenix is absolutely NOT a hockey market , and one of the most important people to my hockey writing future is a Coyotes fan .
When I went to a game in Phoenix , I was handed a pamphlet explaining the rules and game play of hockey by comparing it to basketball .
I almost pulled the guy 's jersey over his head and beat him .
Then a fan told her kid that they were entered in a drawing to ride the Zamboni , which we all know is the " machine that cleans the ice at halftime . "
Florida might be better than Phoenix for hockey , but at this point , I am really doubting it .
I know that San Jose and Anaheim have been contenders for a great period of time , and have built a fan base out of nothing .
The Predators did the same , despite not having been true contenders yet .
Dallas suffered through its lumps and has a large loyal base .
I am not trying to do another , as Ms. Conduct would call it , " Minnesota hockey fans are so much better and smarter than those southern rubes " post .
I am trying to have a conversation about this .
I am not better than any other hockey fan out there , and would love for hockey to grow some roots in Florida and Phoenix .
It just seems to me that the people in the markets that have had success are not targeting the tourist base and hoping to fill their buildings with fans wearing the wrong colors .
I am not a contractionist , and I do not want Jim Basillie in the league .
I had never heard of Hamilton , Ontario until the debate started to move a team there .
I have lived through my team being ripped away and moved , and I would never wish it on anyone .
However , Florida has never had success selling tickets .
They have not shown progress in it , either .
They are in trouble , no doubt about that .
They have new owners , who are the old owners .
The team will not change quickly , and they will not have over night success .
It will take time to build a winner from nothing , especially when the free agents do not want to stay and help build the franchise .
So .
Let 's leave the pettiness behind , let 's not accuse Florida fans of not being " real " hockey fans or make threats about taking their team away .
Let 's not pretend we are any better than them , because we are n't .
Let 's take a moment and ask the question .
" Is Florida a hockey market ? "
Or are they truly going to need to rely on the traveling fans of other teams ?
I hope we can get some input from Florida hockey fans ...

LCROSS Centaur Impact Flash
Credit : NASA , LCROSS Mission Team
Explanation :
This mid-infrared image was taken in the last minutes of the LCROSS flight mission to the Moon .
The small white spot ( enlarged in the insets ) seen within the dark shadow of lunar crater walls is the initial flash created by the impact of a spent Centaur upper stage rocket .
Traveling at 1.5 miles per second , the Centaur rocket hit the lunar surface yesterday at 11:31 UT , followed a few minutes later by the shepherding LCROSS spacecraft .
Earthbound observatories have reported capturing both impacts .
But before crashing into the lunar surface itself , the LCROSS spacecraft 's instrumentation successfully recorded close - up the details of the rocket stage impact , the resulting crater , and debris cloud .
In the coming weeks , data from the challenging mission will be used to search for signs of water in the lunar material blasted from the surface .
Hollywood 's new campaign for government permission to police the Internet for copyright theft began this month with a segment on , of all places , CBS 's Sixty Minutes .
Viewers expecting another of the shows ' self - described " hard - hitting investigative reports " watched a feature called The Movie Pirates , in which a shocked Leslie Stahl disclosed what was apparently a revelation to her — that people go into multiplexes with camcorders , record the movie , then package and sell it on the street .
" Mobsters have moved into the piracy business , and it 's bleeding Hollywood to the tune of billions of dollars a year , " Stahl warned her viewers .
The most prominent scofflaw shown in the program was an enterprising fellow from Illinois , who , to the journalists ' horror , was caught recording the flick while watching it with his family .
" He brought a child with him to do this ? "
Stahl asked the private investigator who collared the man , outrage in her voice .
But that 's not all , Sixty Minutes fans learned on November 1 .
" Even more than organized crime , it 's the Internet that has Hollywood 's hair on fire , " Stahl explained , thanks to a " gee- whiz computer technology called BitTorrent . "
An expert explained the protocol to a wide - eyed Stahl as if its one and only purpose was to let Tony Soprano steal movies .
Then came an interview with director Steven Soderbergh , who suggested that The Matrix would never be made today , thanks to the billions lost by file sharing over the ' Net .
" I 'll tell you Leslie , " Soderbergh declared in all seriousness , " there are days when I really wish Al Gore had n't invented the Internet . "
We 'll spare you the rest of the technology tutorial , but what Sixty Minutes only hinted at during the show was the extent to which the trade association that doubtless cheered this segment — the Motion Picture Association of America — is also pressing for the deployment of a wide variety of techniques to put " speed bumps " on the ' Net , as one of the program 's interviewees called them .
The piece came in the wake of a reshuffling of MPAA staff , reportedly in response to studio complaints that the group 's anti-piracy efforts have not been effective so far .
Even the group 's boss Dan Glickman is stepping down .
Real streets
Copyright theft surveillance becomes synonymous with national broadband planning , since you want to make sure Hollywood retains the incentive to keep making the movies that drive consumers to the ' Net .
The Friday before that program , MPAA sent the Federal Communications Commission a 32 - page filing submitted as part of the FCC's National Broadband Plan , which the agency must submit to Congress by mid-February .
The statement called for the Internet to be " governed by laws , standards and rules , just like the real streets and communities inhabited all across America . "
The FCC and Congress " cannot let the anonymity of the Internet become a cloak behind which people think that unlawful conduct can continue unabated , " MPAA warned .
In tandem with this came a commentary by MPAA member Paramount Pictures illustrating the extent of the problem .
Over five million copies of Paramount 's May release Star Trek have been illegally downloaded over the Internet , the company complained to the FCC .
The studio blamed just about everybody on the ' Net for the development , from ordinary users through Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft 's Bing.com — search engines that lead the public to illegal download sites .
" Today , literally anyone with an internet connection can do it , " Paramount warned — " it " being copyright theft .
" Clunky websites are being replaced by legitimate looking and legitimate feeling pirate movie websites , a perception enhanced by the presence of premium advertisers and subscription fees processed by major financial institutions . "
So what does the MPAA crowd want ?
The commentary spoke favorably of France 's new " three strikes " law , which allows a single judge to order Internet disconnections for illegal file sharers , the United Kingdom 's " Digital Britain " report , which recommends that ISPs identify and notify such users " so that they can be subjected to targeted legal action , " and Sweden 's new law requiring ISPs to reveal content infringers ' IP addresses .
But Hollywood emphasizes that it does n't advocate any of these specific measures per se .
What the studios really covet is FCC carte blanche to partner with ISPs to crack down on consumers in whatever ways they like .
The filing favorably mentioned IP address blocking , subscriber bandwidth capping , digital fingerprinting , watermarking , and hash marking as effective solutions .
MPAA wants the National Broadband Plan to recommend that " government policies [ should ] support these multiple efforts and not foreclose any particular anti-theft approach . "
By now you 're probably wondering what any of this has to do with an FCC proceeding about how to encourage greater broadband deployment and use .
Here 's the supposed link :
The studios have glommed onto the " content is king " thesis , that online movies and " other professional video content " are " key drivers of broadband adoption , " in Paramount 's words .
Thus , copyright theft surveillance becomes synonymous with national broadband planning , since you want to make sure Hollywood retains the incentive to keep making the movies that drive consumers to the ' Net .
Clogging and taxes
Aside from the fact that some scholars say the " content is king " line is bogus , that connectivity ( e- mail , voice , texting , social networking ) is what really ramps up high speed Internet use , much of what MPAA and Paramount have told the FCC is pretty seat - of - your - pants logic .
Example : MPAA 's filing contends that fighting content theft will also " substantially reduce or eliminate vast amounts of unlawful traffic that currently clogs the Internet and degrades service to law - abiding consumers . "
Illegal file sharing " undercuts broadband use and adoption , clogging already taxed network connections with illegal activity , " the trade association adds .
In fact , what this observation also suggests is that file sharing , legal and otherwise , boosts broadband adoption , although it obviously presents challenges to network management .
The question is whether MPAA 's any - argument - we - can - throw - at - the - public approach will win over Congress and , more immediately , the FCC .
The resolution of a controversy that you are far less likely to see covered by Sixty Minutes may serve as a test case here .
We need protection
Late last week , 13 public interest groups released an " action alert " warning that the FCC's Media Bureau is poised to offer the motion picture industry a waiver on " selectable output control . "
Goodness knows who Leslie Stahl would get to explain this to her , but Kyle McSlarrow , President of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association seems like a reasonable candidate .
McSlarrow 's latest blog post makes the case for FCC permission for movie studios to partner with cable companies to selectively shut down the analog cable input to HDTVs or similar home theater devices , which both industries say is more susceptible to copyright theft than digital inputs .
The FCC has banned SOC for some years , but the studios and big cable argue that this green light will allow them to offer the public pre-DVD releases of movies on a video - on - demand basis .
" High - quality content ( most movie productions take years from start to finish ) is expensive to create and content owners rightly need adequate protection against indiscriminate and unauthorized distribution of their content to take this next step , " McSlarrow warns .
" While content producers already make some less expensive independent movies available to cable at the same time they are in theaters , it 's clear that major studios will not release their blockbuster films early unless we can guarantee proper protection . "
McSlarrow dismisses the concerns of Public Knowledge , the Consumer Electronics Association , the Home Recording Rights Coalition , and Ars Technica ( which has reported their arguments sympathetically ) that closing down analog inputs would leave some home theater owners without access to this new service , forcing them to buy new equipment .
But , in fact , the MPAA in one of its recent FCC filings acknowledged this as well , even while casting doubt on Public Knowledge 's estimate of 11 million consumers affected by the change :
" Even if accurate , the Public Knowledge figure is vastly overinclusive because it counts homes where consumers do have at least one television set with protected digital inputs ( even though they also may have older sets in other rooms in the house ) .
In fact , the vast majority of consumers would not have to purchase new devices to receive the new , high - value content contemplated by MPAA ’s waiver request . "
So the debate is not really about whether consumers would impacted by an SOC waiver , but how many , and if that would be in the public interest .
To these questions MPAA brings flimsy historical analogies , such as this : " Under Public Knowledge ’s approach , the Commission would have taken decades to permit television stations to broadcast in color , " the organization told the FCC this month , " since millions of American homes already had purchased black - and - white sets when color broadcasts were introduced in the 1950s . "
The problem with this comparison , of course , is that even with the rise of color broadcasts , black - and - white TV owners could still actually view the programs ( this writer resentfully watched color TV in black - and - white throughout his Wonder Bread years ) .
Sure does
We contacted both the FCC and the MPAA to find out whether the Commission is , in fact , poised to give the FCC the go - ahead on SOC .
The FCC did n't return our call ; MPAA sent us the comments we 've already written about here .
But it seems likely that if the agency does grant the waiver — especially without offering a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or conducting any independent investigation — the action will be interpreted in some quarters as a nod not only towards Hollywood 's VoD goals , but towards its designs on the Internet overall .
The decision could also weaken support for the Commission 's proposal to toughen its net neutrality rules , especially among FCC watchers already worried that enhanced authority could eventually be used to expand copyright surveillance as well .
All this is playing out beyond the earshot of a public that is largely mystified by these subjects — which is why that Sixty Minutes segment was so important .
During the feature Stahl marveled at the demonstration of BitTorrent that she received from former Justice Department Attorney John Malcolm .
" And when we get that complete movie , the technology will rearrange all those little pieces into one complete film that is watchable , " he explained .
" There 's a technology that automatically puts it in the right order ? ? " an amazed Stahl asked .
" Sure does , " Malcolm replied .
What was n't mentioned , of course , was a crucial detail — that the entire Internet works that way , its packet switching system breaking down the data sent by every protocol , from BitTorrent to hypertext to standard mail transfer ( e- mail ) , and reassembling it at the end user point .
And that 's why giving Hollywood and the cable ISPs the right to unfettered surveillance has implications for a lot more than whether the next Matrix gets produced .
Hopefully the public will figure that out before the fact , not afterward .
Start placing your bets folks , 'cause it now looks like its almost certainly no longer a question " if " the Palm Pixi will drop to a free - on - contract price , but " when ? "
The latest stop on the saga is none other than Amazon , which is now offering the webOS - based phone for a mere $ 24.99 with a service plan , beating Walmart 's already bargain price by a full five dollars -- which should be just enough to let you buy a second Pixi next month at the rate things are going .

Interesting Observations and Worthwhile Advice ( From E-mails , and Random Thoughts )
Kamui Kobayashi was set to land a full - time drive for Toyota after impressing
Toyota has confirmed that it is pulling out of Formula 1 racing after posting its worst financial loss .
The world 's largest car manufacturer will concentrate on its core business .
Toyota president Akio Toyoda said the Japanese team had no option but to pull out citing " the current severe economic realities " affecting the world .
The team failed to win any of the 139 races it entered after making its F1 debut in 2002 but was fifth in the 2009 constructors ' championship .
Toyota 's withdrawal leaves the sport with no Japanese team after Honda left F1 at the start of the 2009 season .
They become the third manufacturer to quit the sport in the last 11 months after BMW announced it was leaving in July .
Honda were replaced by Brawn , who went on to win this year 's drivers ' championship with Jenson Button and the constructors ' championship .
Button told BBC Sport : " It 's sad .
I thought Toyota would continue .
" They 've obviously got their reasons , as Honda did , but it 's a pity for F1 and for Toyota .
Hopefully we can survive without them . "
In May the company revealed its worst set of figures for the last financial year - a 436.9bn yen ( £ 2.9bn ) loss in the year to 31 March , 2009 and is expecting further losses when it posts its results to September 2009 on Thursday .
" It was a tough decision because we are betraying the expectations of fans , " Toyoda , a racing enthusiast and grandson of Toyota 's founder , added .
" I apologise to our fans from the bottom of my heart .
I made the decision myself . "
He also ruled out supplying engines to other teams , saying : " In terms of Formula 1 , we will make a complete withdrawal . "
Williams announced last month that it would be replacing its Toyota engine with a Cosworth for next season .
We hope very much that Toyota will return to the world 's most technologically - advanced racing competition in the not too distant future
The Formula One Teams Association F1 governing body the FIA issued a statement in which they revealed their concern at the withdrawals of Toyota and tyre firm Bridgestone .
" Toyota 's decision comes just weeks after its F1 team signed the new Concorde Agreement until 2012 , " the statement read .
" Urgent clarification is now being sought from the Toyota F1 team as to its legal position in relation to the championship .
This will have a direct bearing on the admission of any future 13th entry .
" The FIA has repeatedly warned that motor sport cannot outpace the world economic crisis .
That is why the competing teams have been asked to cut costs and the entry of independent teams has been encouraged .
" The FIA accepted the cost - reduction measures put forward by the teams on the basis that they would ensure a long - term commitment to the championship .

" Toyota 's announcement demonstrates the importance of the original cost - reduction measures set out by the FIA .
" The FIA will now work to ensure that Toyota 's departure is managed in the best interests of the championship and will continue to encourage the F1 teams to undertake the necessary cost - cutting measures for the good of the sport . "
Former team owner and BBC pundit Eddie Jordan told BBC Sport : " I 'm really disappointed that Toyota have decided to pull out .
" When fellow Honda withdrew last December the team continued as Brawn Grand Prix and the rest is history .
" I hope Toyota will leave the sport with the same dignity and allow the team to continue in a new guise .
" Toyota signed a new Concorde Agreement in the summer committing them to F1 until 2012 and so it could be possible for the team to continue in another form if the rest of the grid allow it . "

Cologne - based Toyota F1 's demise could pave the way for Sauber to return , after Swiss - based Qadbak Investments stepped in in September following BMW 's withdrawal from the BMW Sauber team .
At the time , the FIA gave Sauber " 14th place " for next season , meaning they were first reserve to fill any vacancy .
Toyota 's season promised much after long - term driver Jarno Trulli finished third in the opening race of the season in Australia and followed that with another third in Bahrain , after starting race four from pole position .
His team - mate Timo Glock also stood on the podium after finishing third in the rain - affected second race of the season in Malaysia .
But neither driver would reach the podium again until race 14 when Glock finished second behind Britain 's Lewis Hamilton in Singapore , equalling the team 's best finish to a race .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG Toyota never really seemed to have worked out what was required to succeed in F1
One week later , in early October , Trulli also came second at the Japanese grand prix at Suzuka .
Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi joined Trulli , who finished the season eighth in the standings , for the final two races of the season after Glock , who came 10th , was injured .
Trulli is tipped to join Lotus while Glock is expected to move to Renault later this week but Kobayashi 's future is less clear .
Germany 's Ralf Schumacher , France 's Olivier Panis and Britain 's Allan McNish have also all driven for Toyota over the years .
In July Toyota pulled out of hosting the Japanese Grand Prix at its home Fuji Speedway circuit from next year .
Fellow Japanese companies Subaru and Suzuki withdrew from the World Rally Championship prior to this season while Kawasaki pulled out of MotoGP .

Former DNC chairman Howard Dean was on NBC’s Meet The Press today talking about the compromise healthcare bill .
Dean finally answered the Republicans who have been twisting his words on healthcare , specifically John McCain .
He accused McCain of using his words for something that he has no intention of endorsing .
Here is the video :

Earlier this week McCain said about Dean , “ If you live long enough , all things can happen .
I now find myself in complete agreement with Dr. Howard Dean , who says that we should stop this bill in its tracks .
We should go back to the beginning and have an overall bipartisan agreement .
Dr. Dean , I am with you . ”
Dean replied , “ I , I think , you know , the Republicans ’ behavior has been reprehensible .
They have n’t lifted a finger .
All their , their–they , they have really put their party in front of their country here .
You know , they could have made this bill a better bill , but they choose just to kill the bill because they thought they did do that for political reasons .
First–and I do n’t believe there ’s a bipartisan compromise possible . ”
He continued , “ As David Axelrod said , the Republicans of today and the John McCain of today is not the same–not even the same as the Republican Party of eight years ago , and it certainly is n’t the same as the Republican Party my father was in until the day he died .
So it –you know , I respect John McCain , but it ’s , he would n’t be the first person who twisted my words around and used them for something I had no intention of endorsing , which is the Republicans ’ behavior in this bill . ”
The Republicans have been warping Dean ’s criticisms of the healthcare bill for a week now .
They have been trying to muddle the debate in a desperate last ditch attempt to stop the bill .
I only wish that Dean would have came out sooner and knocked down these obvious distortions .
Dean is correct today ’s GOP and John McCain are not the same as they were eight years ago .
The Republican Party is now being driven by a far right ideology , and McCain the maverick has been replaced by McCain the pandering parrot .
Republicans are unable to understand that criticism of the healthcare bill does not equal agreement with their position .
Palestinian schoolgirls ( right ) in Hebron walk across rough ground to avoid Israeli settlers ( left ) blocking their route .
( CPT )
AL
TUWANI
IPS
“ It is really scary walking to school .
We never know when the settlers will attack us and beat us , ” said Rima Ali , 10 , from the village of Tuba in the southern West Bank , about two hours drive south of Jerusalem .
“ Every day we have to watch out that the settlers are not in the valley ahead of us and if we see them we run away , ” Ali told IPS .
Ali still bears the scar from when a settler pushed her causing her to fall to the ground and cut herself below the eye .
Hundreds of Palestinian children in Tuba and the surrounding Palestinian villages face the same daily predicament as they try to reach school in the Bedouin village of al - Tuwani .
Situated on a hilltop overlooking al - Tuwani are the Israeli settlement of Maon and the extended settlement outpost of Havot Maon .
The only road which previously connected Palestinians to neighboring villages and to the nearby Palestinian town of Yatta — a 10 - minute drive away — has been appropriated for the exclusive use of settlers .
Palestinians are banned from driving on it .
The villagers are now forced to take off - road dirt tracks , which circumvent the settlers - only bypass road and the settlements .
If they walk the route it takes approximately an hour on foot — assuming they do n’t have small children with them .
Settler attacks — including arson attacks on agricultural fields , chopping down olive trees , poisoning water wells , killing livestock and assaulting Palestinian villagers living near settlements — have become a way of life for Palestinians all over the West Bank as the Israeli authorities continue to turn a blind eye .
But the repeated attacks on schoolchildren forced a group of international Christian peace activists from Christian Peacemaker Teams ( CPT ) to establish school escorts for the children in a bid to try and protect them .
Furthermore , the Israeli Knesset , or parliament , was forced to intervene several years ago after several foreign citizens escorting children were attacked by chain and baseball - wielding settlers .
Two CPT members were hospitalized after they suffered injuries including a punctured lung , a broken arm and a fractured skull .
The Israeli military was ordered to provide daily military escorts for children from various towns and villages in the southern West Bank .
However , the children and the peace activists have complained that the military escorts are often unreliable and sometimes a source of hostility toward the children themselves , as many of the soldiers are sympathetic to the settlers .
And while the number and severity of attacks have dropped they have not stopped .
Last week a young Palestinian couple , with three children under the age of three , was trying to make its way home to Tuba after visiting Yatta .
They family was warned by two members of the CPT that a group of settlers had been spotted on the ridge above earlier in the day and that it would be safer for them to take the longest route home to avoid a confrontation .
“ We decided to accompany the family in case there was any trouble .
Despite taking the longer route a group of five settler men rushed towards us from the valley above and attacked the father who had a toddler in his arms , ” American CPT member Sarah MacDonald told IPS .
MacDonald and another CPT member , Laura Ciaghi from Italy , were videotaping events in case they needed to go to the police .
“ I decided to try and engage the settlers to try and protect the family , ” Ciaghi told IPS .
Ciaghi was thrown to the ground and repeatedly kicked in the ribs and back as the men stole both video cameras from the women .
“ Because the settlers focused their attention on us the Palestinian family was able to get home safely and so we feel we achieved some kind of victory , ” added Ciaghi .
Ciaghi was badly bruised , required a stitch to her scalp and had contusions on her head .
The Israeli police and army were called to investigate but , with the exception of a couple of individuals , most of them appeared to be disinterested and no thorough investigation was carried out .
This does not surprise Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din , which monitors human rights abuses against Palestinians in the West Bank and acts as an intermediary between Palestinian victims and the Israeli security forces .
In order to file complaints Palestinians need to go to police stations which are located in the illegal Israeli settlements .
However , the catch - 22 is that they are not permitted to enter the settlements and this is where Yesh Din steps in .
“ The police often ‘ lose the paperwork ’ or are ‘ unable to identify perpetrators ’ of attacks against Palestinians , ” Yesh Din director Lior Yavne told IPS .
“ And of the few cases opened , less than 10 percent result in any conviction , ” Yavne added .
“ This situation is completely different from when Palestinian attacks on Israeli settlers are investigated . ”
Meanwhile , despite the Israeli government calling for the demolition of Havot Maon over two years ago , on the grounds it was built illegally according to Israeli law , the outpost continues to expand and the settlers living there continue to attack Palestinians .
In the interim , Israel is carrying out a massive campaign of Palestinian home demolitions as settlements all over the West Bank expand at an unprecedented rate .

As Andrew Sullivan noted , the Quittah from Wasilla used this week 's anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to invent a new myth about how the United States paid for the war which followed it .
Palin wrote this December 7 :
The attack on Pearl Harbor launched America into the Second World War , and our Greatest Generation did not hesitate when asked to sacrifice for their country .
American men enlisted in droves , American women went to work in the factories that became our " Arsenal of Democracy , " and many Americans gave what little money they had to buy the war bonds that funded it all .
Of course , in reality Americans funded the war through massive debt and massive tax increases .
As NPR recalled in August , Americans starting in 1942 began paying dramatically higher taxes , with the richest paying the most of all :
During World War II , tax rates for the wealthy soared as high as 94 percent .
But poor and middle - class families also paid taxes at rates substantially higher than today's .
Despite those high taxes , the vast majority of Americans surveyed by Gallup back then said the taxes they paid were fair .
Just two weeks ago , former Reagan Treasury Department economist Bruce Bartlett quantified those war time taxes and how that vast new burden was shared across the Greatest Generation :
During World War II , federal revenues roughly tripled as a share of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) and the number of people paying income taxes expanded tenfold , from 3 % of the population in 1939 to 30 % by 1943 .
In 1940 , a family of four needed close to $ 80,000 of income in today 's dollars before it paid any federal income taxes at all .
By the war 's end , it saw its effective tax rate rise from 1.5 % to 15.1 % .
( Today such a family only pays a federal income tax rate of about 6 % . )
But taxes were n't the only way the war was paid for .
Spending on nondefense programs was cut almost in half , from 8.1 % of GDP in 1940 to 4.4 % in 1945 .
While loopholes and other provisions of the IRS code enabled the wealthy to pay lower effective tax bills , the top marginal rate remained above 70 % until 1981 .
Nonetheless , as Bartlett noted , new taxes were enacted to fund the smaller conflicts in Korea and Vietnam :
Even during wars closer in magnitude to those in which we are presently engaged , significant sacrifices were made .
In 1950 and 1951 Congress increased taxes by close to 4 % of GDP to pay for the Korean War , even though the high World War II tax rates were still largely in effect .
In 1968 , a 10 % surtax was imposed to pay for the Vietnam War , which raised revenue by about 1 % of GDP .
And there was conscription during both wars , which can be viewed as a kind of tax that was largely paid by the poor and middle class -- young men from wealthy families largely escaped its effects through college deferments .
If that image of " young men from wealthy families largely escaped its effects through college deferments " conjures up memories of the chickenhawks of the Bush administration , it should .
As it turns out , the same men who generally avoided military service in Vietnam later refused to pay for the war in Afghanistan or their unnecessary invasion of Iraq .
The contrast between war presidents George W. Bush and FDR could not greater .
And to be sure , as Bartlett again highlighted , Bush 's refusal to pay for his wars is an exception to the rule of American history :
In recent years , Republicans have been characterized by two principal positions :
They like starting wars and do n't like paying for them .
George W. Bush initiated two major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , but adamantly refused to pay for either of them by cutting non-military spending or raising taxes .
Indeed , at his behest , Congress actually cut taxes and established a massive new entitlement program , Medicare Part D .
The result , of course , was an ocean of red ink .
After Ronald Reagan tripled the national debt , George W. Bush and his Republican allies in Congress doubled it again .
For his part , President Obama in his speech at the Brookings Institution Tuesday made certain to point out the Republicans ' short memories :
" Folks passed tax cuts and expansive entitlement programs without paying for any of it -- even as health care costs kept rising , year after year .
As a result , the deficit had reached $ 1.3 trillion when we walked into the White House .
And I 'd note :
These budget - busting tax cuts and spending programs were approved by many of the same people who are now waxing political about fiscal responsibility , while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by getting health care costs under control .
It 's a sight to see . "
At the end of the day , proposals by some Democrats for a new Afghanistan war surtax are designed more to register their opposition to Obama 's escalation there than to pay for it .
( Of course , Mitch McConnell 's call to fund the U.S. troop surge there from economic recovery funds is just a cynical ploy to highlight Republican opposition to the stimulus . )
Ultimately , after the U.S. economy recovers , Americans will have to begin paying higher taxes , starting with the elimination of most or all of the reckless Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 that never should have been passed during wartime and which are in large measure responsible for the mushrooming budget deficits he bequeathed to his successor .
As for Sarah Palin , she turned to Facebook on November 24 to announce the equivalent of " read my lips , no new war taxes " :
With Congress and President Obama spending money on everything at breakneck speed , it 's interesting that they are only now getting nervous about spending - but only when it comes to providing the necessary funds to complete our mission in Afghanistan .
They do n't need a new " war tax " to fund a strategy for victory in the war zone .
They simply need to prioritize our money appropriately .
Because , only in Sarah Land , that 's what the Greatest Generation did .

In sleepy Sussex is a group of dedicated cryonicists who believe they hold the secret to eternal life .
Simon Hattenstone joins them for a demonstration – but first they need to make sure the hosepipe is n't too leaky
In a bungalow in Peacehaven , by the east Sussex seaside , a 72 - year - old man and his 62 - year - old wife are planning their future .
There 's no discussion of anything morbid , like death , because , as far as they are concerned there is no such thing as death .
When they stop breathing , they will pass into a state of suspended animation .
They will be frozen in a giant flask of liquid nitrogen at almost - 200C , which will preserve their brains and organs in as fresh a state as possible until technology has advanced to the stage where they can be revived .
Many cryonicists choose to have only their heads frozen – because that contains all the vital matter – and by the time people can be brought back to life it will be easier , and preferable for some , to attach a new body .
But Alan and Sylvia Sinclair will have their whole bodies frozen .
For Alan , who used to run a rest home for the elderly with Sylvia , it all started with the death of Queen Mary in 1953 .
" I was aware from a very young age that life is very short .
It occurred to me that no matter what you 've got , you 're still going to die .
I remember thinking , ' I enjoy things : why does anybody want to die ? ' " He looks at me .
" Do you ? "
Has he never thought there comes a right time to go ?
" No , I 'm always too busy .
In the rest home there were people who were quite happy to go to sleep and not wake up .
I could n't understand that . "
Some 30 years later , when he was 45 , he watched a Miriam Stoppard TV programme on cryonics and within days he had joined up .
Sylvia says everybody thinks she just followed suit , but no .
" I thought about it for another couple of weeks before I made my mind up . "
Alan now runs Cryonics UK , and every month he holds meetings with fellow cryonicists and potential converts to discuss the practicalities and potential problems of their suspension – of which there are many .
First , upon so - called " death " , a team of experts must rush to their sides , pump out their blood and fill them with antifreeze .
This is complicated because virtually all the members of Alan 's suspension team at Cryonics UK have practised only on dummies , rather than real people – and if , for example , air bubbles enter the pumping system , the brain will be irreversibly damaged .
Second , there are no storage facilities in Britain , so patients will have to be transferred to the US or Russia .
Third , science has some way to go before we can bring people back to life .
But Alan has always been an optimist .
He knows the situation is far from perfect , but he is doing his bit for eternal happiness .
Parked outside the bungalow is an old ambulance , customised with suspension equipment .
It 's surprisingly archaic – basically a suitcase with a load of tubing inside , reminiscent of an old - fashioned wine - making kit .
Alan credits himself with devising the slogan , " Ambulance to the future . "
In the lounge , a dozen people are listening to Alan run through the weekend 's agenda .
Alan is the oldest ; Dave , at 24 , is the youngest .
His girlfriend , who is only 20 , can not be here .
" She was going to join us from the Wirral , but ironically a death in the family has stopped her , " he says , sounding remarkably chipper about the setback .
There is jukebox in room , though Alan and Sylvia have yet to buy records to play on it , and scattered around the room are clocks of all ages and designs , each telling a different time .
Most of the people wear a silver bracelet , saying they are paid - up cryonicists and that when they stop breathing they expect to be frozen in the agreed manner .
Some also wear tags around their necks .
Alan , who looks much younger than his 72 years , speaks in a meandering monotone , while Sylvia makes tea .
" Sylvia is going to put arsenic in our tea . "
It 's an ongoing joke , and one that gets to the nub of their problem .
The cryonicists are not dying quickly enough , so the opportunity to hone their skills is limited .
Alan says he once carried out a suspension , but he does n't look back at it with pride – it did n't go as smoothly as it might have .
Another man in the room , an ageing hippy called Tim with a thinning ponytail and a philosophical bent , says he has carried out three suspensions – one , in Britain , just involved shipping the body to America , while in the US he was part of a team that performed the cryonics Full Monty , from collection to pumping , decapitation and storage .
The others have no on - the - job experience .
Danielle , a middle - aged woman from Wales , says she can't stay the whole weekend because she 's due back home tonight to sing in Aberystwyth .
She 's not quite a professional , but is proud of her voice .
" That 's why I want the full - body thing , cos I do n't think I 'll get a larynx as good as this . "
It was Benjamin Franklin who first suggested , in 1773 , that it might be possible to preserve human life in a suspended state for centuries .
And that was that for close on 200 years , until physics lecturer Robert Ettinger published The Prospect Of Immortality in 1962 , in which he argued that , since we keep food fresh by freezing it , we can do the same with the human body until such time as we have discovered how to defeat death .
The term " cryonics " , derived from the Greek kryos , meaning cold , was coined in 1965 when Karl Werner founded the Cryonics Society of New York , and the premise is that memory , personality and identity are stored in cellular structures , principally in the brain .
So , if you can preserve the brain in decent nick , technology permitting , you can eventually restore people with their personalities intact .
The cost varies from $ 28,000 for head - only preservation to $ 155,000 for full body .
The largest cryonics organisation , with more than 800 members waiting to be preserved , is the US company Alcor .
It was established in 1972 and has frozen 87 patients .
The Cryonics Institute , also American , and founded by Ettinger in 1976 , has frozen 95 .
The two groups are rivals .
When men walked on the moon at the end of the 60s , eternity did not seem such a huge leap for mankind .
But progress has not quite kept up with our dreams .
Back in Peacehaven , Tim asks Alan how he has been .
" Fine , " he says .
Then he pauses and says that 's not quite true .
" Well , not so fine , actually .
I almost went the other day .
My heart rate went up to 230 – I thought that was it .
I was exercising , just walking on the machine , and it went ... "
He says this with a peculiar mix of panic and excitement .

The plan for this weekend is to make a cool - down box for the newly ( temporarily ) deceased .
Alan can get impatient with members who say it's all too complicated , and there 's too much to remember .
In the end , he says , it 's just a basic plumbing process – out with the blood , in with the antifreeze .
" I do n't mean to be rude , but I try everything out on Sylvia , and if she can do it , ­ anybody can . "
Fortunately , Sylvia is in the kitchen making another cup of tea .
Even more important than the ice box is this weekend 's star guest , Mike Darwin .
He is yet to arrive , and Alan briefs the gathered few with a mixture of awe and dread .
Darwin was born Michael Federowicz in Indianapolis , Indiana .
He worked as a dialysis technician and adopted the name Darwin for his cryonics persona .
At the age of 17 , he carried out his first suspension for the Cryonics Society of New York at the request of Saul Kent , another significant figure in the cryonics world .
In the 80s he went on to become president of Alcor , but was dismissed in controversial circumstances .
Sinclair says Darwin is probably the world 's leading cryonics authority .
But the news is not all good .
" He 's well worth listening to unless he's in a depressive state – then it all becomes a bit pointless . "
A few minutes later a man enters the room .
He bears a disarming resemblance to the infamous prisoner Charles Bronson – shaved head , beard , sweat pouring off him , muscular , starey eyes .
It can only be Darwin .
Alan tells him he did n't recognise him .
" That 's because I 've lost 56 pounds since you last saw me , " Darwin says .
He sits down .
It 's a hot day , and his shirt is soaking .
Within minutes he is arguing with Sinclair and his followers , making it emphatically clear that he is unimpressed with their Dad's Army approach to eternity .
Darwin has spent decades suspending dogs , rabbits and humans , and he can't see how such an inexperienced , higgledy - piggledy group can hope to succeed .
" The approach has to be widespread , aggressive .
We have to be as rich and as big as Scientology .
We must have that level of commitment . "
He stops .
" Maybe that 's not the best example . "
The thing is , he says , he knows the demand is there , if they can only get the technology right .
He tells a story about post - Soviet Russia , where he is working with a new cryonics group , KrioRus .
As he does so the sweat pours through his shirt until it is the dry patches that stand out .
" Eighteen years ago , you wake up and there 's no health service , no social security , no scouts , no government , no benefits , no retirement benefit and no God .
The whole belief system goes – that 's what happened in Russia .
And yet people were asked , ' Would you want to live for ever ? ' , and 20 % of the population say yes , they want to live for ever , under any conditions . "
His eyes get bluer and bluer until they turn green .
Darwin does not simply proselytise for cryonics , he proselytises for cryonics as big business .
But , he says , you 're not going to get anywhere until you start giving it the time and expertise it needs .
" In America , we did n't do it until we started regular animal experiments .
You need to establish a teaching and training environment .
Read the book The Knife Man , about John Hunter , one of the greatest men in your country .
The greatest surgeon in London , and they would n't even let him lecture in the official facilities .
He had to build his own building in his home to teach his students . "
Darwin feels he has much in common with Hunter , a prophet without honour .
" He created disciples , students who went all over the world and took what he taught them .
That 's what we were trying to do ; establish an environment to create a self - perpetuating professionalism . "
" That 's what we 're trying to create , " Alan protests .
" No , " Darwin says .
" No , no you did n't and you could n't for several reasons .
One , you could n't do the animal experiments – the culture here prohibits it .
I 'm sorry to highlight disagreements , but this is where we are at .
The key to a stable cryonics organisation is to store patients .
The instant you do that , people take you serious , because you have taken on the commitment to care for people for a long , long time .
The men from the boys are quickly separated at that point .
Two - thirds of the people who were on my suspension team in the 70s and 80s are now on liquid nitrogen – people I laughed with , had dinner with , shared personal animosity with , shared great triumphs with , shared personal friendships with .
That is what really holds the group together , and it becomes a tangible place that people can show and go to . "
" I always intended to do storage , " Alan says , " but I thought I was too old . "
Darwin gets a " gotcha " glint in his eye .
" Alan , you 've just given the reason why it did n't happen .
You were the principal person people looked to here for leadership , and when you said , ' I do n't want to be stored here ' , that was a no - confidence buster for everybody else . "
Silence .
Darwin : " I want to advance my field – cryonics . "
Alan : " So do we all , but we can't work full - time on it . "
Darwin : " With no experience , you will fuck that patient up .
Every time .
Not just once .
Every time .
Get training and practise . "
That , Darwin says , is the key to progress .
" The teaching environment was wrecked by Jerry 's arrest , then they got rid of me , and then they got rid of everyone systematically . "
Nobody blinks when he mentions the arrest .
Alan : " What practice can we do ? "
Darwin sets them a challenge : " Do a really honest demonstration , with pre-set goals , and see how many mistakes you make . "
The cryonicists break for lunch .
The morning session has been heavier than even Sinclair expected .
Sylvia has ordered in fish and chips for everybody .
A good bit of stodge restores calm .
I ask Sinclair about the arrest that Darwin had mentioned .
" Ah that , " he says .
It 's an old story .
Jerry Leaf , a cardiothoracic surgery researcher , was vice - president of Alcor and Darwin 's partner .
Between them they invented a blood substitute capable of sustaining life in dogs for four hours at near - freezing temperatures .
" Jerry 's arrest ... totally bloody ridiculous .
He had suspended a woman .
She was 97 years of age , she had senility , they moved her from the nursing home to the facility and she died there .
Anyway , the police came in and tried to arrest them all for trying to hide her .
There was a great big court case . "
What was reported as " the strange case of the frozen head " in the Los Angeles Times occurred in 1987 , following the death of Dora Kent , the mother of Alcor benefactor Saul Kent .
Dora Kent , who was actually 83 , was moved from a convalescent home to Alcor by her son .
Alcor officials told police she had died a natural death and only then was her head surgically removed by Leaf .
After Alcor applied for a permit to cremate Kent 's headless body , the Riverside County coroner 's office launched an investigation , noting that she was not under a doctor 's care at the time of her death .
Investigators sought the right to defrost and examine Kent 's head , but a Superior Court judge ruled that this would be an unconstitutional infringement on a person 's right to choose how to dispose of his or her remains .
The coroner , Raymond Carillo , ruled that tests on Kent 's body tissues revealed her death was a homicide , resulting from a lethal dose of a barbiturate .
Alcor officials admitted that she had been given the drug Nembutal , but insisted it was used after her death to help preserve brain cells .
Leaf was arrested , but in 1990 , after three years , the investigation was closed due to lack of evidence .
When Alcor was cleared , Darwin told the Los Angeles Times : " This was a terrible injustice and it has meant three years of fear and anxiety for us .
Any time you are accused of grand theft , homicide and other untruths , it is damaging to you both personally and professionally . "
A year later , Leaf died following a heart attack and was cryonically suspended by the Alcor team led by Darwin .
In 1992 , Darwin left Alcor for undisclosed reasons .
Today , he is a freelance cryonicist working with the Russian organisation KrioRus .
Mark , Tim and David are sitting at a table eating their fish and chips .
All wear their bracelets and are fully paid - up cryonicists – though it emerges that they are paying very different prices .
David pays £ 6 a month for life insurance , and he will be suspended by the Cryonics Institute , a not - for - profit organisation located in Michigan , US .
Mark looks flabbergasted .
" I 'm curious to why you 're only paying £ 6 a month .
Mine 's a lot more than that . "
He looks at him , and suddenly he understands .
" Oh , you 're quite young .
I 'm 45 . "
They are still recovering from Darwin 's assault on their amateurishness .
All three think he was too negative .
" It made me angry that someone significant in cryonics was prepared to sit there and say , ' You ca n't do it because that 's not what cryonics people do , ' " Tim says .
" They say we 'll have to make it work .
It did n't make sense to me . "
" It 's not just negativity , it 's perfectionism , " Mark says .
" But perfect is never achieved . "
We talk about the type of people who are attracted to cryonics .
All three agree they are likely to be men , often with an interest in science and an underlying optimism .
Mark , a software engineer , says , " There are quite a few software or IT people involved .
Software engineers tend to think too much and go outside the normal boundaries of the general population because they spend all their time abstracting about things . "
Why do they want to live for ever ?
Tim says the first time he thought about it was when he heard that Walt Disney had been frozen .
It turned out not to be true , but he could n't get the thought out of his head .
" It started when I was six and I realised it was a rubbish idea to be dead .
I was frightened of death .
Basically , I started to think of ways to solve it . "
" It 's not fear in my case , " Mark says .
" I was interested as a kid in time travel and time travel is technically not possible , so this is the best solution . "
David , a care officer for adults with physical and mental disabilities , says dying is for the defeatist .
" I realised that if I lost my life , I 'd lose everything I 'd ever achieved , loved , enjoyed .
It would be as if I never lived , because from the cessation of life there is nothing more . "
How would they like the world to have changed when they return ?
" It would be nice to come back and have a proper democracy , " Mark says .
David 's having none of that liberal nonsense .
" My opinion is , there 's been no real democracy since the Greek city state of Athens , and if there were real democracy there would be a problem because mob rule is n't the way forward .
We 're living on a planet with six billion suicidal maniacs .
Do I really want to trust everything to their vote ? "
The six billion maniacs to whom he is referring are the world 's non-cryonicists , who have accepted death as an inevitability .
Mark : " You sound a bit paranoid to me . "
David : " I am paranoid – about my personal security .
I'm the kind of person who will tend to listen to exit instructions on a plane .
When I 'm sat in a room , I do n't sit with my back to the door ... "
Why ?
" Because I want to keep myself alive at all costs . "
I ask if they have read Gulliver 's Travels , the novel in which Jonathan Swift imagines a group of immortals called Struldbrugs , who continue to age and are hated by the rest of the population because they are so ugly , useless and parasitical .
What if life were like that for them when they came back ?
David says that 's not even worth considering .
" If geneticists like Aubrey de Grey get their way , ageing wo n't be an issue .
But even if it were an issue , personally I 'd rather be ugly and hated than dead . "
Most of David 's nearest and dearest are cryonicists and that creates a special bond .
" I think it 's more of a meaningful long - term relationship dynamic if somebody 's planning to live for ever than die in a few short decades .
I 'm more into that kind of relationship . "
Ultimately , it 's a sense of duty that drives him on towards immortality .
" Cryonics is a potentially life - saving medical treatment , so to not get cryonics is to have passive euthanasia and I 'm not suicidal . "
Tim says a strange thing happened to him recently – he suffered a crisis of cryonics conscience .
" I knew it was going to happen and I was a bit annoyed when it did .
But once you have a family you think , ' I 'm supposed to die .
That 's the way it works . '
When you 're a single person you 're self - obsessed , you want to live for ever , and that 's as simple as it is .
I had a daughter and I did think , ' This is all wrong , I am actually supposed to die , it 's just an inevitable process and I need to pull myself together ' , and I nearly packed up . "
Why did n't he ?
" That 's a good question . "
The cryonicists screw up their fish and chip paper , put it in the bin and head to the laboratory – which is nothing more than Alan 's back room with a table and a case sat on it .
Tim 's put any doubts to the back of his mind .
He 's raring to go .
" There 's a patient on the table dying .
Hurry up . "
But , of course , the patient is imaginary .
Tim takes the lead , explaining the ins and outs of the tubing to his less experienced fellow travellers .
Meanwhile Mike Darwin watches , arms crossed reprovingly , his concern for the patient growing by the second .
" Right , I started timing you three minutes ago , " he says .
A good few minutes later Tim and his not - so - crack team are still working out where the red and blue bits plug into .
" The only thing that goes wrong is if you switch it on without all the bits plugged in .
It does n't like it and it has been known to go bang , " he says cheerily .
Darwin can't contain himself .
" If I had that kit here , I 'd be scared shitless .
Shitless .
There are some critical things wrong with the setup of that circuit . "
He tells the team they have made so many mistakes the patient would have suffered irreversible brain damage by now .
Darwin suggests technology has regressed since he was in his cryonic prime 20 years ago .
But the water is pumping through the system , and Sinclair 's team are fully focused on saving their imaginary patient .
Whatever Darwin tells them , they believe they are ahead of their time , not behind it .
" One of the theories I hear bandied around is that the people who are involved now are a bit weird , " Tim says .
" We 're the kind of people who would have bought the laser discs before they became mainstream , with the old Laserdisc player .
Apparently , it 's called being an early adopter .
The people who think it 's weird are just too frightened to put the effort in . "
David nods in furious agreement , and repeats his mantra .
" We 're living on a planet with six billion suicidal maniacs . "
SQL Server 2008 T - SQL MERGE Statement Example Microsoft SQL
Server 2008 has T - SQL enhancements like SQL MERGE statement for sql developers and SQL Server database administrators ( DBAs ) .
SQL Server 2008 MERGE T-SQL command can be used to insert , update and / or delete in one sql statement .
T- SQL Merge command will compare two sets of data or two tables .
If there are matched ones than Merge command will update matched ones .
If there are unmatched rows from one set of data into other then Merge will insert missing rows .
Merge command can be also used to delete unmatched ones from the primary table .
Here is a Merge example that you should run on MS SQL Server 2008 databases to view the results of T - SQL MERGE command .
CREATE TABLE Books (
Book Id smallint ,
Title varchar ( 100 ) ,
Author varchar ( 25 ) ,
ISBN varchar ( 50 ) ,
Pages int
)
GO
INSERT INTO BOOKS VALUES
( 1 , ' Microsoft SQL Server 2005 For Dummies ' , ' Andrew Watt ' , NULL , NULL ) ,
( 2 , ' Microsoft SQL Server 2005 For Dummies ' , NULL , NULL , 432 ) ,
( 3 , ' Microsoft SQL Server 2005 For Dummies ' , NULL , '978-0-7645-7755-0 ' , NULL )
GO
SELECT * FROM Books
Here is how the data in sql table Books is shown after the SELECT statement execution .
As a T - SQL Developer , I want to convert the above 3 rows of data into a single row .
In a way I want to group these columns taking the book title as a base .
Also I want to merge these three rows into a single row .
This means while updating column values of a single row , I have to get rid of the other table rows .
This means I will delete duplicate rows as taking the book title as base for compare these all sql table rows .
The below t- sql GROUP BY statement select the data I want , but does not update the row or delete duplicate rows in sql table .
SELECT
MAX ( BookId ) BookId ,
Title ,
MAX ( Author )
Author ,
MAX ( ISBN ) ISBN ,
MAX ( Pages ) Pages
FROM Books
GROUP BY Title
Using MS SQL Server 2008 T - SQL
Merge command we will now build one single statement which will update one row and delete the others from the sql table .
Here is the code for t- sql merge example
MERGE Books
USING
(
SELECT
MAX ( BookId ) BookId ,
Title ,
MAX ( Author )
Author ,
MAX ( ISBN ) ISBN ,
MAX ( Pages ) Pages
FROM Books
GROUP BY Title
) MergeData ON Books .
Book Id = MergeData .BookId
WHEN MATCHED THEN
UPDATE SET
Books .
Title = MergeData .
Title ,
Books .
Author = MergeData .
Author ,
Books .
ISBN = MergeData .ISBN ,
Books .
Pages = MergeData .
Pages
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN DELETE ;
GO
SELECT * FROM Books
And the result set of the above select statement after the Merge command is executed is just as we have targeted .
I hope you liked this SQL Server 2008 T - SQL Merge example .

As my colleague Laura Fitzpatrick reported last year , the “ designer vagina ” trend is on the upswing , with a growing number of young women seeking out surgery to trim , sculpt and perfect their private areas .
Yet while more women may be going under the knife in hopes of improving their intimate aesthetics , according to research published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , many do so without fully understanding the risks of such procedures .
What ’s more , the BBC reports , the study ’s authors question whether creating “ perfect genitals ” should even be a legitimate goal in the medical community .
Most frequently women seek labioplasty — which involves trimming back protruding labia and can cost some $ 5,000 ( £ 3,000 ) — because they say their physical appearance causes embarrassment and discomfort in front of sexual partners , or that excessive tissue causes physical discomfort .
Yet , the authors say , while their analysis of 40 research articles on the procedures revealed that most patients report satisfaction with the results and few complications , that there has been little investigation of long - term effects of these surgeries , including how they may impact future sexual satisfaction or whether they introduce any potential complications into childbirth .
Plastic surgeons who regularly perform labioplasty say that the warnings about long - term complications or side effects are exaggerated and merely meant to scare women away from what they deem a simple , straightforward procedure that most often makes women feel more comfortable about their own bodies .
“ This is a procedure which we have been doing since the 1970s .
Any operation performed poorly carries risks , but when it ’s done properly there are very few issues at all , ” plastic surgeon Angelica Kavouni tells the BBC .
And , Kavouni says , when she sees patients who do n’t have a physical problem with excessive tissue or discoloration , for example , she advises them against the procedure .
Still , the current study ’s authors argue , regardless of widely reported satisfaction with labioplasty , more research is needed to accurately assess long - term risks , and also to determine whether counseling might benefit women who are considering the procedure — even physical discomfort may in fact be a psychological consequence of insecurity , they suggest .
And in the meantime , they believe it ’s important to emphasize that the notion of perfect genitals is a myth .
As consulting psychologist Lih - Mei Liao told the The Times , women should n’t let “ advertisements that prescribe a homogenized , prepubescent genital appearance standard for all women , ” influence their perceptions of what is healthy — and attractive — in their own bodies .
John Williams , who runs the popular counter government data manipulation site Shadowstats , has thrown down the gauntlet to deflationists , and in an extensive report concludes that the probability of a hyperinflationary episode in America over the next year has reached critical levels .
While the debate between deflationists and ( hyper ) inflationists has been a long and painful one , numerous events set off in motion by the Bernanke Fed ( as a direct legacy of the Greenspan multi- decade period of cheap and boundless credit ) may have well cast America as the unwilling protagonist in the sequel of the failed monetary policy economic experiment better known as Zimbabwe .
Williams does not mince his words :
The U.S. economic and systemic solvency crises of the last two years are just precursors to a Great Collapse : a hyperinflationary great depression .
Such will reflect a complete collapse in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar , a collapse in the normal stream of U.S. commercial and economic activity , a collapse in the U.S. financial system as we know it , and a likely realignment of the U.S. political environment .
The current U.S. financial markets , financial system and economy remain highly unstable and vulnerable to unexpected shocks .
The Federal Reserve is dedicated to preventing deflation , to debasing the U.S. dollar .
The results of those efforts are being seen in tentative selling pressures against the U.S. currency and in the rallying price of gold .
And even as Bernanke continues existing in a factless vacuum where he sees no asset bubbles , Williams takes aim at the one party almost exclusively responsible for the economic carnage that will soon transpire :
The crises have been generated out of and are centered on the United States financial system , triggered by the collapse of debt excesses actively encouraged by the Greenspan Federal Reserve .
Recognizing that the U.S. economy was sagging under the weight of structural changes created by government trade , regulatory and social policies -- policies that limited real consumer income growth -- Mr. Greenspan played along with the political and banking systems .
He made policy decisions to steal economic activity from the future , fueling economic growth of the last decade largely through debt expansion .
The Greenspan Fed pushed for ever - greater systemic leverage , including the happy acceptance of new financial products , which included instruments of mis-packaged lending risks , designed for consumption by global entities that openly did not understand the nature of the risks being taken .
Complicit in this broad malfeasance was the U.S. government , including both major political parties in successive Administrations and Congresses .
As with consumers , the federal government could not make ends meet while appeasing that portion of the electorate that could be kept docile by ever - expanding government programs and increasing government spending .
The solution was ever - expanding federal debt and deficits .
Purportedly , it was Arthur Burns , Fed Chairman under Richard Nixon , who first offered the advice that helped to guide Alan Greenspan and a number of Administrations .
The gist of the wisdom imparted was that if you ran into problems , you could ignore the budget deficit and the dollar .
Ignoring them did not matter , because doing so would not cost you any votes .
Back in 2005 , I raised the issue of a then - inevitable U.S. hyperinflation with an advisor to both the Bush Administration and Fed Chairman Greenspan .
I was told simply that " It 's too far into the future to worry about . "
Indeed , pushing the big problems into the future appears to have been the working strategy for both the Fed and recent Administrations .
Yet , the U.S. dollar and the budget deficit do matter , and the future is at hand .
The day of ultimate financial reckoning has arrived , and it is playing out .
Looking at the events over the past year demonstrates that Williams is not just being a drama queen .
Effective financial impairments and at least partial nationalizations or orchestrated bailouts / takeovers resulted for institutions such as Bear Stearns , Citigroup , Washington Mutual , AIG , General Motors , Chrysler , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , along with a number of further troubled financial institutions .
The Fed moved to provide whatever systemic liquidity would be needed , while the federal government moved to finance corporate bailouts and to introduce significant stimulus spending .
Curiously , though , the Fed and the Treasury let Lehman Brothers fail outright , which triggered a foreseeable run on the system and markedly intensified the systemic solvency crisis in September 2008 .
Whether someone was trying to play political games , with the public and Congress increasingly raising questions of moral hazard issues , or whether the U.S. financial wizards missed what would happen or simply moved to bring the crisis to a head , remains to be seen .
More on the impending timing of the complete economic collapse of the US financial system :
Before the systemic solvency crisis began to unfold in 2007 , the U.S. government already had condemned the U.S. dollar to a hyperinflationary grave by taking on debt and obligations that never could be covered through raising taxes and / or by severely slashing government spending that had become politically untouchable .
The U.S. economy also already had entered a severe structural downturn , which helped to trigger the systemic solvency crisis .
The intensifying economic and solvency crises , and the responses to both by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve in the last two years , have exacerbated the government 's solvency issues and moved forward my timing estimation for the hyperinflation to the next five years , from the 2010 to 2018 timing range estimated in the prior report .
The U.S. government and Federal Reserve already have committed the system to this course through the easy politics of a bottomless pocketbook , the servicing of big - moneyed special interests , gross mismanagement , and a deliberate and ongoing effort to debase the U.S. currency .
Accordingly , risks are particularly high of the hyperinflation crisis breaking within the next year .
What are the alternatives for the US ?
In a word , none .
Presumably this means you should ignore what the axed " experts " from various bailed out sell side research chop shops try to tell you .
The U.S. has no way of avoiding a financial Armageddon .
Bankrupt sovereign states most commonly use the currency printing press as a solution to not having enough money to cover obligations .
The alternative would be for the U.S. to renege on its existing debt and obligations , a solution for modern sovereign states rarely seen outside of governments overthrown in revolution , and a solution with no happier ending than simply printing the needed money .
With the creation of massive amounts of new fiat dollars ( not backed by gold or silver ) will come the eventual destruction of the value of the U.S. dollar and related dollar - denominated paper assets .
What lies ahead will be extremely difficult , painful and unhappy times for many in the United States .
The functioning and adaptation of the U.S. economy and financial markets to a hyperinflation likely would be particularly disruptive .
Trouble could range from turmoil in the food distribution chain to electronic cash and credit systems unable to handle rapidly changing circumstances .
The situation quickly would devolve from a deepening depression , to an intensifying hyperinflationary great depression .
While the economic difficulties would have global impact , the initial hyperinflation should be largely a U.S. problem , albeit with major implications for the global currency system .
For those living in the United States , long - range strategies should look to assure safety and survival , which from a financial standpoint means preserving wealth and assets .
Also directly impacted , of course , are those holding or dependent upon U.S. dollars or dollar - denominated assets , and those living in " dollarized " countries .
In other words , the economic cycle will come back with a vengeance .
Having pulled America out of the abyss by the last hairs on its Rogaine infused head , the Fed and the Administration have merely purchased one - two years of excess time in which insiders can sell all their holdings ( look at recent reports indicating the ratio of insider sellers to buyers ) and banks can book one / two years of record bonuses before signing off .
And whether one is a deflationist or inflationist , the take home message from Williams ' thesis that everyone should be able to agree on , is what everyone knows yet is unwilling to admit : that the US economy ( and its derivative , the undecoupled global economy , which that most certainly includes China ) is that we are now caught in the greatest Ponzi bubble of all time .
One small hiccup in which there is no incremental hollow value added on the margin courtesy of printing presses pushing fiat pieces of paper in overtime , would lead to precisely the same outcome as the world saw with Bernie Madoff : from $ 50 billion to 0 overnight .
It is somehow fitting that world GDP is 1,000 time greater , at $ 50 trillion .
Take away the fiat illusion , and the real value collapses to those concepts of tangible value that will remain in a post bubble implosion scenario : whether these be spam , gold , or lead .
And just so there is no confusion about the course of events , Williams presents the Zimbabwe hyperinflation episode as the case study that the historian Bernanke should have been focusing on , instead of spending long nights , " learning " from the Great Depression .
Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe , the former Rhodesia , was a quadrillion times worse than it was in Weimar Germany .
Zimbabwe went through a number of years of high inflation , with an accelerating hyperinflation from 2006 to 2009 , when the currency was abandoned .
Through three devaluations , excess zeros repeatedly were lopped off notes as high as 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollars .
The cumulative devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar was such that a stack of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ( 26 zeros ) two dollar bills ( if they were printed ) in the peak hyperinflation would have be needed to equal in value what a single original Zimbabwe two - dollar bill of 1978 had been worth .
Such a pile of bills literally would be light years high , stretching from the Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy .
In early - 2009 , the governor of the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank indicated he felt his actions in printing money were vindicated by the recent actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve .
If the U.S. went through a hyperinflation like that of Zimbabwe ’s , total U.S. federal debt and obligations ( roughly $ 75 trillion with unfunded liabilities ) could be paid off for much less than a current penny .
What helped to enable the evolution of the Zimbabwe monetary excesses over the years , while still having something of a functioning economy , was the back - up of a well functioning black market in U.S. dollars .
The United States has no such backup system , however , with implications for a more rapid and disruptive hyperinflation than seen in Zimbabwe , when it hits .
Maybe in retrospect it is good that banks are not lending out .
If the $ 1.2 trillion in excess reserves were to actually hit circulating currency overnight , or even in a much more gradual fashion , then hyperinflation would surely be unavoidable , not so much as function of the consumer becoming a dominant force once again , which is the deflationists ' key point , but as a result of the excess liquidity of the capital markets , which is the only reason why the S&P is where it is , into Main Street .
As it stands , banks ' unwillingness to recreate the cheap credit bubble by lending to anyone who has a pulse and can walk is the only thing that is so far preventing America 's name change to the United States of Zimbabwe .
Call it what you will , " the noughties " , " the two - thousands " or something else , the first decade of the 21st century ( 2000 - 2009 ) is now over .
Looking back on the past ten years through news photographs , it becomes clear that it was a dramatic , often brutal decade .
Natural disasters , terrorist attacks and wars were by far the most dominant theme .
Ten years ago , Bill Clinton was ending his final term in office , very few had ever heard of Osama bin Laden , the Taliban ruled Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein still ruled Iraq - all that and much more has changed in the intervening time .
It 's really an impossible task to sum up ten years in a handful of photographs , but below is my best attempt at a look back at the last decade - feel free to let me know what I missed in the comments below .

A Burzum Story : Part XI - Birds Of A Feather Flock Together
When these apparent Burzum fans in the media report the news that Burzum will release another album , the reaction is kind of weird .
Most of them have been honourable enough to both print the whole article , or at least most of it , and tell their readers where they got the news from .
This is correct and lawful journalism , when dealing with copyrighted material .
" Hurray " to You for that .
Apparently my comparing of black metallers with the stereotypical Negro and homosexuals is not taken lightly in " the real world " .
Because of my thoughtless remarks I am , according to them or their readers , both a vile racist and homophobic , and should ideally be stone to death for being intolerant .
Naturally .
The problem is that my remarks are n't really homophobic .
What I do is simply point at the obvious facts ; some black metallers dress , walk , talk , look and act like stereotypical homosexuals .
Both the black metallers in question and the stereotypical homosexuals obviously buy their clothes , their make - up and jewellery from the same " laces & leather " shops .
They wear the same clothes , the same make - up and the same jewellery .
So they do dress and look like the stereotypical homosexual .
End of discussion .
The funny thing is that I never really stated if this was a bad thing or not .
Maybe I in fact think dressing and looking " gay " is okay , but perhaps not for black metallers , who think of themselves and try to present themselves as some sort of " dark warriors " ?
Who can tell ?
I surely never said anything about that in my article .
So , when readers of my words react so strongly it is because they are homophobic : they obviously think that dressing and looking like homosexuals is a bad thing .
Maybe they should take a look in the mirror and think for a minute before they start attacking me for being homophobic ?
When it comes to the " racist remark " I can only apologize to You all .
I obviously live in a different world , where one can discuss ones perception of reality without any fear of harassment ; a world of tolerance and respect , a world of intellectual debate and honesty .
Some of
You apparently do n't , so when I speak I must be careful .
I must say , though , that if You do n't like what I say to my fans on www.burzum.org, then please do n't read or refer to my articles .
It 's a free world , and You are free not to read my articles .
I want to point out that my so called " racist remark " was actually not intended to be racist or to offend anyone but the black metallers in question , whom I happen to know have indeed some strong views and opinions .
It was purely meant to draw attention to how some black metal artists are more and more acting and living a lifestyle like the individuals they at least in private claim to despise .
When it comes to the title of the next album , " The White God " , this has nothing to do with " race " or " skin colour " or anything like that .
Please stop this nonsense about " The White God " being a racist album .
This album is about Baldr , known as " The White God " , because he is a solar deity and because he is pale after spending time in the realm of the dead .
I do n't use the Baldr name because I want to speak to all the different cultures of Europe , and we all happen to have our own name for this deity .
The British / Picts / Gaulls called him Belenus , the Greeks called him Apollon , the Romans Apollo , the Scytho - Slavs Byelobog , and so forth , and before that we all called him Belus .
However , we all know him as the White God , and therefore I use this as the title for my album .
The next album is a description of a part of our culture that most of us have forgotten all about .
I know this interest many of You , or at least many of the Burzum fans ( as surely not all the readers of this are Burzum fans ) .
Maybe
You should wait and see for Yourselves , before
You start " burning books " , like some certain ignorant predecessors in history .
Thank
You for the attention , and for being able to bring some colour to Your lives .
When I speak through www.burzum.org
I always imagine that I speak only to Burzum fans .
If not a Burzum fan , why would You visit this site ?
Judging from the response to the A Burzum Story : Part X - " The White God " , this is not the case .
Or maybe it is , in which case I have a whole lot of fans in the media .
When these apparent Burzum fans in the media report the news that Burzum will release another album , the reaction is kind of weird .
Most of them have been honourable enough to both print the whole article , or at least most of it , and tell their readers where they got the news from .
This is correct and lawful journalism , when dealing with copyrighted material .
" Hurray " to You for that .
Apparently my comparing of black metallers with the stereotypical Negro and homosexuals is not taken lightly in " the real world " .
Because of my thoughtless remarks I am , according to them or their readers , both a vile racist and homophobic , and should ideally be stone to death for being intolerant .
Naturally .
The problem is that my remarks are n't really homophobic .
What I do is simply point at the obvious ; some black metallers dress , walk , talk , look and act like stereotypical homosexuals .
Both the black metallers in question and the stereotypical homosexuals obviously buy their clothes , their make - up and jewellery from the same " laces & leather " shops .
They wear the same clothes , the same make - up and the same jewellery .
So they do dress and look like the stereotypical homosexual .
End of discussion .
The funny thing is that I never really stated if this was a bad thing or not .
Maybe I in fact think dressing and looking " gay " is okay , but perhaps not for black metallers , who think of themselves and try to present themselves as some sort of " dark warriors " ?
Who can tell ?
I surely never said anything about that in my article .
So , when readers of my words react so strongly it is becauseare homophobic : obviously think that dressing and looking like homosexuals is a bad thing .
Maybe they should take a look in the mirror and think for a minute before they start attacking me for being homophobic ?
When it comes to the " racist remark " I can only apologize to You all .
I obviously live in a different world , where one can discuss ones perception of reality without any fear of harassment ; a world of tolerance and respect , a world of intellectual debate and honesty .
Some of
You apparently do n't , so when I speak I must be careful .
I must say , though , that if You do n't like what I say to my fans on www.burzum.org, then please do n't read or refer to my articles .
It 's a free world , and You are free not to read my articles .
I want to point out that my so called " racist remark " was actually not intended to be racist or to offend anyone but the black metallers in question , whom I happen to know have indeed some strong views and opinions .
It was purely meant to draw attention to how some black metal artists are more and more acting and living a lifestyle like the individuals they at least in private claim to despise .
When it comes to the title of the next album , " The White God " , this has nothing to do with " race " or " skin colour " or anything like that .
Please stop this nonsense about " The White God " being a racist album .
This album is about Baldr , known as " The White God " , because he is a solar deity and because he is pale after spending time in the realm of the dead .
I do n't use the Baldr name because I want to speak to all the different cultures of Europe , and we all happen to have our own name for this deity .
The British / Picts / Gaulls called him Belenus , the Greeks called him Apollon , the Romans Apollo , the Scytho - Slavs Byelobog , and so forth , and before that we all called him Belus .
However , we all know him as the White God , and therefore I use this as the title for my album .
The next album is a description of a part of our culture that most of us have forgotten all about .
I know this interest many of You , or at least many of the Burzum fans ( as surely not all the readers of this are Burzum fans ) .
Maybe
You should wait and see for Yourselves , before
You start " burning books " , like some certain ignorant predecessors in history .
Thank
You for the attention , and for being able to bring some colour to Your lives .
Respectfully ,

You guys could n't make the time to show up for " Senior Day " in what was one of UCLA 's most important regular season game in years .
You are too busy with classes and protests ( you know things that we apparently did n't have to worry much about while we attended UCLA ) .
And now it looks like you guys can't be bothered to protect the Bruin Bear on campus :
Photo Credit : E. Corpuz
Simple questions : Really students ?
How the heck did this happen ?
Were there any students protecting the Bear ?
If they were n't , why not ?
Let me guess .
Same lame excuses will be served up that we had to read on Sunday .
Just pathetic .
It 's a classic silly prank .
I can't really get mad at the Trojans for doing this to the Bear .
It 's part of the rivalry week .
We have done the same to them over the years .
Unlike the lifeless UCLA students though , the Trojans were ready and prepared all week :
Photo Credit : Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
Per the Daily Trojan , " The Trojan Knights will hold a Thanksgiving dinner in front of Tommy Trojan on Thursday as they guard the statue as part of Save Tommy Week . "
You can make fun of them all you want UCLA students but you got PWNed .
It was up to our students to make sure it did n't happen and protect the obvious target .
Looks like they dropped the ball again .
Hopefully our football team will show more heart , passion and desire than the UCLA student body has shown the entire season .
There is one word to describe the kind of passion UCLA students have shown this year : Dorrellian .
GO BRUINS .
UPDATE ( N ) : As freesia39 points out apparently there is a Bruin Bear " Security Force " who are charged with this responsibility .
You can demand an explanation for WTH happened by either calling them at ( 714 ) 487-8353 or emailing them at usarep3@asucla.ucla.edu .
Every student groups on campus dropped the ball here .
They should be ashamed and apologetic to rest of Bruin Nation .
Inexcusable .
GO BRUINS .
UPDATE II ( N ) : Per UCLA newsroom the damage was extensive :
" This probably ranks as one of the more egregious forms of vandalism of the bear that we 've seen , " said Leroy Sisneros , director of maintenance and alterations for UCLA Facilities Management , who recalled that the statue was last vandalized three years ago , when it was defaced with white paint , but not during UCLA–USC rivalry week .
" It took all day to clean in 2006 .
This is going to take a lot longer , " Sisneros said .
" It 's going to be very expensive .
In the past , vandals used water - based paint that can be washed off .
But this time , they used an oil - based paint that will be more difficult to remove . "
Oh and take note students .
The " Bruin " is a gift from the Alumni Association :
In 1984 , " The Bruin , " a gift from the UCLA Alumni Association , was unveiled before a crowd of nearly 1,000 alumni celebrating the association 's first half - century .
Measuring 10 feet long , 6 feet wide , 3 feet across and weighing more than 2 tons , the statue was billed at that time as the largest bear sculpture in the United States .
Again , this week has already turned into the worst " Beat $ C " week in years thanks to the laziness and apathy of UCLA students .
If these students had any sense of pride they would try to fire back by showing up in thousands next weekend at the Mosoleum .
Given their Dorrellian performance in recent weeks , it 's clear we can't really cound on them .
Not this year .
GO BRUINS .
UPDATE III ( N ) : Unbelievably this article is currently posted on the Daily Bruin ( and I am assuming ran in the print section today ) :
Students at UCLA and USC also have a long - standing tradition of attempting to vandalize the statues of one another ’s mascots , Tommy Trojan and the Bruin Bear .
One way in which UCLA has attempted to redirect some of this student enthusiasm is through the Bruin Bear Security Force .
Students who join the security force spend the night camping out in front of the Bruin Bear statue and are provided with entertainment and spirit activities and snacks by various campus organizations , including USAC and SAA .
“ The Bruin Bear Security Force is really an opportunity to allow students to get involved in this friendly school rivalry in a safe way , ” said General Representative Thach Nguyen .
His office is helping organize this year ’s security force , who will be treated to a carnival - themed event that includes root beer pong tournaments , blue and gold tie - dying , and performances by a number of student dance and a cappella groups .
I do n't really know what commentary I can add to that .
Cappella group to get fired up for a football game ?
Who are the guys organizing this and do they have any clue about college football ?
GO BRUINS .

After spending some time other this weekend getting started with Clojure ( using the excellent Setting Up Clojure for Mac OS X Leopard to guide me through setting up my development environment ) , it still took me a bit longer than expected to find a concise answer to reading in files , so here is a stab at collecting some thoughts on that topic .
slurp
The simplest approach to reading in a file is to use simply use slurp .
user > ( slurp " tokenize.clj " ) " ( ns tokenize
( : import ( java.io BufferedReader FileR ....
"
For simple scripts , this may be all our need , but it suffers from a few issues :
it reads the entire file into memory , making it unsuitable for large files ,
and it does n't break contents by line ( or any other delimiter for that matter ) which is usually what you want .
java.io.BufferedReader
For a more scalable streaming approach , java.io.
BufferedReader is a simple but efficient bet .
( ns tokenize ( :import ( java.io BufferedReader FileReader ) ) ) ( defn process - file [ file - name ] ( with - open [ rdr ( BufferedReader .
( FileReader . file - name ) ) ] ( doseq [ line ( line - seq rdr ) ] ( println line ) ) ) ) ( process - file " tokenize.clj " )
The BufferedReader wraps the FileReader to provide a lazy interface to the file , and line - seq allows us to treat the stream as a list , while behind the scene it calls the readLine method on BufferedReader .
Modifying the above code you could write a generic function for reducing lines in a file .
( ns tokenize ( :import ( java.io BufferedReader FileReader ) ) ) ( defn process - file [ file - name line - func line - acc ] ( with - open [ rdr ( BufferedReader .
( FileReader . file - name ) ) ] ( reduce line - func line - acc ( line - seq rdr ) ) ) ) ( defn process - line [ acc line ] ( + acc 1 ) ) ( prn ( process - file " tokenize.clj " process - line 0 ) )
The above snippet only counts lines in a file , but you could rewrite process - line to perform detect tokens from the file as well .
( defn process - line [ acc line ] ( reduce #( assoc % 1 %2 ( + ( get % 1 %2 0 ) 1 ) ) acc ( . split line " " ) ) )
At which point , running the script :
bash - 3.2 $ clj read1.clj { " " 20 , " rdr ) ) ) ) " 1 , " * command-line-args * ) ) ) ) " 1 , ... }
In general , BufferedReader and line - seq should be adequate for most file reading ( Buffered Reader is the goto way to read large files in Java ) , but there are always more ways to do things .
clojure.contrib.duck-streams
If you have clojure .
contrib installed , then a slightly more compact approach to parsing files as streams is available : duck - streams .
Modifying the BufferedReader example to use duck - streams , we get this code :
( ns tokenize ( :use [ clojure.contrib.duck -streams :only ( read - lines ) ] ) ) ( defn process - file [ file - name line - func line - acc ] ( reduce line - func line - acc ( read - lines file - name ) ) ) ( defn process - line [ acc line ] ( reduce #( assoc % 1 %2 ( + ( get % 1 %2 0 ) 1 ) ) acc ( . split line " " ) ) ) ( prn ( process - file " tokenize.clj " process - line ( hash - map ) ) )
It 's a bit more compact , but probably you'd be using duck - streams .
read - lines because you were already using other duck - streams functionality ( like spit for writing out files , append - spit for appending to files ) .
There are many other approaches to reading in files in Clojure , but these should be enough to get started .

Awaiting a Fix of the Bubble Mistakes
Gold rose $ 15 yesterday .
What to make of it ?
Perhaps it was because Ben Bernanke ’s extended his “ extended period ” pledge ?
He said , in effect , if this economy does n’t come out of its slump , it wo n’t be his fault .
He ’ll keep monetary policy as loose as possible for as long as possible .
Not that we had any doubt about it .
He has a theory .
It ’s a bad theory , but it ’s all he has .
And it tells him that you fight a depression with loose money .
So , what do you expect ?
Interest rates will remain artificially low as long as Bernanke can get away with it …or until the depression ends … whichever comes sooner .
That said , he hardly has to lift a finger .
Judging from the last auction of short - term Treasury debt , lenders can’t think of anything better to do with their money than to give it to the government – in return for nothing .
The last auction produced a yield of zero on one - month loans .
We went to visit a pair of clever Swiss bankers yesterday .
These fellows manage money for clients all over the world .
What do they think ?
They were focused on stocks :
“ This year , the people who made the most money were those who were most heavily invested in equities .
And if the patterns of the past hold up , 2010 will be a good year for equities too .
Whenever the 10 - year performance goes close to zero , the next few years tend to be very good for stock market investors .
In fact , there has never been an exception , going all the way back to 1881 .
Last year was one of the worst years in stock market history .
This has been one of the best .
And next year should be one of the best too . ”
He handed us a chart to illustrate his point .
It shows the 10 - year performance of the stock market .
We see that very rarely are stock market returns negative over a 10 - year period .
In fact , there are only two worth mentioning .
One was in the ’30s , when in August ’39 stocks had returned MINUS 4.68 % for the previous ten years .
The other major losing period came in February of this year , when investors had gotten an average annual return of - 3.43 % since 1999 .
The message seems simple enough .
When the market turns down sharply …expect a sharp turn - up to follow .
But studying the chart more carefully , we see two things .
First , we see sloppiness in the figures .
The thirties pattern was not a clean break and then a clean bounce … but a series of breaks and bounces .
In fact , investors endured 10 years of losses running up to ’ 30 … and then more 10 - year periods of losses in the years ’ 37 , ’ 38 , ’39 , and ’40 .
The other thing we notice is that an investor could have made a lot of money in the ’ 30 s … if he was lucky .
The year 1933 was one of the best years ever .
Of course , the investor was well advised to take his gains off the table .
Prices slipped in ’ 34 … bounced …and then fell apart .
By the end of the ’ 40s , the poor long - term , buy and hold investor had not made a penny in two decades of investing .
This pattern , by the way , is not so different from what the Japanese have suffered during the last 20 years .
They ’ve seen good times .
They ’ve seen bad times .
But the general trend of the markets has been down for two decades .
We have a feeling that the worst is still ahead for this market too .
Few of the mistakes of the bubble period have been corrected .
None of the challenges of the new post - bubble economy have been met .
Little of the huge mountain of debt trash has been taken away and disposed of properly .
The big reckoning is still to come .
Which brings us back to the price of gold .
It was over $ 1,200 just a few days ago .
It ’s had a little correction .
But we doubt that it has had the correction we ’ve been waiting for .
There is still no sign of consumer price inflation .
Nor is there any sign that consumers are returning to their old spendthrift habits .
Nor is there any sign that jobs are becoming more plentiful …or that this depression is going to end any time soon .
When that becomes clearer , stocks will fall again .
Gold should fall too .
People will want safety .
But where will they seek it ?
Ah , that ’s another big question .
In the first stage of the crisis , they sold gold and bought dollars .
Will they do the same the next time ?
Or will they fear that the dollar may be part of the problem , rather than part of the solution ?
If so , wo n’t they flee stocks for gold ?
We do n’t know .
haha glad you like it !
I have it posted in my door right now at my apt .
In a brazen attack on Iran ’s military elite , a suicide bomber on Sunday killed six Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders and 36 others at a gathering of tribal leaders in a southeastern province near the Pakistani border known for drug running and religious extremism , according to the official Iranian news agency .
The assault was carried out by a lone man who reportedly disguised himself in tribal dress and detonated an explosives belt at a gymnasium in the city of Pisheen in Sistan - Baluchistan , a harsh land beset by heroin smuggling and ethnic animosities .
At least 28 people were wounded , and images of carnage were broadcast across a stunned nation .
State media said the Sunni Muslim militant group Jundallah , or Soldiers of God , which operates along the Iranian - Pakistani border , claimed responsibility for the attack .
The organization , part of a regional Sunni insurgency in Shiite - dominated Iran , has for years killed and kidnapped Iranian soldiers and police officers .

The bombing highlighted the increasing dangers in a region near the intersection of Iran and two of its troubled neighbors : Afghanistan , where U.S. forces are battling a resurgent Taliban , and Pakistan , where the military this weekend launched a major offensive against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters .
Jundallah has its own agenda in Iran , but its ideology and proximity to the other militant groups prompted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to caution Pakistan about cross - border violence .
“ We have heard that certain officials in Pakistan cooperate with main agents of these terrorist attacks in eastern parts of the country .
It is our right to ask [ for extradition ] of criminals , ” Ahmadinejad said Sunday night , shortly after Iranian news agencies reported that Tehran had summoned the Pakistani charge d’affairs to the Foreign Ministry .
The attack also came as the world has been focused on Iran ’s controversial nuclear development program and on widespread protests over alleged vote fraud in Ahmadinejad ’s June reelection victory .
The issues have put tremendous pressure on the president and supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , both of whom have moved to crush internal dissent while offering a mix of defiance and conciliation with world powers over the country ’s nuclear ambitions .

The Baluchistan bomber , dressed in a loose white robe , struck during what was to have been a reconciliation meeting between Shiite and Sunni tribesmen to calm sectarian tensions in southeastern Iran .
State - owned Press TV reported that a simultaneous second bombing targeted another group of Revolutionary Guard officers traveling in a convoy near Pisheen .
The number of casualties was unclear and the report could not be independently confirmed .
The region is a tangle of disenchanted clans and sects that have claimed ethnic and religious discrimination for generations .
Jundallah and other groups pose no serious threat to the central government , but they are capable of deadly ambushes against state and Shiite institutions , such as a mosque bombing in May that left more than 20 people dead .
Iran ’s postelection unrest may have also helped inspire Sunday ’s bloodshed .
Jundallah had vowed to take revenge against the Revolutionary Guard for cracking down on protesters marching against Ahmadinejad .
The peaceful opposition movement led by vanquished presidential candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi never associated itself with Jundallah , but some analysts suggested that the group plotted the attack to exploit the political turmoil at a time the Revolutionary Guard is tightening its hold on the country .
“ It was a measure to show that IRGC is susceptible and penetrable .
A suicide bomber infiltrated a gathering that was supposedly held under tight security because of the presence of the high - ranking IRGC commanders , ” said Mashallah Shamsolvaezin , a political analyst .
“ And , secondly , the timing was important because IRGC is associated with the heavy crackdown against postelection protesters , so the terrorist attack can be an intensified echo of public opinion . ”

The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that those killed included two of the Revolutionary Guard ’s top commanders : Gen . Noor Ali Shooshtari , commander of the guard ’s ground force , and Rajab Ali Mohammadzadeh , a chief commander for the region .
Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution , Shooshtari was a follower of Khamenei , who was then a rebellious mullah .
He rose through the Revolutionary Guard ranks and in March was appointed to oversee the Sistan - Baluchistan province .
The Revolutionary Guard and hard - line politicians blamed “ global arrogance ” for the bombing and said the U.S. was funding and arming Jundallah and other militant groups to overthrow the Ahmadinejad government .
The accusations came the day before officials from the U.S. and other world powers are to meet in Vienna with Iranian delegates over Tehran ’s nuclear development program .
The West says Iran wants to build an atomic bomb , while Tehran says it is focused solely on civilian energy purposes .
“ There is no doubt that this violent and inhumane act was part of the strategy of foreigners and enemies of the regime and the revolution to destroy unity between Shias and Sunnis and create divisions among the unified ranks of the great Iranian people , ” according to a statement issued by the Revolutionary Guard .

Ali Larijani , the speaker of the Iranian parliament , agreed .
“ We consider the recent terrorist attack to be the result of U.S. action , ” he said .
“ This is the sign of America ’s animosity against our country . ”
IRNA quoted Larijani as telling lawmakers : “ The goal of the terrorists is to disturb the security of the Sistan - Baluchistan province .
They do not want to have economic progress in this region .
But certainly the guards will react with additional forces to establish security . ”
U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly denied American involvement , saying Washington condemns “ this act of terrorism and mourns the loss of innocent lives .
Reports of alleged U.S. involvement are completely false . ”
Jundallah is mainly made up of ethnic minority Baluchis scattered across Iran , Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Press TV reported that “ Jundallah is a Pakistan - based terrorist group closely affiliated with the notorious Al Qaeda organization .
The terror ring has carried out countless bombings and other violent attacks in Iran . ”

Attention , iPhone users :
You require some education .
You do n't understand what a megabyte of data truly means , you see , and you 're not aware of how much data you 're using .
If only you 'd allow AT&T to reach out and teach you , all would be well in the world of 3G .
Hang on -- do n't start throwing stones my way just yet .
The preceding message comes straight from the carrier you know and love .
AT&T's CEO of mobility and consumer markets spoke at a conference in New York on Wednesday .
Long story short :
Get ready for changes in the way your mobile data is managed .
AT&T Data Usage : Education , Incentives , and " Pricing Schemes "
The whole data - usage discussion revolves around an ever - increasing demand for mobile data .
A recent report predicts mobile Web traffic will jump to more than 20 times its current amount over the next four years .
It 's no big surprise : Smartphones are becoming more and more prevalent , and those unlimited data plans do promise -- well , unlimited data .
Still , AT&T seems to attract the most attention when it comes to public perception of network - related problems .
And now , silly ad battles aside , the carrier is delivering its strongest indication yet of what solutions could be in store .
First up is that aforementioned " education . "
Here 's exactly what AT&T's Ralph De La Vega had to say , according to PC World sister publication Computerworld :
" The first thing we need to do is educate customers about what represents a megabyte of data .
...
We 're improving systems to give them real - time information about their data usage . "
Why might AT&T think that 's the answer ?
Because it 's worked before , De La Vega attests .
Per Computerworld :
" With landline capabilities , we used that concept and customers did n't know how much data they were using .
...
Once alerted , they reduced their consumption without anything other than being told that data was being used in an inordinate fashion . "
Well , there you have it :
The problem is n't that AT&T 's network can't handle the amount of data you 're using .
The problem is that you 're using too much of the " unlimited data " you purchased .
My , Your Usage Is Heavy
Now , to be clear , AT&T does n't think everyone is part of the problem -- only a small percentage of its smartphone users .
About 3 percent , to be specific .
That 's how many customers are responsible for 40 percent of the network 's data usage , De La Vega indicates .
So what happens if those demonic data - devourers can't be " educated " ?
Then the next steps come into play .
Some kind of thus - far - unspecific " incentives " might be offered , and then , the final blow .
" Longer term , there 's got to be some sort of pricing scheme that addresses the [ heavy ] users , " De La Vega is quoted as saying .
What exactly that means is not yet completely clear .
The practically comedic extremes this line of thinking could lead to , however , are n't hard to imagine .
A Final Message
Here 's my message to AT&T :
You 've taken plenty of flak for your network performance , both from your customers and from your competition .
And we know people are using a lot of data .
But let 's face it , that authority to surf to their hearts ' content is exactly what you sold them .
If charging people for the data they use is what you need to do , then do it -- but , for the love of Luke Wilson , do it in an honest and transparent way .
Do n't market your plans as " unlimited " and then punish the people who actually take advantage of what they bought .
That 's bad business , plain and simple -- and it 's something no marketing campaign can cover up .

In an opinion that could generate more revenue for cash - strapped governments and give additional legitimacy to a fledgling industry , Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said Monday that the state can collect sales tax on medical marijuana .
“ Medical marijuana is tangible property that is generally subject to state sales tax , ” Suthers , a Republican , wrote in response to a query from Gov. Bill Ritter , a Democrat .
The opinion also said medical - marijuana dispensaries must obtain retail - sales licenses from the state to do business .
Ritter ’s administration said it would immediately direct medical - marijuana dispensaries to start paying sales tax and obtain retail licenses .
“ Colorado voters have said they want medical marijuana in Colorado , ” said Ritter spokesman Evan Dreyer .
“ But what we have now is chaos . ”
Voters in 2000 approved a constitutional amendment that legalized medical marijuana .
The issue has gained steam this year as local and state officials grapple with rapid growth in the number of dispensaries and registered users .
“ There ’s been so much uncertainty about this since the summer , we asked for the opinion because we need guidance from the attorney general , ” Dreyer said .
“ We also need clarity from the legislature , and we ’re working with lawmakers on that for the upcoming 2010 session . ”
Medical - marijuana advocates applauded the opinion as a step in the right direction , saying the industry had been working on proposals to enact some sort of tax .
“ I think the community is willing to pay taxes if it will help prove the legitimacy of their efforts , ” said Courtney Tanning , executive director of the Colorado Wellness Association , which represents medical - marijuana dispensaries and the patients and doctors who deal with them .
The medical - marijuana industry “ has been an underground , black - market community for so long that I think they ’re really willing to . . . pay dues to be taken seriously , ” Tanning said .
And at least one lawmaker sees the tax ruling as a boon for state coffers .
“ I ’m pleased we now can get some tax revenue from the sale of a constitutionally authorized medical product , ” said state Sen .
Chris Romer , D - Denver , who has been pushing legislation to further regulate medical marijuana .
Denver to collect sales tax
The opinion comes as the city of Denver was moving to impose its own sales tax on medical marijuana .
City Attorney David Fine said Denver will notify dispensaries that it plans to collect municipal sales tax on medical marijuana starting in December .
Suthers ’ opinion said medical marijuana does not qualify for the sales - tax exemption granted to prescription drugs because it is not prescribed .
( Physicians merely authorize in writing that a patient with a debilitating medical condition might benefit from its use . )
However , seeds used to grow medical marijuana would qualify for the exemption on agricultural products , the opinion said .
In an interview with The Denver Post , Suthers emphasized that the opinion did not speak to the legality of selling medical marijuana itself , only whether the sale of it is taxable .
He said the sale of illegal drugs is taxable , so the sale of medical marijuana could be taxed , regardless of its legal status .
There is an argument that voters did not authorize medical - marijuana dispensaries when they approved Amendment 20 , Suthers said , adding that federal law prohibits them .
The Obama administration has said it would not intervene in states with medical - marijuana laws .
Suthers said his office had no plans to issue an opinion on dispensaries .
“ I think it ’s most likely that it ’s the legislature that is going to clarify the standing of dispensaries , ” he said .

Here 's a strange story : the European Union is leaning hard on Canada to adopt a new " resale right " under which creators would receive compensation — even when the item is resold .
Currently , in both the US and Canada , the basic principle of " first sale " applies , which says that a creator or manufacturer gives up the right to control further uses of that work after it has been sold , or to keep taking a cut of the profits .
Creative industries have long hated this ; when we took a lengthy look at first sale one year ago , we noted that the music and book businesses have long wanted a cut of resale profits .
How can it be right , they argue , that they make only one sale of a book or CD which can then be resold repeatedly to many other people ?
( One never hears home builders make the same argument , though it would seem even more applicable . )
Europe wants that to change .
As part of a comprehensive bilateral trade deal it 's working out right now with Canada , the EU has asked for a host of intellectual property changes : Canada will need to extend its copyright terms by another two decades , will need to ban the circumvention of DRM , will need to adopt a " making available right , " and must implement a " new resale " right giving creators a cut of the money every time their work is resold in the future .
The resale right is quite limited .
According to a leaked version of the draft treaty , it applies only to " the author of an original work of art . "
How a " work of art " is defined is n't spelled out in the document text , but a little digging turned up the definition .
Europe has actually had such a resale right since 2001 , and the treaty is an attempt to extend that right to Canada .
Europe 's Directive 2001 / 84 / EC says that the right covers only " works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures , collages , paintings , drawings , engravings , prints , lithographs , sculptures , tapestries , ceramics , glassware and photographs , provided they are made by the artist himself or are copies considered to be original works of art . "
When an artist sells a painting , for instance , no special fee is paid ( since the artist collects the cash ) .
But whenever an artwork is sold by an art professional like a gallery owner or auction house ( private sales are excluded ) , a percentage of the purchase goes back to the artist every time a sale is made .
This fee is a right that can actually be inherited by family members , and it works on a sliding scale ; 4 percent of sales up to � 50,000 slides down to 0.25 percent when the sale is more than � 500,000 with a cap of � 12,500 .
Artists collect their money by registering with various " collecting societies " who centralize the payment process and then disburse the money .
It 's an odd system , but one meant to " ensure that authors of graphic and plastic works of art share in the economic success of their original works of art , " says the law .
" It helps to redress the balance between the economic situation of authors of graphic and plastic works of art and that of other creators who benefit from successive exploitations of their works . "
The 2002 edition of Law , Ethics , and the Visual Arts explains the logic behind these laws in Europe .
In point of fact , while Impressionist masters , excluded from official exhibitions , were scorned by the public , certain shrewd dealers bought their paintings at ridiculously low prices .
General disdain was followed by infatuation and these same paintings then commanded extraordinary amounts of money .
Examples abound : a Degas painting , originally sold for 500 francs , was auctioned off for 436,000 frances in 1912 ...
The artists were excluded from this wealth .
Does " first sale " matter in a licensed , digital world ?
The resale right chips away at the inviolability of " first sale " in way that does n't much matter to most people now , but might in the future .
The 2001 EU Directive makes plain that the EU will seek to extend the resale right to other countries and will push for it to become a mandatory part of copyright 's " founding document , " the Berne Convention .
Currently , the convention supports the resale right , but only if a country has a national law adopting it ( it 's not mandatory ) .
But the Berne text goes further than the EU currently does , covering not just original artwork but also " original manuscripts of writers and composers . "
If this section becomes compulsory , Berne signatories will need to provide resale protections to art , manuscripts , and original scores .
Still , it applies only to original objects and not to copies — but it 's not hard to see how , once the resale right is embedded more widely in national law , the groups that already agitate for some form of resale revenue wo n't step up their pleas to be included in the scheme .
Or perhaps they wo n't need to bother .
The combination of digital technology , DRM , and " licensing " rather than " sales " has already allowed content owners to put their work in a chokehold .
Think of Kindle content as an example : it 's DRM - wrapped , can't be resold , and is n't " owned " in the way a book is .
Who needs a resale right when resale is n't a possibility ?
I WAS EXPECTING A 6 % PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH QUARTER , BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS !!!
Productivity increased 9.5 percent in the nonfarm business sector during the third quarter of 2009 as unit labor costs fell 5.2 percent ( seasonally adjusted annual rates ) .
In manufacturing , productivity increased 13.6 percent while unit labor costs fell 7.1 percent ...
Back in the 1930s there was a Polish Marxist economist , Michel Kalecki , who argued that recessions were functional for the ruling class and for capitalism because they created excess supply of labor , forced workers to work harder to keep their jobs , and so produced a rise in the rate of relative surplus - value .
For thirty years , ever since I got into this business , I have been mocking Michel Kalecki .
I have been pointing out that recessions see a much sharper fall in profits than in wages .
I have been saying that the pace of work slows in recessions -- that employers are more concerned with keeping valuable employees in their value chains than using a temporary high level of unemployment to squeeze greater work effort out of their workers .
I do n't think that I can mock Michel Kalecki any more , ever again .
What ’s up with Barack Obama ?
The candidate for change once promised to take on the powerful banking interests but is now doing their bidding .
Finally , a leading Democrat , in this case Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd , has a good idea for monitoring the Wall Street fat cats who all but destroyed the American economy , and the Obama administration condemns it .
Dodd wants to take supervisory power from the Federal Reserve , which is controlled by the banks it pretends to monitor , and put it in the hands of a new independent agency .
That makes sense given the Fed ’s abject failure to properly monitor the financial sector over the past decade as that industry got drunk on greed .
As Dodd ’s spokeswoman Kirstin Brost put it : “ The Federal Reserve flat out failed at supervising the largest , most complex firms . ”
But White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee frets that taking power from the Fed would cause financial industry “ nervousness . ”
Is n’t that the whole point of government regulation — to make the bandits look over their shoulders before they launch their next destructive scam ?
Not so in the view of Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin , who blithely insists that the Fed “ is the best agency equipped for the task of supervising the largest , most complex firms , ” despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary .
There is some irony in the fact that the largest of those complex firms got to be “ too big to fail ” because of the radical deregulatory legislation that Wolin drafted during his previous incarnation as the Treasury Department ’s general counsel in the Clinton administration .
Wolin is now deputy to Timothy Geithner , who as head of the New York Fed in the five years preceding the banking meltdown looked the other way as the disaster began to unfold .
Why is Barack Obama allowing these retreads from the Clinton era who went on to great riches on Wall Street to set economic policy for his administration ?
The fatal hallmark of this president ’s financial policy is that it is being designed by the very people whose previous legislative efforts created the mess that enriched them while impoverishing the nation , and they now want more of the same .
In the Clinton years , Wolin was general counsel to then - Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , the key architect of the radical deregulation that caused the recent banking collapse .
Summers went off to work for hedge funds and banks that paid him $ 15 million in 2008 while he was advising Obama .
Meanwhile , Wolin became general counsel for Hartford Insurance Corp. , which had to be bailed out by the taxpayers because it took advantage of the radical deregulation that he helped write into law .
Wolin , Geithner and Summers were all protégés of Robert Rubin , who , as Clinton ’s treasury secretary , was the grand author of the strategy of freeing Wall Street firms from their Depression - era constraints .
It was Wolin who , at Rubin ’s behest , became a key force in drafting the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which ended the barrier between investment and commercial banks and insurance companies , thus permitting the new financial behemoths to become too big to fail .
Two stunning examples of such giants that had to be rescued with public funds are Citigroup bank , where Rubin went to “ earn ” $ 120 million after leaving the Clinton White House , and the Hartford Insurance Co. , where Wolin landed after he left Treasury .
Both Citigroup and Hartford would not have gotten into trouble were it not for the enabling legislation that the three Clinton officials pushed through while they were in power .
But even with that law , had Geithner been on the case protecting the public interest while head of the New York Fed , much of the damage could have been avoided .
Thanks to the legislation that Wolin helped write , the limits preventing mergers between insurance companies and banks imposed during Franklin Roosevelt ’s presidency was reversed .
Hartford got into banking , and as The Washington Times observed in a scathing editorial , “ Hartford … rushed to buy regulated savings and loans just so they could call themselves banks and qualify for government TARP funds . ”
Wolin collected his millions while the taxpayers were obliged to cover Hartford ’s losses .
It is depressing for a columnist who had great hopes for Obama to be forced by the facts to credit editors at the right - wing Washington Times for getting it right when they opined : “ Revolving doors between industry and the administration and fat - cat political contributors getting bailed out at taxpayer expense sound like business as usual .
This certainly is n’t change we can believe in . ”
Please , Mr. President , say it ai n’t so .

Algae seem harmless enough .
These precursors to plants thrive throughout the world 's waters .
But these single - celled plants have global consequences .
We can thank them for oxygen in the atmosphere , oil in the lithosphere as well as dead zones in the oceans and now even a dead horse in France .
That 's right .
The fumes from decomposing algae on a French beach killed a horse and rendered its rider unconscious this past summer .
And poisonous tides caused by algal blooms make eating shellfish dicey at times as well as causing mass die - offs of fish , birds and even sea -going mammals .
Plus , according to a new theory , that might just be a small taste of the plants ' killing ability .
James Castle and John Rodgers of Clemson University think that such algal blooms — triggered by warming water or an increase in nutrients — might be behind the five largest mass extinctions in Earth 's history .
Usually asteroid impacts or massive volcanism get the blame , paired with climate change , but it may be the subsequent bloom in toxic algae that really drove death .
There 's plenty of evidence for such blooms in the geologic record .
Of course , it remains unclear whether algal blooms caused die - offs or merely coincided with them .
And it 's most likely that some combination of factors , including poisonous algae perhaps , helped wipe out 90 percent of all marine life some 250 million years ago , for example .
The bad news ?
Such murderous algae is on the march again thanks to a changing climate , creeping northward into newly warmer U.S. waters .
Beware the killer algae !

Russian officials say the death toll from a nightclub fire in the Urals city of Perm almost three weeks ago has risen to 152 .
The regional branch of the Emergency Situations Ministry said Friday that two women died of their injuries on Thursday .
It said 74 others remained hospitalized .
The blaze at the Lame Horse nightclub broke out on Dec. 5 when an indoor fireworks display ignited a ceiling decorated with branches .
Five people , including the club ’s owner , have been jailed pending an investigation .

The Lithuanian government has concluded that the CIA operated a secret " black site " in Lithuania for high - level Al Qaeda detainees , and that a second secret CIA facility was established in the heart of the capital city of Vilnius .
The government began an investigation after an exclusive ABC News report that the CIA operated a secret black site prison for terror suspects in the Baltic country in 2004 and 2005 .
In a report released Tuesday , the National Security Committee of the Lithuanian parliament recommended that intelligence officials be criminally investigated for their role in establishing the prisons .
In addition to the prison outside Vilnius that was located and revealed by ABC News , the report says that Lithuanian intelligence made a guesthouse in downtown Vilnius available for CIA use as early as 2002 , though they could not prove that it had been used .
Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius criticized the U.S. government for establishing the prisons , saying it had manipulated Lithuanian officials with " essentially Soviet methods " into breaking the law .
However , he suggested that the second prison , which could only hold one prisoner in a single cell , had never been used .
Arvydas Anusauskas , head of the parliamentary investigating committee , said he did not have enough evidence to prove that the guesthouse had been used , but could not rule out the possibility .
In November , an exclusive ABC News report revealed that the CIA had built one of its secret " black site " prisons inside an exclusive riding academy outside Vilnius , Lithuania .
Where affluent Lithuanians once rode show horses and sipped coffee at a café , the CIA installed a concrete structure where it could use harsh tactics to interrogate up to eight suspected al - Qaeda terrorists at a time .
" The activities in that prison were illegal , " said human rights researcher John Sifton .
" They included various forms of torture , including sleep deprivation , forced standing , painful stress positions . "
Lithuanian officials provided ABC News with the documents of what they called a CIA front company , Elite , LLC , which purchased the property and built the " black site " in 2004 .
Lithuania agreed to allow the CIA prison after President George W. Bush visited the country in 2002 and pledged support for Lithuania 's efforts to join NATO .
Lithuania was one of three eastern European countries , along with Poland and Romania , where the CIA secretly interrogated suspected high - value al - Qaeda terrorists .
" The new members of NATO were so grateful for the U.S. role in getting them into that organization that they would do anything the U.S. asked for during that period , " said former White House counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke , now an ABC News consultant .
" They were eager to please and eager to be cooperative on security and on intelligence matters . "
Until March 2004 , the site was a riding academy and café owned by a local family .
The facility is in the town of Antaviliai , in the forest 20 kilometers northeast of the city center of Vilnius , near an exclusive suburb where many government officials live .

Herschel 's splendid spectra
27 November 2009
Since its launch in May this year the teams working on the Herschel Space Observatory have made steady progress as they prepare to hand over the observatory to the world ’s astronomical community .
Early reports on the mission focussed on stunning images from the two cameras onboard .
Today , the three Herschel spectrometers take centre stage , as new spectra are released .
In contrast to images that reveal the distribution of light across the field of view , spectra provide an astronomical fingerprint of the objects being studied .
Detailed analyses of these spectra provide insight into the physical and chemical composition of the objects .
The newly issued Herschel spectra , obtained with the SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer , the PACS integral field spectrometer , and the HIFI heterodyne instrument touch on a number of key science goals for the mission and are an early demonstration of the capabilities of the observatory .
A broad spectrum of objects has been observed , including comets , massive stars , star - forming regions , and a variety of galaxies .
Fabulously detailed spectra reveal forests of emission lines and signatures of elements , some detected for the first time .
For full details click on the images below .
The road to routine operations
Since launch on 14 May this year , the Herschel Space Observatory has been subject to a rigorous series of tests and preparatory activities leading to a fully operational observatory .
Early emphasis was placed on performing observations with the SPIRE and PACS imaging photometers as this also provided the opportunity to test the optics and pointing characteristics of the telescope .
With the confirmation provided by these observations of the excellent quality of the Herschel telescope , the way was cleared to include all three spectrometers in the regular operations planning .
The SPIRE and PACS instruments are now nearing the end of the science demonstration phase and will soon be entering routine operations phase .
During the performance verification phase the HIFI instrument suffered a setback which required it to be put into temporary hibernation while the nature of the problem was investigated and a solution found .
A plan of action leading to HIFI full operations in January has been provisionally agreed .
( For further information see the Herschel operations blog – link in the right - hand menu . )
Forthcoming workshop and symposium
Results from the science demonstration phase will be presented to the community at a dedicated workshop to be held at the European Space Astronomy Centre , Spain , from 17 - 18 December 2009 .
A symposium dedicated to the first science results from Herschel will be held the European Space Research and Technology Centre , in the Netherlands , from 3 - 7 May 2010 .

As a sobering example of how members of Congress can be spoon - fed the views and even the exact words of high - powered lobbying firms , consider remarks inserted into the Congressional Record after the debate and vote on health care reform in the House .
Statements by more than a dozen lawmakers were ghostwritten , in whole or in part , by Washington lobbyists working for Genentech , one of the worlds largest biotechnology companies .
E-mail messages obtained by The New York Times show that the lobbyists drafted one statement for Democrats and another for Republicans .
The lobbyists , employed by Genentech and by two Washington law firms , were remarkably successful in getting the statements printed in the Congressional Record under the names of different members of Congress .
The apparent goal was to show that , even though there were sharp divisions between the parties on the overall reform bill ( only one Republican voted for it ) , there was bipartisan support for provisions relating to drugs produced by the biotechnology industry .
One provision , for example , would allow generic competition to expensive biological drugs but only after the original manufacturer had enjoyed 12 years of exclusive use , a generous period by anyones standards .
Asked about the Congressional statements , a lobbyist close to Genentech said :  This happens all the time .
There was nothing nefarious about it . 

Let ’s remember that it all started with a gaggle of moralizing and marginalized religious dissidents who feasted on fowl , and a native relish of sour red berries .
On Thursday , Americans will stop and share a meal like these long - ago Pilgrims .
Thanksgiving is the holiday of hope , as well as drumsticks and football .
It is also the emblem of American identity  of who we are as a people and our distinctive role in history .
The two New York Times  articles above provide a powerful commentary about health care reform ,  and the true power behind the US health care system in general .
They document the level of influence , corruption , and conflict of interest that affects your health .
There should be no doubt about the power the drug industry wields in shaping the US health care system .
Big pharma has been the driving force behind conventional medicine , and the beneficiaries of exploding health care costs for well over a century , and there are no signs that the current health care reform will change any of this .
Yes You , One Person , CAN Make a Difference
During this Thanksgiving season , I want to express my thanks to you for your partnership in the movement of awakening our culture to the truth about natural health and how the drug companies currently control the conventional medical system .
And the best way I know to do that is to share with you how your partnership is making a difference .
This past year our partnership together has been able to FINALLY make a significant dent in the culture .
We provided powerful explanations from some of the top experts in the world on these issues , and you were able to spread and share that message with MILLIONS .
You were so effective that the MAJORITY of the US population have refused the H1N1 vaccine despite the massive government propaganda and deception .
Doctors Typically Destroy Health Because Its about Wealth , Not Health
Drug companies are not here to bring health to the population but to scam them on one level for vast amounts of money , by treating the symptoms and not addressing the cause .
Sir William Ossler , MD ( 1849 –1919 ) , one of the leading physicians at the turn of the twentieth century , and considered by many to be the founder of modern medicine , said that one of the first duties of the physician is to educate the masses not to take medicine .
You Are Making a Difference
Most everyone reading this does not understand that when I started this newsletter I was not a natural medicine expert .
I was a simple family physician seeing patients in my office , who just decided I wanted to tell the truth about health to more people .
When I first started Mercola.com in 1997 , to educate people about natural medicine , I had less than 100 subscribers and 300 page views per month .
Twelve years later we have 1.5 million subscribers from nearly every country in the world , and we have over twenty million page views per month .

Do we have a ways to go ?
Absolutely , but together we are making a difference .
You need to remember the obvious .
We OUTNUMBER the evildoers by thousands to one .
However , they are very well organized and have loads more money , power , and influence than we do .
You need to know that their Achilles Heel is our ability to communicate with each other and learn the truth about their lies and scams .
So persistently reading our newsletter and others that share the truth , and spreading the message with those you love and care about , will ultimately unite us enough that we can defeat them .

Much - hyped video game Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 has smashed UK sales records on its first day of release .
The first - person shooter sold an estimated 1.23 million units and grossed around £ 47 m , according to industry body Elspa .
The game sold almost double that of the previous record holder , Grand Theft Auto IV ( GTA IV ) .
Hundreds of gamers gathered at shops around the world ahead of its release at 00:00 GMT on 10 November .
" These first day sales figures are astonishing and clear evidence that videogames are now mainstream in the UK , " said Michael Rawlinson , director general of the entertainment and leisure software publishers association ( Elspa ) .
" Our form of interactive entertainment has completely come of age . "
The publishers of Modern Warfare 2 , Activision , have predicted total sales of 3 m across the UK while some analysts believe it could sell 10 m copies globally in the run up to Christmas .
Robert Kotick , CEO of Activision , described it as " one of the largest entertainment launches of any media of all time " .
Modern Warfare 2 is the sixth instalment in the Call of Duty series and gives players the chance to be a member of a military strike force that takes on a Russian ultra-nationalist terrorist group .
The game has drawn criticism because one section , prefaced by a warning screen , involves a player joining a massacre of civilians at an airport .
Labour MP Keith Vaz condemned the game saying he was " absolutely shocked " by its violence .
In response , Activision said the scene was " not representative of overall experience " .
Labour MP
Tom Watson has set up a Facebook group to defend games such as Call of Duty from their critics .
" This is specifically intended for an adult audience and accordingly has emotional , adult content , " said Mr Rawlinson .
" As an 18 - rated videogame , it is important that this game is not played by children , and parents should be appropriately vigilant . "

Global temperatures are on a path to rise by an average of 6C by the end of the century as CO2 emissions increase and the Earth 's natural ability to absorb the gas declines , according to a major new study .
Scientists said that CO2 emissions have risen by 29 % in the past decade alone and called for urgent action by leaders at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen to agree drastic emissions cuts in order to avoid dangerous climate change .
The news will give greater urgency to the diplomatic manoeuvring before the Copenhagen summit .
President Obama and President Hu of China attempted to breathe new life into the negotiations today by announcing that they intended to set targets for easing greenhouse gas emissions next month .
Obama said that he and Hu would continue to press for a deal that would " rally the world " .
The new study is the most comprehensive analysis to date of how economic changes and shifts in the way people have used the land in the past five decades have affected the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere .
" The global trends we are on with CO2 emissions from fossil fuels suggest that we 're heading towards 6C of global warming , " said Corinne Le Quéré of the University of East Anglia who led the study with colleagues at the British Antarctic Survey .
" This is very different to the trend we need to be on to limit global climate change to 2C [ the level required to avoid dangerous climate change ] . "
That would require CO2 emissions from all sources to peak between 2015 and 2020 and that the global per capita emissions be decreased to 1 tonne of CO2 by 2050 .
Currently the average US citizen emits 19.9 tonnes per year and UK citizens emit 9.3 tonnes .
By studying 50 years of data on carbon emissions and combining with estimates of human carbon emissions and other sources such as volcanoes , the team was able to estimate how much CO2 is being absorbed naturally by forests , oceans and soil .
The team conclude in the journal Nature Geoscience that those natural sinks are becoming less efficient , absorbing 55 % of the carbon now , compared with 60 % half a century ago .
The drop in the amount absorbed is equivalent to 405 m tonnes of carbon or around 60 times the annual output of Drax coal - fired power station , which is the largest in the UK .
" Based on our knowledge of recent trends in CO2 emissions and the time it takes to change energy infrastructure around the world and on the response of the sinks to climate change and variability , the Copenhagen conference is our last chance to stabilise climate at 2C above preindustrial levels in a smooth and organised way , " said Le Quéré .
" If the agreement is too weak or if the commitments are not respected , we will be on a path to 5C or 6C . "
Le Quéré 's work , part of the Global Carbon Project , showed that CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels increased at an average of 3.4 % a year between 2000 and 2008 compared with 1 % a year in the 1990s .
Despite the global economic downturn , emissions still increased by 2 % in 2008 .
The vast majority of the recent increase has come from China and India , though a quarter of their emissions are a direct result of trade with the west .
In recent years , the global use of coal has also surpassed oil .
Based on projected changes in GDP , the scientists said that emissions for 2009 were expected to fall to 2007 levels , before increasing again in 2010 .
But Le Quéré 's conclusion on the decline of the world 's carbon sinks is not universally accepted .
Wolfgang Knorr of the University of Bristol recently published a study in Geophysical Research Letters , using similar data to Le Quéré , where he argued that the natural carbon sinks had not noticeably changed .
" Our apparently conflicting results demonstrate what doing cutting - edge science is really like and just how difficult it is to accurately quantify such data , " said Knorr .
The amount of CO2 that natural carbon sinks can absorb varies from year to year depending on climactic and other natural conditions , and this means that overall trends can be difficult to detect .
Le Quéré said her team 's analysis had been able to remove more of the noise in the data that is associated with the natural annual variability of CO2 levels due to , for example , El Niño or volcanic eruptions .
" Our methods are different – Knorr uses annual data , we use monthly data and I think we can remove more of the variability . "
Jo House of the University of Bristol , who worked on the Nature Geoscience paper , said : " It is difficult to accurately estimate sources and sinks of CO2 , particularly in emissions from land use change where data on the area and nature of deforestation is poor , and in modelled estimates of the land sink which is strongly affected by inter-annual climate variability .
While the science has advanced rapidly , there are still gaps in our understanding . "
The scientists agreed , however , that an improved understanding of land and ocean CO2 sinks was crucial , since it has a major influence in determining the link between human CO2 emissions and atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gas .
In turn , this has implications for CO2 targets set by governments at climate negotiations .
• The headline to this article was amended on Wednesday 18 November 2009 to make clear that the study said global temperatures could rise 6C by end of century , not that they will do so .
Too many or not enough ?
Population projections are useless for telling us what will happen , but by showing what might , they reveal a tricky trade - off , says Michael Blastland in his regular column .
What do you do given a choice between two demographic time bombs ?
The UK 's population is predicted to rise from 61 m to 71 m by 2033
That 's not a flattering description of what 's happening ( because remember , you - if you live in the UK - and me , we are those time bombs ) , but this is how many see it .
On the one hand , there 's the fear of an explosion in numbers , driven largely by migration , creating a new Birmingham every Tuesday , or whatever the calculation happens to be .
On the other , there 's the ageing population , leaving about three of us to look after and pay the pensions of teeming millions in walking frames .
I might have exaggerated slightly , there , but the issues are real .
These trends are seldom considered together , but both were raised by figures released a few weeks ago .
Our slideshow allows us to compare them and suggests that every outcome will leave someone worried or unhappy .
Click through the slides to see the effect on the population of different assumptions about migration .
The shaded area on each graph shows how it compares with the previous graph .
Baby boom works though middle age
Sides of pyramid are less sloping than in the past , it looks thin at the bottom ( fewer young ) and wide in middle ( working age baby boomers and migrants ) .
Pushing up and out
Migration continues at 2006 rates .
Pyramid swells up and out ( boomers grow old , migrants and their children fill out lower down ) .
Thinner lower down
Slightly lower migration .
A bit thinner in the middle and bottom ( fewer young and working aged ) .
But growth at the top is still there .
Fatter all round
Same shape , but wider most of the way up , especially noticeable among working aged and young ( the bottom and middle ) .
Top heavy
Pyramid becoming a column .
Fewer working aged and young , nearly 100,000 fewer births than any other projection , but still the growth at the top .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
This population pyramid data was prepared for Go Figure by the Office for National Statistics ( thanks folks ) .
Note that these are projections , not forecasts , and simply extrapolate from data that is probably already changing .
Note too that the " no net migration " projection does n't mean no migration , it just means no more people coming in than going out .
If you think there 's not much change here , think again .
For example , by 2033 under the first projection ( slide b ) , there would be about 150,000 more 66 - year - old men and about the same number of extra women ( nearly a 50 % increase ) , with about a couple of hundred thousand more at almost every age into the 90s .
Either the country grows more crowded , or possibly less rich than it could be
The high migration projection adds about 100,000 to 150,000 people at every age up to about the 80s compared with the low migration projection .
Compared to which , the " no net migration " removes about 200,000 people at almost every age up to about 60 .
What the slides suggest is that these two possible futures create a choice , and help us to see something of its scale .
If we restrict migration , it might seriously worsen what 's known as the dependency ratio of elderly to those of working age .
If we allow or encourage migration at recent levels , it would probably bring a big increase in a total population of increasingly diverse origin .
Changing world
So either the country grows more crowded , or possibly less rich than it could be .
You might say that we should just put up with the latter until a smaller number of children works its way through to old age , when the whole population will begin to shrink , and that this would be a good thing in the long run .
But it still creates about a 50 - year difficulty .
Now you can see the potential effects , what would be your choice ?
Is that choice changed by the data ?
Numbers , even the wrong numbers ( since all projections are wrong , as I 've noted in the past ) can help us make better sense of change , but they can't tell us what our political values should be .
So perhaps what 's most usefully confirmed here is something we all know but often forget in the heat of the argument , that the world is dynamic .
There is no stable state of affairs we can arrive at that solves all our problems .
The large - scale effects of all our individual choices and prospects might be , on aggregate , those that no individual would choose .
Makes you wonder if all our lives would be so much easier if it was n't for , well if it was n't for us .
Below is a selection of your comments .
People get so tied up in the way future immigration may change the makeup of the UK that they ignore the economic reality .
It 's good to remember that the only constant in life is change !
Richard Spurr , Leics .
What you do n't comment on is in the steady increase of retirement age .
As the aging population becomes healthier and more able to continue working longer , the number of pensioners who need support from the working population should , in theory , remain roughly the same thus meaning no need to keep importing people to pay taxes .
This would then mean no population growth but just simply extending people 's working lives ( which probably is n't a vote winner ! ) .
Andy , Guildford
What you appear to be ignoring is a tendency among some economic migrants to come here and work for a few years , before returning " home " .
How does that affect your figures ?
P Gain , London Seems another option would be no net migration combined with an increase in the retirement age - this would mean the reduction in those aged 20 - 65 could be offset by those aged 65 - 70 ( say ) carrying on working , and there would be no need for migrants to fill jobs .

Paul Landskroener , the clerk of the Twin Cities Friends Meeting ( St. Paul and Minneapolis , MN ) announced on Monday on Minnesota Public Radio ’s All Things Considered that the group will stop signing marriage certificates for opposite sex couple until same sex marriage is legalized in Minnesota .
Landskroener said , “ We ’re simply trying to be consistent with the will of God as we perceive it …
Everything else proceeds as it normally has , except that we will not sign the marriage certificate . ”
The religious group , perhaps better recognized by the name “ Quakers ” , is one of a handful of Quaker Meetings nationwide that has made the decision to stop signing the marriage certificates for opposite - sex couples until the state of Minnesota legalizes gay marriage .
While a recognized religion , Quakers , or Meetings of Friends as they are also known , do not ordain ministers .
Marriages are conducted by couples reciting their vows in front of the congregation , after which witnesses sign the marriage certificate .

In the context of this new decision , the signature of a Justice of the Peace or Judge or other officiate will be required to make the ceremony legally recognized .
The Quakers have been holding wedding services for both same sex and opposite sex marriages , despite the lack of recognition for those same - sex wedding ceremonies .
After a three year period during which this new decision was considered , this group of Minnesota Quakers made the decision that this form of protesting the lack of gay marriage recognition was consistent with how they perceived the will of God .
Some Meetings of the Friends feel that not recognizing gay marriage is unjust .
Others do not .
There is much less centralization within the Society of Friends as each local group sets their own policy .
A web site for an Ontario group , Religious Tolerance.org , addresses the range of positions held by the local meetings which are similar to the range of positions professed by other Christian denominations regarding homosexuality and bi-sexuality .
For example , according to the web site , as far back as 1963 in the UK , British Quakers published the book “ Towards a Quaker View of Sex ” embracing the position that God can be present in any relationship “ where there is a measure of selfless love ” , and the Westminster UK Quakers accepted the view that God loves all people regardless of their sexual orientation , and that sexuality was God -given .
In the United States , the Hartford , Connecticut Quakers as far back as 1986 issued a statement recognizing both same - sex and heterosexual celebrations of marriage , and in 1988 the Beacon Hill Quaker Meeting in Massachusetts also issued a statement in support of recognizing same - sex marriage ceremonies .
The Beacon Hill Quaker Statement says , in part ,
“ Mindful that only the heterosexual couples among us currently have the right to legally sanctioned marriages and its privileges , the Meeting asks Friends , and particularly couples preparing for marriage , to examine how best to respond and bear witness to the inequalities still present in the system . ”
The Quakers in Madison issued a statement , “ Madison Affirmation on Homosexuality and Christian Faith ” , declaring they believe homosexuality was “ neither a sickness nor a sin ” , and finding that “ homosexual persons have been condemned and mistreated by the followers of Jesus Christ ” .
In New Zealand , the Aotearoa Quaker Meeting in 1995 similarly pledged “ to seek formal ways of recognizing a variety of commitments , including gay and lesbian partnerships . ”
That statement also asserted the beautiful words “ Love has many shapes and colors and is not finite .
It can not be measured or defined in terms of sexual orientation , ”
Other Quaker groups just as emphatically do NOT share this view of marriage and sexual orientation .
In 1992 , the Evangelical Friends Church Mid America Meeting affirmed an opposing position , comparing homosexuality to adultery , condemning both .
They issued the statement , which included the view “ Homosexual activity , like an adulterous relationship , is clearly condemned in the Scriptures . ” and “ We as Evangelical Friends believe that sexuality has moral implications unlike race , gender , and or national origins . ”
Although Minnesota is certainly ‘ Mid-American ’ , the Friends Meeting of the Twin Cities has sided with their co-religionists in Madison , Wisconsin rather than the position of the Evangelical Friends .
I wo n’t be able to look at my morning cylindrical cardboard box of Quaker Oats ’ oatmeal from now on quite the same .
O nos seguimos riendo , o nos carga la realidad .
Porque para sobrellevar las cosas en este querido México se necesita , qué duda cabe , una dosis de inconciencia , algo de caradura , una pizca de cinismo y mucho , mucho , muchísimo sentido del humor .
Pero de ese humor que dignifica , ¡vaya ! , porque la risa tonta como que tampoco .
Un asesinato más .
Sí y no .
Uno más , en el México que decidió declararle la guerra al crimen y vive , tiro por viaje ( nunca mejor dicho , por cierto ) asesinatos reales e imaginados .
Pero no uno más , porque sucedió en lugar y circunstancia de esos que asustan , cuando penetran los espacios habituales de los ciudadanos que suelen llevar las cosas en paz y gustan en ir de sus corazones a sus asuntos .
La historia en breve : el martes 1 de diciembre , a eso del mediodía , en conocida cafetería ( Starbucks , para mayor seña ) de la Colonia del Valle de la Ciudad de México , asesinaron a Édgar Enrique Bayardo del Villar , testigo protegido de la Procuraduría General de la República .
Lo que se sabe es que entraron , lo asesinaron y se fueron .
En el camino quedó herido un escolta de Bayardo y una mujer que tuvo la mala suerte de estar en espacio y tiempo equivocados .
Las interpretaciones de lo sucedido son muchas , e implican vínculos con grupos del crimen organizado .
Pero eso es asunto de especialistas ; lo importante para los simples mortales como yo es que en conocida cafetería , a plena luz del día , en una colonia de clase media de la siempre ajetreada Ciudad de México , entraron , asesinaron y se fueron .
No habían pasado minutos siquiera de que la noticia corriera , cuando el mexicanísimo sentido del humor se había desatado .
En las redes sociales , en las conversaciones de la calle , entre algunos conductores mediáticos : desde el ya muy trillado y bobo " quieres que te dispare un café " ( en México , disparar , en un contexto así , significa invitar , convidar , regalar ) - que por cierto , había sido chiste socorrido cuando hace muchos años asesinaron al conductor - comediante Paco Stanley en una taquería del Sur de la Ciudad de México - , hasta la broma , un poco pesada y de ácido tono seinfeldiano , sobre la cantidad de ' shots ' ( disparos ) extras con que uno pediría a partir de ahora , su café en Starbucks .
Otros mostraban el orgullo patrio ( " por eso yo compro café de Chiapas " ) , se jactaban del desdén de clase ( " por eso en mi cafecito barriobajero no voy a poner Internet " ) o de plano apelaban a la incontinencia cafetera ( " ve corriendo al Starbucks , ya ves que ahí te despachan rapidito " ) .
La broma , sí. Dicen , en afirmación folclorista , que a los mexicanos nos gusta reírnos hasta de la muerte .
Por supuesto no a todos place este sentido del humor , que se va haciendo cada vez más negro .
No reconoce el dolor humano y es de mal gusto , argumentan ; no respeta a las víctimas ni advierte la profundidad del drama , reclaman .
Lo cual puede ser cierto .
Pero más que excusarlo , yo lo entiendo como necesaria válvula de escape de las tensiones de una sociedad que se siente agraviada , se sabe dolida y se reconoce poco atendida por quienes debieran velar por su bienestar .
Lo han dicho todos , desde Bajtín hasta Zizek , de Paz a Portilla , y hasta Serrat pues : cuando la verdad ha perdido sentido , la única forma de expresarla es a través del chiste , y con la risa que subvierte .
Un buen amigo , lagunero de origen - esa también vapuleada zona del Norte mexicano - me contaba que en una de sus recientes visitas a su ciudad natal , había estado conviviendo con amigos .
La costumbre dicta que , para pasar el rato , los locales suelen cargar neveras portátiles llenas de cervezas , y recorrer en sus camionetas la zona , mientras escuchan música y conversan .
En días pasados , sin embargo , se había suscitado un ajuste de cuentas entre bandas criminales rivales , y en una nevera había aparecido la cabeza cercenada de uno de los implicados .
Desde entonces corre la broma entre los lugareños : " acá tengo la nevera , ¿qué quieres ? , ¿ cerveza o cabeza ? "
Mi amigo , que tiene buen sentido del humor , reconoció que ante la anécdota sintió frío .
Porque hasta la risa por usarse se agota , sobre todo cuando la realidad se impone .
Para muchos habitantes de la Ciudad de México , en especial de un sector de la población que se sentía a salvo de estos infortunios , el primero de diciembre quedará como un día en que se mostró que , como en otros lugares del mundo y en otros momentos de la historia , lo malo también puede tocar a nuestra puerta .
Pero la vida sigue , los cafés continúan atestados , las calles mantienen su ir y venir , y todos encontramos la forma de conferir sentido a un México que se niega a dejar de ser .
Es justo por eso que celebro que a la tragedia siga de inmediato el chiste y se mantenga el sentido del humor .
Lo vivimos en el terremoto del 85 , en las explosiones , vaya hasta en la reciente crisis por la Influenza AH1N1 .
Y espero lo sigamos pudiendo hacer , porque de mucho nos acordamos cuando reímos los mexicanos ; si no de otra cosa , por lo menos de nosotros mismos .
Entonces qué , ¿quieres que te dispare un café ?
Programmers write testcases for programs to check that the programs work correctly .
When a test - case fails , a programmer wants to know two things : first , why specifically did the test fail ( which assertion did not hold ? ) , and secondly , what is wrong with the program ( or the test case ! ) ?
Last Friday
I released CHP 1.5.0 , which adds better support for testing , tracing , and the combination of the two .
Tracing refers in theoretical terms to recording a computation ’s history : practically , it means keeping a log of all the CHP synchronisation events ( e.g. channel communications ) that happened in your program .
CHP supports several types of tracing , but for this post I will use the simplest type : a CSP trace , which is just a linear sequence of events that occurred .
Let ’s explore the combination of testing and tracing in practice .
Previously I used an example involving a four - item pipeline to find the mode ( most common element ) of a list .
Let ’s use this example again , but since this is a post about testing , we ’ll introduce an error : we will forget to include the sort process at the front of the pipeline .
To use the tracing framework , you have to augment your code slightly to label parts of your code .
This involves using arrLabel instead of arr , and *<<<* instead of <<< ( see the remarks at the end of this post for why , and for a way to shorten the tedious labelling ) :
badMode = ( arrLabel " group " group ) *>>>* ( arrLabel " maxByLength " maxByLength ) *>>>* ( arrLabel " head " head ) where maxByLength = maximumBy ( comparing length )
We can then join this pipeline onto one that takes a string , and splits it into words — making a pipeline that looks for the most frequent word :
mostFreqWord = ( arrLabel " makeLower " makeLower ) *>>>* ( arrLabel " words " words ) *>>>* badMode where makeLower = map toLower
Finally , we can provide a simple test sentence for the pipeline that should pick out the most frequent word , “ the ” :
testFreqWord = testCHPIn
Out ( const ( == " the " ) ) ( runPipelineLabel mostFreqWord )
" The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog " main :: IO ( ) main = runTestTT testFreqWord >> return ()
If we run this output , what do we get ?
Well , the test case fails , so we are told that , but we are also automatically given the trace of the failing test case :
### Failure : testCHP
Failure ; trace : < _c4 , makeLower -> words . " the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog " , words -> group . [" the " , " quick " , " brown " , " fox " , " jumps " , " over " , " the " , " lazy " , " dog " ] , group -> maxByLength . [ [ " the " ] , [ " quick " ] , [ " brown " ] , [ " fox " ] , [" jumps " ] , [ " over " ] , [ " the " ] , [" lazy " ] , [" dog " ] ] , maxByLength - > head . [ " dog " ] , _c5 > Cases : 1 Tried : 1 Errors : 0 Failures : 1
So how do we read this trace ?
The trace is delimited by angle brackets , and is a comma-separated sequence of events ( I ’ll look to tighten up the grammar in future to allow for automated parsing ) .
The _c4 is an unnamed event at the start ( this is the channel used in the test framework to inject the data ) .
Then the following events are channel communications of the form channel - name . data - value .
So makeLower -> words is the channel name , and " the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog " is the data value .
The channel names have been automatically generated based on the two processes that the channel connects , and the data value has been printed out using show .
We can use this trace to immediately see which values were passed between each process pair , and thus track down the problem .
You can see from looking at the trace that group is not grouping the two “ the ”s together , which is because the list is not sorted .
We can easily fix this by putting in the missing sort process .
The trace with sort added now works as we would expect :
< _c5 , makeLower -> words . " the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog " , words -> sort . [ " the " , " quick " , " brown " , " fox " , " jumps " , " over " , " the " , " lazy " , " dog " ] , sort -> group . [" brown " , " dog " , " fox " , " jumps " , " lazy " , " over " , " quick " , " the " , " the " ] , group -> maxByLength . [ [ " brown " ] , [ " dog " ] , [ " fox " ] , [" jumps " ] , [ " lazy " ] , [ " over " ] , [ " quick " ] , [ " the " , " the " ] ] , maxByLength - > head . [ " the " , " the " ] , _c6 >
Tracing is useful for tracking down problems and strange behaviours in your system , so integrating it with the test framework made a lot of sense .
You can trace any program , not just test - cases , but I will explore that at a future date .
You may observe that tracing ( at least a CSP trace ) is not too far different from adding print ( or Debug. Trace.trace ) statements around your program .
The main differences are :
Channels are named when you join together processes , so you do n’t have to modify the definition of the original processes to get intelligible trace output ( unless you want to trace the internal channels ) .
Tracing can be turned on or off at run-time ( by changing the top - level call to runCHP ) , rather than at compile - time with pre-processor macros — but if tracing is switched off , you do not incur any overhead .
The order in the trace is guaranteed to reflect the real ordering of the channel communications , so you ca n’t end up with an unrepresentative order that usually happens when you put print statements in a concurrent program .
Remarks :
There are several side notes to add to this post .
Many readers will probably recoil at my introduction of a *>>>* combinator .
This has type :
(*>>>*) :: Show b => ProcessPipelineLabel a b -> ProcessPipelineLabel b c -> ProcessPipelineLabel a c
The show constraint is the reason that I could not declare an arrow instance — so any fix to this problem had to involve declaring a similar combinator outside the arrow , unless I ’ve missed another approach .
The naming of the processes can be simplified with the use of a pre-processor .
Here are the same process declarations , named using the C pre-processor :
# define PR ( p ) ( arrLabel # p p ) badMode = PR ( group ) *>>>* PR ( maxByLength ) *>>>* PR ( head ) where maxByLength = maximumBy ( comparing length ) mostFreqWord = PR ( makeLower ) *>>>* PR ( words ) *>>>* badMode where makeLower = map toLower
Unfortunately , GHC with the - cpp flag does n’t support this stringize operator so you have to run the C pre-processor on the file first as part of your build process before feeding it to GHC , or use the -F flag with a wrapper script .
Showing the data being passed down the channel obviously forces the data , which may potentially affect the behaviour .
Whether you show the data in the trace can be turned on and off — and you can also supply a custom function to show your data if , for example , you are passing around infinite lists ( you could just print the first three items ) .
I ’ve tried to give the gist here rather than all the details , but the CHP documentation explains the different ways you can record a channel communication in a trace .
I will present this example at the fringe session at the CPA 2009 conference this evening here in Eindhoven .
If anyone is interested , last year ’s paper on tracing is available in my list of publications , with this year ’s publication to be added shortly .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : package - vt - 0.1.3.3 , Haskell Package Versioning Tool
Hi !
I 'm pleased to announce the first release of my program package - vt .
It 's role is to detect changes between two versions of package that should cause version bump .
Recommended versioning policy for Haskell packages is on the wiki [ 1 ] .
The ultimate goal is to get as good approximation of the algorithm specified there as possible .
Currently the tool is far from being complete : it only detects changes to exports in .cabal and module files , but does n't take any types into consideration , not to mention other possible heuristics .
This tool is not meant as a replacement for developer 's own brain .
It can only detect a subset of changes , and there will always be some important changes it wo n't catch , like adding such line : head ( _:y: _ ) = y However , it can be used for some quality checks .
Thing that needs improving is user interface .
No options are currently accepted .
This , and a lot more , will change in future versions .
You can find a Git repo here [ 2 ] .
The repo contains ' tests ' directory with two useful scripts .
You can use them to run package - vt on anything from Hackage .
Here are a few random usage examples :
1 ) Detect small change within module package - vt packages / HCL/1.1/HCL-1.1/HCL.cabal packages /HCL/1.2/HCL-1.2/HCL.cabal
Single changes : ChangeABC : Entity added to module ModuleName " HCL " --- EVar ( UnQual ( Ident " prompt1 " ) ) ---
Biggest change comes from : ChangeABC : Entity added to module ModuleName " HCL " --- EVar ( UnQual ( Ident " prompt1 " ) )
2 ) Detect new module added to .cabal package -vt 0.2.0/ AERN-Net-0.2.0/AERN-Net.cabal 0.2.1/AERN-Net-0.2.1/AERN-Net.cabal
Single changes : ChangeABC : Entity added to module ModuleName " Control.ERNet.Foundations .Process " --- EThingAll ( UnQual ( Ident " ERProcessAction " ) ) ---ChangeABC : Module (s ) added .
( Consider AB change if new modules are likely to cause name collisions ) --- " Control / ERNet / Blocks / Real / LFT " ---
Biggest change comes from : ChangeABC : Module (s ) added .
( Consider AB change if new modules are likely to cause name collisions ) --- " Control / ERNet/ Blocks / Real / LFT " --- 3 ) Using testing script : package - vt correctly detects that AERN - RnToRM - 0.4.9 should rather be 0.5.0 because the module Data .
Number.ER.RnToRm.UnitDom.ChebyshevBase.Polynom .
Field has been removed .
./test-on-package.lhs
AERN-RnToRm -- cut-- >>>
Testing package - vt on AERN - RnToRm - 0.4.2 and AERN - RnToRm -0.4.9 Parse error : VarSym " # " : SrcLoc {srcFilename = " 0.4.2/AERN-RnToRm-0.4.2/src/Data/Number/ER/RnToRm/Approx/DomTransl.hs " , srcLine = 174 , srcColumn = 1} Single changes : ChangeABC : Entity added to module ModuleName " Data.Number.ER.RnToRm.Approx " --- EVar ( UnQual ( Ident " keyPointsConsistencyCheck " ) )
EVar ( UnQual ( Ident " keyPointsPointwiseConsistencyCheck " ) )
---ChangeABC : Entity added to module ModuleName " Data.Number.ER.RnToRm.UnitDom.Approx " --- EVar ( UnQual ( Ident " keyPointsConsistencyCheck " ) )
EVar ( UnQual ( Ident " keyPointsPointwiseConsistencyCheck " ) )
---ChangeAB : Module (s ) removed / renamed .
--- " Data / Number / ER/RnToRm/UnitDom/ChebyshevBase/Polynom / Field " ---
Biggest change comes from : ChangeAB : Module (s ) removed / renamed .
--- " Data / Number / ER/RnToRm/UnitDom/ChebyshevBase/Polynom / Field " --- ExitSuccess -- cut--
In case of any trouble please email me or report an issue here [ 3 ] .
In the near future I 'll post more specific plans about development on my blog [ 4 ] .
I hope you will find it useful .

China 's world tour of oil acquisition is coming soon to a region near you !
CNOOC is looking to purchase a stake in a project in the Gulf of Mexico .
WSJ : Cnooc Ltd. is in talks with Norway 's Statoil Hydro ASA over a deal for a few leases in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , a deal that would open the U.S. Gulf to China 's oil companies for the first time , a person familiar with the matter said .
The move is significant as Cnooc 's scuttled $ 18.5 billion bid for California - based Unocal Corp. in 2005 is widely seen as having deterred state - owned Chinese oil giants from investing in U.S. oil and gas assets .
Cnooc withdrew its offer for Unocal after it drew protests from some U.S. politicians .
But as we noted yesterday , the political tides have changed .
In 2005 , it was easy to block investmnets on political grounds , because there was no shortage of cash .
Plus , this is just a few leases -- putting their toe in the water , it looks like -- not an $ 18.5 billion bid for a US company .
Still expect all kinds of howls before this goes through .
Enlarge By Morry Gash , AP " From the very beginning , we have made it clear that this education stimulus funding is intended to supplement local education dollars , not replace them , " says Secretary of Education Arne Duncan .
WASHINGTON 
An internal watchdog at the Education Department says states are using money from the economic stimulus to plug budget holes instead of boosting aid for schools .
President Barack Obama did not intend for state lawmakers to simply cut state education spending and replace it with stimulus dollars .
But Congress made that tough to enforce , and the Education Department 's inspector general said in a memo Thursday that some states are doing it .
That means instead of getting extra help to weather tough times , school districts and colleges could wind up with the same level of state aid or with cuts , even as local tax revenues plummet .
Education Secretary Arne Duncan said some states are flouting the president 's wishes .
" From the very beginning , we have made it clear that this education stimulus funding is intended to supplement local education dollars , not replace them , " Duncan said in a statement .
" When the spending reports are made public in October , states will be held accountable by the public and the department on how they used education funding , " Duncan said .
Duncan has also said that those states may hurt their chances at extra stimulus dollars from a $ 5 billion competitive grant program .
The money is to reward states and school districts that adopt initiatives Obama supports , such as charter schools and teacher pay tied to student performance .
Duncan alone has control over the $ 5 billion incentive fund .
And in some cases , he may be able to withhold other stimulus dollars that have been allocated for a particular state
The inspector general 's office singled out Connecticut , Massachusetts and Pennsylvania for cutting state spending on education and replacing it with stimulus dollars .
Pennsylvania lawmakers have not yet finalized the state budget .
A spokesman for the Pennsylvania Education Department , Michael Race , said education spending wo n't be clear until lawmakers complete the state budget .
A spokesman for the Massachusetts department of education , Jonathan Palumbo , said his state 's plan for spending the stabilization dollars was approved by the Education Department and was in compliance with the stimulus rules .
" The intent of these stimulus funds is to stabilize education funding in these unprecedented economic times , " Palumbo said .
" We funded education at record levels ... this year while almost every other area of state government was cut . "
Congress included $ 100 billion for education in the stimulus law earlier this year .
Part of that was a $ 40 billion fund to stabilized state and local budgets .
Nearly three - quarters of the $ 40 billion stabilization fund has already been awarded .
But as the bill made its way through Congress , lawmakers decided not to prohibit states from using the stabilization money to replace precious state aid for schools .
They required states to maintain spending on K - 12 schools and colleges but only at 2006 levels , which allowed most states to make significant cuts to education .
That flexibility " may be leading to a reduction in state support for public education , " the inspector general said .
The inspector general recommended the department create a system to track state spending on K - 12 and college education and to make sure states have kept up spending levels as required in the stimulus .

A boffin at the Bulgarian national Space Research Institute has stated that not only are aliens living among us , but that they object strongly to " immoral behaviour " by humanity - such as causing global warming .
" Unnatural " acts such as use of cosmetics and " artificial insemination " are also frowned upon by the extraterrestrial visitors .
Luchezar Filipov , deputy head of the space institute at the government 's Bulgarian Academy of Science , made these startling assertions to Bulgarian media earlier this week .
The Sofia Echo , referencing other local media , quotes the eminent space brainbox as stating that " they [ aliens ] are here right now , among us " and that the extraterrestrials are " conducting surveillance " and - chillingly - " research " on humanity .
“ They are currently all around us , and are watching us all the time .
They are not hostile towards us ; rather , they want to help us but we have not grown enough in order to establish direct contact with them , " said the Bulgarian boffin , according to Sofia news agency novinite.com .
Reportedly Filipov and unnamed colleagues have elicited this information by decrypting messages hidden within crop circles .
The crop -circle " pictograms " were said to have been a response to questions posed by the Academy scientists .
Crop - circle comms being unreliable , Filipov apparently feels that future direct contact will come through the medium of " mental power and telepathy " .
However , some basic themes have apparently been made clear .
" The aliens are very critical of our immoral behaviour and our destruction of the environment , " says Filipov , according to the Echo .
" They say that global warming is attributed mainly to infrastructural engineering . "
Presumably the star - travelling aliens have long ago graduated to advanced energy sources such as nuclear fusion or antimatter , and sneer at our pathetic fossil - fuelled civilisation .
Filipov stated that the alien spies in our midst have other objections to our lifestyle , too .
" They are very skeptical of our use of cosmetics , and artificial insemination because this is unnatural , " he reportedly said .
There was no word on the aliens ' views on gang - probing of humans abducted as part of their " research " programme .
Read all about it from the Echo and novinite.com here and here . ®
Editor 's note : Professor Bridgette Carr directs the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School .
The Human Trafficking Clinic provides direct representation to victims of human trafficking and works to identify solutions to combat human trafficking .
Ann Arbor , Michigan ( CNN ) --
" We did not have a right to choose where we lived ... freedom of speech , or freedom of actions .
The traffickers had keys to our apartment .
They controlled all of our movement and travel .
They watched us and listened when we called our parents .
They did n't let us make friends or tell anyone anything about ourselves .
We could n't keep any of the money we earned .
We could n't ask anyone for help . " -- Lena
Lena was an athletic student from Eastern Europe yearning to visit the United States through a study - abroad program at her college .
She had visions of learning English and returning home to share her experiences with her family .
But the human traffickers who ensnared her had a different vision for Lena , shipping her to America and exploiting her in the sex industry for profit .
They met her at the airport with news that her study abroad placement had been changed .
She was given new bus tickets and sent off to Detroit , Michigan .
Once there they took her passport and her freedom .
After almost a year of enslavement , Lena risked her life to make a daring escape .
She is smart , resilient and funny , and I have been honored to be her attorney through the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School .
Unfortunately there are thousands of adults and children like Lena who have not been able to escape their traffickers .
These victims , especially the children , are in the same position Lena was :
They 're being exploited and can't ask anyone for help .
The data on human trafficking is sparse , but what is known is terrifying .
It 's already the second largest criminal industry in the world -- behind only the trade in illegal drugs -- and it 's growing fast .
The global commercial sex trade exploits one million children annually .
At least 100,000 and perhaps as many as 300,000 children in America are victims of sex trafficking each year .
The grim reality of child sex trafficking in the United States is this : Human traffickers are selling sex with children in big cities and small towns throughout America .
Child sex trafficking has been illegal in the United States since 2000 with the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act .
Under this law it is illegal to recruit , harbor , transport , provide or obtain a person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of a commercial sex act .
Since the passage of the TVPA many states have passed their own human trafficking laws .
Children who are selling sex in the United States are then , by definition , victims of human trafficking .
Despite this , child victims of sex trafficking are frequently viewed as criminals rather than as victims .
According to the Department of Justice in 2006 , six years after the passage of the TVPA , 1,600 children were arrested for prostitution and commercialized vice .
The children victimized by sex trafficking are often very young .
On average , girls are first exploited for commercial sex between the ages of 12 and 14 .
For boys the average age is even younger -- between 11 and 13 .
But being a victim of sex trafficking does not have to be a life sentence .
Victims can become survivors and build new lives .
And while Lena is no longer the young college student she once was and it is too dangerous for her to return home , her speech and actions are now her own .
She can choose where she wants to live .
She is free .
Through my work with Lena and other clients in the Human Trafficking Clinic we have identified a number of ways to fight sex trafficking .
Raise awareness within your community :
One of the biggest barriers to helping victims of sex trafficking is the lack of awareness about the issue .
Human traffickers profit when we think human trafficking only happens in foreign countries .
• Human trafficking happens everywhere , and sex trafficking cases involving children have been found in all regions of the country .
No community is immune to the horrors of human trafficking .
• Communities must prioritize the fight against human trafficking -- including providing enough resources to law enforcement .
Change the conversation : Children who by law are too young to consent to having sex obviously cannot consent to selling sex , so :
• Victims should not be described as entering into prostitution ; they are being exploited and should be described as victims of human trafficking .
• Law enforcement officials often arrest and detain child victims of sex trafficking on either prostitution charges or other charges , such as truancy or curfew violations .
Law enforcement must be trained about human trafficking .
• Sellers of sex , especially when they are children , should not be guilty of a criminal violation .
Buyers and pimps should be the only individuals at risk of criminal penalties .
This would ensure that no victims are arrested or jailed .
Reduce demand :
The reality of sex trafficking must not be neutralized or glamorized .
• Individuals who travel abroad to purchase sex from children are demonized in the media and identified as sexual predators , yet individuals who stay in the United States and pay to have sex with children are given the anonymous title " john " -- and frequently are n't even charged with a crime .
• Individuals who pay for sex with children in the United States should be punished .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bridgette Carr .

For the past week or so my wife and I have been vacation .
We went on a road trip from beautiful Niagara Falls , across New England , ending up in Northern Maine .
The fall colors were in full bloom , and we had a wonderful time .
On the last day of our trip , however , we almost had something happen that would have put a serious damper on our trip .
We almost had to pay the price for not making sure that the great deal that we got on our rental car actually went through when we booked .
A Rude Surprise When Dropping Off Our Rental Car
After our last beautiful day seeing the sites around Portland , Maine , my wife and I headed to the airport to drop off our National Car Rental owned vehicle and check in for our flight .
After cleaning out our rental and packing up our bags , we grabbed the keys and noted that we had put almost 1200 miles on the car in our drive across the east coast .
We had done a lot of driving !
We walked up to the counter , gave the desk agent the keys , and after he asked – told him the mileage on the car .
He then proceeded to let us know that our credit card would be charged over $ 1000 for the 8 days we had been driving the car !
We were taken aback .
Why were we now being charged over $ 1000 for a car rental that was supposed to cost around $ 490 ?
The agent told us that since we had driven almost 1200 miles , and since we had no free mileage – we would be paying a pretty penny .
We were being charged at the rate of about 40 cents a mile !
Right away I knew something was n’t quite right .
I explained the deal that we had gotten when we signed up , and how we had used a contract code that gave us unlimited mileage , an extra driver and free insurance coverage .
The agent was n’t sure what to say , and said that he was n’t able to do anything about it .
We would have to pay .
After going back and forth for what seemed like an eternity ( 10 minutes ? ) , the desk agent ’s supervisor came out .
We explained our situation again , and how it would make no sense for us to rent a car for a long trip without having unlimited free mileage ( like we signed up for ) .
It must have been an issue with the rental agency ’s computer system not noting our complete deal ?
After talking with the supervisor for another 10 minutes , showing her the paperwork that we still had , and explaining what contract code we were using , she was able to confirm that the deal we had signed up for was legit .
To her credit , and to National Car Rental ’s credit , she apologized for the problem , and found a way to write up the transaction that allowed us to pay what we had signed up for from the start .
Check out this article for more tips on talking with customer service agents .
Make Sure To Double Check And Make Sure You Get What You Pay For
While dealing with all this was a pain , at least we found the problem , and to National ’s credit they fixed the problem so we did n’t overpay .
It makes me wonder , though , how many people sign up for one deal , are n’t as careful about checking and do n’t catch the discrepancy if it is n’t as pronounced as ours was ?
Maybe they end up overpaying by $ 50 instead of $ 500 ?
Oftentimes $ 50 might be dismissed as airport taxes , fees for extras or something else .
So when signing up for a deal on a rental car , airline tickets , or a deal on any other high ticket item , make sure to trust but verify .
Verify that all coupon codes , discounts and corporate codes go through when you purchase .
Verify that all of the terms on your deal are correct ( on ours , the unlimited mileage provision did n’t come through as it should have ) .
When you complete the deal , verify again .
If you find something wrong , bring it up right away to get it fixed .
Have you had a situation where you found you were charged more than you should have been for a product or service ?
Did you bring it up , and if you did , was it fixed for you ?
Tell us about your experience in the comments .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
Demonstrators entered their third day of a building takeover at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday in protest of a tuition increase , an undertaking that a school spokesman called futile .
The occupation of Kerr Hall is just one of several demonstrations across University of California campuses this week after the regent 's board approved a 32 percent increase in tuition Thursday .
University officials said the $ 505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made due to California 's persistent financial crisis .
Protesting students said the increase will hurt working and middle - class students who benefit from state - funded education .
On the Santa Cruz campus , where building occupations began last week with a library sit-in , about 100 students staged a sit-in in the second - floor lobby of Kerr Hall soon after hearing that the tuition increase had been approved , according to UC Santa Cruz Provost David Kliger .
The students made a list of 20 " demands " detailing how they want the administration to increase funding , spokesman Barry Shiller said .
But the school has no plans to negotiate the demands with the student body , he said .
The school just does n't have the money , he added .
School officials hope the students realize that their demonstration is " not accomplishing anything " and is " just a disruption " to administrative duties on campus , he said .
The administration will continue to wait out the takeover , but Shiller said he is unsure of how long it will last .
The school hopes the students will leave voluntarily , he said .

Meanwhile , uprisings on other campuses have quieted since earlier mass demonstrations .
At UC Berkeley on Friday night , 41 protesters occupying a building were arrested .
Authorities decided to cite them for trespassing and release them rather than take them to jail , per an agreement with student leaders , school spokeswoman Claire Holmes said .
Three students were arrested there Friday morning .
Fifty - two students were arrested at UC Davis late Thursday after they refused to vacate the school 's administration building .
And UCLA 's Campbell Hall was occupied for several hours Thursday evening .
The angry students are condemning a nearly $ 2,000 tuition increase .
The first change , which takes effect in January , will raise undergraduate tuition to $ 8,373 .
The second increase kicks in next fall , raising tuition to $ 10,302 , university spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka said .
Students who live on campus could pay an estimated $ 17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing , according to the system 's July 2008 finance guide .
The January increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition increase last year .
On average , tuition and fees at four - year public universities nationwide increased 6.5 percent , or to $ 7,020 , since the previous school year , according to data from College Board .
Students eligible for financial aid and whose families make less than $ 70,000 will have their tuition covered , the university said .
The holidays are built on tradition , which means it 's time for us to gather around the yule log and listen to that insane rendition of O Holy Night .
It has been a year , and it remains as beautifully horrible as I remember .
( Here it is , presented in magical streaming whatever - it - is that makes it work . )

What I love about it is just when you think it could n't possibly get any worse , it does .
By a lot .
And it does this more than once , building to the most glorious mess I 've ever heard .
I smile every time I hear it .

Extreme Origami .
From the website :
In the dojo of the origami purist , there are only two rules :
The folder may use just one sheet of square paper , and the paper cannot be cut or torn in any way .
Following these rules to make a figure like a peace crane , with four basic features — a head , a tail , and two wings — is relatively easy , and origamists traditionally proceeded by trial and error , unfolding and refolding a piece of paper until it started to resemble , say , a swan .
For hundreds of years , origami's most complex patterns topped out at 20 steps .
These days patterns requiring more than 100 steps are common .
Some of that competitive acceleration is due to Lang , who transformed the art by writing a computer program that can generate the blueprint for ultracomplex origami sculptures .
Even with digital assistance , figuring out the sequence of folds that will create a beetle and all its ornaments is a mathematical problem of staggering complexity .
Still , the reigning champion of intricate origami is a 23 - year - old Japanese savant named Satoshi Kamiya .
Unaided by software , he recently produced what is considered the pinnacle of the field , an eight - inch - tall Eastern dragon with eyes , teeth , a curly tongue , sinuous whiskers , a barbed tail , and a thousand overlapping scales .
The folding alone took 40 hours , spread out over several months .

There are many toxins in commercial cosmetics .
Aluminum is common in most under arm deodorants , for example .
Many fragrances contain harmful additives as well .
Dr. Samuel Epstein , Chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition and author of , is openly concerned about Avon calling on The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) to create a computerized program of researching and tracking incidents of breast cancer to determine causation .
Dr. Epstein considers this a worthy project , but from an unholy alliance .
He has publicly and privately called on Avon to remove all harmful toxins from their products before continuing their courtship with the NCI .
There are many others who argue that the NCI itself is not so holy .
Dr. Epstein is concerned mostly about parabens .
Parabens are the preservative darlings of the entire cosmetic industry , not just Avon .
They are dear to this industry for the same reasons any preservative is to any industry :
They 're effective and cheap .
As preservatives , parabens are common to most cosmetic products .
There has been mounting evidence that parabens are carcinogenic and estrogenic with continued use .
Parabens are estrogen mimickers that are easily absorbed into the skin .
Parabens have stimulated premature uterine growth in mice .
Besides upsetting hormonal balance , the excess estrogenic effect is also linked to cancer .
Laboratory testing has created cancer cells with parabens .
So they 're rightly considered carcinogenic .
Here 's a list of products containing toxic items inthat Dr. Epstein itemized in response to a large Avon ad placed in a November 2008issue :( hormonal and penetration enhancer ) in Nail Experts Nail Brightener . ( hormonal ) , ( hormonal ) , and cancer precursor ) in Wash - Off Waterproof Mascara . ( cancer precursor ) , and ( penetration enhancer ) in Advance Techniques Body Building Conditioner . , and ( cancer precursors ) in Anew Beauty Youth - Awakening Lipstick .
Dr. Epstein maintains that a decade of research shows even low daily paraben exposure causes estrogenic and carcinogenic problems .
Of course , the cosmetic industry differs .
They argue there are " no specific scientifically proven links to cancer . "

The sacking of David Nutt for insisting on the probity of scientific evidence that did not correspond to political exigencies has a significance well beyond the drugs debate .
The essence of democracy is evidence - based argument , reason and genuine deliberation .
Of course there will be a passionate clash of values and priorities , but if we cannot accept the facts we descend into a shouting match between rival prejudices .
This is not the first time the government has shown its unwillingness to accept the primacy of science in the debate over drugs .
Last year its own Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) recommended – on a vote of 20 - 3 – that cannabis should remain a class C drug .
Gordon Brown chose to dismiss the science and ordered cannabis to be upgraded to a Class B drug .
Where was the rational argument in this decision ?
There was n't one .
Jacqui Smith , the then home secretary , admitted at the time of the announcement to the Commons that she was taking into account " public perceptions " alongside other factors .
Science and rational thought lost out to the court of what the government deemed was popular opinion .
Now they 've done it again .
As Professor Nutt argues , the ACMD has been systematically undermined by government .
Why summon scientists to have an input to a debate where complex issues such as pharmacology and toxicology need to be elucidated , only to reject them out of hand ?
Nutt dared to argue there is not the scientific backing to support labelling the drugs the government wants to label as dangerous .
Even at its zenith , New Labour was never a courageous political formation ; now , limping towards a general election , it is determined not to appear liberal or soft on drugs for fear it will be torn apart by foes in the press .
Nutt did not get the politics and did not help his case with some ill - judged interventions .
But to pay with his job is extreme .
Any successor will ponder long and hard , as many scientists are reported to be doing , about whether any scientific advice they offer will be acted on if it does not suit the political mood .
What a long way we 've come since Labour 's ascent to power , when it promised to develop policy on the basis of evidence , not political expediency , where science would be at the heart of the debates and always be a source of rational decision - making .
Nutt 's sacking would be serious enough if it was just one incident , but British politics – and our culture – is increasingly being disfigured by politicians bowing to prejudice .
Sharon Shoesmith was summarily sacked as director of Haringey Social Services over the Baby P scandal .
She was accountable for dreadful omissions by her department , but there was not even a nod to due process or natural law .
The press demanded a head .
One was offered .
Britain is losing its way , unmoored from its tradition of fair play , debate and respect for facts .
Nutt 's sacking was another milestone in Britain 's progression from a great Enlightenment country into a place where prejudice reigns .
Big Media has played its part , but so have timid , callow politicians .
The dismissal demonstrates how profoundly disfigured our politics is becoming by a political class unwilling to stand up to the way public opinion is being manipulated .
Hopes of a breakthrough that would allow women to protect themselves from HIV have been dashed with today 's revelation from a large , British - funded trial that a promising microbicide has turned out to be ineffective .
Britain's Medical Research Council ( MRC ) and the department for international development ( DfID ) had backed the trial in four African countries , involving 9,385 women .
But after four years and significant investment , scientists have been forced to conclude that the PRO 2000 gel does not prevent HIV / Aids .
Dr Sheena McCormack of the MRC , chief investigator of the trial known as MDP 301 , said they were deeply disappointed , but that the search must go on .
A microbicide , in the form of a vaginal cream or gel that kills the virus , would give women in Africa and Asia the power to defend themselves against HIV given the refusal of many men to wear condoms .
The trials in Africa showed that both men and women found its use acceptable .
Expectations were raised in March when a smaller US - led trial of PRO 2000 , involving 3,099 women , found a 30 % reduction in infections , but the actual numbers of people who became HIV positive were not large enough to give conclusive results .
" I have to say then we got quite excited , " said McCormack .
" But in a big trial you get closer to the truth , and unfortunately the truth is it did n't work .
It is bitterly disappointing for us , but it will inform the way we go forward . "
Half the participants were given PRO 2000 while the other half got an inactive gel .
There were 130 infections among those who used the real thing and 123 among those who had the placebo .
The hunt for a microbicide was given a big boost when Clare Short , as international development secretary , enthusiastically endorsed it in 2002 as a gender and equity issue .
Her department gave £ 14 m to the MRC , Imperial College and five African countries .
The final cost to DfID of the PRO 2000 trial has been £ 40 m , with £ 2 m from the MRC – a substantial sum , but tiny compared with the cost of pharmaceutical company trials .
Other gains were made , however , despite the results .
Professor Gita Ramjee , who enrolled 2,385 women at her centre in Durban , South Africa , said they had received health checks and treatment for conditions from high blood pressure to potential cervical cancer that would not otherwise have been picked up .
All the women and their partners had also been counselled on avoiding HIV and given condoms .
But Ramjee , who has conducted five separate microbicide trials , said she felt " very despondent " at having to tell her staff and the participants that the gel did not work .
" A lot of my staff are HIV positive and do a lot of counselling and they hear the pleas of women who say we desperately need something to prevent HIV infection because our partners do n't want to wear condoms , " she said .
About 2.7 million people were infected with HIV last year .
A number of African countries have run out of money to put newly diagnosed people on drugs to keep them alive and will struggle to continue to treat those already taking them if donations fall because of the economic crisis .
There is a danger , said McCormack , that it is " going to go wrong again for Africa " .
If PRO 2000 had worked , it could have been made available cheaply over the counter to any woman who wanted it .
Scientists have turned their attention to the possibility of adapting anti-retroviral drugs given to stop HIV becoming Aids .
One of the possibilities is a gel form of Tenofovir , a drug that could also be taken daily in tablet form to prevent HIV infection .
But such gels or tablets would have to be given out through clinics with supervision , and there are fears that the virus could become resistant to them .

GOP TO TAKE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE OF TERRORIST TRIALS ' America will see it 's Republicans who want to keep them safe with our fair and balanced torture program . '
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON - ( PTSD News ) -
No sooner did Attorney General Eric Holder announce that five high - profile detainees from Guantanamo Bay prison were going to be brought to trial in New York than the Republicans sprang into action .
" We 're so excited Holder is bringing those terrorists here for trial , " said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele .
" Now we can go to town with our fake outrage . "
" Our message to the American people is that the Muslim - infested Democrat Party brings terrorists into our country to make heroes of them .
We will pound this message 24/7 on Fox , and the other networks will soon pick up on it .
This is manna from heaven , " said House Minority Whip Eric Cantor .
" America will see it 's Republicans who want to keep them safe with our fair and balanced torture program . "
What American would vote Democrat again when we tell them liberals are granting special rights to those terrorist killers , " Texas Senator John Cornyn asked , " special rights like the right not to be tortured , the special right not to be denied an attorney , and the special right not to be put away for life without a trial ?
What 's next for these Democrat special rights granters ?
The right for gay Muslims to marry ? "
" I can't believe this outrageous pre-9/11 approach is being proposed in my city , " fumed former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani .
" If I had been made mayor for life , like I should have been after 9/11 , I would never let these 9/11 terrorists set foot in my post - 9/11 city .
Did I forget to mention 9/11 ? " Former Vice President [ sic ]
Dick Cheney also had harsh words for the Democrats .
" Do n't these idiots know you can't go to the dark side if trials are out in the open ? "
" It 's a good thing that I and the Republicans had the good sense to block socialized medicine , " said Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman ( I ) , " or those terrorists would be getting free taxpayer - paid health care . "
" If I only had this issue during the campaign , " said Senator John McCain , " I would have wiped Obama all over the electoral map , even with that albatross Palin on my back . "
The former Governor of Alaska , Sarah Palin , taking a break from her book tour , added had her own comment on the terrorist trials coming to New York .
" Where are those Obama death panels when we need them ? "

Long - distance carrier orders ' high density ' A380 to hold most passengers ever to fly in a single aeroplane
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The retail adage " stack 'em high and pack ' em tight " is to be introduced to airlines after plans were announced today for economy - only flights carrying a record - breaking 800 passengers in Airbus A380s .
The French company Air Austral said that it placed orders for two " high density " double - decker A380s with a capacity for 840 seats .
When full , the flights between Paris and the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean , where the company is based , will easily involve the most passengers ever to fly in a single aeroplane .
Air Austral plans to start operating the flights from 2014 .
The A380 began commercial flights in 2007 carrying around 500 people .
The planes included space - consuming business and first class seating areas complete with showers and bars .
But it was safety tested for evacuating more than 800 people before it entered service .
With a crew of 20 included , it has been approved to carry up to 873 people .
Air Austral 's plans for no -frills A380s flights will make it the easyJet or Ryanair of super - jumbo travel .
" We are convinced that airplanes with good - priced tickets will help explode traffic figures , " its founder and president Gerard Etheve told Reuters .
It said the giant people carrier was aimed at tapping growth in China and India .
Speaking at the Dubai airshow , Etheve added : " The A380 is great for high - density routes .
We handle 550 people at the airports at the moment .
Handling another 200 is not going to be difficult . "
Enjoy a soothing one - hour Rejuvenating Facial that will relax both your body and mind .
This will then be followed by your choice of either an Express Manicure OR Pedicure , including colour to leave you feeling completely renewed and refreshed .

Criticism of New Racism Film Journalist Goes Undercover to Discover Life as a Black Man in Germany
Günter Wallraff is Germany 's most famous investigative journalist .
He 's made a name for himself by going undercover to reveal the hidden side of many social issues .
In his new film , he disguises himself as a black person to explore racial discrimination in Germany .
His approach , however , is drawing criticism .
Starting in the Google Chrome developer channel release 4.0.249.0 , Web Sockets are available and enabled by default .
Web Sockets are " TCP for the Web , " a next - generation bidirectional communication technology for web applications being standardized in part of Web Applications 1.0 .
We 've implemented this feature as described in our design docs for WebKit and Chromium
XMLHttpRequest ( " XHR " ) for such purposes , but XHR makes developing web applications that communicate back and forth to the server unnecessarily complex .
XHR is basically asynchronous HTTP , and because you need to use a tricky technique like long - hanging GET for sending data from the server to the browser , simple tasks rapidly become complex .
As opposed to XMLHttpRequest , Web Sockets provide a real bidirectional communication channel in your browser .
Once you get a Web Socket connection , you can send data from browser to server by calling a send ( ) method , and receive data from server to browser by an onmessage event handler .
A simple example is included below .
The Web Sockets API enables web applications to handle bidirectional communications with server - side process in a straightforward way .
Developers have been using ( " XHR " ) for such purposes , but XHR makes developing web applications that communicate back and forth to the server unnecessarily complex .
XHR is basically asynchronous HTTP , and because you need to use a tricky technique like long - hanging GET for sending data from the server to the browser , simple tasks rapidly become complex .
As opposed to , Web Sockets provide a real bidirectional communication channel in your browser .
Once you get a Web Socket connection , you can send data from browser to server by calling amethod , and receive data from server to browser by an onmessage event handler .
A simple example is included below .
if ( " WebSocket " in window ) {
var ws = new WebSocket ( " ws://example.com/service " ) ;
ws.onopen = function ( ) {
// Web Socket is connected .
You can send data by send ( ) method .
ws.send ( " message to send " ) ; ....
} ;
ws.onmessage = function ( evt ) { var received_msg = evt.data ; ... } ;
ws.onclose = function ( ) { // websocket is closed .
} ;
} else {
// the browser does n't support WebSocket .
}
In addition to the new Web Sockets API , there is also a new protocol ( the " web socket protocol " ) that the browser uses to communicate with servers .
The protocol is not raw TCP because it needs to provide the browser 's " same - origin " security model .
It 's also not HTTP because web socket traffic differers from HTTP 's request - response model .
Web socket communications using the new web socket protocol should use less bandwidth because , unlike a series of XHRs and hanging GETs , no headers are exchanged once the single connection has been established .
To use this new API and protocol and take advantage of the simpler programming model and more efficient network traffic , you do need a new server implementation to communicate with — but do n't worry .
We also developed pywebsocket , which can be used as an Apache extension module , or can even be run as standalone server .
You can use Google Chrome and pywebsocket to start implementing Web Socket - enabled web applications now .
We 're more than happy to hear your feedback not only on our implementation , but also on API and / or protocol design .
The protocol has not been completely locked down and is still in discussion in IETF , so we are especially grateful for any early adopter feedback .

Conservatives and tea party activists already have set their sights on some of the GOP 's top Senate recruits — a list that includes Gov. Charlie Crist in Florida , former Rep. Rob Simmons in Connecticut and Rep. Mark Kirk in Illinois , among others .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Uncivil War : Conservatives to challenge a dozen GOP candidates
In what could be a nightmare scenario for Republican Party officials , conservative activists are gearing up to challenge leading GOP candidates in more than a dozen key House and Senate races in 2010 .
Conservatives and tea party activists had already set their sights on some of the GOP ’s top Senate recruits — a list that includes Gov. Charlie Crist in Florida , former Rep. Rob Simmons in Connecticut and Rep. Mark Kirk in Illinois , among others .
Advertisement
But their success in Tuesday ’s upstate New York special election , where grass - roots efforts pushed GOP nominee Dede Scozzafava to drop out of the race and helped Conservative Party nominee Doug Hoffman surge into the lead on the eve of Election Day , has generated more money and enthusiasm than organizers ever imagined .
Activists predict a wave that could roll from California to Kentucky to New Hampshire and that could leave even some GOP incumbents — Utah Sen .
Bob Bennett is one — facing unexpectedly fierce challenges from their right flank .
“ I would say it ’s the tip of the spear , ” said Dick Armey , the former GOP House majority leader who now serves as chairman of FreedomWorks , an organization that has been closely aligned with the tea party movement .
“ We are the biggest source of energy in American politics today . ”
“ What you ’re going to see , ” said Armey , “ is moderates and conservatives across the country in primaries . ”
These high - stakes primaries , pitting the activist wing of the party against the establishment wing , stand to have a profound impact on the 2010 election landscape since they will create significant problems for moderate candidates recruited by the national party precisely because they appear well - suited to win in places that are not easily — or even plausibly — won by conservative candidates .
The tensions between the two visions threaten to limit the party ’s gains in an election year that is shaping up in its favor .
Party strategists worry that well - funded , well - organized challenges from the right could force Republicans to exhaust precious resources on messy primary fights — or force moderate candidates to adopt more strident positions early on that could haunt them during the final months of the campaign .
“ For me , what this says is , we need to take a deep breath and decide whether [ moderates and conservatives ] work together or not , ” said Tom Davis , the former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
“ And if we do n’t , it can get very , very ugly . ”
Activists contend that the only way back to majority status is to embrace the conservative principles that the party jettisoned during the past decades once it became too enamored of power .
To them , the issue is less about ideological purity than about the compromises they see the party ’s Washington establishment making and what they contend is a lack of support for conservative candidates who are deemed unelectable by GOP solons .
“ New York 23 , on some scale , is the first battle of a larger internal Republican debate over how to define the party , ” said former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio , a conservative who is challenging Crist for the Senate nomination .
“ They want us to vote for their candidates , but they do n’t want us to run for office . ”
Rubio ’s race is one that many on the right point to as the next New York 23 , a contest where conservatives and tea party activists are in open revolt about Crist and the national party ’s decision to endorse him despite his embrace — literally — of President Barack Obama and his stimulus package during a Florida visit in February .
Rubio has won nearly a dozen county GOP straw polls across the state and is rapidly becoming a darling of the tea party movement .
Everett Wilkinson , an organizer for the Florida Tea Party Patriots , said his group plans to take part in get - out - the - vote activities and other efforts to deny Crist the GOP nomination , despite the fact that Crist leads both Rubio and Rep. Kendrick Meek , the likely Democratic nominee , by a comfortable margin .
To Wilkinson , he ’d rather burn the house down if it means saving it .
“ We would lose if Charlie Crist got elected or if another person who does n’t support our policies got elected , ” he said .
“ Our members are actively going to get out there and create awareness of the governor ’s actions . ”
Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , a leading conservative who has endorsed Rubio , said he viewed the Florida Senate race as distinct from the New York special election .
But he agreed with Rubio ’s contention that the national party needed to broaden its outlook on candidates .
“ I ’m not saying our party made a mistake , because there ’s a debate within the party over what we should be , ” he said .
“ If we just start looking at who can win — sometimes we might miss a gem in the rough in effect .
And I said from the beginning , that ’s what I think Rubio is . ”
Florida turns out to be one of many states where Senate candidates favored — in one way or another — by the National Republican Senatorial Committee are facing serious pushback from the grass roots .
In almost every situation , the lay of the land is the same .
Whether it ’s California , Illinois , Connecticut , New Hampshire or Kentucky , the NRSC has found a candidate who appears to be an exceptionally strong general election prospect — either well - known , well - financed or ideologically well - suited to the state ’s politics — who is nevertheless meeting with tough resistance at the grass - roots level from activists who believe the conservative cause would be better served over the long term , even if it means the party nominee loses in the short term .
Even in Illinois , where polls shows Kirk would be highly competitive as a general election candidate in a state in which Republicans have been crushed in recent elections , the prospect of picking up the president ’s former Senate seat is n’t enough to win over many activists .
“ We ’re going to work hard as hell to make sure Mark Kirk does n’t win , ” said Evert Evertsen , an Illinois tea party organizer .
“ Mark Kirk is about as liberal as Arlen Specter was . ”
GOP House and Senate incumbents are fair game , too .
In Utah , where Bennett has won reelection by landslide margins since first winning the seat in 1992 , disgruntled conservatives are looking to take him down in next year ’s state party convention after his Wall Street bailout vote last fall and several other high - profile votes in which he broke with the right .
In the House , Rep. Bob Inglis ( R - S.C. ) is among a handful of GOP veterans facing primary challenges of varying competitiveness for their departures from conservative orthodoxy .
“ It ’s kind of like investors in a company saying they ’re not going to tolerate it anymore .
And that ’s what we ’re seeing here , ” said Eric Odom , executive director of the American Liberty Alliance , a libertarian - oriented group .
“ We ’re already gearing up .
This is just the beginning . ”

Sea urchins may use the whole surface of their bodies as compound eyes , scientists now suggest .
Although sea urchins do n't have any problems avoiding predators or finding comfortable dark corners to hide in , they do n't have eyes .
The question then is how they see .
Genetic analysis of sea urchins has revealed they have light - sensitive molecules , mostly in their tube feet and in tiny stalked appendages found in among their spines .
As such , " it looks like the entire surface of their bodies are acting as one big eye , " said researcher Sönke Johnsen , a marine biologist at Duke University .
Scientists had conjectured the spines of sea urchins might then help them pick out relatively fine visual details by screening out light from off angles .
If this proved true , urchins with densely packed spines would have relatively sharp vision .
To investigate that possibility , Johnsen and his colleagues experimented with California purple sea urchins ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) , testing how 39 specimens placed in a brightly lit 4 - foot - wide ( 1.2 m ) arena responded to a black disc on the wall .
When the disc was nearly 2.5 inches wide ( 6 cm ) , the urchins seemed oblivious to the disc .
However , when it was roughly 3.5 inches wide ( 9 cm ) , they reacted strongly , with roughly two - thirds racing toward it and the other third fleeing in the opposite direction .
These diametrically opposed responses might reflect whether the urchins saw the disc as a shelter or predator .
" To say they ' raced ' toward the discs is relative — watching these guys move is like watching paint dry , " Johnsen said .
In any case , the California purple sea urchin 's vision seems roughly as good as nautiluses and horseshoe crabs , and much better than urchins Echinometra lucunter and Echinometra viridis , which have more sparsely packed spines .
" We think of animals that have a head with centralized nervous systems and all their sense organs on top as being the ones capable of sophisticated behavior , but we 're finding more and more some animals can do pretty complex behaviors using a completely different style , " Johnsen said .
Although sea urchins do n't have brains , " it could be their entire nervous system more or less acts as a brain , " Johnsen said .
" In our case , we vertebrates have nervous systems that are more or less controlled by a central brain , but sea urchins have a pretty diffuse nerve net , where no region looks like a central processing unit as far as we can tell .
It 's hard to examine their nervous systems , since their nerves are very , very small and the animals are more or less made of rock . "
The way that urchins apparently carry out eyesight and brainwork reflect how scientists are now often designing robots — more like invertebrates than we vertebrates .
" In the beginning , people built robots like they would humans , with powerful central processing units , complex sensors and fairly complex rules for doing things , " Johnsen said .
" Now they 're finding it might be a lot better with a distributed system with many little processors and simpler sensors and simple rules , which end up creating fairly complicated behaviors as emergent properties , just as how a flock of birds can make intricate patterns without any one bird choosing these patterns . "
The researchers are quite curious as to why these urchins choose to race either to or from objects .
" Are there urchins that always run away or run towards them ?
Do we have timid or bold urchins ?
Or is it just something specific to how an urchin feels at a certain time ? "
Johnsen wondered .
Although experiments that clip spines off urchins would seem to make sense if one wanted to directly test how they contributed to vision , " we ca n't just remove spines — if we do , they get very sick and die , and do n't behave naturally at all , " Johnsen explained .
Other experiments could involve testing light objects on dark backgrounds , or if they respond to color .
" It could be that they move towards green objects since they look like algae , which they really like to eat , " Johnsen conjectured .
Johnsen and his colleague Divya Yerramilli will detail their findings online December 28 in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
For our latest mission , Agent Lathan pretended to get lost during a Knicks game .
Throughout the second half he kept appearing further and further away from his assigned seat with a confused look on his face .
Of course Knicks fans went crazy trying to help him find his way back .
Enjoy the video first and then go behind the scenes with our report below .
Agent Lathan first pulled this stunt for Improv Everywhere back in the summer of 2006 .
Getting lost at a ball game was a prank he had done spontaneously a couple of times in the past , and we decided to try to organize one for IE at a Yankee game .
The mission turned out to be a total blast , but we were n’t able to capture much of it on film .
Yankee Stadium did not allow video cameras , so we were limited to using “ movie mode ” on a couple of point - and - shoot still cameras .
Madison Square Garden
We decided to try the mission again at a Knicks game for two reasons :
1 ) We wanted to try to get better video footage of the prank and 2 ) Agent Lathan found a deal on $ 10 tickets .
MSG has a similar camera policy , but technology has advanced quite a bit in the past three years .
Flip video cameras are the same size as point - and - shoot still cameras , and some DSLR cameras shoot gorgeous HD video .
MSG does n’t allow professional cameras with detachable lenses , so we had to get a little creative to smuggle in our nicer gear .
Agent Sokoler had the best method– she hid her equipment in her bag underneath underwear and tampons .
The security guy flinched when he opened her bag and waved her right on through .
Agent Sokoler ’s bag
There was a reason the tickets were on special for $ 10 – the seats had an obstructed view and were WAY up at the top of the 400 level .
This did n’t matter as we did n’t plan on sitting in them for long .
The Knicks have a pretty bad record , so there were plenty of empty seats down below .
Right before halftime Agent Lathan and his five friends headed down to a row of $ 89 seats in the 300 level .
The five IE agents minus Agent Lathan in our upgraded seats
The camera agents sat in the sections next to , below , and above ours , so they ’d be able to document from a distance without tipping anyone off .
Agent Lathan :
At halftime I got up out of my seat and headed for the concession stand .
I bought a beer , a large popcorn , and a giant bag of cotton candy – the perfect accessory to add to my visibility and helplessness .
Even better , the cotton candy came with an orange Knicks stocking cap – something that could add a little pizazz to my “ lost sports fan ” ensemble later on .
At the next break in action , I stumbled through the gate looking for my seat .
I wandered up some steps one aisle over from my original seat when Agent Todd began casually waving his arms and saying my name : “ Rob , hey Rob , we ’re over here . ”
A few more agents got into it and yelled out my name as I glanced around in a confused state .
Eventually I walked back down the aisle and disappeared back under the gate .
By this time several rows of unsuspecting fans were now tipped off that some idiot named Rob could n’t find his seat .
Rob , upper left .
His friends , bottom right .

He proceeded to walk directly in front of us while we frantically waved our arms and shouted his name to no avail .
After Rob disappeared back under the stands , a concerned lady seated in front of me asked , “ Is your buddy OK ? ”
It seemed pretty insane that he could n’t see or hear us from a distance of about 15 feet .
Rob gives up and leaves
By my second appearance , a few rows over , several crowd members now joined in and yelled my name , “ Rob ! Hey Rob !
Your friends are over there ! ”
Some misunderstood my actual name and screamed , “ Bob ! Bob !
Over here , Bob ! ” – thus creating a perfect blend of chaos and mass hysteria .
Rob ’s 2nd appearance , now on the other side of his friends
More people get up and yell “ Rob ! ”
Rob disappeared again through the gate and continued wandering around the arena to more and more absurd places – from the opposite side of the court to the upper deck .
Rob on the opposite side of the arena
I kept an eye out for him throughout the game , leaping to my feet to point and scream whenever I saw him appear .
Often other fans in the section found him before I did .
Of course spotting Rob across the way was all the more hilarious since his red and white shirt made him look at bit like Waldo .
With each appearance there were tons of people screaming , “ Rob ! ” and waving their hands , trying to get his attention from across the arena .
After receiving a text from Agent Todd , I made a move towards my next appearance – a few sections directly under my original seat – an ideal spot to get maximum exposure .
It was time to put on the orange Knicks stocking cap .
Rob in front of section 112
Rob ’s next entrance was perfect .
He was directly below all of the sections who were looking for him and he entered right when a time - out started .
The crowd went absolutely nuts screaming for him .
What was at once the most remarkable and puzzling aspect of the stunt was the sustained patience of the crowd .
We spent the last 3/8ths of the game distracting everyone within ear - and eye - shot by trying to get the attention of our aimlessly wandering friend .
From both a cost and a value standpoint , the price of Knicks tickets is unconscionable .
But no one got mad .
No one took matters into their own hands ( except one good - spirited fellow in a Cowboys jacket , who walked down two sections to point out to Rob where his friends were sitting , and then remained jolly when Rob still walked the wrong way ) .
Rather , our section — and the section next to us , and the section in front of us — embraced Rob , and our efforts to get him back .
If only the Knicks displayed that kind of teamwork .
r
At the height of this hysteria , Knicks cheerleaders started shooting t- shirts into the crowd .
Amazingly , one landed right at Rob ’s feet .
Everyone laughed their asses off as he immediately put it on .
Seeing Rob catch a cannon - propelled t- shirt during a fourth quarter timeout was easily the funniest moment of the mission .
I ’ve been to dozens of sporting events where t- shirt cannons launch shirts into the crowd , but I ’ve never come close to catching one .
The fact that Rob caught a t - shirt while holding a massive concessions tray only adds to his legend .
Laughing at Rob ’s new shirt
At this point Rob had been standing in the same spot for over a minute , and people sitting near us started shouting at me , “ Just go get him !
He ’s right there !
Go get him ! ” I had n’t anticipated this happening , but I knew I had to do something .
Why would n’t I just go get him ?
I got up and slowly started walking down the steps to get from the 300 level to the 100 level , making sure Rob saw me coming .
I knew there was no way he would let me reach him .
Rob disappeared again just before I could get to him , and I returned to my seat , defeated .
“ I tried chasing him in the hallway , but he must have walked the opposite direction ! ”
Agent Lathan :
I figured the only way to heighten my next appearance was by getting as close to the floor as possible – on the exact opposite side of the court .
I figured I ’d get stopped by the ushers , but amazingly they let me through .
I made it all the way down to the floor – right behind the Hawks bench – and close enough to make a brief appearance on TV .

At this point the crowd around us was way more interested in Rob than the Knicks .
Although they were ahead at halftime , by the fourth quarter the Hawks had a large lead .
A group of kids seated behind us kept yelling about Rob , and eventually got a pretty big “ Where is Rob ? ” chant going .
The kids would also try to trick me , by screaming that they saw him across the court .
I ’d jump up and say , “ Where ? ” and they ’d laugh at me .
“ Your friend is an idiot , ” they kept yelling at me .
I just kept agreeing .
“ Yeah , he ’s an idiot . ”
The downside of the Knicks getting blown out was that fans started leaving the game early .
The plan was for Rob to return right as the game ended , but this would n’t work if everyone in our area was already gone .
Agent Lathan :
My seats were on the opposite side of the arena and I had to travel up two escalators .
I broke into a jog .
At one point I made a wrong turn and went up a staircase the led to a locked door .
So while I was trying to get “ fake ” lost , I actually got really lost .
Finally I made my triumphant return .
The entire section greeted me with a loud cheer .
High fiving Rob as he finally returned to his seat
Finally I made it back just before the end of the game .
The entire section erupted in applause .
Some youngsters seated directly behind the agents were especially excited to see my return , “ Rob !
Where were you ? ” I just shook my head and responded , “ Aw man , I ’ve been looking all over for you guys . ”
The entire section chanted , “ We found Rob ! ” CLAP - CLAP CLAP -CLAP-CLAP .
“ We found Rob ! ”
Cheering for Rob in the back
Rob received a thunderous standing ovation when he finally found his seat , and the scene that ensued was total bedlam .
More than one hundred Knicks fans mobbed Rob after the game clock wound down .
They hugged him , high - fived him , and asked for his autograph .
It was like something out of A Hard Day ’s Night .
Rob posed for dozens of pictures while fans chanted his name .
I guess rooting for Rob to find his seat is a lot like rooting for the Knicks to win – it ’s a hopeless cause , but you ca n’t help cheering for the underdog anyway .
There was a group of European exchange students in the section right next to ours .
Of everyone in the area , they loved Rob the most .
It was their first sporting event in America , and they were simply amazed somebody could get that lost .
One kid from Spain with a hoarse voice kept yelling , “ Listen to my voice Rob !
My voice is not for the Knicks .
My voice is for you ! ” ( I think he meant he was hoarse from yelling at Rob the whole game . )
The group ’s teacher asked Rob if he would pose for a photo with all of them .
The mission was tons of fun for everyone involved .
It really did seem like everyone cheering for Rob legitimately thought he was lost .
Of course the point was n’t to fool people , the point was to make people laugh and smile at something ridiculous .
It ’s so awesome to see a crowd unite and experience something crazy together .
Whether these Knicks fans ever see this page or not , hopefully they ’ll always remember the night they helped some idiot find his seat .
Mission Accomplished .

Helium is atomic number 2 on the periodic table , with the element symbol He .
It is a colorless , flavorless gas , best known for its use in filling floating balloons .
Here is a collection of facts about this lightweight , interesting element :
Helium Element Facts
Helium Atomic Number : 2
Helium Symbol : He
Helium Atomic Weight : 4.002602 ( 2 )
Helium Discovery : Janssen , 1868 , some sources say Sir William Ramsey , Nils Langet , P.T. Cleve 1895
Helium Electron Configuration : 1s2
Word Origin : Greek : helios , sun .
Helium was first detected as a new spectral line during a solar eclipse , so it is named for the Greek Titan of the Sun .
Isotopes : 9 isotopes of helium are known .
Only two isotopes are stable : helium - 3 and helium - 4 .
While the isotopic abundance of helium varies depending on geographical location and source , 4 He accounts for nearly all of the natural helium .
Properties : Helium is a very light , inert , colorless gas .
Helium has the lowest melting point of any element .
It is the only liquid that cannot be solidified by lowering the temperature .
It remains liquid down to absolute zero at ordinary pressures , but can be solidified by increasing the pressure .
The specific heat of helium gas is unusually high .
The density of helium vapor at the normal boiling point is also very high , with the vapor expanding greatly when heated to room temperature .
Although helium normally has a valence of zero , it has a weak tendency to combine with certain other elements .
Uses : Helium is widely used in cryogenic research because its boiling point is near absolute zero .
It is used in the study of superconductivity , as an inert gas shield for arc welding , as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals and producing titanium and zirconium , for pressuring liquid fuel rockets , for use in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , as a cooling medium for nuclear reactors , and as a gas for supersonic wind tunnels .
A mixture of helium and oxygen is used as an artificial atmosphere for divers and others working under pressure .
Helium is used for filling balloons and blimps .
Sources : Except for hydrogen , helium is the most abundant element in the universe .
It is an important component in the proton - proton reaction and the carbon cycle , which account for the energy of the sun and stars .
Helium is extracted from natural gas .
In fact , all natural gas contains at least trace quantities of helium .
The fusion of hydrogen into helium is the sources of a hydrogen bomb 's energy .
Helium is a disintegration product of radioactive substances , so it is found in ores of uranium , radium , and other elements .
Most of Earth 's helium dates back to the planet 's formation , although a small amount falls to Earth within cosmic dust and some is produced via beta decay of tritium .
Health Effects : Helium serves no biological function .
Trace amounts of the element are found in human blood .
While helium is considered to be non -toxic , it displaces oxygen so inhaling it can lead to hypoxia or asphyxiation .
Fatalities from inhaling helium are rare .
Liquid helium is a cryogenic liquid , so risks include frostbite from exposure and explosion from expansion if the liquid is stored in a sealed container .
The mixture of helium and oxygen ( heliox ) can cause high - pressure nervous syndrome , however the addition of nitrogen can remedy the issue .
Compounds :
Because a helium atom has a valence of zero , it has extremely low chemical reactivity .
However , unstable compounds called excimers can be formed when electricity is applied to the gas .
HeH + is stable in its ground state , but it is the strongest known Bronsted acid , capable of protonating any species it encounters .
Van der Waals compounds form with cryogenic helium gas , such as LiHe .

Jane Harman represents the status quo
While applauding House passage Friday of overhaul legislation and urging quick Senate action , Obama expressed frustration with banks that were helped by a taxpayer bailout and now are " fighting tooth and nail with their lobbyists " against new government controls ...
The president also told CBS ' 60 Minutes that " the people on Wall Street still do n't get it .
...
They 're still puzzled why it is that people are mad at the banks .
Well , let 's see .
You guys are drawing down $ 10 , $ 20 million bonuses after America went through the worst economic year ... in decades and you guys caused the problem , " Obama said in an excerpt released in advance of Sunday night 's broadcast of his interview .
... No House Republicans voted for the bill , and 27 Democrats voted against it .
Opponents argue that the broad legislation overreaches and would institutionalize bailouts for the financial industry .
The Senate , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is working on its own version of the package .
In his address , Obama contended that the worst economic downturn since the Depression would n't have happened if the rules governing Wall Street been clearer and enforcement tougher .
Obama singled out Republicans and industry lobbyists for trying to block the changes .
Last week , top House Republicans urged more than 100 financial industry lobbyists to work harder to defeat the bill .
Lobbyists have spent more than $ 300 million this year trying to scuttle the bill .
“ This amendment strikes an appropriate balance that is good for debtors , creditors , taxpayers , financial institutions along with all of the innocent homeowners that have been dragged into this mess .
And it will not increase the future cost of home credit .
It ’s a rare win , win , win .
“ Over the past three years , millions of Americans have lost their homes through foreclosure and millions more are at risk of losing their homes .
Relying solely on taxpayer - financed incentives to encourage the lending industry to voluntarily resolve our nation ’s foreclosure crisis has proven to be woefully inadequate .
Thankfully there is an answer .
Today , several of my colleagues and I have introduced an amendment to H.R. 4173 , the “ Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 , ” that will give American families facing foreclosure a critical lifeline by which to save their homes .
Our amendment -- which wo n’t cost taxpayers a single penny -- will allow a homeowner under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge to extend a mortgage ’s repayment term ; reduce excessive high interest rates and exorbitant hidden fees ; and , under certain limited circumstances , allow the principal amount of the mortgage to be adjusted to the home ’s fair market value .
Our amendment rectifies an anomaly in current law that allows virtually every other type of secured obligation to be modified , except for home mortgages .
Most importantly , my amendment will help stop the endless cycle of foreclosures that lead to abandoned homes in communities across our nation and that , in turn , cause neighborhood property values and tax revenues to further decline .
I am hopeful that passing this amendment will send the signal that the House feels strongly that this provision must be passed into law to help resolve the ongoing mortgage crisis . ”
I am well aware of the anxiety many constituents feel when out of work and unable to find a job .
There ’s the scramble to cover the month ’s rent , provide food and make tuition or car payments -- and for some , feelings of depression and questions of self worth .
There are currently 2.3 million jobless Californians -- 620,000 in Los Angeles County -- more than at any time in the past three decades .
Getting people back to work is urgent -- and vital if what is at present only an “ asset ” recovery is to become a true economic recovery .
Recall where the economy was at the start of this year : foreclosures were at record levels , bank lending was frozen , and nearly $ 10 trillion in wealth had been lost as the stock market spiraled out of control .
In just three months , 2 million Americans lost their jobs .
While some economic indicators are improving , South Bay residents have certainly felt the pinch .
Trade at the Ports of LA and Long Beach is down 21 percent , idling 20,000 longshore workers , truckers and warehouse workers .
And across the board , our local communities have seen unemployment rates shoot dramatically upwards .
... Though it was n’t the only cause of the economic crisis , inadequate financial regulation also contributed to the problem .
This week the House voted on H.R. 4173 , the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , which is intended to overhaul the financial regulatory system .
For the first time , credit default swaps will be regulated , many predatory lending practices will be outlawed and credit rating agencies will be held accountable .
The government will increase the reserves big banks must set aside , monitor firms that are so large and interconnected that their collapse would endanger the financial system and establish a process for reorganizing and dismantling failing institutions .
These changes are critical safeguards against the kind of irresponsible business practices that helped trigger the credit crisis .
This legislation also establishes a new federal consumer agency , which to me is problematic .
I worry that another government reorganization will not work .
We want representatives who truly represent us , working men and women -- not Wall Street or million - dollar CEOs spending weekends on their yachts .
Once again , however , my Blue Dog opponent , who also voted for the mean - spirited bankruptcy bill , sides with big corporations against the people of our district .
While thousands of homeowners from West Los Angeles to San Pedro face foreclosure , not only on their home but of the American Dream , Harman votes to slam the door in their face , to essentially kick them out of their living room .
Why should banks receive billions in bail - out money , refuse to renegotiate home loans , and then get a pass in bankruptcy court ?
In Congress I will work to strengthen the Progressive Caucus , to work with progressive caucuses in each state party , so that together we can create the political will to successfully reintroduce the amendment .
I want to ensure working families , the American middle class , can renegotiate their home loans to enjoy a stable and secure future in their living room .
Funny that Obama was willing to posture against the Wall Street banksters and their nefarious lobbyists in his radio address this morning , but stopped short at going after the shamelessly corrupt Democrats who weakened the bill so badly and the 27 who voted with the Republicans against it .
As we reported over the course of Thursday and yesterday , the House passed , 223-202 -- without a single Republican vote -- a package of reforms to prevent the kinds of abuses that would have inevitably led to another Wall Street meltdown .
A coalition of corrupt , conservative Democrats in thrall to the banking industry , primarily Blue Dogs , formed a coalition with the Republicans to water down the legislation significantly .
And one of their most insidious accomplishments was their ability to strip " cramdown " out of the bill entirely .
Cramdown ( the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 had passed the House last March -- only to be defeated a month later in what Dick Durbin famously called the bank - owned Senate .
A dozen conservative Democrats like Blanche Lincoln , Mark Pryor , Arlen Specter , Mary Landrieu , Tom Carper and , of course , Ben Nelson had joined with the entire GOP to defeat the Obama - backed House legislation that was meant to allow bankruptcy court judges to reset some mortgage terms to help families save their homes from foreclosure .
At the time of the House vote we tried to show why even some Republicans in foreclosure - plagued districts broke ranks with their party 's obstructionist leadership to vote for the bill .
Joined by unlikely new convert Ron Paul , three of them were still onboard Friday , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R- FL ) , Walter Jones ( R- NC ) and Mike Turner ( R - OH ) , one of 9 co-sponsors of the amendment .
Mario Diaz - Balart was back to his comfort zone / default position of rubber stamping GOP leadership decisions , while his brother Lincoln ducked the vote altogether .
Mike Castle ( R - DE ) , now in a tough race for the GOP nomination for an open Senate seat in Delaware -- and under attack by teabaggers for being too " moderate " -- flip - flopped , and voted against the provision this time .
Among the Democrats my first surprise came that the amendment was actually introduced by arch - Blue Dog Jim Marshall of Georgia .
True , his own constituents have been catastrophically hit by mortgage foreclosures but he rarely lets little things like that get in his way of opposing the aspirations of working families .
This time he actually sounded almost as much like a Democrat as his two colleagues who pushed it most aggressively , progressives John Conyers and Zoe Lofgren .
Marshall : Lofgren sounded a more populist note by pointing out that " the only people who have not been helped in this economic crisis are homeowners .
This legislation would finally give American homeowners the same protection that large corporations enjoy . ”
But , predictably is was Conyers who gave voice to the full scope of why America needs this legislation :
Alas , though , in March only 24 conservative Democrats voted with the GOP against working families , Yesterday it was a staggering 71 !
Let 's look at one particularly slimy flip - flopper : California Blue Dog Jane Harman .
Harman , through a marriage to a rich , elderly industrialist , is one of the two or three wealthiest members of Congress .
Her Los Angeles district , CA - 36 , includes some very wealthy neighborhoods -- and some very poor ones .
There have been 7,526 foreclosures so far and it is estimated that within the next 4 years that number will rise to 25,053 .
Yesterday , on the same day she joined the Republicans to vote against mortgage reform , Harman -- who is in a battle of political survival with grassroots reformer Marcy Winograd -- sent this expression of compassion and faux empathy to her constituents :
She forgot to mention that she voted against the " cramdown " legislation that Obama said he needed to address the predatory mortgage abuses .
But she did tell voters that she has a jobs bulletin board on her website and that if you can't find work you can always volunteer for something !
I managed to track down Marcy Winograd this morning and ask her if she would be a different kind of representative for the South Bay than Harman .
( I admit that I have an idea that she will be but I wanted to hear it in her own words . )
Everything Marcy has done in her life leads me to believe that that statement represents the kind of congressmember she will be -- way up at the top of the foodchain with principled and effective fighters like Alan Grayson , Donna Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , Jerry Nadler , Raul Grijalva and Barbara Lee .
That 's why I never hesitate in askingreaders to go to the Bad Dogs page and donate to Marcy 's grassroots campaign to dislodge the most beatable Blue Dog in California .

Advertisement Scientists are planning to develop a paint coating for military vehicles which would soak up a chemical warfare agent and then decontaminate itself .
The technology could protect those operating in or around a vehicle after a chemical attack .
It would be adapted from " strippable " coatings currently used to provide temporary camouflage for vehicles .
The development work is being carried out by the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ( DSTL ) .
Dr Steven Mitchell , from DSTL 's headquarters at Porton Down in Wiltshire , said the next generation of paint could be engineered to absorb chemical warfare agents .
Ultimately , what we'd love to do is develop a paint technology that is ' self - disclosing '
Dr Steven Mitchell , DSTL
Further down the line , scientists are looking into reactive coatings .
These would incorporate catalysts and possibly enzymes allowing the paint to " self - decontaminate " .
" Ultimately , what we'd like to create is a coating that changes colour to indicate it 's been contaminated , decontaminates itself , then returns to the original colour when it 's clean , " said Dr Mitchell , acting team leader for hazard management and decontamination at DSTL .
" This is a long - term but not unreasonable ultimate objective . "
Currently , strippable - or peelable - coatings are used when a new camouflage is required , changing a vehicle 's colour from green to , for example , " light stone " in order to blend with desert terrain .
But even if something is not visible from far away , it may reveal itself by reflecting sunlight ; the paint can also alter the vehicle 's " glint signature " , helping conceal it from hostile troops .
Under the skin DSTL has been collaborating on the technology with industry partner AkzoNobel Aerospace Coatings .
" There are a number of advantages to this technology .
One is its flexibility ; it is easy to apply and easy to remove .
You can change your colour or your signature in theatre in a relatively straightforward manner , " Dr Mitchell told BBC News .
The coating is applied just like normal paint , often using commercially available spray guns .
The paint can be used to temporarily change a vehicle 's camouflage " It 's a single pack emulsion .
It looks much like paint you 'd find in a DIY store for painting your house .
So you could apply it with a paint brush , or you could apply it with a roller .
It 's really flexible , " Dr Mitchell explained .
" That 's important for potential use in theatre because you might not have a sophisticated paint spray system available . "
On the grounds of DSTL 's headquarters , Dr Mitchell demonstrated how to remove the coating from a battlefield ambulance which had been painted for desert camouflage .
The coating on a rear door had been pre-scored with a knife ; Dr Mitchell reached up to the raised tab and peeled back the rubbery skin by hand .
The coating came away easily and largely in one piece .
While paint remained stuck to some raised areas such as bolts , he said remaining residue could be removed with a water power washer .
Before long , the whole door was stripped to the vehicle 's dark green base colour .
Dr Mitchell squashed the peeled coating into a lump and dropped it on the grass .
Chemical peel
Some other coatings require a caustic wash to remove , which means care has to be taken when disposing of the waste .
But this one can be disposed of as general waste as long as it is not contaminated .
Dr Mitchell said DSTL was currently working in partnership with industry to develop a version of the coating that would absorb the vast majority of a liquid chemical warfare agent .
Dr Mitchell wants to develop a coating that is ' self - disclosing '
" That helps prevent the contact hazard .
It also helps prevent people touching the surface and spreading the contamination , " he explained .
Liquid decontamination would still be required ; some parts of vehicles , such as tracks and running gear , are not suitable for the application of a coating .
" Ultimately , what we'd love to do is develop a paint technology that is ' self - disclosing ' - when it becomes contaminated , perhaps it changes colour to tell you it is contaminated with a chemical warfare agent , " Dr Mitchell said .
" Maybe we'd also like to put some chemistry into the coating that would then react with and decontaminate the agent itself .
And then perhaps even a colour change to tell you that process has been successful and the agent has been destroyed . "
However , he stressed that these were long - term research aims : " Clearly , there are a lot of technical hurdles to be overcome to develop something this sophisticated , " Dr Mitchell said .
Medals ceremony
Although current research is focussed on chemical warfare agents , scientists have also been looking at approaches that might tackle radiological and biological agents .
Dr Mitchell was demonstrating the strippable coating technology during the opening of a new energy - efficient building at Porton Down .
The Earl of Wessex , Prince Edward , opened the Minerva Building at the site near Salisbury last week .
The earl was given a tour and was presented with examples of DSTL's work , including cutting - edge research designed to counter Improvised Explosive Devices ( IEDs ) .
He also presented Operational Service Medals for Afghanistan to five DSTL staff who recently returned from providing scientific advice on the frontline .
DSTL scientists and analysts are routinely deployed to theatre in support of operations .
The five staff were Matthew Brookes , a programme leader ; Jarrod Cornforth , an operational analyst ; Robin Hiley , a chief scientist ; Chris Morriss , a concepts adviser and Amy de Vries , a research psychologist .
DSTL chief executive Frances Saunders commented : " These members of staff have gone the extra mile while working alongside our armed forces on the frontline , providing life - saving solutions and advice within extremely short timescales . "

Researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine have determined that patients over 65 years of age with knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) who engage in regular Tai Chi exercise improve physical function and experience less pain .
Tai Chi ( Chuan ) is a traditional style of Chinese martial arts that features slow , rhythmic movements to induce mental relaxation and enhance balance , strength , flexibility , and self - efficacy .
Full findings of the study are published in the November issue of Arthritis Care & Research , a journal of the American College of Rheumatology .
The elderly population is at most risk for developing knee OA , which results in pain , functional limitations or disabilities and a reduced quality of life .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) there are 4.3 million U.S. adults over age 60 diagnosed with knee OA , a common form of arthritis that causes wearing of joint cartilage .
A recent CDC report further explains that half of American adults may develop symptoms of OA in at least one knee by age 85 .
For this study , Chenchen Wang , M.D. , M.Sc. , and colleagues recruited 40 patients from the greater Boston area with confirmed knee OA who were in otherwise good health .
The mean age of participants was 65 years with a mean body mass index of 30.0 kg / m2 .
Patients were randomly selected and 20 were asked to participate in 60 - minute Yang style Tai Chi sessions twice weekly for 12 weeks .
Each session included : a 10 - minute self - massage and a review of Tai Chi principles ; 30 minutes of Tai Chi movement ; 10 minutes of breathing technique ; and 10 minutes of relaxation .
" Tai Chi is a mind - body approach that appears to be an applicable treatment for older adults with knee OA , " said Dr. Wang .
Physical components of Tai Chi are consistent with current exercise recommendations for OA , which include range of motion , flexibility , muscle conditioning , and aerobic work out .
Researchers believe the mental feature of Tai Chi addresses negative effects of chronic pain by promoting psychological wellbeing , life satisfaction , and perceptions of health .
The remaining 20 participants assigned to the control group attended two 60 - minute class sessions per week for 12 weeks .
Each control session included 40 minutes of instruction covering OA as a disease , diet and nutrition , therapies to treat OA , or physical and mental health education .
The final 20 minutes consisted of stretching exercises involving the upper body , trunk , and lower body , with each stretch being held for 10 - 15 seconds .
At the end of the 12 - week period , patients practicing Tai Chi exhibited a significant decrease in knee pain compared with those in the control group .
Using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) pain scale , researchers noted a - 118.80 reduction in pain from baseline between the Tai Chi and control group .
Researchers also observed improved physical function , self - efficacy , depression , and health status for knee OA in subjects in the Tai Chi group .
" Our observations emphasize a need to further evaluate the biologic mechanisms and approaches of Tai Chi to extend its benefits to a broader population , " concluded Dr. Wang .
Evil Twin- spawning Sarah Palin is n't catching any easy breaks lately .
Should she ?
Better ask her fans who , oh wait , are now booing her .
And when Martha Stewart calls you out , damn , you know you 've set some kind of bar .
Not exaggerating .
Martha Stewart got asked by CNN why Sarah Palin 's polarizing .
Martha calls her " boring , " " confused , " " a dangerous person , " and a " real problem . "
The best is when Martha throws down on a patronizing " good for her " when told about her book sales and then , after , " I would n't watch her if you pay me . "
SHOTS FIRED !
And then there 's this wonderful clip .
Palin dipped out of a signing early , and got booed by her fans , who were pissed that they did n't get their books signed .
It goes without saying that Palin 's fans sound just as patently insane hating her as they do loving her , but hey , you can't put lipstick on an neglectful idol , or whatever .
Or you can , but , she 's still gonna stiff you for a book signature .
This sounds like the worst book tour ever .
... As opposed to former New York Times $ 25 and Under food writer Peter Meehan and Momofuku Cookbook chef David Chang 's book tour .
Which goes something like this :
WHY was somebody calling me ?
Did n't they know I was still DRUNK from the night before ?
It was 5:00 a.m . Tosi explained to me what was going on .
I had to get to Ssam Bar to pick up her and Gabe , a cook who'd be coming down to help us , and head to LGA .
I was fucked up .
Tosi wanted to kill me .
I was literally falling over in a drunken stupor like Dudley Moore in Arthur .
My life had two - day hangover written all over it .
Arrive at airport at 5:50 for a 6:30 am flight and magically got on .
For some reason , the flight got delayed for four hours ... but it was all news to me : I pilled myself out , so I came to on the runway in Memphis .
See , Sarah Palin !
If you 're gonna do the book tour of a dangerous person who does n't give a shit about pissing people off , there 's a right way , and a wrong way .
As far as signing books goes , if you ever need help , do n't be afraid to ask .
We might know a thing or two about it to help you on your way .

Last week I switched from my trusty original ( non - 3G ) iPhone to Verizon for the much - heralded Motorola DROID .
I ’ve been seeing Google ’s Android OS maturing over the last year and a half , and now I ’m convinced that within the next couple of years , Android devices are going to be a huge deal .
Right now we ’re seeing pretty much all of the American wireless carriers release many next - generation Android devices with different form factors and fitting different price ranges – instead of the iPhone ’s “ one size fits all ” approach , Android is taking the same route as Windows Mobile , getting packed onto many devices from different manufacturers with a bunch of different specs in hopes that each device will better appeal to a diverse customer base .
The HTC Hero hit Europe last July and it seemed like the perfect device for me – save for its sluggish speed .
Then comes the Droid on Verizon , which had a big feature list that stood out to me .
When I found out that my state employee discounts make the Droid cheaper than my old iPhone plan , I decided to give it a try .
Verizon has an extended return period during the holidays , so I have until the middle of January to figure out if Android OS and the Droid are for me , or if my iPhone and I are in for a longer - term relationship than I had planned .
( This is n’t a full - on review of the Droid – Engadget has an excellent one – but this is more about my personal experiences with the Droid from the perspective of a 2 + year iPhone user . )
The short of it is that the Droid has an amazing list of awesome features , but it lacks the iPhone ’s incredibly polished user experience and attention to every detail .
That tradeoff will mean different things to different kinds of users ; I ’m a nerd who has to deal with complicated systems on a regular basis , but I have a feeling that people just looking for a phone that complements their lifestyle with minimal fuss will still fare better with an iPhone or BlackBerry experience .
A few things I absolutely love about the Droid :
Its 858×480 3.7 ″ screen is AMAZING .
I love the iPhone screen , but I was surprised by the difference that the Droid ’s insanely high PPI ( pixels per inch ) count makes .
It ’s most obvious when viewing websites , where much more content is clearly visible without the need to zoom in .
In the dark , I did notice that the iPhone has a better viewing angle , and the ambient light sensor on the Droid is a lot quicker to change the screen brightness , so if shadows pass over your phone , it might decide to freak out on you .
Multitasking apps is a huge deal .
Any app can continually run in the background – so all day , I get notifications from Facebook , Twitter , Gmail , and Instant Messaging .
Also , switching between apps currently running goes much quicker than the iPhone , which can be susceptible to lots of time waiting for things to load if you ’re trying to , say , copy and paste segments between the browser and a notetaking program .
I ’m also glad that Android automatically manages your running processes ; the multitasking Windows Mobile leaves everything running unless you open the task manager and quit processes , which most people do n’t think to do , so their phones just get slow and lose tons of battery life .

I ’m also glad that Android automatically manages your running processes ; the multitasking Windows Mobile leaves everything running unless you open the task manager and quit processes , which most people do n’t think to do , so their phones just get slow and lose tons of battery life .
Having a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus , LED “ flash ” and a physical shutter button is a godsend .
Photo quality is still pretty miserable , but the experience is better than my older iPhone .
( The 3GS has 3.2MP and autofocus as well . )
The LED message indicator flashes for notifications - something most phones have , but the iPhone does n’t .
The mix of metal and rubberized plastic casing on the phone : this thing is durable , a weight that feels good in the hand , but still manages to keep an unpretentious look that would n’t look weird in a boardroom .
If you use Google services a lot – Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Talk , Google Voice - you can’t find a more seamless experience than Android .
Android 2.0 has amazing contact sync between Google , Exchange , and Facebook contacts .
I did n’t have to enter a single phone number because my contacts just synced right away , and my contacts automatically get their latest Facebook profile picture and phone number .
The notification panel can be pulled down within any application – so I can see new e-mail subjects , tweets , and messages without having to stop using my current app .
It seems more stable than iPhone OS under heavy use - my iPhone pretty commonly crashes programs when it runs out of memory , especially when loading large webpages .
Not only is Google less of a control freak about application distribution , but the OS itself is much more customizable and extensible by third party apps .
I did n’t like the lock screen or the music player app , but I was able to find great replacements in the Android Marketplace – something I could n’t do with the iPhone .
Being on Verizon means not having to worry about reception just about anywhere in the United States .
I ’m no CDMA fan , but AT&T ’s reception is truly frustrating .
I ’m having a hard time deciding about text entry .
I ’m a very fast typist on the iPhone ’s virtual keyboard , and have learned how to trust its autocorrection dictionary and even type in Spanish .
The Droid has both a physical keyboard and landscape / portrait virtual keyboards .
The physical keyboard is n’t great by any measure , but I do enjoy using it while doing lots of messaging because I have the full screen showing the conversation .
I do n’t like Android ’s landscape virtual keyboard , because it often maximizes the selected text entry field , taking away all of my UI view whenever I want to view text .
The portrait mode keyboard is quite good , however .
I am still adjusting to the ( barely ) different layout and sensitivity from that of the iPhone , so I ’m not as fast yet , and the autocorrection is an adjustment too .
Right now , I ’d say that Android 2.0 ’s virtual keyboards are about 90 % as good as the iPhone ’s , so I ’d be happy with a non-QWERTY Android phone too .
Despite all of these good things , the last week using the Droid has made me realize just how much attention of detail went into iPhone OS , and how I took some seemingly small features for granted .
Here are just some of the annoying things I ’ve run into :
The first - party music app is dismal , and does n’t have podcast support .
That said , there are third party apps that work better .
Notification ringtones for SMS and e-mail abruptly interrupt any playing music – the iPhone fades music before and after playing a ringtone .
The notification area is buggy and regularly shows notifications that I ’ve already cleared out once a new one comes in .
When I receive an SMS message , the screen does not turn on to show me the message like the iPhone does .
Instead , I have to turn the phone on , unlock the screen , and pull down the notifications area before I can see any message text .
The proximity sensor is n’t good enough - I frequently am on the phone only to find my cheek mashing the virtual keypad on an active screen .
The text messaging app gives unknown callers the image of the last known caller – so I get text messages from Verizon Wireless that have my mom ’s image .
It ’s very awkward to think that my mom is telling me I can pay my bill online !
Android ’s App Marketplace is quickly growing to become a huge one like Apple ’s – but it ’s not there yet .
It has 12,000 apps to Apple ’s 100,000 , and there are admittedly a lot of lower - quality applications because there is little to no approval process .
I am confident that this will be a very different story in a couple of years , but I still find myself sneaking back to my deactivated iPhone to use its better Twitter , Facebook , and Evernote apps .
Many Droid users , including me , are reporting that the battery door falls off very easily .
I keep it in my front pocket and the friction from pulling it out is often enough to slide it off .
I cut a business card to size and put that inside , and that cleared up the issue .
Despite the dedicated GPU and snappy CPU , some UI actions are still quite sluggish , and it looks like its graphics capabilities are nowhere near that of the iPhone .
My guess is that Android ’s Java base is to blame , since this powerful hardware is hampered by running a virtual machine and executing code at runtime .
This platform is naturally going to give it performance penalties compared to OSes that allow precompiled binaries .
So overall , I ’m on the fence about Android OS and the Droid .
I have a very optimistic outlook for Android OS , and the Droid finally presents a very , very good Android device .
Most of my gripes are related to software , which I suspect will be addressed sooner rather than later .
I do n’t see any Android device as an “ iPhone killer ” because I think both platforms have a very strong future ahead of them .
The question I have to ask myself , as do others , is about what they need out of their smartphone .
Carrier differences aside , Android offers way more customization and features for power users and Google users .
The iPhone experience is much more streamlined and polished ; it ’s straightforward and complements your lifestyle rather than trying to be the center of it .
Right now , the iPhone has a much larger app store and much , much better games .
Am I going to switch back to my iPhone or not ?
I do n’t know yet .
It ’s going to take a few more weeks to decide .
The Droid tempts me with many things I could n’t do with my iPhone , but I ’m not sure if it ’s worth leaving the amazing iPod app and ease of use behind .

Call it a bikelash !
A group of enraged cyclists fought back against the city for removing the Bedford Avenue bike lane last week , repainting the lane under cover of darkness last Friday night .
The two - wheeled crusaders went out late with rollers , paint , homemade stencils — and , of course , a video crew — to document their act of uncivil disobediance .
“ We are NY city bicyclists and our message is clear , ” the dissidents announced at the end of their video .
“ Do n’t take away our bike lanes . ”
But early on Monday morning , when they returned to finish up , a patrol unit from South Williamsburg Shomrim Jewish police force , intervened and called cops .
After an investigation , the NYPD arrested two of the painters , but a source told The Brooklyn Paper that four more Williamsburg bikers and two Hasidim were also part of the re-laning effort .
The controversy began on Dec. 1 when the city sandblasted the painted bike lane along a 14 - block stretch between Flushing and Division avenues , citing nearby bike paths along Kent and Wythe avenues as more than sufficient .
But that explanation did not quell persistent rumors in the biking and blogging communities that the lane was removed at the behest of Hasidic leaders , who claim that the lane hinders buses dropping off and picking up children at the numerous religious schools on the route , and populates the neighborhood with scantily clad females .
Hasidic officials refused to talk about the issue this week , but one insider said that political pressure was exerted on the city to remove the lane .
“ It was a power play by Hasidic leaders who need to scare community members into behaving , ” said Baruch Herzfeld , the Orthodox Jewish owner of the Traif Bike Geschaft shop on S. Sixth Street .
Herzfeld , together with environmental advocacy group Time ’s Up ! , is organizing a rally in support of the lane on Sunday , to be led by a brigade of bicycle clowns .
The Department of Transportation did n’t exactly deny the allegation that the Hasidic community demanded the bike lane ’s removal , merely referring The Brooklyn Paper back to its original statement that called the lane ’s removal a “ network readjustment . ”
The agency said it will fight back against the repainting this week .
“ Any paint remaining after [ Wednesday ’s ] rainfall will be removed , ” said Scott Gastel , an agency spokesperson .
The bike advocacy organization Transportation Alternatives condemned the removal of the lane , but recommended that , like Rosa Parks or Gandhi , bikers should employ passive resistance .
“ Cyclists need not risk arrest to ensure their right to ride on Bedford Avenue .
It is theirs , ” said Wiley Norvell , communications director for the group .
Bike activists repainted the Bedford Avenue bike lane the other night — and much of their efforts are still visible .

FBI knew of CIA torture , considered prosecution
By Tom Eley
4 November 2009
Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) agents witnessed the torture of inmates at secret Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) overseas prisons in 2002 , according to documents partially declassified in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the advocacy group Judicial Watch .
In September 2002 , the FBI agents saw prisoners chained naked to chairs , “ manacled to the ceiling and subjected to blaring music around the clock , ” and knew of written orders to CIA agents asking them to compare “ How close is each [ interrogation ] technique to the ‘ rack and screw ’ “ ( an extreme method of torture ) .
The Obama administration resisted release of the documents , and continues to withhold critical information , including a transcript of an interview between FBI Director Robert Mueller and investigators on the question of “ terror suspect ” interrogations .
The newly released documents , including a Justice Department inspector general ’s report , remain highly redacted in critical sections .
Nonetheless , the new revelations fill out a few more details , adding to an overwhelming body of evidence that proves that the torture and murder of prisoners was not some aberration carried out by a handful of “ rogue agents . ”
It was systematic , and was ordered and overseen from the Bush White House on down .
The documents “ paint a very clear picture of extreme micro-managing of the CIA ’s detention and interrogation program , ” Alex Abdo , a legal fellow with the ACLU told Free Speech Radio News .
“ Discussions about what types of techniques to use , what specific interrogation protocols to implement on particular detainees were occurring at a very , very high level in the Bush administration . ”
“ The documents released today add to our knowledge about the origins , scope and consequences of the Bush administration ’s torture program , ” Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project commented in a statement .
“ The documents are also a reminder , however , of gross human rights abuses that have yet to be investigated seriously by Congress or the Justice Department ( DOJ ) . ”
The documents show that the FBI was involved , albeit to a lesser extent than the CIA and the US military , in the interrogation of prisoners at Guantánamo , in Iraq and Afghanistan , and secret “ black site ” prisons in a number of third - party countries .
Significantly , the FBI doubted the legality of the CIA ’s methods , the documents reveal .
So much so , in fact , that unnamed figures in the FBI contemplated prosecuting CIA personnel for torture — among them a CIA agent who threatened to torture a prisoner with a power drill — and it ordered agents not to participate in CIA interrogation sessions in which “ enhanced ” techniques were used .
In another instance , an FBI agent who traveled to a secret prison seeking to interrogate Ramzi bin al - Shibh , a suspect in the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , found him “ naked and chained to the floor . ”
The agent said that he had obtained intelligence from al - Shibh in 45 minutes of interviewing him before the CIA “ shut down the interview . ”
Afterwards , the FBI raised concerns about its agent ’s participation .
The interrogation “ indicates that a ‘ bright line rule ’ against FBI participation or assistance to interrogations in which other investigators used non-FBI techniques was not fully established or followed , ” according to one of the documents .
Bin al - Shibh is currently being held at the Guantánamo Bay prison camp and may face the death penalty for his alleged role in 9/11 .
Among other new revelations , the documents confirm that 24 of the 29 interrogation methods used at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison camp in Iraq were personally approved by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
Rumsfeld had endorsed the “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” for use at Guantanamo in 2002 , but his memo soon provided the basis for abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ The first 24 techniques were adopted virtually verbatim , ” from Rumsfeld ’s memo , according to a revised version of a Justice Department inspector general ’s report from 2008 .
The Obama administration ’s efforts to bury the crimes of its predecessor mean that , in all probability , the same abuse is ongoing today .
While the secret CIA prison gulag has been closed down — even prior to Obama ’s executive order issued in February — there can be little doubt that at Guantánamo , and in prisons in Iraq , Afghanistan , and in third - party countries , torture continues .
The documents “ tell us very little about the current treatment of detainees , ” Abdo said , pointing to “ the new Guantánamo , which is the Bagram air base in Afghanistan . ”
Researchers may have taken a step towards curing the rare , inherited brain disease made famous by the movie Lorenzo 's Oil - - and also towards ushering a new era of gene therapy .
To help two young boys suffering from the disease , researchers tried an experimental treatment using a deactivated version of the HIV virus .
The virus delivered working copies of a gene to stem cells from the patients ' bone marrows .
The HIV
virus , stripped of genetic material that makes it toxic , integrates permanently into the DNA of cells it enters , scientists said .
That means the modified gene remains in the blood - forming stem cells for the life of the patient [ Bloomberg ] .
Adrenoleukodystrophy , or ALD , is a progressive disease characterized by the gradual destruction of the myelin sheaths that insulate neurons and nerves , allowing electrical signals to be transmitted through them .
The disease is caused by a genetic defect , which prevents cells in the bone marrow from producing a crucial protein necessary for the formation of the myelin sheaths .
Typically , children with ALD are given bone marrow transplants to provide them with healthy blood - forming stem cells , but in the two cases described in the study , no matching donors could be found .
In the experimental treatment , described in a paper published in Science , researchers
took blood stem cells from the patients ' bone marrow and used the new vector system to genetically alter them by inserting a working copy of the ... gene .
The modified cells were then put back into the patients [ Reuters ] .
The boys are now seven years old , and if the disease had continued on its course they would have been nearly dead by now .
Says lead researcher Patrick Aubourg :
“ They would now be unable to speak , to walk , to communicate , to sit , to eat .
They would be in an advanced stage of the disease , in a vegetative state ....
Instead they go to school .
They live a normal life ” [ Wired.com ] .
Aubourg says brain scans of the two boys show the myelin destruction has come to a halt , and cognitive tests have shown no further deterioration over the course of several years .
The tactic will be tested further to see if its beneficial effects extend to other patients , and the treated boys will also be monitored for any late - breaking side effects .
So far the researchers have detected no ill effects , but they will be vigilant because
gene therapy is still best - known for its high - profile failures .
In 1999 , 18 - year - old Jesse Gelsinger died during tests of a gene therapy for a rare metabolic disorder .
In 2003 , two French children receiving treatment for severe immune deficiencies developed leukemia .
But with the recent success of a gene therapy for blindness , and the refinement of new , apparently more reliable methods , gene therapy may have turned a corner [ Wired.com ] .

One might think that after centuries of scanning the night skies , mankind would have a pretty clear idea of who our galactic neighbors are , and whether they mean us harm .
That ’s not the case .
Vast landscapes of the cosmos remain hidden to us because most of our telescopes plumb the heavens for light that can be seen by the human eye -- and that constitutes only a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum .
“ Think of a wall map , ” said Edward Wright , an astronomy professor at UCLA .
The map may show the whole world , “ but I ca n’t figure out from it where the national parks are .
If I have an atlas with a much more detailed view , I can plan my vacation . ”
Making a better atlas is what Wright and his colleagues hope to do with NASA ’s Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer , or WISE , space mission .
Scheduled to launch Friday from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California , the $ 320 - million spacecraft will photograph the entire night sky in infrared light .
In the process , it will capture hundreds of thousands of previously unknown objects that are too cool and too dark to light up our nighttime sky .
Like alleyway skulkers with hats pulled low over their eyes , these objects have been lurking around space for millions of years , yet hidden from view .
These denizens of the dark are likely to include tens of thousands of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter -- some of which could turn out to be an eventual threat to Earth ; dozens of failed stars known as brown dwarfs ; possibly even a giant planet out beyond Pluto .
Scientists say WISE could revise the familiar portrait of our solar system .
“ What we ’re doing with WISE is opening up the sky in a way that has n’t been possible before .
It will transform the picture of our solar neighborhood , ” said Peter Eisenhardt , a scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge , where the mission is managed .
“ It will give scientists things to study for decades . ”
Steinn Sigurdsson , an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University who is not affiliated with the mission , agrees that WISE offers “ considerable prospects for significant discoveries . ”
It ’s even possible , he says , that the mission could find planets around other stars .
Of course , this is n’t the first time anyone has thought of scanning the sky in wavelengths other than the narrow region of visible light .
Radio telescopes like the Arecibo instrument in Puerto Rico search deep space for the long radio waves emitted by many galaxies .
Other instruments try to capture the intensely short and dangerous gamma rays released by exploding stars .
But some things , such as the process in which stars form from balls of hard - to - see interstellar gas , are much easier to study in the infrared , which can pick up very dim and relatively cool objects .
“ From my perspective , this is an incredibly exciting mission , ” said Andrea Ghez , an astronomy professor at UCLA who is not part of the WISE team .
The forerunner to WISE was NASA ’s Infrared Astronomical Satellite .
Launched in 1983 , it probed the entire sky in the infrared , increasing the number of cataloged astronomical objects by a staggering 70 % .
It detected 350,000 new objects , including comets and wisps of invisible but warm dust clouds in almost every direction of space .
But by using just 62 pixels to measure the heavens , that satellite was a dim flashlight compared to WISE .
Each of WISE ’s four detectors will scan space with 1 million pixels , making the suite of instruments thousands of times more sensitive .
After being launched by a Delta II rocket , WISE will settle into orbit about 326 miles above the Earth ’s surface .
The heart of the 9 - foot - tall spacecraft is a 16 - inch - diameter telescope housed in a shroud of solid , frozen hydrogen called a cryostat .
This floating ice chest is designed to keep the instruments so cold -- as low as minus 445 degrees Fahrenheit -- that the four detectors will not accidentally pick up heat from the mission ’s own electronics .
The first class of objects likely to pop out of hiding is a type of failed star called a brown dwarf .
Brown dwarfs did n’t possess the sheer bulk necessary to sustain the nuclear fusion reaction that causes stars like our sun to burst into flames after collapsing from a ball of gas .
Brown dwarfs do n’t shine , except in the infrared .
Their temperatures , ranging from a downright icy minus 330 degrees to 1,300 degrees , are remnants of the heat generated by their gravitational collapse .
According to Eisenhardt , many scientists believe there are as many brown dwarfs in any region of space as regular stars .
Within 25 light - years of the sun , there are about 100 known stars , only six of which are brown dwarfs .
That means there could be another 90 or so brown dwarfs in that area awaiting discovery .
There is an even chance , Wright said , that one might be closer than the conventional star Proxima Centauri .
Four light - years away , Proxima holds the record for our closest starry neighbor .
“ That would be a very exciting discovery , ” Eisenhardt said .
Within our solar system , WISE will probably uncover as many as 100,000 new asteroids in the rocky junk pile between Mars and Jupiter .
The several hundred thousand asteroids we know now consist mostly of those with surfaces that reflect light well .
Further , the conventional way to measure an asteroid , Wright said , is to equate its size with its brightness .
But some things just do n’t reflect as well as others , regardless of size .
Because WISE will see temperature differences , it will provide a much better tool for judging size , Eisenhardt said .
That does n’t mean the spacecraft will find a “ doomsday asteroid ” that poses a threat to Earth .
What it does mean is that the mission will help scientists judge the size of any threatening asteroid , giving greater advance warning about the ones that could be the next weapon of extinction , like the one suspected of wiping out the dinosaurs .
Finally , Eisenhardt and other members of the WISE team think there is a decent possibility of finding a new planet on the fringes of our solar system .
The solar system ’s Wild West is the Kuiper Belt , where thousands of icy bodies roam , including Pluto , the former ninth planet in our solar system that lost its status when the International Astronomical Union decided several years ago that it was too small to be a planet .
Beyond that is the Oort Cloud , the home of lots of comets that occasionally wander into the inner solar system .
“ We know stuff is out there , ” Eisenhardt said .
“ It ’s possible there could be a planet larger than Jupiter . ”
Roger Launius , a space expert at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C. , was skeptical of that kind of speculation .
“ There ’s no theoretical work that suggests there ’s a big planet out there , ” he said .
Still , though Launius admits to bouts of cynicism in the face of NASA “ ballyhooing ” its missions , he said this one could yield important findings .
“ This is part of the electromagnetic spectrum where we have n’t done that much . ”

Advice on home improvement
Today marks the first day of a long journey which myself and my wife have been planning for around a decade now .
What 's that ?
I hear you asking .
Well , to put it simply , we 've gone all in and purchased a little bungalow in the middle of the countryside away from the city lights .
Granted , it 's a bit run down and will need extensive renovation work carried out on it , but that 's the whole point of this blog .
We shall be providing home improvement guides for you to use as we go about putting the pieces of our dream home together .
To give readers the full picture , I am planning to spend months and months completely overhauling the design and layout of the kitchen , lounge , back yard , bathroom , and its two bedrooms .
Alongside that , there is a need to re-wire the electrics .
So we 've got quite a lot to keep us busy , but it will enable us to bring our vision of a family home to life .
As someone who has spent the past seven years training as a plumber and handyman , some of these tasks are simple .
But for some of the more difficult stuff , I 'll be consulting well known toilet resources like http://www.toiletbrains.com/.
By using there guides and interacting with communities online , I hope to get a full understanding of things I 'm doing wrong , as well as ideas and inspiration .
I 'll be highlighting the areas that we 're working on in more detail below .
First up , the bathroom .
This will prove quite tricky .
The shower area , drainage system , and fixtures are n't fit for purpose , and shall be removed .
Then there is the old fashioned sink and faucets that will need to be either replaced or upgraded .
But the main focus shall be comparing toilets on Thetoiletthrone.com to ensure I get a model that has a powerful flushing mechanism .
This wo n't be easy as there is so many styles .
However , I 'm considering a dual flushing toilet as it tends to be more flexible for a busier household .
Water usage will vary which makes them a economically friendly option .
Next on the list is the living area or lounge .
This is the place me and my family shall be spending most of our time whilst at home .
So we want to make sure that it lives up to our expectations .
What we do know is the room is quite spacious , with floor space to put down a number of chairs and sofas should we wish to .
It does n't currently have a carpet either , which is something that is being fitted .
There is a slight issue with the heating in this room , which we will be aiming to remedy by insulating the walls and instaling a good wood stove .
As they can be expensive , we will be using warm home guide for log stove ratings .
Next up , the bedroom .
This is arguably the most run down part of the home , and we will almost certainly need to tear up the flooring , put up some wallpaper and add a lick of paint here an there .
We are having a small extension built onto it too with the view to creating an en suite bathroom .
So that 's the interior tasks .
No doubt that alone will keep us busy for many months .
However , the exterior will require quite a bit of work too .
Not just the back yard , but the driveway too .
Small matters like trimming back trees can be fixed using a durable , top rated pole saw listed on polesawpicks.com .
But the heavier work such as relaying and digging up tarmac is going to set us back quite a bit in terms of hiring tools etc .
To help me get this work underway , two close family friends will lend a helping hand .
They are both experienced in their fields of work and will certainly help me out in areas I do n't have the expertise .
As time goes by , and rooms start to take shape , we aim to show our readers before and after pictures , as well as prograss pictures with step by step guides for beginners .
The materials used , plus man hours expected is going to set us back around thirty thousand dollars , which we think we will look back on as being quite cheap upon completion .
However , shopping around for the right price will be essential to ensuring we do n't overspend our budget .
Over time , this will become a website which you can visit for important building advice , be it plumbing , yard maintenance , roofing , tiling , or otherwise .
Third party testing has confirmed that Apple 's new 27 " iMac can only be used as an external display for devices designed to provide DisplayPort video .
It will not work with any equipment that only supports VGA , DVI , or HDMI output .
In a follow - up to its teardown of the 27 " iMac last week , iFixit said it revisited the new hardware to see if it could display high - definition video from a non-DisplayPort external source .
The results of the testing indicate that Apple 's stated specifications for the iMac were correct ; while video input worked as expected with a 13 " MacBook Pro equipped with Mini DisplayPort , all attempts to use a physical adapter dongle to supply alternative video signals to the new 27 " iMac failed .
" The iMac will not act as a second ( or primary ) display using the Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter that Apple sells , " the group 's website stated .
" We tried it on a PS3 Slim , as well as a MacBook and MacBook Pro .
It looks like we 'll have to wait for a special adapter from Apple or a third party . "
A one way street
According to Apple 's stated specifications however , the 27 " iMac 's video input feature will only ever work with DisplayPort devices , and no physical adapter will change that fact .
Apple has frequently used converter dongles on its notebooks in order to support multiple types of video output signaling via the same port .
For example , previous notebook models provided Mini-DVI ports proprietary to Apple which could deliver both VGA and DVI outputs using the appropriate connector .
These ports provided multiple signaling types over the same physical pins .
Apple 's modern machines similarly all supply a Mini DisplayPort connector ( originally designed by Apple but now part of the official DisplayPort specification ) ; using the right connector , users can extract and output any video signal type supported by the computer , including VGA , DVI , HDMI , and DisplayPort .
VGA is analog video ; DVI and HDMI are both digital , electrically compatible , serial video data formats that only differ in their physical connectors ; DisplayPort is an entirely new format that uses a packet signaling format .
The iMac 's Mini DisplayPort supports output of all three , but can only input and display Display Port video .
Unlike moving from DVI to HDMI , converting a DVI signal to DisplayPort requires more than a cheap physical dongle ; it would necessitate a relatively expensive converter box to process the signal into a completely new format and possibly also a scaler to match the output device to the 27 " iMac 's enormous resolution of 2560x1440 .
This prevents the new iMac from serving as an HDTV - style output source for older DVI - based computers or HDMI - output devices such as the Playstation 3 , Xbox 360 , Apple TV , or standard DVD and Blu - Ray players .
Future devices that support the DisplayPort standard will work , of course .
Why no DVI or HDMI input is supported
The 27 " iMac 's inability to input DVI video is rooted in the fact that the DisplayPort specification is uniquely designed to work as both an internal ( video card to built - in display ) and external ( PC to monitor ) video signaling system .
Non-DisplayPort systems typically use LVDS for internal video cabling and DVI for external video connectors .
No Apple computers supply any sort of internal DVI input to support driving their built - in LCD via the DVI port using an external computer .
LONDON , U.K. —
In the more than four years since July 7 , 2005 , when British - born suicide bombers targeted the London transport system , killing 52 and injuring over 700 , Britain ’s government has pumped hundreds of millions into its anti-extremism program .
The government insists its strategy is the envy of terror - fighting nations , designed to keep the public safe , while still safe - guarding the rights of Muslims .
But the 140 million pound ( $ 230 million ) Preventing Violent Extremism ( Prevent ) program is now facing serious criticism , not just from within the Muslim community , but from civil liberties groups .
Most recently a report in the Guardian newspaper last month said that the program was being used to spy on innocent Muslims .
Prevent - funded projects , claimed the paper , are being used to gather general intelligence on Muslims , with police accused of pressuring community workers to provide information on Muslims as a condition of funding .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the British civil rights watchdog Liberty , told the Guardian that the program is “ the biggest domestic spying programme targeting the thoughts and beliefs of the innocent in Britain in modern times . ”
The government swiftly disputed the newspaper ’s claims .
“ Prevent is not about spying , ” said a spokeswoman for the Home Office , the U.K. equivalent of the U.S. Homeland Security department .
“ It ’s about protecting vulnerable individuals who could be at the risk of radicalization . ”
According to the government , the overall strategy marries muscular police and intelligence services with an attempt to cut off extremism at the source , funding community programs to tackle the alienation felt by many young Muslims .
Muslim community workers — and a report out in October from London ’s Institute of Race Relations ( IRR ) — worry that Prevent suffers from mission - creep , with lines blurring between collecting information on potential violent extremists and on the Muslim community more generally .
“ It ’s not that the police have someone under surveillance , then they ask a youth worker to supplement their information , ” said Arun Kundnuni , author of the IRR report .
“ This is about the mapping of the Muslim community .
“ They ’re asking things about all of the young Muslims : what mosques they go to , what street corners they ’re hanging out on , what their views are on foreign policy issues . ”
Kundnani cited the case of a community worker in Northern England working on a Prevent - funded project designed to bring together Muslim and non-Muslim youth .
The local police force had asked him to pass on the names , mobile phone numbers , and political and religious opinions of the young people he worked with .
“ They were asking him to pass on information like , ‘ What do the young people think of what ’s going on in Gaza at the moment ? ” said Kundnani .
Some Muslim leaders of community organizations said they felt that Prevent money came freighted with pressure to gather information on the community .
“ Absolute nonsense , ” said the Home Office spokeswoman .
“ Funding for Prevent Projects is never , ever conditional on information sharing . ”
Prevent ’s major problem , charged its critics , is its funding structure , which yokes anti-extremist work to broader Muslim community development projects , such as mental health programs and youth services .
“ They ’re talking about security , and they ’re talking about community cohesion , and they are tackling [ broader community issues ] from the point of view that the Muslim community are all potential terrorists , ” said Humera Khan , founder of the British Muslim women ’s group An - Nisa .
Linking Prevent money and social service programs stigmatized the entire community , argued a February report from the group : “ With all the parallels between the Irish community and the Muslim community , even during the height of the IRA terror campaign in the 1970s the whole Irish community in the U.K. did not get targeted in this way . ”
Rather than building community relations , Prevent has the potential to erode them , said its critics .
With so much money directed at Islamic extremism , it sows bitterness among other communities , who watch Muslim programs get millions in funding .
At the same time , Muslims themselves feel targeted , since Prevent only targets Islamic extremism , not , say , right - wing groups , or Catholic militants in Northern Ireland .
Embedding anti-terrorist works in local community projects merely has the potential to divide communities , said An - Nisa ’s Khan : “ Security ca n’t be dealt with at a local level , ” she said .
“ It ’s one thing to deal with it at a national level .
But once the government starts giving money to local authorities and community groups , it changes the whole nature of it . ”
( AP ) -- Starting in mid-2010 , new versions of gadgets like cameras , cell phones and computers will be able to talk to each other using Wi -Fi without needing to connect to a wireless network first .
The Wi-Fi Alliance , an industry group , said Wednesday it is nearly finished putting together a Wi -Fi Direct specification , a set of technical " rules " that guide consumer electronics companies that plan to add the new capability .
Kelly Davis - Felner , the Wi-Fi Alliance 's marketing director , said Wi -Fi Direct will make it easier to liberate the mounting gigabytes of digital family photos that are trapped in cameras , smart phones or PCs .
Now those gadgets will be able to connect directly to digital photo frames , TVs or printers .
In creating the specification , the Alliance is moving into the territory of Bluetooth , a competing wireless technology that already handles direct gadget - to - gadget connections .
Bluetooth uses less power but has much shorter range and a lower transfer speed .
To tackle the latter problem , the industry group behind Bluetooth announced last year that it would co-opt Wi-Fi technology to make it possible to send videos and other bandwidth - hogging files around the house , much as Wi-Fi Direct promises to do .
Only one of the gadgets need have the new Wi -Fi Direct technology to make a two - way connection work .
In one scenario , you could connect a smart phone with Wi-Fi Direct to a laptop and piggyback on its wired Internet connection for a quick e-mail check without tapping your phone 's data plan .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Small business owners are still whittling away at their payroll , but the deluge of pink slips on Main Street is slowing down .
Businesses with fewer than 50 employees cut another 75,000 workers in October , according to estimates released Wednesday from payroll processor ADP .
October 's job losses marked the smallest number of job cuts in a single month since July 2008 .
But do n't expect hiring any time soon .
" Losses are likely to continue for at least a few more months , but at a diminishing rate , " Joel Prakken , chairman of ADP ( ADP , Fortune 500 ) research partner Macroeconomic Advisers , said in a written report .
A telephone survey of 830 small business owners conducted by management consulting firm George S. May International from Oct. 28-30 found that 74 % of the owners polled do not plan to increase their staff headcount in the next 90 days .
" The term ' help wanted ' has become obsolete , " Paul Rauseo , managing director of the George S. May International Company , said in a statement accompanying the survey 's release .
" Small business owners feel they do not have the need for more employees and , in fact , see sizable portions of their staff as an unnecessary expense . "
Small companies have been hit especially hard by a recession double whammy : Consumers and businesses have pared back their spending , while banks have tightened their lending standards .
After three years of growth , sales at small companies -- those with annual revenue of less than $ 10 million -- have declined by nearly 4 % this year , according to a recent analysis by Sageworks , which tracks financial data at privately held companies .
That 's leaving business owners with little choice but to cut back .
President Obama acknowledged the problem in a speech last week about his administration 's economic recovery initiatives .
" We know how tough times have been for small businesses , " he said .
" Maybe you 've had to forgo raises .
Maybe you 've had to do the unthinkable and lay off friends or family . "
Doing more with less
Nearly two years of recession have left businesses stripped to the bone .
ADP estimates that 2.6 million jobs at small companies have disappeared since early 2008 .
" They are trying to function with the minimal number of employees , " said Elizabeth Klimback , executive director of the North Texas Small Business Development Center , which counsels local entrepreneurs in Dallas .
" You have fewer people doing more work , and it puts a strain on the small business . "
That challenge is forcing owners to come up with new approaches to filling the gaps .
For Jennifer Hason , owner of Beach Lake Bread in Honesdale , Pa. , free labor from participants in a job training program has helped her bakery keep payroll costs down .
Beach Lake traditionally sold to convenience stores , coffee shops and high - end restaurants .
But last fall , sales started plunging .
" We saw drastic pullbacks , " Hason said .
" The coffee shops , instead of taking our muffins , started baking their own muffins . "
Hason revamped her business model to include prepared foods like soups and bread spreads .
That helped her company increase sales to its remaining clients , but it also increased the bakery 's workload .
Hason knew she could n't keep up without extra hands in the kitchen : " That was when we started taking on Job Corps kids . "
Job Corps is a federally funded program for students age 16 to 24 years old that teaches life and vocational skills .
Participants work in area businesses , picking up trade skills and training on how to hold down a job .
The target population for Hason 's local Job Corps center is inner city youth from New York City , especially Brooklyn and the Bronx .
One of Hason 's first Job Corps students stepped in to help with the new prepared food production .
" She trained up in that under her schooling , so that when we finally hired her , she was fully functional and was able to run that division , " Hason said .
Job Corps students work on location for six weeks unpaid , but if there is the possibility of a full - time job coming out of the training , they can stay on longer .
Hason took on her first two students in May , who worked in the bakery from 9 am to 3:30 pm each day .
Both developed into excellent workers , and Hason has hired them on as full - time employees , taking her staff up to 14 employees .
" They are getting ready to send me a new crop of hands for training , " Hason said .
" It is my absolute dream .
I get to teach and I get to have assistance -- essentially financial assistance -- from this program .
It is unbelievable . "
Klimback , of the Dallas small business development center , said she 's hearing more stories of business owners finding innovative ways to adapt to their staff shrinkage .
After a fairly grim year , she 's sensing a changing attitude among the business owners her center serves .
" The optimism is there , " she said .

South Korea and Japan have agreed an aid proposal for North Korea Leaders of China , South Korea and Japan have urged an early resumption of talks on North Korea 's nuclear programme .
During talks in Beijing , the three leaders said they were committed to a denuclearised Korean peninsula .
Tokyo and Seoul have been pushing a policy of withholding aid packages until after the North has dismantled its nuclear weapons programme .
But correspondents say that winning the support of China - a key ally of Pyongyang - may not be easy .
North Korea has already indicated that it may return to multi-party talks on the nuclear issue but has also said it wants direct negotiations with the US first .
In a joint statement issued after their morning summit in Beijing , the leaders said : " We will remain committed to dialogue and consultation and continue to work through peaceful means to pursue the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula .
" We will make joint efforts with other parties for an early resumption of the six - party talks , so as to safeguard peace and stability in north - east Asia . "
The six - party talks involve the two Koreas , China , the US , Russia and Japan .
The leaders in Beijing also said that they would work closely together to make the upcoming global climate change talks in Denmark a success .
Improved ties Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , who recently visited North Korea , said the country appeared to be open to discussions and it was time to " seize the opportunity " to make progress .
" North Korea does not only hope to improve relations with the United States , it also hopes to do so with South Korea and Japan , " he said .
Wen Jiabao was to brief the other leaders on his talks with Kim Jong - il " This is the deepest impression I got from my visit , " he said .
On Monday , North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was reported to have told Mr Wen he was " willing to attend multilateral talks , including the six - party talks " .
But Mr Kim said doing so was dependent on North Korea first holding bilateral talks with the US , a request Washington has not confirmed it will grant .
The US has said it is willing to engage directly with North Korea , but only as part of a return to the six - party forum .
Washington wants the North 's complete denuclearisation .
Mr Wen said he supported the idea of direct US - North Korea talks .
But South Korea 's President Lee Myung - bak said that while he also welcomed the idea , the " final purpose of any talks between South and North Korea should be denuclearisation of North Korea " .
Conditions
On Friday , Mr Lee and Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said sanctions against North Korea should remain in place until it began dismantling its nuclear programme .
But Mr Lee told reporters the countries had agreed on the " need for a fundamental and comprehensive solution " to the nuclear issue .
The two leaders agreed to offer North Korea a one - off package of aid in exchange for denuclearisation , instead of the step - by - step measures that have been followed since the talks began in 2003 .
As North Korea 's biggest trading partner , China holds the greatest sway over the secretive Pyongyang regime .
The BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing says South Korea and Japan might find it tough to win China 's public support for their latest proposals as Beijing sees North Korea as a close ally .
But there was a sense of optimism following Saturday 's meeting , which was a rare chance for the three regional powers to show unity , our correspondent says .
Pyongyang pulled out of the six party talks in April this year and tensions in the region rose after it launched a series of missiles and conducted an underground nuclear test - drawing UN sanctions in response .
The country had previously said it would never re-engage with the multilateral talks .

Enlarge By Dean Hoffmeyer , AP Virginia Rovnyak stands in protest outside Greenville Correctional Center in Jarratt , Va. , just before the scheduled time of D.C. sniper John Muhammad 's execution .
JARRATT , Va.  John Muhammad was executed Tuesday , seven years after carrying out sniper attacks that terrorized the nation 's capital for weeks and left 10 people dead .
Muhammad , 48 , died in five minutes at 9:11 p.m. from a lethal injection at the Greensville Correctional Center .
He said nothing as relatives of his victims looked on behind mirrored glass .
One of those in attendance was Milton Perry , a co-worker of bus driver Conrad Johnson , 35 , who was shot in the chest at a bus stop in Maryland .
" I 'm here because Conrad was the real deal , " he said .
BACKGROUND : Pending execution reopens victims ' wounds A Gulf War veteran and Muslim convert , Muhammad never revealed why he stalked and shot people getting gas or shopping at stores .
His accomplice , Lee Malvo , 24 , said Muhammad hoped to extort $ 10 million from the government to set up a camp where children would be trained as terrorists .
The death penalty was ruled out for Malvo , who was 17 at the time of the murders and committed some of them , after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2005 that juvenile offenders cannot be executed .
For three weeks in October 2002 , Muhammad and Malvo created panic in Washington and its suburbs .
Many fretted that the shootings were an al - Qaeda plot , coming as they did so close to the one - year anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
People avoided going outside and avoided self - serve gas stations .
Police got a break when they found Malvo 's fingerprint at one of the shooting scenes and learned he was with Muhammad , and that Muhammad owned a blue Chevrolet Caprice .
A truck driver spotted the car Oct. 22 at a highway rest stop in Maryland and police arrested the sleeping killers inside .
The car had been modified so someone could shoot from inside the trunk .
Muhammad and Malvo were convicted of six Maryland murders , for which they received life terms .
In Virginia , a jury in 2003 sentenced Muhammad to death for the murder of Dean Harold Meyers , 53 , killed while pumping gas at a Sunoco station in Manassas .
Defense lawyers argued that Muhammad was not mentally competent to stand trial .
Courts disagreed .
Muhammad , divorced with five children , spent his final hours meeting with members of his family .
He ate a last meal of chicken with red sauce .
His lawyer , Jon Sheldon , said that in the hours before his death Muhammad remained " obsessed in his belief that the government was conspiring against him because of his race . "

It looks like David Gregory is reading C&L and many other blogs because I 've been saying that for the cost of the wars , America would have health care bought and paid for .
David Gregory finally asked a Republican the same question .
This clip also shows that republicans are living in a land far , far from reality if they actually go on TV and say Americans are n't dying because they have no health care .
David writes : Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) told NBC's David Gregory that the war in Afghanistan is a " necessity " but health care reform is not as important .
" And is it a necessity to tackle the fact that there are more and more Americans who die because they do n't have access to health insurance ? " asked Gregory .
Kyl disagreed with the premise of the question .
" I 'm not sure that it 's a fact that more and more people die because they do n't have health insurance .
But because they do n't have health insurance , the care is not delivered in the best and most efficient way , " said Kyl .
Talking Points Memo notes that it is indeed a fact that Americans die from a lack of health insurance .
I imagine Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) -- of " Republicans want you to die quickly " fame -- might have a field day with this one .
And for the record , a highly - publicized Harvard study released last month said that 45,000 deaths are linked to lack of health insurance coverage each year -- and that uninsured , working - age Americans have a 40 percent higher death risk than their privately - insured counterparts .
It would have been nice if Gregory followed up and asked Kyl to back up why he thinks Americans are n't dying over health care .
That 's what he does week after week .
Show quotes and news reports to back up his questions , but to just let Kyl ignore the premise of the question is ridiculous .
Gregory knows thousands are dying every month .
It 's not a secret or some super duper liberal code word .
And the country should n't be spending blood and treasure on the two Bush wars like it is and the country knows it too .
But I do n't want to focus on Gregory too much because at least he asked the question .
Sen .
Kyl is either a stone cold liar or really is that ignorant .

Rapists will continue to walk free from British courts in the future , the peer leading a government review of sex crime admitted this weekend .
Lady Stern said last week that while some progress has been made on the issue , radical measures are needed , in prevention , policing and prosecution .
Free late - night transport for women would go a long way to reducing attacks ; as would education for boys , teaching them the importance of sexual consent .
As the Government prepares this week to launch its strategy for the next 10 years to tackle violence against women and girls , Baroness Stern , a cross - bench peer , said some cases would always be beyond the power of the courts .
The problem is " you have to prove beyond reasonable doubt something which happens in private between two people .
A ceiling may exist beyond which a system cannot adjudicate , " she said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The review was announced earlier this year amid concern about how the police , local authorities , health providers and the Crown Prosecution Service respond , individually and together , to rape complaints .
Britain currently has the lowest rape conviction rate in Europe .
Some women 's groups estimate that only 15 per cent of rapes are reported to the police ; 80 per cent of those that are reported do not make it to court .
Just 6.5 per cent of reported rapes end in a conviction .
While Lady Stern , who is a senior research fellow at the International Centre for Prison Studies at King 's College London , acknowledged some cases could not be prosecuted successfully , she said changes in police and prosecution practice could improve conviction rates .
Her review is intended to encourage more women to report attacks , as well as to improve the performance of public bodies dealing with rape .
It will also consider the role of victim support organisations , such as sexual assault referral centres and rape crisis centres .
The number of rape crisis centres fell from 68 in 1984 to 38 in 2009 due to lack of funding .
Many of the 44 police forces in England and Wales have been criticised for their handling of rape cases in the past .
The peer has spent the past few weeks visiting police forces in cities such as Newport , Manchester and Blackpool , focusing on examples of good practice , rather than investigating forces with bad track records .

Rhode Island Hospital Fined for Fifth Surgery Error in Two Years Rhode Island Hospital botched procedures on everything from fingers to brains .
Nov. 4 , 2009  --
Few people could argue with the notion that hospital operations performed on the wrong body part are events that should never happen , but at one hospital , these so - called wrong - site operations have taken place five times since 2007 .
Rhode Island Hospital , based in Providence , has been fined $ 150,000 by the Rhode Island Department of Health after a surgeon operated on the wrong finger of a patient last month .
Among the ramifications , the hospital will have to install video cameras in all of its operating rooms and all surgeries will have to be watched by a clinical professional , not on the surgical team , trained in surgical safety measures .
Rhode Island Hospital previously drew scrutiny in 2007 , after three separate brain surgeries were done in the wrong locations .
While the hospital said it would make reforms at the time , some see the errors that have happened since then as a sign that the hospital has not followed through .
Earlier this year , a surgeon operated on the wrong side of the mouth of a patient with a cleft palate .
" We have been looking into this for quite a while , " said Dr. Sidney Wolfe , president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen .
" This is now deemed inexcusable , it 's a ' never to happen ' occurrence in a hospital .
When it repeatedly happens in a hospital , it means a system is n't in place in the hospital to keep it from happening . "
Lifespan Corp. , which owns Rhode Island Hospital , sent ABC News a statement , but declined to comment for the story .
" At Rhode Island Hospital , we remain more committed than ever to working on methods to reduce the incidence of all medical errors from reaching patients , " said hospital president and chief executive officer Dr. Timothy Babineau in the statement .
" Patient safety has always been , and remains , our number one priority . "
An analysis of patient safety from HealthGrades , which ranks hospital quality , showed Rhode Island Hospital performed average in its overall patient safety .
Will Fixes Improve Safety ?
The installation of video cameras is among the more unconventional measures being taken by the state , but questions remain about how effective they will be .
Dr. Glenn Rothman , chair of surgery for Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa , Ariz. , said cameras will likely do little to stop errors like the one in this case .
" I 'm not aware of any data that show that works , " he said .
" Would cameras in the cockpits of planes reduce pilot error ? "
Nancy Foster , vice president of quality and patient safety policy for the American Hospital Association , had a similar sentiment , saying cameras could be helpful , but would not prevent surgeries in the wrong places .
" They are not used to prevent the error that is occurring at that moment , " she said of cameras , comparing them instead to black boxes on airplanes .
" It may not be able to prevent a crash but it is a valuable tool to prevent a similar problem from occurring [ in the future ] . "
Never Say Never ?
Foster was reluctant to say that " never to happen " occurrences like surgery in the wrong place could really be made to never happen .
" That was a catchy phrase .
I 'm not sure [ the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ] really thought we had the knowledge and the tools to ensure these events never happen , " she said .
" I hate to say never .
I think they can be made so rare as to be virtually eliminated .
I do n't think we have all the knowledge and the tools right now to make that happen . "
Wolfe blames the culture of the hospital for not taking these errors seriously enough and not doing enough to stop the wrong - site incidents , since he said no one person could be blamed for these errors , given the number of people involved .
" The hospital has failed repeatedly to succeed in stopping this , " he said .
" Most hospitals in the country , in the course of a few years , do n't have any , or at most , one wrong - site surgery .
It 'll get fixed , but I would have said that when I saw the story two years ago . "

The Americas have seen the sharpest rise in swine flu deaths
The number of swine flu deaths reported worldwide has jumped by more than 700 in a week , latest World Health Organization figures reveal .
More than 5,700 swine flu deaths were reported by 25 October , compared to nearly 5,000 the week before .
The biggest rise was in the Americas where 4,175 deaths have been reported , up 636 from the week before .
Meanwhile , Ukraine has shut all schools and banned public meetings for three weeks after its first swine flu death .
Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the measures were to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus .
Mrs Tymoshenko said there would also be restrictions on what she called non-urgent travel between different parts of Ukraine .
Cases ' unreported '
The latest WHO figures showed there had been 440,000 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus worldwide .
But the organisation said that as many countries have stopped counting individual cases , the actual number is likely to be significantly higher .
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes says the WHO has warned for months that as winter sets in , the northern hemisphere can expect swine flu cases to rise .
Now that appears to be happening .
The virus emerged in Mexico in April and was declared a global flu pandemic on 11 June .
" In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere , influenza transmission continues to intensify , marking an unusually early start to winter influenza season in some countries , " said the WHO 's latest update .
Statistics showed fatal cases in Europe climbed to at least 281 , while those in Asia - Pacific rose to 1,070 .
In a separate statement , the WHO said that experts meeting this week had concluded that a single dose of swine flu vaccine was sufficient to immunise adults and children over 10 .
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ( Sage ) said that countries that had made vaccinating children a priority could administer them a single dose to ensure that as many as possible are immunised quickly .
It said that while more data on children between six months and 10 years was needed " the priority should be to give them at least one dose of vaccine now , and to cover as many of them as possible " .

While in Rome for the U.N. World Food Summit last week , Libyan leader Muammar al Gaddafi engaged in an unusual form of dawah : inviting 500 Italian escorts to convert to Islam .
The women , employed by Hostessweb agency , were under the impression they were attending a party .
The agency advertised for “ …500 attractive girls between 18 and 35 years old , at least 1.70 meters ( 5 foot , 7 inches ) tall , well - dressed but not in mini-skirts or low cut dresses . ”
Those who replied were offered € 60 euros ( $ 90 ) to attend an evening at the Libyan ambassador ’s villa for an “ exchange of opinions ” and to “ receive a Libyan gift ” , which turned out to be a copy of the Qur’an , Gaddafi ’s own Green Book on the Libyan revolution , and a pamphlet entitled How to be a Muslim .
The women were lectured for about two hours on varying Islamic topics , including the role of women in Islam , sexism in the west , and Islam ’s belief about Jesus ’ crucifixion .
The second meeting was less formal , and the new batch of women were allowed to ask him questions .
Gaddafi has held similar lectures before and sees himself as a self - proclaimed savior of European women .
Whatever his intentions , it is important to note that his recent effort was a result of individual inclination , not supported by The Arab League or any sort of Muslim council .
So aside form being a typically wacky Gaddafi publicity stunt , was there any benefit in the meetings ?
What did Gaddafi say ?
And what did he wear ?
Well , according to this Times Online article ( which runs a photo of him clad in a sleek beret , female bodyguards in the shadows ) , his message was coherent and consistent with the teachings of Islam , if not a little uplifting .
After claiming he was “ for and alongside women , ” Gaddafi said it was untrue that Islam is against women and then criticized the way they were treated in eastern countries , likening them to pieces of furniture :
“ Women have often been used as pieces of furniture , changed whenever it pleases men .
And this is an injustice . ”
He pointed out that whereas there were four different Gospels , there was only one Quran .
And since this is Gaddafi , he was n’t shy about bluntly stating his objective :
“ Convert to Islam . …
Whoever goes in a different direction than Mohammed is wrong .
God ’s religion is Islam , and whoever follows a different one , in the end , will lose . ”
Why an Arab leader feels the need to preach about Islam is bizarre in itself .
But consider his audience : for a report of what happened next we have to thank an ingenious Paola Lo Mele , a reporter from the Ansa news agency who snuck into the Sunday event by posing as a hostess .
She said the women , “ expecting a party with gala dinner , ” gathered at a hotel in Rome , where those “ inappropriately attired or not tall enough were weeded out . ”
If one ’s intention is to convert women to religion , which in essence focuses on modesty and not outward appearance , why does it matter what they look like ?
Or more specifically , since inappropriately attired probably means too much skin ( in this context ) , why care about the height ?
That Gaddafi invited these women , specifically chosen for their youth and beauty , speaks volumes about his impressions of Western women .
Why not preach to housewives , mid-age professionals , or men ?
He specifically chose beautiful young women , whose job it is to mingle and provide hospitality at social events , to make a statement .
A rather disheartening one at that , because it implies Islam is mostly against women who dress up , but is only for women whose outward appearance fits within societal beauty norms .
It once again puts the problem on women by focusing on the way they look .
No way , a Monday update .
I ’m indebted to John Barth for this one .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
In the past few days , the White House has made it clear that the president wants specific exit strategies for all his Afghan war options .
That brought to mind the advice almost a century ago of an American geopolitician describing the only exit strategy worth considering :
Over there , over there
Send the word , send the word ,
Over there
That the Yanks are coming ,
The Yanks are coming ,
The drums rum tumming every
where
So prepare ,
Say a prayer
Send the word ,
Send the word to beware
We ’ll be over , we ’re coming over .
And we wo n’t be back till it ’s
over over there !
The geopolitician in question , of course , was that great Irish - American , Tin Pan Alley ’s own George M. Cohan .
And by quoting his lyrics to World War I ’s most popular song , I do n’t mean to be frivolous .
But millions of young men were prepared to risk their lives - to not come back “ till it ’s over over there ” - because they were called to fight for something our nation considered vital .
Those farm boys did n’t know about foreign policy , but they trusted their parents and their leaders not to send them off for no good reason .
Hearing the president ’s request for exit strategies at the beginning of what would be “ his ” Afghan war - and thinking of our young troops , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 years old who have volunteered to risk their lives for America - how on God ’s good Earth can we ask those wonderful kids to risk dying for an exit strategy ?
I have heard from a few of them , and they are game to make a fight of it if their country believes it ’s necessary .
Of course they will obey all their orders and commands .
But what a cold and heartless command : to send our generation ’s “ Yanks ” off to risk their young lives just to prepare to retreat ( i.e. exit ) .
The administration is making its intentions quite clear .
Over the weekend , top Obama administration officials went on television to “ lower the bar for success ” in Afghanistan , stressing that the administration is seeking an exit strategy and holds “ no illusions ” ( Fox News ) .
“ We have no illusions .
This is not the prior days when people would come on your show and talk about how we were going to help the Afghans build a modern democracy and build a more functioning state and do all of these wonderful things , ” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
On another Sunday show , the president ’s top political adviser , David Axelrod , explained that “ obviously we cannot make an open - ended commitment .
And we want to do this in a way that maximizes our efforts against al Qaeda , but within the framework of bringing our troops home at some point . ”
We have to watch our pennies , too .
As the Saturday New York Times reported : “ While President Obama ’s decision about sending more troops to Afghanistan is primarily a military one , it also has substantial budget implications that are adding pressure to limit the commitment , senior administration officials say . ”
Even the great Cohan could not write a song that would give life and passion and hope to such flatulent , cynical comments .
Three months ago in this space , I wrote : “ President Obama is on the cusp of a fateful policy decision .
He has argued consistently that the war in Afghanistan is necessary to deny al Qaeda a base of terrorist operations and to stop the Taliban insurrection from destabilizing nuclear Pakistan . … [ But ] even the optimists now believe that a successful counterinsurgency in Afghanistan ( and needed as much in Pakistan ) will require several years of sustained commitment , with substantially more men and materiel . …
To have a reasonable chance at success , Mr. Obama will have to sustain the effort for years , which will require him to be at least as determined and stubborn on behalf of this war as former President George W. Bush was in fighting the Iraq war . ”
Now , three agonizing , rationalizing , equivocating , twisting , turning months of White House squirming later - even a blind man could see that this president , and this White House staff , do not have the stomach to continue the war in Afghanistan .
They are trying to avoid it .
They do n’t want to fight it .
They think they have great things to do here at home .
They know they do n’t have anything they want to do in Afghanistan .
If the Taliban and al Qaeda retake Afghanistan , the world ( and America ) will have hell to pay for the consequences .
But this president and this White House do not have it in them to lead our troops to victory in Afghanistan .
So they should n’t try .
The price will be high for whatever foreign policy failures we will endure in the next three years .
Let ’s not add to that price the pointless murder of our finest young troops in a war their leader does not believe in .
Bring them home .
We ’ll need them later .

People occasionally ask me vague questions about how to optimise their programs .
Generally , that 's because their programs do n't have challenging performance demands , and they 've wisely postponed thinking about it .
Continue not thinking about it and skip this series of posts .
Firstly , I am specifically talking about optimisation as in making something working go faster , and as most code does n't get to the stage where it works , is generally irrelevant .
Like scaling to large workloads , it is largely of theoretical interest to your typical engineer , and a great deal of nonsense is written about it by engineers who have never really needed to do it and are therefore free to confirm whatever bias they started with .
Here is a general attempt to provide a concrete guide to optimisation , giving examples from tpd2 : a program in Lisp that is comparable in speed to the best equivalent programs in more machine - orientated languages .
One way of looking at it , is that optimisation is about avoiding doing unnecessary things , and doing the necessary things faster .
Quite often , it actually makes a program simpler and clearer to understand .
A better engineer than me will write a program that is both simpler and faster than mine .
These two aims are generally achieved together .
Secondly , there is a saying made famous by Knuth that premature optimisation is the root of all evil .
Inexperienced engineers tend to worry greatly about performance in irrelevant places , and their idea of what is inefficient is often utterly misguided .
Think rationally about whether the effort is well spent , and take measurements to determine whether your theories are correct .
Modern compilers and hardware architectures are very sophisticated .
Do n't make complicating optimisations without measuring their benefit even if you vaguely know what you are doing .
This is especially important , given that Lisp environments are complex and often introduce unexpected inefficiencies , and do not have compilers on a par with GCC .
The other danger is that your planned design has no hope of meeting its performance requirements , and a few minutes considering it could save you a rewrite later .
If you actually have a performance challenge , then consider it from the outset .
How will the data flow through your program ?
A few realistic back - of - the - envelope calculations can save an expensive rewrite , and give you an idea of what is important .
Thirdly , despite the inauspicious start , this series of posts is not about vague generalisations .
It is about SBCL , which is the highest performance Common Lisp implementation today , and how best to use the tools it provides .
Continued .
UPDATE 20100109 —
There are no inefficient languages !

Los tatuajes no se borran .
Por eso hay tipos que se tatúan el nombre de la amada como prueba de su amor infinito .
El alcalde de Los Ángeles fue más allá .
Nieto de uno de los millones de mexicanos que cruzaron el río Grande buscando fortuna , se enamoró perdidamente de una mujer y decidió incorporar su apellido al suyo .
Antonio Villa pasó a ser Antonio Villaraigosa .
Para siempre .
Para mucho después de que aquel amor muriera .
Ayer , Villaraigosa volvió a la tierra de sus abuelos .
Para inaugurar , como orgulloso primer alcalde mexicano de Los Ángeles , la Feria Internacional del Libro de Guadalajara ( FIL ) .
Tal vez la única feria donde la literatura se vive , de forma colectiva , con la pasión de un tatuaje en la piel .
Aquí se prefiere una metáfora de Rafael Cadenas a una finta de Cristiano Ronaldo
Villaraigosa es un alcalde con carisma .
Uno de esos políticos raros que no echan balones fuera .
Invitado a dar la conferencia inaugural de la FIL - dedicada este año a la ciudad de Los Ángeles - , abordó sin complejos todas las cuestiones que separan , más que unen , a su país con el de sus abuelos .
Ante la mirada del escritor mexicano Carlos Fuentes , Antonio Villaraigosa cargó contra los políticos norteamericanos que ven en sus vecinos del sur una amenaza más que una oportunidad .
No deja de ser curioso ver a un alcalde - el de la segunda ciudad más poblada de Estados Unidos - llamando a la rebelión : " No podemos permitir que doce millones de hombres y mujeres sigan bajo las sombras .
No podemos aceptar un no como respuesta a una reforma migratoria razonable " .
¿ Que qué tiene que ver esto con una feria del libro ?
Todo .
Al menos con la Feria Internacional del Libro de Guadalajara .
Porque la FIL es una feria distinta a todas las demás .
Aquí los libros se disfrutan como en ningún sitio .
Aquí , desde el primer minuto del primer día , el público llena todos los espacios y busca con verdadera pasión los últimos títulos , el encuentro fugaz con su autor preferido , ojalá una firma con dedicatoria .
Aquí , por increíble que parezca , los escritores son vitoreados como futbolistas .
Aquí , y no es exageración , se prefiere una metáfora de Rafael Cadenas a una finta de Cristiano Ronaldo .
Aquí todo , hasta el alcalde que se tatuó el amor en su apellido , se mira desde el tamiz esperanzador -y protector - de la literatura .
Todo .
Hasta la difícil coyuntura que atraviesa México .
Sin ir más lejos , la novela que Carlos Fuentes presentó ayer , Adán en Edén , también convierte en literatura el presente que asfixia : " Me pasan informes de armas recuperadas en México .
Un rifle en Acapulco después de un asalto a las oficinas del procurador con saldo de tres secretarias muertas .
Dos rifles recuperados en carreteras federales (... ) .
Saco las cuentas .
Cinco armas recuperadas por las autoridades en México .
Cinco .
Miles de armas importadas por los carteles de la droga .
Miles .
Mansiones con puertas de metal , banderines de colores , ventanas tapiadas , pistoleros en las azoteas , jardineros armados " .
Desde ayer y hasta el domingo próximo , por los pasillos de la FIL los mexicanos se pueden encontrar al premio Nobel Orhan Pamuk , o a Carlos Fuentes , o a Mario Vargas Llosa , o a José Emilio Pacheco , o a Carlos Monsiváis , o a Élmer Mendoza , o a Rosa Montero presentando su novela Instrucciones para salvar el mundo , una novela que es una historia de supervivencia : " Un cuento tragicómico sobre esta vida angustiosa que tiene esa apariencia de Apocalipsis .
Ojalá mi libro sea como esas bolsas que te dan en urgencias cuando vas con un ataque de angustia para que respires dentro " .
La FIL , que hoy entregará el primer Premio Internacional de Ensayo Isabel Polanco a Rafael Rojas por su obra Las repúblicas de aire , escuchó ayer las palabras de Rafael Cadenas .
Con su voz cansada , el viejo poeta habló del devenir de la literatura desde la frontera de la nostalgia .
Su discurso bien se podría haber titulado como aquel maravilloso libro del también poeta José Manuel Caballero Bonald Tiempo de guerras perdidas .
Porque en algún momento , como si estuviera leyendo el último parte llegado desde el frente , se escuchó al poeta decir : " Pierde terreno la metáfora " .
A Pub and a Theatre ?
Opened in 2008 , The Browncoat Pub and Theatre is a quirky hybrid .
While we are first and foremost a theatrical venue , we are also a geeky bar .
Not only do we produce multiple plays a year , but we have nightly karaoke , the Camp - B Movie film club , screenings of shows such as Doctor Who , The Walking Dead , Game of Thrones , and a variety of other forms of entertainment .
We showcase magicians , mentalists , comedians , and art shows .
We ’re also proud to host and partner with the Cape Fear Film Festival .
The Browncoat Pub and Theatre is a place where people can meet and share ideas , pursue artistic endeavors , enjoy quality entertainment , and not feel constrained by the “ traditional ” bar atmosphere .

As something of a follow - up to the last post on the never - ending “ war on Christmas , ” I just wanted to highlight this press release :
Over 200,000 shoppers are wearing buttons this Christmas season that proclaim a straightforward message to retailers : “ It ’s OK , Wish Me A Merry Christmas ( tm ) . ”
Individuals and churches around the country are partnering with the Wish Me A Merry Christmas Campaign mobilizing advocates energized for a return to the traditional , convivial greeting , bearing buttons that make a clear statement – “ It’s OK , Wish Me A Merry Christmas ( tm ) ( www.wmamc.com)”.
Over 200,000 of these buttons have been distributed nationally .
As we ’ve noted before , this whole victimization ploy has been exceedingly profitable for right - wing groups and it looks like it still is : the buttons mentioned above are priced at $ 25 for 10 , meaning that if the producers have sold 200,000 , they have banked somewhere in the ballpark of $ 500,000 .
We 're # 1 !
Not Good Enough !
The Best Bike Commute City Should Be Even Better
Photo by Sarah Mirk
FIRST THE GOOD NEWS : Portland is kicking every other American city 's ass at bike commuting .
US Census Bureau data released last week shows that Portlanders bike to work much more frequently than any other major city in the country and are less likely to drive alone than in the last decade .
But despite being the first major city to be ranked platinum by the League of American Bicyclists , Portland has spent relatively little on bike infrastructure in recent years .
The census data shows that 6.4 percent of Portlanders say biking is their primary mode of transportation to work , up from just 2.1 percent 10 years ago .
Of the 30 largest cities in the country , Minneapolis trailed in second place with 4.5 percent and Seattle ranked fourth with 3 percent regular bike commuters .
At the same time , over the past decade , the number of Portlanders driving alone to work has dropped 4 percent and public transit ridership is up slightly .
The city has invested only 1 percent of its entire transportation budget , about $ 2.7 million total , toward building bikeways over the last seven years .
Additionally , the number of bike lanes built in the city has almost flat - lined during that period .
From 1995 to 2000 , the city launched into bike improvements with gusto , doubling the number of Portland bikeway miles from 114 miles to 222 miles .
But from 2001 to 2008 , the city has added only 38 miles while the biking population has more than doubled .
Meanwhile , Seattle is catching up .
In 2009 , our big sister city only had 130 miles of bikeways — however , David Hiller of Seattle bike advocacy group Cascade Bicycle Club explains that since the city passed a street levy in 2006 , the transportation department has poured between $ 6 - 9 million a year ( that 's 3 - 4 percent of its budget ) into bikes .
" Our small investment in bicycling infrastructure and education are paying off in a big way , " Mayor Sam Adams wrote in his press release applauding the census numbers .
But in actuality , it seems more accurate to say that the small infrastructure investments of city officials 10 years ago are starting to pay off today .
According to Northwest environmental group Sightline Institute , half of recreational bikers nationwide say they would bike to work if better lanes existed .
Portland 's bike - to - work numbers would likely be far higher if the city had continued its decade - old bike - lane building boom at the same rate .
" Should we be spending more on bikes ?
The answer is yes , " says Adams ' transportation director Catherine Ciarlo , adding that Adams has done good work on bike funding .
This year Adams created the city 's first bikes - only transportation fund , which will direct $ 500,000 into bike projects annually .
While the number of new bike lanes has lagged , Adams was right on in mentioning education .
Since 2005 , the City of Portland has introduced Safer Routes to School , a biking class now taught to almost every Portland elementary school , and SmartTrips , which delivers bike and pedestrian maps to Portlanders ' doorsteps .
Recent advocacy is paying off , too .
The Bicycle Transportation Alliance 's 14th annual Bike Commute Challenge boasted 10,553 active members this past month .

A 17 - year - old Boy Scout worked more than 200 hours to clear a path in his local park so that people could enjoy walking and biking along the river .
Bad move Boy Scout .
Now grown men who did n’t get around to doing it for a paycheck are after you .
Kevin Anderson , a junior at Southern Lehigh High School , a varsity soccer player and a Boy Scout hoping to get his Eagle Scout badge , spent 250 hours over several weeks creating a path on the partially complete 165 - mile Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor that runs through Kimmets Lock Park in Allentown , reports The Morning Call .
" I decided to do my part in completing this part of the trail .
In that way , others could enjoy walking along the river , without having to walk on the busy road , " Anderson said in an e-mail , says The Morning Call .
But once the city ’s municipal union caught wind of this do - gooder breath of fresh air , it put up a stink at Tuesday ’s city council meeting .
Nick Balzano , president of the local Service Employees International Unions said its considering filing a grievance against the city for allowing such good , free - of - charge , work to happen .
" We 'll be looking into the Cub Scout or Boy Scout who did the trails , " Balzano told the council , reports The Morning Call .
Anderson ’s act of carving out a 1,000 - foot path is not seen as good community service by the union because it was the only group to suffer layoffs in the city ’s current financial downturn .
" We would hope that the well - intentioned efforts of an Eagle Scout candidate would not be challenged by the union , " said Mayor Ed Pawlowski in an e-mail Friday .
" This young man is performing a great service to the community .
His efforts should be recognized as such . "
All aboard the polar express : Steam locomotive takes home passengers stranded by snow - delayed modern trains
Passengers stranded when modern - day trains fell victim to the freezing weather have been rescued by the crew of a steam engine .
About 100 passengers climbed aboard the first mainline steam locomotive to be built in Britain for almost half a century at London Victoria when electric trains were delayed .
The 1940s technology used to power Tornado , a £ 3 million Peppercorn class A1 Pacific , was able to withstand the snow and ice that brought much of the South East to a standstill on Monday night .
Historic solution : The Tornado A1 locomotive came to the aid of stranded passengers let down by modern trains in freezing conditions
The locomotive 's ' Cathedrals Express ' service was offering festive trips in the region when staff on board heard about the stranded passengers .
The travellers were offered free seats and were dropped off at stations as it chuffed through Kent , said Mark Allatt , chairman of the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust , the charity which built Tornado .
Mr Allatt said they were pleased to be able to help some of London 's stranded commuters ' get home in style ' and joked that rail operators could learn lessons from them .
' It 's amusing because this engine is predominantly made up of 1940s ' technology and we were able to keep running despite modern trains not being able to , ' he said .
' If any of the rail operators would like to use this technology for themselves , we would be more than happy to build them an engine . '
Built partly by volunteers with donations collected over 19 years , the apple - green locomotive can reach a top speed of 100 mph and is designed for long - distance express journeys .
In 1990 , a band of enthusiasts came together to work on their ambition to construct a brand new Peppercorn A1 Pacific , and achieved their aim when that locomotive , No 60163 Tornado , moved under its own steam last year .
The A1 60163 Tornado is the 50th Peppercorn class A1 locomotive , all of which were designed to cope with the heaviest passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line .
The A1s were among the last steam engines to be withdrawn from service from British Rail in the late 1960s in favour of the more reliable diesel .
The locomotive was officially named Tornado by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall earlier this year and has since entered regular service on excursion trains on the Network Rail main line .
Officers responsible for Parliamentary security stayed calm this week , despite the unexpected arrival - on the 404th anniversary of an infamous plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament - of several dozen masked men and women dressed as Guy Fawkes .
Meanwhile , a distinct lack of instant response from the Met to what most passers - by might consider to be a demonstration , suggests that the bad press that they have received over the past few years from enforcing draconian rules on demonstrating in the vicinity of parliament has led them to conclude that discretion might be the better part of policing public order .
On Thursday afternoon , about three dozen individuals , kitted out as Guy Fawkes and wearing V for Vendetta masks , took a " stroll " down Whitehall .
As a token of their good intentions , they left a rose at the entrance to 10 Downing St , although police officers there refused to take it in – possibly on the grounds that it might conceal a deadly airborne nerve agent .
They then stopped off at the Westminster Arms , before making their way en masse towards the principal public entrance to Parliament – St Stephen ’s Gate .
They were definitely not led by an individual best known to the world as blogger aulde Holborne .
He explained that he was merely " out for a walk " , and suggested that he could in no way be held responsible if a number of his friends just happened to turn up wearing almost identical outfits ( and masks ) .
You can never find a copper when you need one .

On arrival at parliament , a police officer promptly informed the group that they could n’t " go in dressed like that , sir " – a reference not to the garb , so much as the masks .

Well lookee here !
An invite from my limey comrades to recap Barack Obama 's first year in office .
Well comrades , I can do this thing two ways .
I can simply state that the great mocha hope turned out to be a Trojan horse for Wall Street and the Pentagon .
Or I can lay in an all - night stock of tequila , limes and reefer and puke up the entire miserable tale like some 5,000 word tequila purged Congolese stomach worm .
I have chosen to do the latter .
As you may know , Obama 's public approval ratings are taking a beating .
Millions of his former cult members have awakened with a splitting hangover to find their pockets turned inside out and eviction notices on the doors of their 4,000 square foot subprime mortgaged cardboard fuck boxes .
Many who voted for Obama out of disgust for the Bush regime are now listening to the Republicans again on their car radios as they drive around looking for a suitable place to hide their vehicles from the repo man .
Do n't construe this as support for the GOP .
It 's just the standard ping ponging of disappointment and disgust that comes after the honeymoon is over with any administration .
Most Americans ' party affiliations are the same as they were when Bush was elected .
After all , Obama did not get elected on a landslide by any means ; he got 51 % of the vote .
Right now his approval ratings are in the 40th percentile and would be headed for the basement of the league were it not for the residual effect of the Kool - Aid love fest a year ago .
However , millions of American liberals remain faithful , and believe Obama will arise from the dead in the third year and ascend to glory .
You will find them at Huffington Post .
This frustrating ping pong game in which the margin of first time , disenchanted and undecided voters are batted back and forth has become the whole of American elections .
That makes both the Republican and Democratic parties very happy , since it keeps the game down to fighting the enemy they know , each other , as opposed to being forced to deal with the real issues , or worse yet , an independent or third party candidate who might have a solution or two .
Thus , the game is limited to two players between two corporate parties .
One is the Republican Party , which believes we should hand over our lives and resources directly to the local Chamber of Commerce , so the chamber can deliver them to the big corporations .
The other , the Democratic Party , believes we should hand our lives and resources to a Democratic administration -- so it alone can deliver our asses to the big dogs who own the country .
In the big picture it 's always about who gets to deliver the money to the Wall Street hyena pack .
Americans may be starting to get the big picture about politics , money and corporate power .
But I doubt it .
Given that most still believe the war on terrorism is real , and that terrorists always just happen to be found near gas and oil deposits , there is plenty of room left to blow more smoke up their asses .
Especially considering how we are conditioned to go into blind fits of patriotism at the sight of the flag , an eagle , or the mention of " our heroes , " even if the heroes happen to be killing and maiming Muslim babies at the moment .
Patriotism is a cataract that blinds us to all national discrepancies .
Much of the rest of the world seems plagued with similar cataracts that keep it from noticing the chasm of discrepancy between what Obama says and what he actually does .
The Nobel Committee awarded the 2009 Peace Prize to the very person who dropped the most bombs and killed the most poor people on the planet during that year .
The same guy who started a new war in Pakistan , beefed up the ongoing war in Afghanistan , and continues to threaten Iran with attack unless Iran cops to phony US - Israeli charges of secret nuclear weapons facilities .
It 's weapons of mass destruction all over again .
Somewhere in the whole fracas has been forgotten that Iran has been calling for a nuclear free zone in the Middle East since 1974 .
Iran has also been consistent in its position that " petroleum is a noble material , much too valuable to burn for electricity , " and that nuclear energy makes much more sense , given that our food supply , whether we like it or not , is fundamentally dependent upon petrochemicals and will remain so until the earth 's population is reduced to at least half of what it is now .
The Iranian attitude has been to use the shrinking petroleum deposits as judiciously as possible .
To which oilman George Bush replied that " There will be consequences for Iran 's attitude . "
Obama has reinforced Bush 's sentiment , stating that not only will there be consequences , but that a military strike on Iran " is not out of the question . "
Although nuclear weapons are in direct opposition to the Muslim faith , 71 million Iranians must have shuddered and paused to think : " Maybe an Iranian bomb is n't such a bad idea after all . "
Under cover of being the first " black " president , Obama is looking to best one of the Bush administration 's records .
And that is causing unshirted hell for anybody two shades darker than a paper bag , particularly if they are wearing sandals ( Obama himself being only one shade darker than the bag and given to size eleven black Cole Haans ) .
So far , two million Pakistanis have been , in official US State Department jargon , " displaced " by U.S. backed bombing and gunfire -- which will surely displace a fellow if anything will .
A significant portion of them are " living with host families . "
Translation : packed into crowded houses ten to a room , wiping out food and water supplies , crashing already fragile sanitation infrastructure , and serving as a giant human Petrie dish for intestinal and respiratory diseases .
Many more are still living in the " conflict area . "
Makes it sound like living next door to a neighborhood domestic squabble , does n't it ?
God only knows how many more innocent people will yet be killed in the conflict area of Obama 's " war of necessity . "
You know , the " good war . "
The war that is supposed to offset the interminable bad one in Iraq , where we continue to occupy and build more bases .
Afghanistan : Grab the opium and run
Then there are Obama 's noble efforts to fight terrorism by beefing up troop " deployment " in Afghanistan .
Deployment may be construed to mean an American style armed gangbang , in which everybody piles on some wretched flea bitten hamlets for all they are worth , with periodic breaks for pizza and video games .
Now if you look at the deployment of US forces in Afghanistan , compared to NATO country forces there , you 'll find them in a nice even line along what could easily be mistaken for an oil pipeline route .
One that taps into the natural gas deposits in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and , by the purest coincidence , just happens to bypass nearby Russia and Iran .
But we all know that " It 's about fighting terrorism over there so we wo n't have to fight it here ! "
That still plays in Peoria , so we 're sticking with it .
At the moment , out - of - pocket cost of America 's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is $ 900 billion .
Interest on the debt incurred , plus the waste of productive resources on the war , pushes the cost to three thousand billion dollars ( Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz ) .
By comparison , the entire 2009 government budget for elementary and secondary education is slightly above $ 800 billion .
Or to look at it another way , how far would three thousand billion dollars go toward establishing energy independence ?
As Harvard monetary expert Linda Bilmes points out that there is " no benefit whatsoever for any American whose income does not derive from the military / security complex . "
I sent an email to Obama pointing this out , suggesting that we pull out of Afghanistan , grab the opium and run .
I got a nice reply saying that my president is grateful for the input .
So there ya go .
Lately there has been a ruckus about our little " slap shop " in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Despite Obama 's promises to close down , " Cigarland , " it is still open for business .
Word has it that Cigarland may be moved to an " underused " maximum security prison ( one would think a scarcity of criminals for a maximum security prison would be good news , but what do I know ? ) in the desperately broke community of Thompson , Illinois .
Locals there tell the national press , " Sure , put it in our backyard .
No problem . "
Or , " This town is in the prison business .
Prisons R Us . "
Or more bluntly , " We know how to handle these creeps and we need the jobs . "
It 's the kind of job creation Stalin would have understood .
Happiness is a warm tent
But at least the recession is over .
This , according to Obama 's monetary point man , Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank .
For British readers unfamiliar with the US system , the Federal Reserve is not a government agency , despite its agency like name .
" The Fed " is an offshore private banking cartel that decides just how much bogus currency can be printed and circulated profitably for bankers without wrecking their Ponzi schemes .
And the chairman of that august body has announced that the recession is over .
Well halleluja !
We can quit rolling our own cigs and buy ready mades , and run recklessly through the Dollar Store scooping up dented canned goods and cheap Chinese tube socks .
That makes us luckier than the three and a half million Americans , most of whom led normal lives a few of years ago , who are now homeless .
That includes one million school children sleeping in tents , shelters and other makeshift arrangements , and trying to look presentable each morning at schools that have not even the mercy to let them use the school showers .
By the administration 's own calculation , the number of homeless and people out of work will continue to escalate at least into the next year .
Home foreclosures , and therefore homelessness , " has not topped out yet , " says Obama .
But Bernanke has announced that the recession is over .
So there you have it .
A grateful nation breathes a sigh of relief .
And besides , he is right about it being over .
The recession is over for the most important members of a capitalist society , the oligarchs and banksters , who have made fortunes off this recession , thanks to our unique economic system , and may now return to their standard garden variety usury .
Economic systems are merely belief systems .
I did n't say that .
Keynes said that .
For instance , if the early Assyrians believed a shekel was worth a jar of wheat , then it was worth a jar of wheat .
American style capitalism eventually stretched belief to the absolute limits of fantasy to the snapping point , as regards general credulity .
Nobody abroad still believes the dollar is worth folding up and sticking in a wallet , certainly not worth exchanging for a good old fashioned shekel .
However , be it shekels or dollars or euros , there is no economic system at all if there is no production .
And there is no production if there are no jobs .
Hence the obsession with unemployment rates .
The U.S. Ministry of Truth has announced that our unemployment rate is at 10 % .
I 've yet to meet an American who does not know the official unemployment rate is a complete fiction .
One half of the unemployed -- the half that has been unemployed for more than one year -- are simply erased from the official count .
Poof !
The real rate is somewhere around 20 % .
But if we acknowledged that , we'd have to admit to being on par with Europe 's unemployment rate .
And by diddle damned we can never do that .
Every American fully understands that the purpose of life is to hang onto one meaningless job or another , two of them if possible .
And by the state 's official numbers more Americans have a white knuckled grip on the life 's purpose than any of those pussy socialist European nations with their free healthcare , low infant mortality rates and ridiculously long vacations .
But the bad news , which the Obama administration openly acknowledges , is this : Unemployment will in all likelihood go higher .
And nobody on earth knows how to reduce it ( although no one in the administration is about to acknowledge that ) .
The factories are all but gone and they are not coming back .
Not unless American workers are willing to work 13 hours a day for two Chinese yuan an hour , which is about 31 cents .
What US factories remain are laying workers off due to high interest rates , and waiting for a lower interest rate policy before deciding if it is feasible to call any workers back into production .
During their wait they can watch hell freeze over .
Banks know a fatter hog when they see it .
And that hog is the consumer credit business ( nobody has figured out yet that consumers need paychecks before they can consume anything , on credit or otherwise ) .
To that end the Federal Reserve has logically set a low interest rate policy .
And in true accordance with banking logic , the banks took the Fed 's money , then raised the annual percentage rate ( APR ) on credit card purchases and cash advances and on balances that have a penalty rate because of late payment .
Next they raised the late fee .
What the hell ?
If Americans are on the ropes , struggling to make their payments on time , then the logical thing to do is to stick it to them .
Bleed 'em for all they 're worth .
It 's an American free market tradition .
We the people do not complain .
We expect no mercy .
America is a business and the American concept of business is pure ruthlessness .
A Deutsche Bank analyst tells me a near term worst is yet to come .
Bank failures and home foreclosures have not peaked .
A commercial real estate bust is coming down the pike .
He says that , while there will be some minor periodic upswings , the fraudulent value of the dollar is now evident as it falls against every other currency , even the Russian ruble ( 13 % ) , except those unlucky enough to be pegged to the US dollar .
As former Assistant Secretary of Treasury Paul Craig Roberts says : " What sort of recovery is it when the safest investment an American can make is to bet against the US dollar ? "
My Deutsche Bank friend , who is younger and has a family to think about , has taken what he considers more appropriate action .
He 's buying gold and moving to an undeveloped Central American country .
But Mr. Bernanke assures us that the worst is indeed over .
Despite the outside world 's serious doubts , but Bernanke 's announcement just might fly in the U.S.
We believe whatever our Ministry of Truth tells us .
We believed that debt was wealth , did n't we ?
And we believed in WMDs , and have come to believe warfare is a prerequisite to peace .
The saddest thing is that Americans are cultivated like mushrooms from birth to death , kept in the dark and fed horseshit .
Consequently , they have n't the slightest idea that there is an alternative to the system in which they labor at the pleasure of corporate and financial elites who own both their government and their every waking hour .
That alternative is democratic Socialism .
Self governance for the broadest common good .
Which the Ministry of Truth has defined for them as fascism .
Healthcare and environment ?
Ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha
I would guess that you have heard about the " debate " over " healthcare reform in America . "
There really was n't much debate , just a lot of thuggish behavior and wild tales of geriatric death panels by the right , and groveling capitulation on the left .
The " reform " turned out to be a $ 70 billion a year giveaway to the insurance companies , by forcing those 45 million folks who cannot afford insurance at all to buy it anyway .
Taxpayer dollars will make up the difference between what can be wrung out of the working poor , and what insurance corporations can demand and get because they have a throat lock on both of the other parties involved -- the doctors and the patients .
As for the doctors , they have played it so cool butter would n't melt in theor mouths , and successfully avoided the question of whether their quarter million dollar and up incomes just might be contributing to the exorbitant cost of healthcare .
Even with a majority in Congress , the best Obama and the Democratic Party 's corporate lapdogs could come up with was total handover to the insurance industry .
If this smells a bit suspicious , it is the sweat of cold fear you are smelling .
The insurance companies have always made it clear they have billions to spend in defeating and destroying any elected official not on their side .
As for environmental legislation , under the Obama administration environmentalism is pretty much reduced to " cap and trade . "
In the truest spirit of capitalism , corporations will be able to sell their pollution for a profit , instead of ending it .
And even this legislation barely made it through the House of Representatives .
Moreover , environmental legislation has had the snot knocked out of it by the economic crash , and opinion polls now show the American public believes the price is too dear .
It should be interesting to see what price their children will be willing to pay for oxygen and water .
Goldstone who ?
Just when you think your country has reached the limits of raw shame and the outer banks of rogue internationalism occupied by Korea 's Kim Jong - Il and Sudan 's Omar al - Bashir , it surprises you with some new and worse outrage .
America 's latest is right up there with holocaust denial in sheer unmitigated abrasive gall -- putting the kibosh on the UN's Goldstone Report .
The report documents Israeli war crimes in the Gaza Ghetto , where 1.5 million Palestinians have been held miserable hostages by Israel .
Admittedly , leadership both in Gaza and Israel is nothing short of a pack of criminals .
But the Israeli attack on civilians and civilian infrastructure such as hospitals and schools , using illegal munitions such as skin melting white phosphorus , was a war crime by every definition .
The UN and the world agree that it meets and exceeds the Nuremberg standard that the US established in order to execute Nazis .
But as any American will tell you , the United States has never considered itself part of the rest of the world or in any way obliged to join .
So the rest of the world was not surprised when the US House of Representatives voted 344 to 36 to condemn the Goldstone Report .
The Obama administration has promised Zionist groups that it will never let the report get to the criminal court .
The perps are safe .
Zionists everywhere threw their hats in the air and cheered .
The AIPAC boys at the back of the room nodded in approval :
" Now tell us Congressmen , who 's yer daddy ? "
I might add at this point that I am not one of those conspiracy freaks who see Zionist plots behind everything .
The Zionists are but one of many backstage operators with a death grip on some aspect of U.S. policy .
Frankly , of all the greaseballs and thugs muscling US domestic and international policy , I fear the Wall Street and the bankers far more than I fear any Zionist ( except maybe that spooky shapeshifting motherfucker , Rahm Emanuel . Brrrr ! ) .
In any case , most Americans have never heard of the attack on Gaza or the Goldstone Report .
They were prevented from hearing the outside world 's news coverage of the grisly two week long specter .
Residing in a free Central American country at the time , I was fortunate ( or unfortunate ) enough to hear the daily dispatches from inside Gaza , despite Israeli efforts to suppress them .
About the only place the Zionist misinformation machinery really worked was in the United States , where it successfully repressed media coverage of Israeli atrocities and genocide .
Not that it required great effort .
American politicians and media long ago learned , as a client state of Zion , to look the other way .
Or if that is not possible , to support one of the prepackaged lies conveniently provided the U.S. media by the Likudnik media management apparatus .
" And besides , were n't the Palestinians the fuckers who danced in the streets after 9/11 ?
Screw 'em !
We now return to Cable News coverage of last night 's America 's Got Talent winners , the ZOOperstars ! "
The man with the plan
The same day the assault on Gaza began , January 4 , 2009 , president elect Obama announced he would create or save three or four million jobs during his first two years in office .
Ninety percent of them were to be in the private sector , of which about 400,000 would be in building roads , bridges , schools and broadband lines .
Another 400,000 were predicted in solar panels , wind turbines , fuel - efficient cars ; and one million in healthcare and education .
The key term here was " jobs saved . "
Any job not lost apparently goes in the jobs created column .
I 'm rather math impaired , but it seems to me that with real unemployment at about twenty percent and rising , and job losses predicted by the administration to continue for at least another year , it 's hard to see how the claim can be made .
I suppose that as long as three million jobs remain in the US economy , Obama can claim to have saved them .
I 'd be the first to admit it 's all over my head , and a damned good example of why I am not suited for public office .
Then too , I never did understand Bill Clinton 's surplus either .
Political math is done in some fourth dimension anti-space where terrestrial rules do not apply .
One thing I do know is that for every dollar a worker would earn under Obama 's plan , a capitalist corporation employing the worker would earn almost two dollars .
That Mexican guy balling sod along the new highway 's median strip for the contractor may be making eight bucks an hour he would n't have otherwise earned .
But he is making his employer about $ 15.50 on the same hour .
As a younger man in Colorado I balled sod , hired the Mexicans and passed out the paychecks , so I know .
First rule about capitalist math is :
The capitalist owner gets to do the math .
So Obama 's plan lines more corporate pockets than those of the working man .
This being America however , Obama was charged by conservatives with having an anti-capitalist socialist agenda .
These businessmen conservatives are more than happy to take the money .
But the rule of thumb in America is " Show No Gratitude !
Bite the living hell out of any hand that feeds you , on the chance that it may give up more .
Maybe even drop everything it is holding so you can grab it up and run while a crowd gathers to stone the alleged socialist . "
But the truth is that Obama 's jobs would have done nothing to help the economy " recover " anyway .
There is no economy left to recover .
It moved to China and India .
Things such as road projects do not generate capital .
Under capitalism roads are worthless unless they make money , and they can do no economic good if there is nothing being manufactured to haul on them .
Likewise education that does not contribute the gross national product ( otherwise known as corporate interests ) by producing higher wages to exponentially pump up American consumer fetishism is considered worthless .
And let 's face it , higher education has become , for the most part , another racket .
The student is saddled with massive loan debt ( again , there is the odor of hyena banker spoor in the air ) on the promise of eventual higher wages .
Or at least that the graduate will work in a nice warm dry video store and never have to ball sod .
Unfortunately , the number of jobs that require " college educated " Americans -- quite an oxymoron , given the caliber of U.S. colleges these days -- is shrinking right along with the Empire .
All those jobs middle managing the Republic , such as helping us cheat on our taxes , brainwashing the school kids , and devising sales strategies for beer , grow scarcer by the day .
Even book editing and reading medical scans are being outsourced to Asia .
There 's a nasty rumor that American medical scans are being read in India by trained Buddhist temple monkeys to save rupees .
The US healthcare industry has been mum on the subject .
Obama 's recovery plan depends on going deeper in hock to the Chinese .
For Christ sake , are n't there any of our tax dollars lying around anyplace other than in Wall Street vaults ?
Apparently not .
So the Treasury Department keeps cranking out more funny money to make payments on the pawn ticket for the Empire .
Rather like those doddering old Englishmen one meets on estates in rural Kent sporting " The Queen 's Own " military ties , we still prefer to think of ourselves as an Empire .
But the Chinese are looking askance , questioning the wisdom of pouring more money down a rat hole , based upon the US Treasury 's allegation that the other end of the rat hole comes out somewhere in China and not on Wall Street .
Chinese talk shows publicly question American loans , when upcoming powerhouses such as Brazil are so ripe for investment .
You can bet that if it's on television in China , the public is being issued an official state sanctioned opinion they may feel free hold as their own .
The big heist
In the end the campaign rattle and prattle about Obama 's recovery plan turned out to be moot anyway .
Wall Street moved in and heavied up on the whole damned country , in one of the ballsiest heists in American history .
It was a stroke of pure genius as theft goes .
Following a meeting of the Five Families , Citicorp , Bank of America , Morgan Chase , Wachovia , Taunus Corp. , the financial cartels said , " The rip - off is in .
We got it all .
Now if you do n't hand over all the people 's savings and assets so we can loan it back to them , the whole flaming ball of shit you call the services and information economy is gonna come down on everybody 's asses like a giant meteor .
So you can load three trillion bucks for now into the armored cars lined up out front and nobody will get hurt .
Or you can watch the national economy shrivel up until the schmucks out there in the cul de sacs and cardboard condos can't even put together cab fare for their ride to the poor house .
It 's your call Barack . "
There are still a few delusional souls out there who believe Obama is trying to do his honest best to fulfill campaign promises , but just cannot get past the pack of vampire financial corporations and cold blooded Republican lizards .
Which is true in a sense .
He can not get past the Wall Street pack because he is running in the middle of it .
Obama 's nefarious relationship with Wall Street 's power players has been ongoing for years .
It is no accident that Wall Street got to select the members of the president 's financial cabinet .
My mutton eating friends , it 's a sad and sordid tale , one I have neither the space nor the stomach to cover here .
Especially since better journalists such as Matt Taibbi and others have written extensively about it in detail .
Last I heard , the banks never un -assed the dough .
Never let it circulate in the people 's hands or even through business loans .
Instead , they declared a profit , divvied it up in bonuses , and congratulated themselves .
Indeed , this was the sort of sheer brilliance we have come to expect from the Yale / Harvard MBA crowd .
Getting rich by going broke .
Then getting even richer by sticking up the US government and the entire American public , and eventually the entire world , leaving 1.5 quadrillion dollar cloud of toxic derivatives girding the world , to hoover up more money for them before imploding like a dark star .
And indeed , the derivatives are even astronomical in nature .
They represent $ 180,000 in debt load for every man woman and child on earth ( although I cannot understand why , if the money is n't real , why we should consider the debt real ) .
It is impossible to produce our way out of this calamity .
There are n't even enough resources left on earth to sustain that scale of production .
For now the financial mobsters have retired to Tuscan villas to savor their haul .
The poor schmucks out there in the US heartland are left to devise new ways of hiding the family ride from the repo man .
Never once , though , do they doubt capitalism .
They figure it is all just a big financial accident .
Fate .
And that will somehow " work our way out of it , " like we always have .
These things happen in a dynamic free market economy .
A new mob moves in
To backtrack , that was when the smell of long green flying out of the public -- the insurance industry .
Insurance racketeers moved in with their own muscle to fill the void left by the Wall Street gang .
The insurance syndicate dispatched its made men and soldiers throughout the halls of Congress , and , voila !
They were able to pass the aforementioned $ 70 billion a year political blackmail job off as " reform legislation . "
Say what you want to about my country , but pillage and looting have never been so elegantly ritualized , institutionalized and executed .
Realistic people on the left have long known that the last act of American strong - arm capitalism would be a massive gunpoint redistribution of wealth from the public to the owning class through the private financial sector -- which the owning class happens to own .
But few would have expected it to be executed under a Democratic majority in both the House and the Senate .
Or under a Democratic administration honchoed by the first black president .
One liberal blogger wondered aloud , " Imagine what the Republicans would have done had John McCain been elected ? "
The same thing , brother .
The same thing .
Only with a different cover story .
Both parties exist at the pleasure of the same crime syndicates .
How to join the rackets
As I remember , it was a Mexican diplomat who once told me that graft , theft and bribery are socialized in his and other Latin American countries -- democratically distributed throughout much of society .
But in America , he said , this sort of criminal activity is legislatively institutionalized .
Only the elites are allowed to practice usury , theft , insurance blackmail and other forms of non-violent looting ( violent looting being reserved for oil bearing Middle Eastern countries ) .
The first step in building one of these rackets is become a legally recognized interest group , in order to access the key Congressional players you wish to bribe or strong - arm into acquiescence or complicity .
The banking mob , the insurance mob , and other criminally organized legislative muscle men , cartels and commodity syndicates , are all officially sanctioned as " interest groups " operating alongside hundreds of others in that whorehouse by the Potomac River .
To list just a few , there are environmental interest groups such as the Sierra Club , which exists so its officers can draw fat salaries and meet movie star environmentalists .
There is an interested group for education , which exists to assure the mediocrity of our public schools .
Munitions manufacturers are an interest group .
Gambling casinos and tobacco corporations are interest groups .
There is an interest group to force feed us corn sugar , in order to sustain Midwestern Republican farmers and ensure the future of the ever expanding weight loss and diabetes industries .
There are even lobby groups to protect the interests of syndicates in other countries , such as Israel .
There is an interest group for everything except we ordinary American pudwhackers .
The folks who just want to raise families in peace , and maybe have modest financial security in old age .
And there are thousands of interest groups whose purpose is to make damned sure we never get either one .
We ain't mean , just thrifty
Yesterday I watched a CNN host ask two experts : " Is stepping up the war in Afghanistan really the best use of our tax dollars ? "
The killing , maiming and displacement of untold thousands is discussed in terms of the best use of capital .
A dehumanized and monetized capitalist society sees everything in dollars and cents and return on investment .
Even infant mortality is rated that way , though seldom does anyone admit it .
Saving a black ghetto baby has a low return on investment , according to some human services analysts , as regards their lifetime contribution to the gross national product .
I actually heard an expert on a television panel show say this .
Yet Americans sitting in front of their TV sets do not find this one bit odd .
Or even mean spirited , much less an indication of a cruel society .
No American thinks of himself or herself as cruel , or connected in any way with the world 's largest human and environmental killing machine .
No American doubts his inalienable right to drive around or run air conditioning or drink wine from grapes grown in Chile at the expense of a national war on the environment and those of the world 's people who have been born amid energy resources .
If there are things such as cruelty and injustice , we the people are n't the ones doing it .
We the voters and taxpayers are not the CIA snatching people off to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to be raped with broken bottles and boiled alive to extract those " terrorist confessions " that keep the war on terror alive .
We simply finance such operations .
And accountability ?
Well , on the very slight chance that someday the world will hold America accountable ( which will never happen so long as we possess more armaments that the rest of the world combined and are quite clearly willing to use them toward our own ends ) we the people can express our shock and disgust as citizens .
We good people would never , never , never have approved of all those awful acts .
And besides , there is not much the ordinary person can do about such things anyway .
Right ?
Maybe not .
But it was Americans who so loudly proclaimed that complicity through silence is no defense , when we rubbed the German people 's noses in the grisly filth of the concentration camps and hung their national leadership .
The revenge of Smirking George
We have n't heard much from George W. Bush since he packed up his comics and moved to Dallas .
But his policies remain like dog piss stains to stink up the Obama White House .
Rendition and assassinations continue , as does warrantless spying on the citizenry , along with other civil liberties violations in the name of the " war on terror . "
1 -- No quail hunter is Georgia will ever be safe as long as Cheney 's pacemaker still functions ;
2 -- The precedents set by the most criminal administration in US history remain .
Until they are confronted and rectified , America will not to have the opportunity to heal and recover .
Honestly speaking though , the patient has been dead since the 2000 election fraud went unchallenged .
Obama 's election was the best chance America had to hold the Bush Republicans accountable for their crimes .
Now it 's gone .
Opportunities to exercise moral principles as a nation and a people are rare to begin with , and fast vanishing .
At some point they will be extinguished by the exigencies of human species survival .
It does n't take a prophet to know this .
Anyone paying attention to planetary population , resource depletion and the eco-collapse understands it in the gut .
The mounting worldwide competition for human survival will not allow for much high mindedness .
So we should exercise principle and administration of justice while principle and justice are still possible .
There are endless rationalizations proffered as to why Obama has not come within a mile of fulfilling the promise and potential of his presidency , and the Democratic Party is writing more of them every day .
Disappointed Democratic voters grab at them , and desperately defend each one on internet forums and in letters to the editor .
But we must use our own personal capabilities as free rational human beings to assess Obama , and decide why he is failing .
Or not failing .
To hell with highly crafted official explanations about " wars of necessity " and trillion dollar blackmail payments .
George W. Bush left office wearing the same smirk he came in with .
Perhaps it 's congenital .
But if Bush was smirking when he left office , he must now be convulsed in crazed hysterical laughter .
His gang not only got away clean , but Obama carries on the dark Bush - Cheney legacy .
And , almost as if to top the whole black escapade with a cherry of irony , the most inarticulate president in American history is now on the motivational speaking circuit at $ 200,000 a pop .
Never let it be said that the Devil does not care for his own .
Will Americans ever rise up in defense of their own common well being through such things as education , health and a productive peace caring society ?
Nope .
Because it has been seen to that socialism -- the administration of the nation solely for the common good and benefit of all the people without preference or privilege -- does n't stand a chance in America .
For over a century those who have attempted to further socialism have been shot , hanged , burned alive in their beds on Christmas Eve , imprisoned , falsely accused of crimes and falsely convicted , and demonized by the capitalist elites of the corporate state .
The cause of socialism has effectively been wiped out in the US .
Few Americans can even define the word .
Most think it is a political system when it is a social philosophy .
Hell , half the socialists these days think it is entirely a political system .
But even if Americans understood socialism , they are too terrified to ever admit to its virtues , much less publicly support the cause .
And without free and open public participation in some democratic form of socialism , regardless of the name or label given it , there can be no recognition of the people 's common welfare and good .
And so the most egalitarian social philosophy ever conceived dies within a nation , with very little chance of being reborn because such an ideal , by its definition , cannot exist within the narrow mindset of bankers and oligarchs .
Bush smirks , Obama breakdances in and around the minefield of his false promises , and Wall Street CEO bonuses are higher than ever .
Like I said , the Devil does take care of his own .

Telus will start selling Apple 's iPhone Nov. 5 , at the same prices as rival Rogers , the same day its new cellphone network goes online .
The carrier will sell the iPhone 3G for $ 100 , the 16 - gigabyte iPhone 3G S for $ 200 and the 32 - gigabyte iPhone 3G S for $ 300 .
All these prices require a three - year contract .
Telus announced the launch date and pricing Monday .
The prices are the same as those of Rogers Wireless , although Telus has n't released information on monthly rates .
Bell has also announced that it will also start selling the iPhone in November , but has n't announced a date or pricing .
Rogers has had a de facto exclusive on the device since last summer , because it had the only compatible cellphone network .
Rogers had been using the GSM and HSPA standard , while Bell and Telus were on the CDMA standard .
Bell and Telus announced last year they were building a $ 1 billion next - generation network to take advantage of hot devices such as the iPhone and Google 's Android phones .
The new network will offer mobile internet speeds up to 21 megabits per second with more than 20,000 towns and cities covered , the company said .
Rogers has already begun rollout of a network that offers the same speeds .
Currently , virtually no existing phones — including the iPhone 3G S — can handle these speeds , though new ones are expected to .
This war in Iraq really makes my blood boil !

There ’s a fair amount of buzz going round at the moment about Wi -Fi Direct , the latest thing from the WiFi Alliance people .
It appears for all intents and purposes to be a version of the 802.11 Ad - hoc mode , designed to allow for connections between individual devices without the use of an AP or router , which led to bnet.com claiming it was a “ sales bomb ” that would somehow destroy Bluetooth , kill the majority of AP sales , kill all the companies who make connector cables and create a large security problem to solve as we all switch over to using WiFi Direct to hook up our various gadgets .
And they ’re not alone in suggesting this is a bluetooth killer .
Baloney .
Utter rot .
Nothing of the kind is going to happen , and it ’s pretty obvious why .
Taking one worry at a time :
1. Bluetooth is n’t going to be destroyed , it ’s perfectly safe .
We ’ve tested 802.11 and Bluetooth usage here on mobile phones as part of the Suura project and the difference in battery life is n’t just significant , it ’s game - changing .
Just scanning every few minutes ( and powering down in between ) with a phone ’s 802.11 connection will drain a full battery in two or three hours on some of the older phones while bluetooth will give three times that or more even in continous usage .
Bluetooth has a pretty much guaranteed role in the low - power end of the market for the foreseeable future no matter how much success WiFi Direct enjoys .
802.11a/b/g/n transceivers just draw too much power for us to see them in mobile phones replacing bluetooth modules for the next few years at least , and then only when someone invents a circuit that works at very low power over short ranges and higher power in normal mode ( which is not a trivial exercise ) .
And do n’t forget , bluetooth was decried from the get - go and survived all the knocks because it ’s good at what it ’s designed for .
2. AP sales wo n’t take a dive for a while yet for several reasons .
For marketing reasons , it ’ll be a while before we see enough takeup of WiFi Direct for customers to be able to do without APs even if they wanted to .
Plus , there are a lot of legacy devices which will still need APs to function .
There ’s also the point that there are less hassles with an AP for connecting devices .
Lets say you have three computers in your home with WiFi and an AP and you get a WiFi- enabled printer .
You set up one connection ( Printer ↔ AP ) and everyone can use the printer without having to create their own WiFi connection to it .
With WiFi Direct , you have to set up three connections ( Laptop1 ↔ Printer , Laptop2 ↔ Printer and Laptop3 ↔ Printer ) .
A technology that adds work for the user for the same end goal is probably not going to succeed in the marketplace .
And add to that the point that your connectivity to the internet is going to be a main driver for AP purchases for quite a while yet in the domestic market – regardless of how WiFi Direct works out , we will not be going over to 3G for all our data needs ( or 4G / LTE / whatever MNO network you choose ) , not for some time and possibly not ever .
It ’s just too expensive – 3G basestation prices , spectrum limits and other factors make serving a single Mbit of connectivity two orders of magnitude more expensive with 3G than with WiFi and a wired backbone .
While WiMax may make inroads here , it ’s still going to be more expensive , and wo n’t be able to compete with a traditional DSL line to the house for some time yet .
3. Connecter cables did n’t go away when bluetooth arrived and they wo n’t go away because of a just - announced , as - yet - unavailable standard .
Even when it ’s arrived and fully deployed , they wo n’t go away , and here ’s why : everything needs a cable of one sort or another .
If for no other reason than to supply power .
And no wireless connection is ever going to exceed the potential bandwidth of a wired connection , or require less power than a wired connection to run .
And it ’s hard to see how you could build a WiFi connection with less circuitry than a USB cable connection .
Cables are cheap , low - power , high - bandwidth , and very user - friendly and obvious in operation .
They ’re not going anywhere for quite a few decades yet .
Even old standards like RS - 232 - C are still in production today , long after their ports vanished from the backs of modern machines .
Saying a new standard will kill them off is like saying that bread is going to kill off water as a foodstuff …
And do n’t forget the people who were saying that the introduction of 802.11g would kill off 802.11 b in the crib .
Legacy systems are a powerful market force .
4 . What , a security problem ?
With WiFi ?
What ’s new there ?
We ’ve seen password sniffing on open WiFi nets , then WEP was cracked and then WPA and frankly , if you think there ’s no possible way to crack a WiFi connection security - wise , you ’re deluding yourself .
The trick is to make the encryption strong enough so that the cost of decrypting it exceeds the reward – economically - based security in other words .
WiFi Direct introduces no new issues here , Bluetooth and Ad- hoc WiFi and even normal WiFi all have this same problem and have longstanding tried and tested solutions to it .
Bomb ?
Hardly .
Competitor to Bluetooth ?
Not universally .
In some limited areas , yes , but until and unless extremely low - power WiFi chipsets turn up , it ’s never going to happen for battery - powered devices .
Interesting development ?
Well , sure 🙂
But not something to go around playing Chicken Little over .
Bnet.com FAIL
I think .
AS world leaders prepare to meet tomorrow in Copenhagen to address global warming , skeptics are pointing to e-mail hacked from a computer server at a British university as evidence that the conference may be much ado about nothing .
They say the e-mail messages show a conspiracy among scientists to overstate human influence on the climate  and some accuse The Times of mishandling the story .
Although The Times was among the first to report on the e-mail , in a front - page article late last month , and has continued to write about the issue almost daily in the paper or on its
Web site , readers have raised a variety of complaints :
Some say Andrew Revkin , the veteran environmental reporter who is covering what skeptics have dubbed “ Climategate , ” has a conflict of interest because he wrote or is mentioned in some of the e-mail messages that the University of East Anglia says were stolen .
Others wondered why The Times did not make the e-mail available on its Web site , and scoffed at an explanation by Revkin in a blog post that they contain “ private information and statements that were never intended for the public eye . ”
What about the Pentagon Papers ?
they asked .
Others contended that The Times was playing down a story with global implications , coming as world leaders consider a treaty to limit the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere from autos , power plants and other sources .
Luis Alvarez Jr. of Charlottesville , Va. , was outraged that a front - page article on President Obama ’s pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States had not a single mention of the e-mail , in which one scientist , for example , said he had used a “ trick ” to “ hide ” a recent decline in temperatures .
When it comes to things like image recognition , the human brain can completely outclass the most powerful computers on the market .
It 's able to dredge up images that are decades old — no bit - rot or obsolete formats in the wetware — in order to identify similarities or perform category recognition tasks .
And , even though we have a decent idea of how individual neurons work , scientists are still struggling to understand how these cells manage to store and convey information .
A study published over the weekend by Nature Neuroscience describes how researchers were able to track the maintenance of short - term , working memories in the neurons of a rat brain and , in the process , managed to read and write individual bits into a brain slice .
Working memory provides the short - term recall capacity that 's essential for many basic tasks — it's where we put a phone number while we 're remembering which pocket our cell phone is in , or hold the digits we 're carrying while summing a series of numbers .
For the most part , these memories are only held for a matter of seconds ; we have to engage completely different processes to store them for the long term .
A brain structure called the hippocampus appears to be essential for the handling of both short - and long - term memories ( as well as moving memories from short - to long - term storage ) .
Previous work had indicated that there are populations of neurons in the hippocampus that , given a brief stimulus , would remain active for a matter of seconds ; this activity was associated with working memory .
Unfortunately , attempts to isolate these cells and observe the same sort of behavior under controlled conditions in culture have n't worked out .
A just - published paper relies on an experimental system that 's somewhere in between the two : slices of the rat brain that contain the dentate gyrus , a structure within the hippocampus .
The neurons can survive for a while when the slices are placed in culture , and the connections among most of them should be maintained .
That means that researchers can explore brain activities that more closely approximate normal ones , but under better - controlled and more accessible conditions .
With the brain slices in place , the authors were quickly able to replicate the patterns observed in living animals , and identify the precise cells responsible .
Using an electrode to activate a cell called a semilunar granule neuron would trigger a response in entire populations of neurons called hilar cells , which could still be detected over 10 seconds after the end of the stimulation ( the half life of the activity occurred at about eight seconds ) .
Those are the sorts of time scales typically associated with working memory .
A lot of the paper is spent identifying the precise combination of cells and receptors to get this extended burst of activity — glutamate signaling through NMDA receptors seems to be essential , as does calcium .
But the really interesting results , at least from the non-neurobiologist perspective , come from recordings of entire networks of the hilar cells .
By triggering different combinations of input cells and seeing which cells responded with long - term activity , the authors were able to identify stable input / output combinations .
In other words , they could identify ( with an accuracy of about 90 percent ) which stimulus was given based on the pattern of long - term activity it generated , even out to about 10 seconds after the input .
The authors do n't make a big deal out of it in the paper , but this is the rough equivalent of writing a bit to the brain , and reading it back out 10 seconds later .
This is n't exactly a breakthrough in biological computing .
As the student who performed much of the work , Phillip Larimer , put it , " It took us four years to be able to reproducibly store two bits of information for 10 seconds . "
Still , the cellular behavior he 's helped identify matches up nicely with the actual experience of using working memory that we 're all familiar with .
And , by diving into the mechanisms in detail , the paper may provide some insight into the general question of how cells encode information .

Women do a larger part of agricultural work in developing countries Women in developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change , a report from the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) has warned .
The agency said there was a disproportionate burden on those women and called for greater equality .
They do most of the agricultural work , and are therefore affected by weather - related natural disasters impacting on food , energy and water , it said .
Slower population growth would help cut greenhouse gas emissions , it added .
The report suggested family planning , reproductive healthcare and " gender relations " could influence how the world adapts to rising seas , worsening storms and severe droughts .
" [ There ] are fundamental questions about how climate change will affect women , men , boys and girls differently around the world , and indeed within nations , and how individual behaviour can undermine or contribute to the global effort to cool our warming world , " UNFPA executive director Thoraya Ahmed Obaid said .
' Cycle of deprivation '
She called for any treaty that might come from the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen next month to take into account individuals ' power to " reverse the warming of the Earth 's atmosphere " .
Temperatures are predicted to rise by 4C to 6C by 2100 , with a " likely catastrophic effect " on the environment , habitats , economies and people , the report said .
Migration could be affected , as rising sea levels and droughts prompt people to leave uninhabitable lands , and poor people could lose their livelihoods .
But women , particularly in poor countries , will be affected differently from men , the UNFPA added .
Describing " a cycle of deprivation " , the report said that women in developing countries did a larger share of farming and had less access to income - earning opportunities .
They also managed households and cared for families , which limited their chances of moving around and increased " their vulnerability to sudden weather - related natural disasters " .
' Centuries ' to tackle
When drought strikes , the women had to " work harder to secure food , water and energy for their homes " .
" Given women 's significant engagement in food production in developing countries , the close connection between gender , farming and climate change deserves far more analysis than it currently receives , " the UNFPA said .
Societies which will be more resilient to climate change are those with education , healthcare and legal protection for all , and where people have more say in their own lives , it added .
It warned it was a long - term goal - taking " decades , even centuries " - to keep the atmosphere suitable for human habitation .

Third - party candidates rarely win elections .
So what does it say about the deep blue states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island that they now have credible independents running for governor next year ?
While politics is often messy and even contradictory , third - party candidates tend to run strong when one party becomes so dominant that it becomes comfortable pushing unpopular policies .
That seems to be happening now in the Democratic stronghold of New England .

Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Tomas Kaberle , Nashville Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne and San Jose Sharks goaltender Evgeni Nabokov have been named the NHL ' Three Stars ' for the week ending Nov. 1 .
Kaberle led the NHL in scoring last week with 12 points ( 2 goals , 10 assists ) in four road games , helping the Maple Leafs post a 1 - 0 - 3 record .
Kaberle registered a career - high five points ( one goal , four assists ) in a 6 - 3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks Oct. 26 , recorded two assists in a 4 - 3 overtime loss to the Dallas Stars Oct. 28 and earned one assist in a 3 - 2 overtime loss to the Buffalo Sabres Oct. 30 .
He closed the week by tallying a goal and three assists -- including the game - tying score at 19:06 of the third period -- in a 5 - 4 shootout loss to the Montreal Canadiens Oct. 31 .
Kaberle leads NHL defensemen in scoring with 17 points ( two goals , 15 assists ) and ranks second in the League in assists .
He has tallied 450 career points with the Maple Leafs , eight behind Hall of Famer Tim Horton for second place among defensemen on the franchise 's all - time scoring list .
Rinne posted a 3 - 0 - 0 record with a 0.76 goals - against average , .968 save percentage and one shutout as the Predators improved to 6 - 6 - 1 on the season .
Rinne began the week by stopping all 12 shots he faced in 38 minutes of relief for starter Dan Ellis as the Predators rallied for a 4 - 3 victory over the Minnesota Wild Oct. 28 .
He turned aside 22 shots to post his eighth career shutout in a 2 - 0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks Oct. 29 and finished the week with a 27 - save effort in a 4 - 2 victory over the Dallas Stars Oct. 31 .
Rinne , who celebrates his 27th birthday tomorrow , has posted a 4 - 3 - 0 record with a 2.63 goals against average , .910 save percentage and one shutout in eight games .
Nabokov posted a 3 - 0 - 0 record with a 0.97 goals - against average and .963 save percentage , helping the Sharks ( 10 - 4 - 1 ) extend their winning streak to five games and claim first place in Pacific Division .
Nabokov stopped 28 shots and five of six shootout attempts in a 2 - 1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings Oct. 28 , made 24 saves in a 3 - 1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche Oct. 30 and finished the week with a 25 - save effort in a 5 - 1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes Nov. 1 , the Sharks ' first victory in Raleigh since Oct. 24 , 2000 .
Nabokov improved to 9 - 3 - 1 with a 2.42 goals - against average and .915 save percentage in 14 appearances .
A federal judge ruled this week that South Carolina can't distribute license plates featuring an image of a cross and the phrase " I believe . "
U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie said the Christian license plates are unconstitutional because they violate the First Amendment ban on establishment of religion by government .
Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer , who pushed through legislation to create the tags , said Currie was just a liberal judge making laws instead of interpreting them .
Who 's right ?
A Christian license plate is un-American : " Government must never be allowed to express favored treatment for one faith over others , " says Americans United executive director Rev. Barry Lynn in Opposing Views .
South Carolina lawmakers used religion as a " political football " by approving the Christian license plates in clear violation of the Constitution .
Kudos to the judge for putting a stop to this " appalling misuse of government authority . "
" Court rules against South Carolina 's ' Christian ' license plates "
Believers are being censored : Separation of church and state " makes sense , " says Bill Belew in Examiner.com .
But " what about freedom of speech ? "
The people who want to buy these " I believe " license plates are being denied the same right to express themselves that other drivers enjoy when they select one of South Carolina 's 103 approved specialty tags .
" Judge bans Christian car license plate "
The ruling wo n't settle the question :
This case was a fait accompli from the beginning , says blogger Allahpundit in Hot Air .
No judge is going to allow a state to hand out Christian license plates .
But now a private group of Christians is registering its organizational name as " I Believe " and , as the state allows , " applying with the DMV to produce vanity plates with that slogan — and , er , a cross . "
What does the Constitution say about that ?
" Oh my : Federal judge finds Christian license plates unconstitutional "

Mr. Barrow , we have supported you throughout your time in the House .
Even in the cases where we did not agree with your voting record , we stood firm and said John Barrow is our guy and we will back him .
However , now our concern has grown into action .
So , please be advised , that as chair of the Candidate Recruitment Committee for the Democratic Party of Bulloch County , an active search for a Democratic challenger in upcoming elections for the 12th district is a strong possibility .
As always , you have an open invitation to meet with our membership to share your specific view points and clarify your motivations regarding this pivotal point in healthcare reform .
We hope that you will actively support moving our country forward and support President Obama , as we do .
( We have not forgotten how President Obama publicly supported
you during the last election . )
Please do not take our trust in your service for granted .
Based on the reaction of his constituents at the Chatham County Democratic Committee meeting in Savannah last night , John Barrow will not be receiving the support of many local Dems in any upcoming elections .
John Barrow was present at the meeting and actually tried to defend his vote by saying that the bill was n't " Good " or Strong Enough .
No one bought his used car salesman act .
he is gone baby gone !!!
Wednesday we published a letter that the Bulloch County Democrats sent to Rep. John Barrow , warning him not to take their support for granted .
It ended with this paragraph :
Here at commenter from Chatham County attended the Democratic Party meeting there .
She informed us that Barrow needs to look elsewhere for support : Today , a day after she filed official papers of candidacy with the FEC and ActBlue , Regina spent time with the Savannah State University Young Democrats .
Last year the Young Dems , like the Bulloch County Dems , supported Barrow .
And like the Bulloch County Dems , they 're fed up and ready to move forward .
While Regina was listening to the Young Dems at SSU and sharing her plans with them , I was on a long conference call with major progressive fundraisers from around the country .
Among other things , we talked about Regina 's candidacy .
One savvy funder pointed out something I 've been hearing all week : Barrow beat her 76 - 24 % , so how could she hope to win next year ?
It 's a good question and it needs to be answered .
Barrow has no roots in much of the district , including the entire western part of GA - 12 .
His hometown and political base , Athens , was cut out of the district entirely .
He did n't win in 2008 because people felt he 's been a helpful longtime congressmen .
He won for exactly one reason : Obama made a deal with him .
Obama needed some conservative white Democrats to wrap up Georgia 's primary votes and Barrow needed Obama 's help with the African - American majority who make up the bulk of the district 's primary voters .
So they endorsed each other .
The enthusiastic Democrats in the district her an ad from Obama over and over and over endorsing Barrow .
That was the election .
Since being elected there is no one who 's been watching who has n't noticed that Barrow 's very conservative voting record -- and his tendency to cross the aisle and vote with the GOP -- has become far worse than ever before .
A frightened Blue Dog without any convictions , Barrow 's lifetime ProgressivePunch voting score is an unimpressive 55.66 , one of the worst in the Democratic House caucus .
But since Obama took office , Barrow 's voting score has sunk dramatically to a dismal 29.41 , especially pitiful when you consider than only Democrats in districts voting overwhelmingly for McCain have congressmen who vote as frequently with the GOP as Barrow does .
Obama won GA - 12 54 - 45 % and Barrow 's fear - driven outlook on life is geared in the wrong direction .
He needs to start fearing the Democratic base , not rowdy teabaggers and crazed Glenn Beck fans .
In 2008 Barrow spent over $ 2.5 million , much of it from corporate special interests .
Regina raised , primarily from small grassroots and netroots contributions , $ 100,000 .
People have been critical of her campaign skills .
First bear in mind that she had never lost an election since first being elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1994 and then the Georgia state Senate in 1999 .
Basically , she won races by meeting all the voters and by building an unblemished record of serving their needs .
She campaigns at church suppers and community events , talking with everyone .
That works in a state legislative district ; not so much is a sprawling congressional district that stretches from Savannah to Augusta to Milledgeville and Vidalia .
But Regina is a quick study and this time she 's assembling a team to help her with strategy and finance .
A Hillary Clinton campaign strategist is working with her to assemble a modern and effective race .
They even put up a Facebook page yesterday !
This race is going to be a long , tough slog , not unlike the hard races we fought that eventually led to victories for candidates Donna Edwards , Eric Massa and Larry Kissell .
Regina is the first progressive to jump into a race against one of the slimy Blue Dogs who voted against Choice and against healthcare reform .
Please consider helping today , even with a small donation at Regina 's Blue America ActBlue page .

Just the appearance of science fiction memorabilia , computer game boxes and junk food in a classroom or workplace is enough to create an environment that makes computer science an unattractive field to many women .
Photo by Sapna Cheryan
( PhysOrg.com ) --
In real estate , it 's location , location , location .
And when it comes to why girls and women shy away from careers in computer science , a key reason is environment , environment , environment .
The stereotype of computer scientists as nerds who stay up all night coding and have no social life may be driving women away from the field , according to a new study published this month .
This stereotype can be brought to mind based only on the appearance of the environment in a classroom or an office .
" When people think of computer science the image that immediately pops into many of their minds is of the computer geek surrounded by such things as computer games , science fiction memorabilia and junk food , " said Sapna Cheryan , a University of Washington assistant professor of psychology and the study 's lead author .
" That stereotype does n't appeal to many women who do n't like the portrait of masculinity that it evokes . "
Such objects help create what Cheryan calls ambient belonging , or the feeling that you fit or do n't fit in somewhere .
" It is the sense you get right away when you walk into a room .
You look at the objects and make an instant appraisal of how you would fit with the objects and the people who are typically found in that environment .
You also make a judgment of ' I like it here ' or ' I do n't belong here , ' " she said
Cheryan set up four experiments involving more than 250 female and male students who were not studying computer science to look at possible reasons why the proportion of women in the field is dropping while the proportion of women in such disciplines as biology , mathematics and chemistry is increasing .
In the first experiment , students entered a small classroom that either contained objects stereotypically associated with computer science such as Star Trek posters , video game boxes and Coke cans , or non-stereotypical items such as nature posters , art , a dictionary and coffee mugs .
The students were told to ignore these objects because the room was being shared with another class .
After spending several moments in the classroom , the students filled out questionnaires that asked about their attitude toward computer science .
Women exposed to the stereotypical setup expressed less interest in computer science than those who saw the non-stereotypical objects .
Men placed in the same situations did not show a similar drop in interest in computer science .
Cheryan said this study suggests that a student 's choice of classes or a major can be influenced by the appearance of classrooms , halls and offices .
The other three experiments which asked student to imagine stereotypical and non-stereotypical objects in various environments , found that :
When women were given the choice of joining one of two all - female teams at a company , and the only difference between the teams was the objects found in the teams ' workrooms , 82 percent of the women picked the team with the non-stereotypical workroom .
The stereotypical and non-stereotypical objects were the determining factor for both women and men when they were given the choice of taking similar jobs at one of two companies that had workforces evenly split by gender .
Both genders had a preference for the job in non-stereotypical work environment , but women 's preferences for the non-stereotypical environment were significantly stronger than men's .
Women also felt less of a sense of ambient belonging in the stereotypical work environment than men .
After being questioned about their attitudes toward a Web design company , males and females were asked to choose between identical job offers from two such companies .
The only difference between the firms was the objects in each company 's workplace .
Women were more likely to accept an offer with the non-stereotypical company while men had the opposite preference .
The more women perceived the stereotypical environment as masculine , the less interested they were in that company .
" These studies suggest objects such as science fiction books and Star Trek posters communicate whether or not a person belongs in an environment .
" Instead of trying to change the women who do not relate to the stereotype , our research suggests that changing the image of computer science so that more women feel they fit in the field will go a long way to recruiting them into computer science , " said Cheryan .
" We want to attract more people to computer science .
The stereotype is not as alienating to men as women , but it still affects them as well .
A lot of men may also be choosing to not enter the field because of the stereotype .
We need to broaden the image of the field so both women and men feel more welcome .
In workplaces and universities we can do this by changing the way offices , hallways and labs look .
The media can also play a role by updating the image of computer science .
It would be nice for computer scientists in movies and television to be typical people , not only computer geeks . "

The put -upon people of Manchester got the chance to quiz Home Office minister Meg Hillier on ID cards yesterday , while Parliament got an update on the national identity register - the database at the heart of the project .
Sir Joseph Pilling told the Home Affairs committee that 538 people were now on the database - one of them foreign the rest Brits .
Pilling is the UK ID czar and is described as " an independent voice ... safeguarding the public ’s privacy and identity rights " , although he 's been a Home Office Sir Humphrey since 1966 .
Meanwhile , Meg Hillier spent part of yesterday responding to questions from readers of the Manchester Evening News .
This grassroots , reach - out web chat was an enormous success in turning round public opinion using just reasoned argument - think Peel 's speech on the Corn Laws .
The online poll carried out by the paper , clearly not astro - turfed by any special interest group , found four per cent of respondents were in favour of the cards against 96 per cent of people who were against it .
This did n't faze meg though , who told the audience that around two thirds of the public could n't wait to get their hands on an ID card .
So , there you are , ID cards are like Man United - all the supporters live outside Manchester .
Otherwise the web chat repeated other Home Office half - truths .
Hillier said : " But another real benefit is that once you have registered no - one can steal your identity " and " the databases will be very secure - think Police National Computer .
No -one will be able to download information and it will not be on PCs on people 's desks . "
Regular readers wo n't need reminding of the government 's rubbish record of managing the DNA database , the criminal records databases or the complete failure of the prisoner tracking database .
She also said that less than 100 " highly security vetted " people will have direct access to the database - which suggests that not many requests will be made of it , or they 'll be working very fast .
Hillier also reminded the Mancs of the penalties for anyone failing to update the register with their correct address , which , really , are all for their own good .
" The penalty charges are really an encouragement to keep info up to date - this only actually affects your address .
The main beneficiary of up to date address is the card holder so we do n't envisage many people not complying . "
Of course , if the biometrics confirm your ID , what 's your address got to do with it ?
And with that she said , " I 'm sorry I ca n't stay longer - it 's been an interesting discussion . ®

Well that 's George Burley sent packing , and I think the majority of the Tartan Army will welcome the news - but where do we go from here ?
Every Scotsman will have their own thoughts on their ideal candidate , but as far as I 'm concerned Scottish Football needs to change from rock - bottom up in order for our fortunes to change - and it 's going to take a long time .
The last time we qualified for a major tournament was in 1998 , which means that at least 14 years and six competitions will have passed by the time Euro 2012 comes around .
Graeme Souness said earlier this week that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger would n't fair much better due to the quality of squad they would inherit .
I can see where he is coming from although I hope he was over - exaggerating slightly .
Our last two " successful " managers were Walter Smith followed by Alex McLeish .
I say successful but , despite raising our world rankings , they ultimately failed in their respective qualification campaigns .
Maybe that 's what we have to accept now .
It may be the case that the odd upset against the top nations , with qualification for a major tournament every 20 years is the measure of success for our national team .
Smith and McLeish made Scotland difficult to beat .
They knew that we were not blessed with the most talented players in the world but they were honest and hard working and appeared passionate when playing for their nation .
The home and away victories achieved against France were testament to this .
I 'm sure there is a manager out there to get us back to where we were before Burley , but we all want more .
For that to happen we need to start producing better players from the kids that come through at club level , and that 's why I believe any significant turnaround could take years .
We need to have our kids eating , sleeping and drinking football .
They should have the opportunity and the facilities to be able to practice , practice and practice again .
I 'll get a bit of stick from my mates , telling me to let it go , but when I was at Rangers as a youngster , the opportunity to do a bit extra with a ball was n't really there .
It was in the days before Murray Park was built and we were based at Ibrox every day , travelling to various locations around Glasgow in order to train .
Between doing our jobs , there was nowhere for us to go and get the ball out .
We often played the odd game of head - tennis in the dressing room or under the East Enclosure , but we were always caught and had to head back in .
In an ideal world we would have football academys all over the country , where our kids could be educated and enjoy scheduled football sessions at various points in the day .
It works in other parts of Europe , so why not here ?
There are obviously some good coaches in our country , but perhaps some of our methods need to change .
I wonder if the Scottish Football Association is aware of the content of coaching courses in other counties and the steps that are taken to achieve the various qualifications to coach in the game .
I had to laugh when I read that Chick Charnley threw in the towel after his first SFA coaching course when he was sat beside two pregnant women and a school teacher .
Okay , maybe this was a slight exaggeration on Chick 's part , but I understand where he is coming from .
As much as I would like to get away without mentioning it , Annan lost the most recent game on Saturday at home to Elgin .
In case you did n't know , that was actually our first defeat against Elgin since we joined the Scottish Football League .
Perhaps all the talk in our match day programme about that very subject , along with their 6 - 1 thrashing at Livingston the previous week , gave them a little added incentive .
It may sound daft , but I was very wary about Saturday 's fixture , because we had a night out planned after the match .
It 's happened to me regularly since I joined Annan , and now when there 's any talk of a team night out I pray it falls on a free weekend .
Researchers from the UCLA AIDS Institute and colleagues have for the first time demonstrated that human blood stem cells can be engineered into cells that can target and kill HIV - infected cells -- a process that potentially could be used against a range of chronic viral diseases .
The study , published Dec. 7 in the - peer reviewed online journal PLoS One , provides proof - of - principle -- that is , a demonstration of feasibility -- that human stem cells can be engineered into the equivalent of a genetic vaccine .
" We have demonstrated in this proof - of - principle study that this type of approach can be used to engineer the human immune system , particularly the T - cell response , to specifically target HIV - infected cells , " said lead investigator Scott G. Kitchen , assistant professor of medicine in the division of hematology and oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and a member of the UCLA AIDS Institute .
" These studies lay the foundation for further therapeutic development that involves restoring damaged or defective immune responses toward a variety of viruses that cause chronic disease , or even different types of tumors . "
Taking CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes -- the " killer " T cells that help fight infection -- from an HIV - infected individual , the researchers identified the molecule known as the T - cell receptor , which guides the T cell in recognizing and killing HIV - infected cells .
These cells , while able to destroy HIV - infected cells , do not exist in enough quantities to clear the virus from the body .
So the researchers cloned the receptor and genetically engineered human blood stem cells , then placed the stem cells into human thymus tissue that had been implanted in mice , allowing them to study the reaction in a living organism .
The engineered stem cells developed into a large population of mature , multifunctional HIV - specific CD8 cells that could specifically target cells containing HIV proteins .
The researchers also found that HIV - specific T - cell receptors have to be matched to an individual in much the same way that an organ is matched to a transplant patient .
The next step is to test this strategy in a more advanced model to determine if it would work in the human body , said co-author Jerome A. Zack , UCLA professor of medicine in the division of hematology and oncology and associate director of the UCLA AIDS Institute .
The researchers also hope to expand the range of viruses against which this approach could be used .
But the results of the study suggest that this strategy could be an effective weapon in the fight against AIDS and other viral diseases .
" This approach could be used to combat a variety of chronic viral diseases , " said Zack , who is also a professor of microbiology , immunology and molecular genetics .
" It 's like a genetic vaccine . "
In addition to Kitchen and Zack , investigators included Michael Bennett , Zoran Galic , Joanne Kim , Qing Xu , Alan Young , Alexis Lieberman , Hwee Ng and Otto Yang , all of UCLA , and Aviva Joseph and Harris Goldstein of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York .
The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine ( CIRM ) and the UCLA Center for AIDS Researchfunded this study .
Using borrowed money for a band - aid bailout of the economy should seem backwards to most people .
However , it likely is a planned strategy to promote radical change .
Those naively believing that President Obama is simply rewarding his far - left base , and will then move to the political center , must wise up .
The assumption that Obama will need the nation to prosper in order to protect the 2010 mid-term election incorrectly assumes that he esteems free market capitalism .
He does not .
Rather than win through superior ideas and policies , the Democrat plan for success in the mid-term elections is to win by destroying political opposition .
The Cloward / Piven Strategy is named after Columbia University sociologists Richard Andrew Cloward and Frances Fox Piven .
Their goal is to overthrow capitalism by overwhelming the government bureaucracy with entitlement demands .
The created crisis provides the impetus to bring about radical political change .
According to Discover the Networks.org :
Rather than placating the poor with government hand - outs , wrote Cloward and Piven , activists should work to sabotage and destroy the welfare system ; the collapse of the welfare state would ignite a political and financial crisis that would rock the nation ...
[ Emphasis added . ]
Making an already weak economy even worse is the intent of the Cloward / Piven Strategy .
It is imperative that we view the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan 's spending on items like food stamps , jobless benefits , and health care through this end goal .
This strategy explains why the Democrat plan to " stimulate " the economy involves massive deficit spending projects .
It includes billions for ACORN and its subgroups such as SHOP and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program .
Expanding the S - Chip Program through deficit spending in a supposed effort to " save the children " only makes a faltering economy worse .
If Congress were to allow a robust economy , parents would be able to provide for their children themselves by earning and keeping more of their own money .
Democrats , quick to not waste a crisis , would consider that a lost opportunity .
The Cato Institute reports that the plan will harm a faltering economy , intentionally causing increased job losses leading to increased demands for the aforementioned programs .
Even the jobs to be created are set apart to render social justice , not economic revival .
Robert Reich believes new infrastructure jobs should not go to white construction workers .
Meanwhile , workers at Microsoft , IBM , Texas Instruments , and the retail market find themselves experiencing the life of the welfare poor .
If highly educated and trained workers continue to lose jobs and business falters as a whole , where will these jobless workers go ?
Could this be construed as revolutionary social reorganization that puts the underachiever above the achiever ?
Where is the future economic strength when jobless professionals collect welfare and unemployment while dreaming of a minimum wage job ?
For whites , there 's not even the hope of a good paying construction job .
Because these programs are financed with deficit spending , the effect of the Cloward / Piven Strategy becomes doubly destructive .
Talk about a perfect storm !
The Democrat stimulus plan is a mechanism whose goal is the destruction of the traditional American way of life .
It is bitter irony that the American taxpayer will actually fund the destruction of his own ability to live according to the values of our Founding Documents .
It is not alarmist to identify this situation as a coup d'etat .
As the flow of money from the top of the economy dries up , job losses and mortgage busts will mount exponentially .
The Democrat stimulus plan provides for welfare expansion but not for a robust economy that creates high paying jobs .
Is this what Obama means when he warns , " It 's going to get worse before it gets better ? "
If we are not bailing out corporate America so they can regain profitability , we must conclude Obama is working toward another end goal .
Recognizing these attack methods reveals the only logical response -- an unwavering wall of " No ! "
( Wired ) --
A year after its release , Google 's open source Android operating system has become a sensation .
After a slow start , it is now available on at least 12 phones , with more devices waiting in the wings .
Good news for Android fans , right ?
Not really , say some developers .
A slew of problems have made managing Android apps a " nightmare , " they say , including three versions of the OS ( Android 1.5 , 1.6 and 2.0 ) , custom firmware on many phones , and hardware differences between different models .
For users , it means apps in the store could be buggy , might not work well depending on their handsets , and could deliver a frustrating experience .
Unaware of the increasing back - end complexity , they would then be more likely to leave bad reviews for those apps -- a potentially lethal blow for small businesses , say developers .
" Instead of working on updates to our apps , we find we are trying to make each app work for multiple versions of the OS and different hardware capabilities , " says Chris Fagan , co-founder at Froogloid , an Android - focused application development company .
" We are not complaining about all the growth , but if you are a small or a new Android developer coming in and trying to learn I could see your head exploding .
It would be overwhelming , " he says .
The problem echoes similar concerns over Java in the 1990s .
Originally touted as a way for developers to build apps that would run on any computer ( " write once , run anywhere " ) , developers found that wide variations in Java virtual machines as well as available hardware meant that Java 's promise was really " write once , debug everywhere . "
While Java is still used -- particularly in the mobile space , where it powers games and other apps written for Java - capable cellphones -- it is not nearly the cross - platform panacea it was originally conceived as .
Fagan 's concern about the fragmentation of Android is being echoed by other developers , says Sean Galligan , vice president of business development at Flurry , an mobile app analytics company .
" There 's no question that we are starting to hear developers express concern , " says Galligan .
" Android is growing very fast and there 's a lot of excitement for it but it's also a lot for work , especially for medium and small developers . "
Since the launch of the first HTC T - Mobile G1 phone running Android OS , a number of handset makers have jumped on the bandwagon .
HTC alone has five Android handsets available , while others like Motorola have shifted completely to the Android platform .
In the past two months , Motorola released two new Android - based handsets , the Cliq and Droid .
And in a bid to differentiate themselves , handset makers are creating custom user interfaces like the HTC Sense , the Motorola Blur and the Rachael UI from Sony Ericsson .
Android phones vary significantly in the hardware , too -- phones with and without camera flash , some have physical keyboards , others do n't .
" You may build an app that works perfectly with all three firmwares , but then when you run it on carriers '
ROMs it completely blows up , " says Fagan .
" So we find ourselves having to create apps that are compatible with multiple firmwares , multiple ROMs and multiple devices with different hardware . "
It 's in sharp contrast to the iPhone platform .
Apple has tightly controlled the introduction of new iPhones and updates to its operating system .
It has just three iPhone models available since it first introduced the phone in 2007 .
And all iPhone users are prompted to update their phones to be on the same version of the operating system .
While Apple pioneered the app store idea with the iPhone , Android , too , offers Market , a store for distribution of third - party programs .
Unlike with the Apple app store , Android developers do not have to go through an approval process to get their apps on the Android Market .
Currently , the Android market has about 10,000 apps compared to the 100,000 in Apple 's app store .
For developers , Apple 's autocratic ways may be frustrating , but they can pay off .
" Apple maintains an iron grip on what they do and there 's an advantage to that , " says Kelly Schrock , owner of Fognl , which has three apps on the Android market .
" IPhone developers do n't have to worry about fragmentation and creating apps for the iPhone is much easier . "
Founded about the same time as the first Android phone hit the market , Froogloid today has more than 100,000 users across its three apps : a2 b , Key Ring and CowPotato .
But with Android 's growth , managing these apps is becoming quite a challenge , says Fagan .
The diversity of devices running Android OS has led to some unexpected results , says Fagan .
For instance , the Sprint HTC Hero was launched without its GPS setting turned on .
When run , the a2b application could trigger it -- but Froogloid soon found that the standard commands they used reacted differently on the Hero than on other Android devices .
Instead of launching the GPS settings , it set off the " screen unlock pattern " settings , says Chris Pick , requiring Froogloid to write custom code in their app for that particular device .
Google says it has emulators available that allows developers to test their application running on simulated devices so they can see how it behaves .
But it does n't always work , says Fagan .
" In a sense , we are shooting blind with the emulators because we have no idea how it is really working on the device . "
For instance , explains Pick , the graphics for their 3D game app , Cowpotato worked fine on the emulator but crashed when run on Motorola 's Droid phone .
Pick suspects a bug in the graphics driver on the Droid .
Writing for a fix for it took care of the problem but its not the best solution , he says .
" When we have to start writing rules based on the phone model in our code , it adds more code to our code base , creates more work for us and makes the app heavier , " says Pick .
Different versions of the OS also means new functionality is added or some removed .
Understanding these changes and making software backward compatible takes time , say Schrock .
" It 's a multiplication of work to support all of them . "
A bigger problem is the customization of firmware or custom ROMs .
For instance , Google offers a basic homescreen with the Android code .
But device manufacturers or network carriers can always modify it .
Sometimes the changes are simple , such as replacing all white color with grey , or red with yellow .
That allows handset makers and carriers to tailor Android better for their customers , something that Google says it supports " strongly . "
" That is n't a big deal , " says Fagan .
" However , when they start changing fundamentally how certain activities are controlled , such as user settings and screen orientation , it creates issues for developers that have built their apps on an out of the box version of the firmware / SDK . "
Custom ROMs are always available for developers to look through , points out Froogloid .
" Google has mandated that every one base their releases on the standard versions , " says Pick .
" But this slips under the radar . "
Ultimately , developers will have to start making tough decisions on who they want to target and versions of the operating system they want to support , says Galligan .
" Developers have to identify which devices and carriers appeal to the market they are creating an app for and develop just for it , " he says .
A one - man band , Schrock says without any employees he can't maintain four different app versions .
" It 's getting a lot riskier on the Android .
It 's not 4 x increase in the cost but it will be a lot more work . "
And while Schrock says the apps are not his meal ticket , he does n't want to make choices that could cut off some Android users from his apps .
" I will have to decide then how much return I am getting and if it is worth it . "

Engineers can build autonomous vehicles capable of cruising city streets without the aid of a human driver , as demonstrated two years ago in the DARPA Urban Challenge .
A team of researchers is now looking to translate that success to the medical field by building so - called " smart wheelchairs " with artificial intelligence that uses lasers , sensors and mapping software to operate and navigate powered chairs for riders who can not do so on their own .
With help from a five - year , $ 480,000 National Science Foundation grant received in June , a team of researchers led by John Spletzer , an associate professor of computer science and engineering at Lehigh University in Bethlehem , Pa. , has developed a prototype chair designed specifically for negotiating sidewalks , parking lots and other outdoor areas .
As with other smart wheelchairs designed in the past , Spletzer 's device uses a light detection and ranging ( LiDAR ) system to detect trees , poles , parking meters , corners and other real - world obstacles .
A key difference is that this chair will cross-reference the maps it makes of its surroundings using LiDAR and other sensors with 3 - D maps that Spletzer and his team create and load into its memory .
To complement the chair 's ability to recognize and avoid stationary obstacles , the researchers are also planning to write software that will help the chair predict and avoid moving obstacles such as pedestrians and cars .
" My work aims to push the envelope in wheelchair autonomy , " Spletzer says .
" It will not be limited to structured indoor environments .
Instead , it investigates the much more difficult problem of autonomous operations in unstructured environments outdoors . "
The prototype that Spletzer and his colleagues have built thus far can trace its lineage back to two of Spletzer 's previous research endeavors .
One is the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge for robotic vehicles , where Spletzer was part of the team that produced " Little Ben , " a Toyota Prius fitted with laser and camera sensors .
Little Ben was one of six cars ( out of a field of 89 vehicles ) that autonomously completed the 92 - kilometer course , designed to mimic the challenges of city driving .
Spletzer 's work with Philadelphia 's Freedom Sciences , LLC , likewise contributed to his smart wheelchair prototype .
Freedom Sciences received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval in 2008 to sell its Automated Transport and Retrieval System ( ATRS ) , which lets wheelchair users get into and out of their vehicles as well as stow and retrieve their motorized wheelchairs .
ATRS works as such : after getting into the driver 's seat , the driver uses a remote control to guide the wheelchair to a lift at the back of his car .
Once there , the wheelchair uses a laser guidance system to dock itself on the lift platform , which is then retracted into the car .
" The wheelchair only goes a couple of feet on its own , " Spletzer says , " but it allows the driver to be independent . "
Spletzer and his team created the maps for their prototype smart chair with Little Ben 's help .
They drove the modified Prius around South Bethlehem and the Stabler Arena parking lot on Lehigh 's Goodman Campus to create 3 - D maps later downloaded to their wheelchair 's control system .
( Although this sounds work - intensive , it is not unlike Google 's approach to creating its Street View maps . )
In test runs , the researchers have been able to get the chair to autonomously travel about one kilometer and arrive at its destination while tracking its position within an accuracy of 20 centimeters .
Spletzer adds that they could not have achieved this level of accuracy using the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , which tends to be off by a meter or more .
Not a big problem for drivers , but a huge issue for a wheelchair .
A key aspect of Spletzer 's chair will be making it affordable .
He points out that Freedom Sciences is able to sell its ATRS because that product 's cost is comparable with that of purchasing a van or SUV and revamping it to allow a person to drive while seated in the wheelchair , as most wheelchair drivers now do .
To get beyond the prototype phase with their smart wheelchair , Spletzer and his team will have to figure out how to get it to move autonomously without having to rely on the expensive LiDAR system that Little Ben used but rather on a combination of lower cost LiDAR and sonar sensors .
Of course , Spletzer and his colleagues are not the only ones who have come up with the idea of a smart wheelchair .
A paper published in the December 1999 IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering describes a NavChair Assistive Wheelchair Navigation System ( pdf ) developed at the time to reduce the " cognitive and physical requirements of operating a power wheelchair for people with wide ranging impairments that limit their access to powered mobility . "
The NavChair was based on a commercial wheelchair system with the addition of a DOS - based computer system , ultrasonic sensors and an interface module interposed between the joystick and power unit .
Two more recent projects share nearly the same name :
The Robochair project at the University of the Basque Country 's Laboratory of Human–Computer Interaction for Special Needs in Spain is creating an autonomous navigation system that can be added to commercially available powered wheelchairs .
In 2007 researchers at the University of Essex in England pursued a similar project called RoboChair ( pdf ) .
Yet , whereas others have demonstrated that smart wheelchairs can work , they have yet to make them affordable for the large population of users ( 2.7 million people age 15 and older in the U.S. alone ) .
" The ultimate goal is to develop a smart - chair system capable of unprecedented levels of autonomy while still being commercially viable , " Spletzer says .

Formula 1 is set for a radical alteration to its points system in 2010 if the World Motor Sport Council approves an F1 Commission proposal to give points to the top 10 finishers in each race .
In today 's Commission meeting , chaired by Bernie Ecclestone and attended by FIA president Jean Todt , a new scoring system was put forward which will award 25 points to each race winner , 20 for second place , 15 for third and 10 for fourth , before descending 8 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 2 - 1 for fifth through 10th positions .
The change has been proposed to take into account the increased field for 2010 , when the addition of the new entrants will take the grid up to 26 cars , its highest figure since 1995 .
Assuming it is approved by the WMSC , the change would be the first revision to the points system since the number of scoring drivers per race was increased from six to eight in 2003 .
The F1 Commission also agreed that its Sporting Working Group sub - committee should develop " detailed proposals to improve the show " that would take effect next year , and that " the FIA and FOM will further collaborate to enhance the communication and promotion of the championship to the media and its worldwide fanbase . "

When the recession cut into Jay and Valerie Holt ’s veterinary practice , their financial bind was more pressing than most .
The couple care for a menagerie worthy of Noah ’s Ark .
The monthly grocery bill ?
$ 10,000 .
Jay suggested they sell some of their 160 creatures , including kangaroos , opossums , anteaters and coatimundi .
Valerie balked .
Then came an idea :
Since people had long shown up at their home and asked to see the animals , the couple turned their three acres into Roos - N - More Zoo .
“ If I started from scratch and built a zoo , I probably would n’t put my house in the middle , ” said Valerie , 42 , a ring - tailed lemur named Macoco hugging her neck .
But it worked .
Though Nevada is often defined by the glitz of Las Vegas , much of the state resembles this unassuming town 50 miles to the north , with 1,000 residents and the topography of a sandbox .
Off the two - lane main drag are a post office , an elementary school , a diner ( advertising , simply , “ Good Food ” ) and endless desert where people tinker with the most improbable of plans .
On a recent Saturday , cars turned at a homemade sign for Roos - N - More , a nonprofit facility accredited by the Zoological Assn. of America .
The cars lumbered down a dirt road and parked outside a gate imprinted with a kangaroo .
Valerie , in a yellow Roos T - shirt and dirt - stained jeans , stood next to a sizable tunnel near her front porch .
She shook a piece of corn until an African crested porcupine named Racer X crawled out .
Racer X is the size of a dog , with a mohawk of black and white quills .
As the creature devoured the corn , Valerie began smashing a pumpkin .
Onlookers gasped : Behind her , two more porcupines , Thorn and Spike , emerged , their quills spread into giant fans .
“ This is incredible , ” murmured visitor Jan Voight , speaking for her stunned granddaughter , Sofia Macarena , 4 .
Almost three years ago , Valerie and Jay , 44 , decided to leave the outskirts of Las Vegas .
They had about 16 kangaroos , wallabies and wallaroos -- the first , Pogo , had been a birthday present to Valerie -- and suburbia was inching closer .
Also , Jay wanted a camel .
Moapa was close enough to commute to their Las Vegas veterinary clinic , Animal Kindness , but far enough that there ’s no inkling of the Strip .
Their acreage was once alfalfa fields and , when they bought it , had neither water nor electricity .
They got two camels , Habib and Sayyid .
After Habib died , Valerie surprised her distraught husband with another camel , Jafar , for his birthday .
A friend suggested their camels needed a zebra ; the Holts bought Razbe ( yes , that ’s an anagram ) .
And so the brood grew .
Valerie and Jay , who attended Louisiana State University ’s veterinary school together , had seen many small exotic animals in their practice .
( Nevada is so rife with exotics that when a tiger escaped near Las Vegas this summer , it barely made news . )
Often , Valerie would swoon over a new species and plead with her husband : Just .
One .
More .
So Jay often found himself flying his six - seat Cessna -- which he ’d bought so the couple could travel to veterinary conventions -- to ferry lemurs and porcupines .
To transport Jafar , he took out all the seats .
“ She does n’t do jewelry , ” he said of his wife .
“ She wants an animal she can care for . ”
One year Valerie declared the couple ’s “ pork anniversary ” and received a pot - bellied pig .
The Holts also developed a reputation for raising wounded creatures , such as a one - legged red kangaroo named Boomerang .
Soon , people started calling with questions like , “ Do you have room for a bush baby ? ”
That ’s how they got Grumbles , who had been for sale on Craigslist .
“ There ’s something about these animals that ’s almost magical , ” said Valerie , despite the numerous scratches and bruises she ’s endured .
Her husband staffs the veterinary practice four days a week ; she takes the fifth .
Whoever is home tends to the flock with help from children Zach , 14 , and Hailey , 12 , who grew up at the practice and sometimes napped next to the patients .
They also have an employee , LynnLee Schmidt , 26 , who worked with lions at MGM Grand .
Jay built most of the open enclosures ; in one , camels and zebras mix with pigs , goats and sheep .
The Holts turned an old storage shed into an animal kitchen for the family to make the horde ’s meals .
The decor includes a painting by Thumper , a Patagonian cavy ( a large guinea pig relative ) , who had dipped its paws in orange and blue paint .
( Artwork by , among others , Sushi the otter and Caico the monkey sells for $ 25 online . )
Plastic containers are marked “ Goat Treats ” and “ Roo Crumbs . ”
Cards say the coatimundi , members of the raccoon family , relish “ monkey biscuits soaked in fruit juice . ”
And the parrots ?
“ Table scraps but no chocolate or junk food . ”
Good to know .
The four - bedroom house is a children ’s storybook come to life .
The coffee table doubles as a home for marbled polecats .
Monkey Caico has her own room with a rope hammock and stuffed bears .
One afternoon , a duck - like grebe -- found by an animal control officer -- floated in the bathtub .
The Holts , who get a few hundred visitors a month , have kept their entire brood .
They ’ve also found work for some animals on “ Let ’s Make A Deal , ” which films in Las Vegas .
On a warm afternoon , Valerie crouched over the pond and waterfall -- mostly made by Jay -- near the porch .
She lifted out Snork , an otter named after the noise he makes when startled , dried him with an aqua towel and asked the half - dozen onlookers :
Who wants to pet him ?
Little Sofia , who had been enraptured by the porcupines , approached Snork with caution .
She touched his dark fur with her fingers .
Valerie nodded reassuringly , and Sofia threw both arms around the otter in a giant hug .

( CNET ) -- Dell said Friday that it 's ready to enter the smartphone business with the Android - based Mini 3 .
Long rumored to have such a device in the works , Dell said that the first two carriers to sell the Mini 3 will be China Mobile and Brazil 's Claro .
The Mini 3 will apparently use OPhone , China Mobile 's customized version of Google 's Android operating system .
" We are excited for Dell to be among the first manufacturers to introduce new technology based on the OPhone platform , " an unnamed China Mobile representative said in Dell 's press release .
We 've got a call out to Dell to seek clarification on the operating system software .
Dell did not provide technical specifications or pricing information for the phone , saying those would be revealed when the device arrives in stores -- probably late November for China Mobile and by year 's end for Claro .
It also did not say when the phone would arrive in the U.S. or other markets .
Michael Tatelman , a Dell sales and marketing executive , told the Associated Press that the phone has a 3.5 - inch high - definition touch screen .
The Mini 3 sold in China wo n't have Wi-Fi at the start , but Tatelman said that would come later .
Similarly , Apple 's iPhone just made its official debut in China sans Wi-Fi .
China Mobile has more than 500 million customers , and Claro serves more than 42 million people in Brazil as part of the America Movil network , Dell said .
Dell did tout its " existing agreements with other leading global telecom providers , " including Vodafone in Europe ; AT&T and Verizon in the U.S. ; M1 and Starhub in Singapore ; and Maxis in Malaysia .
The Texas - based PC maker also played up the Internet connectivity angle of small mobile gadgetry .
" Our entry into the smartphone category is a logical extension of Dell 's consumer product evolution over the past two years , " Ron Garriques , president of the Dell Global Consumer Group , said in a statement .
" We are developing smaller and smarter mobile products that enable our customers to take their Internet experience out of the home and do the things they want to do whenever and wherever they want . "
But does the world need a smartphone from Dell ?
The device will have plenty of company : Android phones have begun arriving on the market in larger numbers in recent months .
Most notably , U.S. carrier Verizon Wireless last week began selling the much - hyped Droid , made by Motorola , and the more modest Droid Eris , made by HTC .

Is feminism " destroying the family " ?
Plenty of people appear to believe so .
Earlier this week , " crop - haired " Katherine Rake , who recently ended a seven - year stint as head of feminist campaigning organisation the Fawcett Society , was accused of continuing to work towards this sinister agenda – her easy - care hairdo cited by the Daily Mail as proof of her malicious intent .
Rake upset the socially conservative by declaring in her first speech as head of the Family and Parenting Institute ( a government - funded organisation that we do n't need anyway ) that " the days of the typical family are numbered " .
This statement of statistical - projection fact drew outrage from David Cameron , who lambasted Labour for its continuing hostility to marriage .
Ed Balls , the minister for children , schools and families , offered a retort .
He 's not personally hostile to marriage – he is , after all , married himself , to " crop - haired " work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper – but he is against the Conservative idea that unmarried parents should be treated as " second - class " citizens .
It 's a horrible idea , of course , and its horrible reality is still a raw , living memory .
Only days ago , there was a new outpouring of abhorrence – and an apology from Kevin Rudd , the Australian prime minister – over one of the most ghastly manifestations of the treatment of " unmarried parents " .
Who could listen to the stories of children separated from their mothers , told they were orphans , and transported to exploitation in Australia ( a practice that ended only four decades ago ) without a horrified shudder ?
Yet however scrupulously one may reject the idea of unmarried parents as " second - class citizens " , class – as a cultural expression of economic status – continues to dog the " debate " .
Single parents do tend to be " second - class citizens " , with 47 % living below the poverty line .
Statistically , their children do less well at school , and are overwhelmingly more likely to enter the criminal justice system , or to run into mental health or addiction problems .
Middle - and upper - class people are more likely to have their children later , when they are financially stable .
Middle - or upper - class teenage pregnancies are more likely to end in abortion than teenage pregnancies among poor families .
And so on .
Delayed and structured parenthood , even marriage , is now , broadly , the choice of people – men and women – who have real choices .
Early and unplanned parenthood is now , broadly , the choice of people – men and women – who look around them and perceive their options are narrow .
Feminism has liberated aspirational and affluent women , because it has ensured that women who are capable of financial independence are more able to achieve it , within marriage or outside it – although the continuing gender pay gap ( much - monitored by Rake when she was at the Fawcett Society ) is testament that even this success has been highly circumscribed .
I do n't imagine that 1970s feminists envisaged the rejection of educational opportunities , the refusal of family planning options , and the graft of bringing up children alone and on the breadline , as brave - new - world female choices for a post - liberation era , any more than they envisaged the advent of boob - jobs , pole - dancing supermodels and store - card bankruptcy .
Actually , it is a big fat irony that feminists are now obliged to defend the right of lone mothers to stay at home with their young children , when the initial idea was to liberate women from the obligation to , well , stay at home with their young children .
Notwithstanding his dislike of the idea of unmarried parents as second - class citizens , Ed Balls has long been a senior member of a political party that has directed policy – admittedly without great success – at pressurising unmarried parents , in particular , into work .
The Conservatives believe that , with rings on their fingers ( placed there with the help of a tax break ) , the mothers who have caused Labour such angst would have stayed at home very much more happily .
But that is only because of their blind adherence to the middle - class portrait of the pre-feminist world .
I do n't believe in that world , in which women got married , then gladly gave up work .
Both of my grandmothers worked .
My father 's mother worked in a factory that made ladies ' foundation garments , supporting her five surviving children alone after her husband , an asthmatic miner , had died young of lung disease .
My mother 's mother left " service " after she had married .
But as the wife of a landless rural worker and mother of seven , she kept chickens , grew vegetables , made jams and chutneys , baked , cooked , sewed and knitted interminably , all year round .
My aunts worked , all 10 of them , especially the widows – in offices , as barmaids , in shops , as cooks , even though they were married , even though they had children .
My mother , like her sisters and her sisters - in - law , stayed at home when we children were small .
But she returned to work , first part - time , then full - time , as soon as she could .
So , when Fay Weldon ruffles feathers , as she did at a literary festival this week , by declaring that one of the down - sides of feminism is that it has " made wage - slaves " out of mothers , I can only shake my head .
Mothers always had access to wage - slavery , and those mothers who had husbands who drank the pay - packet , or handed over risible " housekeeping " , were particularly glad of their " pin money " .
Feminism gave women much greater access to , or at least hope of , " careers " .
Its rejection of marriage was bound up with the fact that a married woman was a woman who could forget about professional progress .
Now feminists defend their distrust of marriage , as if out - of - work mothers , living with a succession of boyfriends with whom they have a succession of children , was the intention and the dream all along .
It was n't , and other social factors , such as the sexual revolution , the mass exodus from religious belief , and changing patterns of work ( including the annihilation of the earning power of manual - labouring males ) , have played just as large a part in " promoting " alternative family structures as feminism .
For Conservatives , the feminist rejection of the taboo against unmarried motherhood has been fuelled by a welfare state that " puts children first " , creating a society in which the female poor have little incentive to work because they can get an income and a home from breeding .
There is certainly some truth in this argument , but it ignores the counter - intuitive fact that throughout human history , and in our own era too , the poorest people are always the ones who have children most frequently , whether there is a welfare state to offer incentives or not .
So , if David Cameron is worried about his recent poor showings in the polls , he should reconsider his lazy homilies about the magic of marriage , and take a look at the possibility that " broken societies " are often teeming with very broke people .
Not to bad
You 've got a pretty good set o' lungs on you .
Though the problem i see is that you may have tried to hard to sound like the muse singer , and had a couple crackles in the voice .
Also , i do wish that at least the bass and guitar part where played by a person , since by my ears the bass part was a little robotic in it 's smoothness , and the guitar was mostly just a sound of the distortion , but yeah , it was pretty good still , keep up the good work .

It 's interesting to me that snake bites elicit so much more horror in the general populace than any other type of animal bite .
I 'm sure that , historically , this is due in part to the fact that even some very small snakes , especially certain elapids , are capable of delivering a bite that , while minimal in terms of any visible physical damage , can cause rapid death .
This ability must have been particularly shocking to early peoples , resulting in snakes being viewed as having almost supernatural powers .
Of course , as we see from photos such as these , some snakes are certainly capable of causing massive and visible tissue damage and trauma around the bite .
However , I work at a vet clinic and regularly see the results of dog bites inflicted on other dogs , and the damage is regularly every bit as horrible and visible as what is depicted in these photos .
We currently have a German shepherd here in the hospital that looks as if he had been skinned from just behind the head to his shoulders .
Another dog , a very large female Rottweiller , was so badly mauled by one of her own adult pups that she died on the operating table .
This dog was literally so covered in blood that you could n't tell what color she was ( white ) .
I can easily imagine the damage that such teeth and jaws could inflict on human flesh , if so inclined , and treat the dogs here with as much respect as I do my rattlesnakes .
Often , when I begin a snake lecture with a very docile boid of some sort draped around my neck , I am asked " Why does n't that thing bite you ? " as if biting is an automatic and unavoidable behavior for snakes .
I usually respond by asking if the questioner owns a dog .
" Does your dog normally bite you ? "
The answer being almost certainly " no , " I then point out that all dogs are equipped with very sharp teeth and powerful jaws , and that any dog is CAPABLE of delivering a very serious bite , but most of them do n't .
The point is that just because an animal has the equipment to inflict a bite does n't mean that it is inclined to , i.e. , being well - armed does n't necessarily imply malice .
I believe that most snakes do n't want to bite us , and would much rather avoid any confrontation with such a large and formidable adversary as a human .
The last thing a captive venomous snake wants to do is bite its keeper , whether the snake actually realizes this or not .
In the big picture , such an act is likely to seal the snake 's doom , since it is unlikely that anyone but the keeper is really going to care about the snake 's welfare in such a situation , and most other ( sane ? ) people will probably call for the " offending " snake 's destruction ( along with the rest of that unfortunate keeper 's collection ) .
It is our job to ensure , not just for our own sake , but for that of the snakes , that this does not happen .
Do not take chances !
Yet , what amazes me is the horror that people , many keepers included , of being bitten even by a non-venomous snake .
To me , this is just a non-event , except perhaps for large , long - toothed boids .
Non-venomous snakebites are by - and - large just so superficial and ineffective that I almost feel sorry for the snake and its puny efforts to defend itself .
Next to a dog or cat bite ( which ALWAYS become horribly infected ) , NV snake - bites are just nothing .
I 've had far worse from briars or household scrapes and cuts .
Perhaps this horror of ANY snakebite , venomous or non , comes from the fact that biting is really a snake 's only available form of ACTIVE defense , that is to say , a form of defense that inflicts any damage , however minor , upon an assailant .
With no limbs , they are incapable of clawing or scratching , and while many snakes resort to unique ( and perhaps repulsive ) defensive behaviors such as hiding , musking or playing dead , these are all PASSIVE forms of defense .
( I am really unaware of constriction being used defensively , at least in a conscious way ) .
I am very interested in the phenomenon of ophidiophobia , which is always at the top of any list of human fears ( just above public speaking ) .
How many people are really going to encounter a seriously dangerous snake in their daily lives ?
To my mind , ophidiophobia is a major worldwide health problem in terms of the loss of productivity and quality of life that it imposes upon its sufferers , for no good reason .
I have known people who are terrified of walking in the woods or going fishing becasue of snakes ( while they think NOTHING of driving 200 miles on the interstate , a far more dangerous activity ) .
We should all be doing our utmost to combat it .
So much evil is caused by the ills that never happen .
Many " snake shows " capitalize on this supernatural fear , to the benefit of the showman 's ego , who makes himself look as if he is performing some superhuman , death - defying feat by handling snakes .
I am continually trying to undermine this approach with my own lectures , by demonstrating how even potentially dangerous snakes are not inclined to bite , and that most snakes are utterly harmless animals with bites less painful or damaging than that of an average parakeet ( which can deliver a very painful pinch ! ) .
The snakes in my presentations are not refraining from biting me because I have some supernatural powers , or because I am preternaturally " brave " or daring ( hell , I hate to fly ! ) ... they are refraining from biting me because THEY DON'T WANT TO !
Best regards to all -

MANCHESTER , ENGLAND–UFC heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar is seriously ill in hospital after collapsing in Canada , UFC president Dana White said Saturday .
" He 's in rough shape , he 's in really bad shape , " White said Saturday after UFC 105 .
" He is not well and he is not getting any better .
...
He 's very , very sick and he 's going to be out for a while .
He 's got a lot of problems . "
Citing mononucleosis , the 32 - year - old Lesnar was forced to postpone a title fight against Shane Carwin scheduled for UFC 106 on Nov. 21 in Las Vegas .
The fight was pushed back to UFC 108 on Jan. 2 , but that too has been postponed .
" He 's got mono and he 's got something else wrong with him .
I know what 's wrong with him , he just does n't want me talking about it , " White said .
" He does n't have cancer or AIDS or anything like this , ( but ) he 's got some problems , man . "
White said the 6 - foot - 3 , 265 - pounder was currently in a hospital and may have to go to the Mayo Clinic or another top facility " to figure out what 's wrong with this guy . "
" He 's not going to be getting well any time soon , " he said .
A NATURAL WIN : Randy ( The Natural ) Couture eked out a close decision over Brandon ( The Truth ) Vera in a drab light - heavyweight fight at UFC 105 .
In the co-main event , English welterweight Dan ( The Outlaw ) Hardy won a decision over American Mike ( Quick ) Swick .

The strongest evidence yet that the rise in atmospheric CO 2 emissions continues to outstrip the ability of the world 's natural ' sinks ' to absorb carbon is published this week in the journal Nature Geoscience .
An international team of researchers under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project reports that over the last 50 years the average fraction of global CO 2 emissions that remained in the atmosphere each year was around 43 per cent - the rest was absorbed by the Earth 's carbon sinks on land and in the oceans .
During this time this fraction has likely increased from 40 per cent to 45 per cent , suggesting a decrease in the efficiency of the natural sinks .
The team brings evidence that the sinks are responding to climate change and variability .
The scientists report a 29 per cent increase in global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel between 2000 and 2008 ( the latest year for which figures are available ) , and that in spite of the global economic downturn emissions increased by 2 per cent during 2008 .
The use of coal as a fuel has now surpassed oil and developing countries now emit more greenhouse gases than developed countries - with a quarter of their growth in emissions accounted for by increased trade with the West .
Lead author Prof Corinne Le Quéré of the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) and the British Antarctic Survey said : " The only way to control climate change is through a drastic reduction in global CO 2 emissions .
The Earth 's carbon sinks are complex and there are some gaps in our understanding , particularly in our ability to link human - induced CO 2 emissions to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations on a year - to - year basis .
But , if we can reduce the uncertainty about the carbon sinks , our data could be used to verify the effectiveness of climate mitigations policies . "
The main findings of the study include :
CO 2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels increased by two per cent from 2007 to 2008 , by 29 per cent between 2008 and 2000 , and by 41 per cent between 2008 and 1990 - the reference year of the Kyoto Protocol .

CO 2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have increased at an average annual rate of 3.4 per cent between 2000 and 2008 , compared with one per cent per year in the 1990s .

Emissions from land use change have remained almost constant since 2000 , but now account for a significantly smaller proportion of total anthropogenic CO 2 emissions ( 20 per cent in 2000 to 12 per cent in 2008 ) .
emissions ( 20 per cent in 2000 to 12 per cent in 2008 ) .
The fraction of total CO 2 emissions remaining in the atmosphere has likely increased from 40 to 45 per cent since 1959 , models suggests this is due to the response of the natural CO 2 sinks to climate change and variability .

Emissions from coal are now the dominant fossil fuel emission source , surpassing 40 years of oil emission prevalence .
The financial crisis had a small but discernable impact on emissions growth in 2008 - with a two per cent increase compared with an average 3.6 per cent over the previous seven years .
On the basis of projected changes in GDP , emissions for 2009 are expected to fall to their 2007 levels , before increasing again in 2010 .
Emissions from emerging economies such as China and India have more than doubled since 1990 and developing countries now emit more greenhouse gases than developed countries .
A quarter of the growth in CO 2 emissions in developing countries can be accounted for by an increase in international trade of goods and services .

The researchers called for more work to be done to improve our understanding of the land and ocean COsinks , so that global action to control climate change can be independently monitored .
The sinks have a major influence on climate change and are important in understanding the link between anthropogenic COemissions and atmospheric COconcentration .
But so far scientists have not been able to calculate the COuptake of the sinks with sufficient accuracy to explain all the annual changes in atmospheric COconcentration , which hinders the scientists ' ability to monitor the effectiveness of COmitigations policies .

Update 2 Nov : Just set up a wiki to document resources about the Network Challenge at http://redballoon.wikispaces.com – feel free to join in !
You may have heard of DARPA before – they ’re the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
In 1969 , they created ARPANET , the predecessor to the Internet , and more recently , they run the DARPA Grand Challenge , which is a competition for groups to create driverless cars .
A couple of days ago , they announced the DARPA Network Challenge to mark the 40th anniversary of the Internet .
Like the Grand Challenge , it ’s a simple competition : On December 5th , ten large red weather balloons will be inflated and moored at at locations across the US .
The first individual to submit the latitude and longitude of all ten balloons will win $ 40,000 .
The purpose of the competition is to ‘ explore the role the Internet and social networking plays in the timely communication , wide area team - building and urgent mobilization required to solve broad scope , time - critical problems . ’
Without the internet , it ’d be impossible for all but the very largest organisations – the government , the military , Google , etc. – to win this competition ; but with the internet , it ’s possible for millions of people across the world to collaborate on a single goal .
The Network Challenge is not the first to test the mass problem - solving abilities of online communities ; open source projects see thousands of people work on extremely complex problems over long time scales .
Some of the tasks in Alternate Reality Games ( ARGs ) have brought these problems into the physical world ; in I Love Bees , thousands of people answered payphones across the US .
But the Network Challenge is the first to pose such a geographically - massive task in such a small timescale .
Those red balloons are n’t going to stay up forever – they ’re only going to be moored for six hours .
And while they ’ll be moored at ‘ readily accessible locations and visible from nearby roadways ’ , the continental United States has an area of 8 million square km and 6.5 million km of roadways ( 4.2 million if you ’re just counting the paved ones ) .
It ’s a deceptively simple challenge that ought to be reasonably straightforward to solve , but gets extremely difficult and time - consuming when you think things through .
Online discussions about the Network Challenge seem to think that you could win this just by following Twitter hashtags and Facebook .
Far from it .
That might do for a few balloons in cities , but not those by a desert road that no - one ever drives down ; and believe it or not , but not everyone uses Twitter – and even if someone does , that ’s no guarantee they might not keep the information to themselves for bargaining .
Given this , $ 40,000 seems like a pittance compared to the effort involved , but the small prize money is really a key point of the competition .
It ’s not supposed to cover any expenses – in fact , it ’s probably as small a sum as they could reach without getting insultingly low .
The reason for the small prize money is because DARPA are exploring the different kinds of motivation that can be brought to bear on this type of problem .
If a team treated the Network Challenge like paid work , $ 40,000 would buy very little time .
However , if it ’s treated differently – like a game , or like a citizen - science project such as GalaxyZoo – money is basically irrelevant .
And it ’s those non-monetary types of motivation that DARPA will be keen to evaluate – which works , and which do n’t ?
So , let ’s get onto the fun stuff – how do you win the DARPA Network Challenge ?
( Caveat :
This is all assuming that DARPA is going to make this hard .
If all the balloons end up in cities or by highways , it ’ll be much easier ) .
Positive Strategies
Satellite Photography
This seems like the easiest way – just get a satellite to photograph the continental US over a six hour period .
Unfortunately , there are numerous problems :
The satellites with sufficient resolution to resolve an 8ft weather balloon do not have a wide enough image swathe to cover such the US in six hours .
The very best resolution you ’ll realistically get is 1.6 ft , meaning an 8ft red balloon will take up about 19 pixels .
That ’s not bad , but that ’s only under ideal conditions , so if you ’re trying to automate the process of finding those 19 pixels with computer vision , you ’re going to get a lot of false positives ( see below ) .
Clouds , and weather in general .
It ’s expensive .
Not sure how quickly you can get the images from the satellites – it ’d need to be near real - time .
Highly susceptible to fake balloons ( see below ) .
Satellites are clearly the coolest and tech - heavy solution , but basically impractical for all but the most remote and inaccessible areas …
Aerial Photography
OK , so satellite photography is not the solution .
What about planes though ?
You can get better resolution and near real - time data .
But …
Planes do n’t move fast enough , and the image swathe is n’t big enough .
Clouds , and weather in general .
It ’s expensive .
Highly suspectible to fake balloons ( see below ) .
Having said this , I would n’t be surprised if aerial photography , like satellite photography , played a role in winning the challenge .
Crowdsourced Data
Let ’s forget about looking from above at the moment , and consider a ground - level solution .
Why not just get lots of pepole to keep an eye out for the balloons and tell you if they find one ?
This strategy is n’t susceptible to fake balloons , so that ’s a plus , at least .
4.2 million km – that ’s a hell of a lot of road .
OK , so you do n’t have to walk or drive down all of them , particularly in cities , but to have a reasonable level of confidence of finding more than a few balloons , you ’re talking about tens of thousands of hours of driving .
So you might be able to drum up a few thousand people to drive down specific roads on a Saturday , but they can only cover a fraction of the area required .
So there ’s a big publicity and marketing challenge here – say you make some iPhone app or SMS number for people to report sightings ; how do you get sufficient numbers of people ( e.g. tens of thousands ) to use yours ?
Because it certainly wo n’t be the only one out there .
Very noisy data – expect thousands of false sightings
Let ’s face it – you ’re going to have to use crowdsourced data whether you like it or not .
And you ’re going to be in for a world of pain …
Negative Strategies ( aka 4CHAN )
Winning the Network Challenge is n’t just about finding those ten balloons – you need to find them first .
To do that , you can either do the job really quickly , or slow everyone else down .
A nice way of doing this is through generating false positives :
Identical red weather balloons :
These will fool everyone and cause a lot of grief ; unfortunately , they ’re comparatively expensive , and you ’ll have to impersonate a DARPA representative .
Red circles :
Make a 2D red circle with an 8ft diameter and put it on the ground ; it ’ll look pretty similar to a red balloon from above .
You could even paint it with a shadow to annoy sat and aerial photography users even more .
False reports :
Want to mess up a crowdsourced strategy ?
Send in false data !
For bonus points , get your friends to corroborate your false reports with photoshopped photos and so on .
Destroying balloons :
If you find a balloon , make a note of its location , and destroy it .
Do n’t let those DARPA nerds stop you – just use an airgun !
I predict a veritable firehose of false positives being entered into the Network Challenge ; it ’s just too easy and too fun to put up fake balloons and send in false reports .
How to Win
Realistically , if you ’re serious , you ’re going to use a combination of these strategies .
If I lived in the US and had more spare time , here ’s what I ’d do :
Use satellite and aerial photography for remote and inaccessible regions , then use people + machines to spot the balloons .
For most areas , use crowdsourced sightings by creating an application that integrates sightings via every and any communications medium available ; voice , SMS , MMS , email , Twitter , IM , etc .
When you get a sighting , get other people to corroborate it from different angles .
Have an algorithm that assigns a reliability value to each location based on the incoming information .
Recognise useful contributors and make stars out of hard - working reliable ones .
Use points , and turn it into a game .
Give people a reason to be involved .
Finding ten weather balloons is not cool enough , and $ 40,000 does n’t go very far .
Give the prize to charity , or make the challenge part of a story .
Make people care .
Do n’t mess about too much with putting up fake balloons – it ’s a waste of time .
You ’d be better off refining your algorithms and getting more contributors .
Do n’t try and restrict your contributor base ; to win , you need scale .
This means a lot of false data , but you ’d get it anyway .
This all sounds very hard , but there ’s one good piece of news – the required accuracy is only one arc minute , which is about 1.86 km ; a pretty big area , all things considered .
You do n’t need people with GPS devices to report , you could do fairly well with just a street name .
Unanswered Questions and Wildcards
It ’s not clear how many times you ’re allowed to submit entries on the site .
If you had a list of , say , 30 sightings you were reasonably confident in , could you just send a few hundred thousand entries to cover all possible combinations of the ten real balloons ?
Will there a spam cut - off limit , so you can only submit one entry a second ?
What if someone performs a DDOS attack on the Network Challenge website to prevent other people from entering ?
( OK , it ’s DARPA so you ’d think they ’d be ready for this , but still … )
Will people unaware of the challenge report balloons anyway ?
If so , the challenge becomes rather easier .
Will a rich person or organisation ( e.g. Google ) throw money or time at the problem , for the kudos ?
If this happens , it wo n’t be as boring as it seems , since I ’d be impressed with any organisation nimble enough to shift resources to a problem like this within a mere few weeks .
Will anyone try a social engineering attack against DARPA to steal the location data ?
When we ran our Perplex City treasure hunt , with a $ 200,000 prize , we were paranoid about being followed .
While the Network Challenge is less money , it ’s arguably more kudos .
Is DARPA going to make this easy , or hard ?
( see below )
My Prediction
The Network Challenge will either be solved reasonably quickly , or not at all , and I think it ’ll come down to the amount of false positives being entered into the system .
Any balloons in or near metropolitan areas will get sighted very rapidly , but others will be very tricky to find .
Teams will require scale in order to win – tens or hundreds of thousands of ‘ players ’ , all feeding in data ; unfortunately , the most visible team will be the most tempting target for griefers , and they ’ll have to deal with a lot of crap , so with the balloons only being up for six hours , it ’s not clear whether they ’ll be able to corroborate sightings in time .
If individual teams can’t , teams will eventually end up pooling their data in an attempt to weed out false positives .
That could take time , but if you ’re allowed to send in unlimited entries , maybe this wo n’t be so bad .
Personally , I welcome the false sightings and griefing ; it might be annoying , but that ’s life , and if you can beat them , the victory will be much sweeter !
It ’s really up to DARPA as to how difficult they make this challenge .
If they put most of the balloons near cities and highways , the challenge will be solved within hours .
If they ’re placed randomly , it ’ll be very hard .
Very possibly they ’ll make it easy to start with this year , and then ratchet up the difficulty , which is sensible ( but personally quite disappointing ) .
Final Thoughts
The Network Challenge is brilliant – it ’s the sort of hard - to - solve but easy - to - describe challenge requiring strategy and mass co-ordination that is catnip to someone like me .
It also represents the future of work , and demonstrates type of skills that will be most valuable in the future – in that sense , it reminds me of Vernor Vinge ’s Rainbows End .
Also , the great thing about the Network Challenge is that it costs DARPA very little to run ; you ’ve got a website and ten weather balloons .
If someone does win , $ 40 k is a small price to pay for witnessing such an original type of problem - solving ; and if no - one wins , then they do n’t have to pay up .
What about a UK version ?
While people of any nationality can enter the Network Challenge , and much of the work will be done online , it ’s very much a US - centric task .
Happily , if you are interested in this sort of thing , I ’ve been planning a similar sort of challenge with Philip Trippenbach .
It ’ll be much easier , but no less challenging and fun , and it ’ll happen in London before Christmas ; you ’ll also be able to follow and participate online .

Google posed a unique problem for the censors :
Because the company had no office at the time inside the country , the Chinese government had no legal authority over it -- no ability to demand that Google voluntarily withhold its search results from Chinese users .
And the firewall only half - worked in Google 's case : it could block sites that Google pointed to , but in some cases it would let slip through a list of search results that included banned sites .
So if you were in Shanghai and you searched for " human rights in China " on google.com , you would get a list of search results that included Human Rights in China ( hrichina.org ) , a New York - based organization whose Web site is banned by the Chinese government .
But if you tried to follow the link to hrichina.org , you would get nothing but an error message ; the firewall would block the page .
You could see that the banned sites existed , in other words , but you could n't reach them .
Government officials did n't like this situation -- Chinese citizens were receiving constant reminders that their leaders felt threatened by certain subjects -- but Google was popular enough that they were reluctant to block it entirely .
In 2002 , though , something changed , and the Chinese government decided to shut down all access to Google .
Why ?
Theories abound .
Sergey Brin , the co-founder of Google , whose responsibilities include government relations , told me that he suspects the block might have been at the instigation of a competitor -- one of its Chinese rivals .
Brin is too diplomatic to accuse anyone by name , but various American Internet executives told me they believe that Baidu has at times benefited from covert government intervention .
A young Chinese - American entrepreneur in Beijing told me that she had heard that the instigator of the Google blockade was Baidu , which in 2002 had less than 3 percent of the search market compared with Google 's 24 percent .
" Basically , some Baidu people sat down and did hundreds of searches for banned materials on Google , " she said .
( Like many Internet businesspeople I spoke with in China , she asked to remain anonymous , fearing retribution from the authorities . )
" Then they took all the results , printed them up and went to the government and said , ' Look at all this bad stuff you can find on Google ! '
That 's why the government took Google offline . "
Baidu strongly denies the charge , and when I spoke to Guo Liang , a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing , he dismissed the idea and argued that Baidu is simply a stronger competitor than Google , with a better grasp of Chinese desires .
Still , many Beijing high - tech insiders told me that it is common for domestic Internet firms to complain to the government about the illicit content of competitors , in the hope that their rivals will suffer the consequences .
In China , the censorship regime is not only a political tool ; it is also a competitive one -- a cudgel that private firms use to beat one another with .
Self - Discipline Awards
When I visited a dingy Internet cafe one November evening in Beijing , its 120 or so cubicles were crammed with teenagers .
( Because computers and home Internet connections are so expensive , many of China 's mostly young Internet users go online in these cafes , which charge mere pennies per hour and provide fast broadband -- and cold soft drinks . )
Everyone in the cafe looked to be settled in for a long evening of lightweight entertainment : young girls in pink and yellow Hello Kitty sweaters juggled multiple chat sessions , while upstairs a gang of young Chinese soldiers in olive - drab coats laughed as they crossed swords in the medieval fantasy game World of Warcraft .
On one wall , next to a faded kung - fu movie poster , was a yellow sign that said , in Chinese characters , " Do not go to pornographic or illegal Web sites . "
The warning seemed almost beside the point ; nobody here looked even remotely likely to be hunting for banned Tiananmen Square retrospectives .
I asked the cafe manager , a man with huge aviator glasses and graying hair , how often his clients try to view illegal content .
Not often , he said with a chuckle , and when they do , it 's usually pornography .
He said he figured it was the government 's job to keep banned materials inaccessible .
" If it 's not supposed to be seen , " he said , " it 's not supposed to be seen . "
One mistake Westerners frequently make about China is to assume that the government is furtive about its censorship .
On the contrary , the party is quite matter of fact about it -- proud , even .
One American businessman who would speak only anonymously told me the story of attending an award ceremony last year held by the Internet Society of China for Internet firms , including the major Internet service providers .
" I 'm sitting there in the audience for this thing , " he recounted , " and they say , ' And now it 's time to award our annual Self - Discipline Awards ! '
And they gave 10 companies an award .
They gave them a plaque .
They shook hands .
The minister was there ; he took his picture with each guy .
It was basically like Excellence in Self - Censorship -- and everybody in the audience is , like , clapping . "
Internet censorship in China , this businessman explained , is presented as a benevolent police function .
In January , the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau created two cuddly little anime - style cartoon " Internet Police " mascots named " Jingjing " and " Chacha " ; each cybercop has a blog and a chat window where Chinese citizens can talk to them .
As a Shenzhen official candidly told The Beijing Youth Daily , " The main function of Jingjing and Chacha is to intimidate . "
The article went on to explain that the characters are there " to publicly remind all Netizens to be conscious of safe and healthy use of the Internet , self - regulate their online behavior and maintain harmonious Internet order together . "
Intimidation and " self - regulation " are , in fact , critical to how the party communicates its censorship rules to private - sector Internet companies .
To be permitted to offer Internet services , a private company must sign a license agreeing not to circulate content on certain subjects , including material that " damages the honor or interests of the state " or " disturbs the public order or destroys public stability " or even " infringes upon national customs and habits . "
One prohibition specifically targets " evil cults or superstition , " a clear reference to Falun Gong .
But the language is , for the most part , intentionally vague .
It leaves wide discretion for any minor official in China 's dozens of regulatory agencies to demand that something he finds offensive be taken offline .
Government officials from the State Council Information Office convene weekly meetings with executives from the largest Internet service companies -- particularly major portals that run news stories and host blogs and discussion boards -- to discuss what new topics are likely to emerge that week that the party would prefer be censored .
" It 's known informally as the ' wind - blowing meeting ' -- in other words , which way is the wind blowing , " the American businessman told me .
The government officials provide warnings for the days ahead , he explained .
" They say : ' There 's this party conference going on this week .
There are some foreign dignitaries here on this trip . ' "
American Internet firms typically arrive in China expecting the government to hand them an official blacklist of sites and words they must censor .
They quickly discover that no master list exists .
Instead , the government simply insists the firms interpret the vague regulations themselves .
The companies must do a sort of political mind reading and intuit in advance what the government wo n't like .
Last year , a list circulated online purporting to be a blacklist of words the government gives to Chinese blogging firms , including " democracy " and " human rights . "
In reality , the list had been cobbled together by a young executive at a Chinese blog company .
Every time he received a request to take down a posting , he noted which phrase the government had objected to , and after a while he developed his own list simply to help his company avoid future hassles .
