After trying to make one of those super - rad IR camera blockers as seen here and here , I can only say that I am left disappointed .
A couple of weeks ago I took an over - sized thug hoodie , decked out the outer rim of the hood with 8 ultra - bright IR LEDs and pointed a camera at it .
If someone were to be observing me on a security camera I would have looked like a walking Christmas tree .
The lights did not do a darned thing other than make me look mildly - silly .
Although , thanks to the fact I was wearing an over - sized hood , part of my face was obscured from the camera ( but I did n’t need IR LEDs for that ) .
Anyhow , from this initial experiment I got the impression that there is no way this could work under any circumstances , but I decided to give this theory the benefit of the doubt .
There are two models online .
The first model was made by URA / FILOART and has a ring of 12 super - bright IR LEDs centered on the forehead and being powered by 12vdc .
The other model posted online on Instructables had 8 LEDs staggered across the front of a baseball cap .
These LEDs are being powered by a 9vdc battery with no resistor .
This , from the get - go , seemed kinda fishy .
Being that the baseball cap was bound to fail for the same reason my hoodie had failed ( the LEDs being to far spaced out and at different viewing angles ) , I resolved to centralize all of the LEDs on the center of my forehead like URA / FILOART had done with their headband .
Next , to alleviate doubt and the obvious playa - hating that is gonna arise from my claims here , I purchased from the Electronic Goldmine at least 9 of just about every IR LED they sold .
I ended up with 5 different promising IR LEDs ( those being Part # G14670 , G2318 , G13661 , G2158 and G14587 ) .
I placed eight of each LED on a breadboard and powered them first with 5v and then with 12v ( with a 220 ohm resistor ) .
I took photographs ( using a camera modified to view near IR light ) of each test .
In addition , for the 12 v trial , I placed the breadboard on the center of my head and took a video from an arm ’s length .
I took the video dead on for a few moments and then would move the camera to view my side profile .
I could have just given up there since , but I wanted to thoroughly test this before I called “ FAKE !!!! ”
So , I took the brightest LEDs in my arsenal , added another 4 to the breadboard to match URA / FILOART and powering them at 12 v , tried it again at an arm ’s length .
It was slightly better from the front , but as soon as I moved the camera to my side - profile , there I was clear as day .
What I found was that I could see myself in every single attempt at every angle .
It then dawned upon me that perhaps the results at 3 feet were not the same results I would get at 10 .
So , I moved the camera back 10 feet and using the most promising of the LEDs ( G2318 ) , I tested it again .
From that distance I found the results to be more or less disappointing .
My head was not a halo of light .
It just looked like I was wearing a headlamp .
The other thing I had to take into consideration was that perhaps the security cameras they were using were of a lower resolution than my 3 megapixel camera ( even in 640 x 480 video mode ) .
This point is almost not worth exploring since as soon as you turn your head , you become clearly visible , but , even so , I have tested it using the security cam in the hallway at work at about 20 paces and still no noticeable difference .
Lastly , I remembered a prior discussion with Dan and he was of the impression that if you pointed the LEDs at your face , you may be able to illuminate it out of existence .
I felt pointing that many high - intensity IR LEDs directly at my face was a bad idea , but I closed my eyes and gave it a shot .
No noticeable difference .
The results from my tests have led me to conclude the following :
1 ) Even if you can hypothetically block cameras with IR LEDs you could only do it so long as the LEDs are pointed directly in the direction of the camera .
LEDs ( and IR LEDs in particular ) have a limited viewing angle that does not correspond the 360 degree aspect ratio of the average person .
2 ) The existing results on the internet may either be digitally altered to make it seem to work better than it does or were photographed in a very opportunistic manner in the brief instance in which it may have been working ( aKaMaKaVeLy on Instructables never shows actual video of their hat in use .
There is just two quick and highly suspect snapshots ) .
3 ) Probably with around 20 high - powered LEDs located in about 5 positions around the front of your head , you might be able to pull this off .
At that point , you will be so conspicuous , why bother ?
4 ) New media artists and metacafe panderers cannot be trusted with your privacy .
5 ) You cannot sufficiently block cameras with 12 high - powered IR LEDs .
End of story .
( If anyone feels like proving me wrong with replicable results , be my guest . )

Image : Bernard Turkewitz *
One of the indelible memories for anyone living through the 1960s was watching CBS newsman Walter Cronkite anchor another televised liftoff from Cape Canaveral , Florida .
Throughout the decade , from Alan Shepard through Neil Armstrong , Cronkite made it clear to his audience that they were taking part in something momentous , something that not only represented the flowering of a great technological achievement but stirred the human soul as well .
This week , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration observes the 50th anniversary of its creation .
And make no mistake :
There 's a lot to celebrate .
NASA 's achievements write a glorious chapter in human history , one that 's nearly impossible to overstate .
Is it fair to call NASA the greatest scientific and exploratory agency ever created ?
It is .
Americans used to appreciate this .
Rare was the school in the early ' 60s that did n't stop the day 's activities so student and teacher alike could gather in front of a grainy , often wavy , black - and - white picture of an Atlas booster rising heavenward from the smoke and fire , while Uncle Walter , live from the Cape , told us what it all meant .
It meant a lot .
The U.S. space program was a cultural touchstone as much as a scientific or political one .
Astronauts were heroes , as revered as any ballplayer or movie star of the time .
You 'd have to be living in a cave not to know what NASA was , and byproducts of the space program touched almost every corner of American life .
It cost the United States about $ 40 billion to get to the moon .
Even at twice the cost , that 's chump change .
The human race has been repaid many times over for that investment , as it has for many other NASA projects .
So much of what we take for granted today is either directly or indirectly a byproduct of what used to be called space - age technology .
Medicine , the military , communications , miniaturization , computerization – all have benefited because of NASA 's work .
The space program also helped to fire an interest in the sciences generally , with all the obvious benefits that accrue to that .
And if you believe that reaching for the stars represents a triumph of the human spirit , then those who dedicate their lives to it – from NASA 's astronauts to the Soviet / Russian cosmonauts to all the other spacefarers who have taken up the challenge – only carry us forward .
And to think it all started , more or less , with the terrifying appearance of a shiny ball measuring a mere 22 inches across .
Sputnik Started It All
The Russian launch of the 22 - inch , 184 - pound Sputnik satellite kicked the Space Age — and the American space program — into high gear .

It was Oct. 4 , 1957 when the Soviet news agency Tass announced to a stunned world that the Soviet Union had successfully placed Elementary Satellite 1 , aka " Sputnik , " into an elliptical orbit 900 kilometers above the Cold War - wracked planet .
The aluminum sphere was the first man-made object to orbit the Earth , and its celestial presence electrified the world and kicked the Space Age into high gear , leading in short order to the formation of NASA .
American scientists were already in a close race with the Russians to launch the first orbiting satellite .
But the Americans ' Vanguard program , run by the Naval Research Laboratory , was beset by cost overruns and delays .
Getting beat by the Russians was a tremendous blow .
The pressure intensified with the successful Russian launch , less than a month later , of the much heavier Sputnik 2 ( with the dog Laika aboard ) .
The sting of that was only somewhat mitigated by the Army 's successful launch and orbiting of Explorer 1 on Jan. 31 , 1958 .
It was clear that the United States was losing ground and that its space effort needed a major reorganization .
The first step was to reinvigorate the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics , or NACA , a rather geeky and elitist civilian panel that had been around since 1915 .
As NACA 's charter grew , the decision was made to expand it into a full - fledged government agency .
On July 29 , 1958 , President Eisenhower signed legislation creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration .
NASA was born .
Space Pioneers
Astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space with a brief suborbital flight in 1961 .
Photo : NASA NASA officially became a functioning entity on Oct. 1 , 1958 , with T. Keith Glennan as its first administrator .
There were 8,000 employees , inherited from NACA ; three research laboratories – Langley Aeronautical Laboratory , Ames Aeronautical Laboratory and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory – and an annual budget of $ 100 million .
The agency 's mission statement will have faint echoes for Star Trek fans : " To improve life here , to extend life there , to find life beyond . "
The U.S. and Soviet space programs dueled throughout the decade , launching various satellites ( military , communications , environmental ) and sending their men ( and eventually , women ) on increasingly ambitious missions .
The Russians were first to hit the moon with a man-made object ( 1959 ) , first to orbit the moon and photograph its far side ( 1959 ) , first to send a man into space ( Yuri Gagarin , in 1961 ) , first to send a woman into space ( Valentina Tereshkova , in 1963 ) , first to have a cosmonaut go EVA , or leave an orbiting spacecraft ( Alexei Leonov , in 1965 ) , first to land a probe on the moon and transmit data back to Earth ( 1966 ) , the first to place a manned space station into orbit ( 1971 ) .
NASA , though , was no laggard , posting a series of successes throughout the 1960s and eventually overtaking the Russians .
The ultimate goal was straightforward , if not simple : Beat the Russians and be first to put a man on the moon .
A manned space program required astronauts , so NASA immediately began screening military and civilian test pilots for suitable candidates .
Seven were chosen , and because the project was named Mercury , they became known as the " Mercury Seven " : Scott Carpenter , L. Gordon Cooper Jr. , John Glenn Jr. , Gus Grissom , Walter Schirra Jr. , Alan Shepard Jr. and Deke Slayton .
A project of that scope also required massive public support , and NASA cannily touted the Mercury Seven as the mascots of the fledgling space program , turning them into national heroes and rallying the populace behind the agency 's lofty goals .
Twenty - three days after Gagarin 's historic , 108 - minute flight , Alan Shepard became the first American into space .
It was a quick up - and - back , suborbital affair aboard Freedom 7 .
Eleven months later , on Feb. 20 , 1962 , John Glenn completed three orbits aboard Friendship 7 and the space race was officially tied again .
Project Mercury ran its course .
It was replaced by Project Gemini in 1965 , an intermediate program designed to pave the way for Project Apollo and the final assault on the moon .
To the Moon
Apollo 11 's Neil Armstrong snapped this photo of Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the moon , just eight years after NASA 's first manned , suborbital spaceflight .
Photo : NASA Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to enter lunar orbit , circling the moon 10 times before heading home .
Apollo 10 amounted to a full dress rehearsal for the actual landing , orbiting the moon 31 times and coming within 50,000 tantalizing feet of the lunar surface .
NASA 's supreme moment arrived on July 20 , 1969 .
With the entire world watching – no exaggeration – Apollo 11's lunar lander , Eagle , touched down on the powdery surface of the Sea of Tranquility at 4:18 p.m. EDT .
The first words spoken from the lunar surface was a simple acknowledgement to mission control : " Houston , Tranquility Base here .
The Eagle has landed . "
Six - and - a- half hours later , astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon .
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent two - and - half hours on the lunar surface , planting the American flag , placing a plaque ( " Here Men From the Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon . July 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace for All Mankind . " ) , collecting soil samples and setting up scientific instruments .
Astronauts returned to the moon on subsequent Apollo flights to collect additional mineral samples , play a little golf and conduct a slew of scientific experiments .
NASA narrowly averted disaster in April 1970 with Apollo 13 , when an oxygen tank ruptured onboard .
The mission became a harrowing rescue drama that in some ways was NASA 's finest hour .
The three - man crew – James Lovell , John Swigert and Fred Haise Jr. – abandoned their crippled , oxygen - starved command module and crammed themselves into the lunar lander for an attempted return to Earth .
Working with flight controllers on the ground , they swung around the moon , using the lunar gravity to propel them toward Earth .
Three days after the explosion , they splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean .
Although there were five more Apollo missions to come , NASA was already turning its attention to the exploration of deep space , the deployment of an orbiting space station and the development of a reusable craft that it called the space shuttle .
And the race was not without its tragic setbacks .
In January 1967 , Gus Grissom , one of the original seven Mercury astronauts , was killed along with two crewmates , Ed White and Roger Chaffee , when their Apollo 1 training capsule caught fire during a test at Cape Canaveral .
They were the first fatalities for NASA and the U.S. space program .
Even as they paused to mourn and bury their dead , NASA 's engineers and astronauts forged ahead .
Beyond Apollo

On March 2 , 1972 , NASA launched Pioneer 10 , which became the first satellite to pass through the asteroid belt and return close - up images of Jupiter .
From there , it sailed on out of the solar system and into deep space , where it continued sending signals until contact was finally lost on Jan. 22 , 2003 .
NASA launched two more deep - space probes in 1977 , Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 .
Together , the two spacecraft have visited more planets , asteroids , rings and moons , and traveled farther than any other spacecraft .
Voyager 1 is now further from Earth than any man-made object .
Closer to Earth , NASA began to " extend life there " by launching its first space station , Skylab , in 1973 .
Americans were now able to spend extended periods in space , which , among other things , led to more sophisticated studies on the effects of prolonged weightlessness on the human body .
As the cold war thawed , U.S. and Soviet space programs began moving toward a spirit of cooperation , which culminated in the Apollo - Soyuz test project in 1975 .
The crews performed a few joint scientific experiments , but the real value of this mission was to help the easing of tensions back on Earth , advancing NASA 's mission to " improve life here . "
It also paved the way for future joint U.S. - Russian efforts , like the Shuttle - Mir program .
The centerpiece of NASA 's post - Apollo years has been the space shuttle .
Designed to carry large payloads in low Earth orbit , the shuttle is the first truly reusable orbital spacecraft .
Six shuttles have been built .
Five of them – Columbia , Challenger , Discovery , Atlantis and Endeavour – were fully operational .
The prototype , Enterprise , was not built to fly in space .
Its versatility and durability has made the shuttle NASA 's workhorse since STS - 1 , Columbia 's maiden flight in 1981 .
Shuttles have been used to deploy and recover satellites , to deliver payloads and crews to various space stations , to conduct experiments in the weightlessness of space , and to dispatch crews to repair other space vehicles .
In 1990 , it was Discovery that deployed another resounding NASA success , the Hubble Space Telescope .
To date there have been 121 shuttle missions .
Of those , 119 have ended successfully .
The two that did n't remain burned into the national consciousness .
The Challenger and Columbia disasters , which cost the lives of 14 astronauts , have dogged the shuttle program since 1986 , delaying missions while NASA undertook painstaking investigations .
Recent shuttle missions have centered on keeping the Hubble telescope functioning and ferrying additional components to the International Space Station , a multinational endeavor that has helped NASA strengthen its ties with other national space programs .
Now the shuttle is nearing the end of its operational life .
NASA plans to retire the orbiter following STS - 133 , scheduled for 2010 .
A new orbiter , Orion , is expected to deploy in the middle of the next decade .
Meanwhile , NASA is currently lavishing a lot of attention on our nearest planetary neighbor , Mars .
Although NASA rovers have pretty well discounted the possibility of the existence of little green men , the red planet 's geological history is being intensely studied .
NASA 's recent declaration that water ice is present on Mars holds out the hope that some form of life did , or does , exist .
The Next 50 Years

Challenges lie ahead as NASA moves into its second half - century .
Funding remains a chronic problem , especially in the age of the shrinking government purse .
NASA , like other agencies , has to fight for its place at the budget trough .
Public perception has also changed over the years .
A new generation , one that has grown up taking space flight for granted , does n't understand why the seemingly routine should be so costly .
What they fail to realize , perhaps , is that none of this is routine , and never will be .
Maybe this glib miscalculation is also what spurs on that new breed of space explorer , the private entrepreneur .
The idea that a few wealthy space enthusiasts could somehow supplant NASA and come anywhere near matching its achievements – ever – is laughable , or would be if it were n't given so much credence in certain corners of the popular consciousness .
Not to belittle the accomplishment , of course , but getting a pilot to the edge of space in an experimental aircraft is so ... 1956 .
Laughable or not , however , NASA is watching this new generation of space entrepreneurs .
That much is clear .
And as the first decade of the 21st century comes to a close , NASA can look back on a half century of real achievement .
There have been failures and disappointments , but considering the size of the omelet it was inevitable that a few eggs would get broken along the way .
Nobody understood that better than the 17 astronauts who lost their lives in service .
By any measuring stick , the American space program , kick - started by a tiny Russian satellite in 1957 , stands as both a towering scientific success and a triumph of the human spirit .
We are privileged to be along for the ride .

How NASA Screwed Up ( And Four Ways to Fix It )
A team of MIT students walked away from their spring - semester course with a lot more than just an A and six credits :
They just won a $ 275,000 top prize from Google for the application they developed for the company 's new open - source Android cell - phone system .
The application , called " Locale , " lets a cell phone automatically adjust its settings according to the location it's in — for example , silencing the ringer when it detects that it's at the office or in a lecture hall .
Video : EECSLocale was developed by students in a class called " Building mobile applications with Android , " ( 6.087 ) , taught by Hal Abelson , the Class of 1922 Professor of Computer Science and Engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
The class is being offered again this fall , but this time is extending to two other cell - phone systems in addition to Google 's Android : Nokia and Windows Mobile .
Engineers from Google , Nokia and Microsoft will also work with students in the class to help them develop their concepts .
One of the important aspects of this hands - on class , Abelson says , is " to give the students the experience of working with really experienced professionals " as they refine their applications .
Professor Alex ( Sandy ) Pentland of the Media Lab and Eric Klopfer of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning will be co-teaching the class with Abelson .
Andrew
Yu of MIT 's IS&T will also be working with the teams .
Two of the students who developed Locale , Carter Jernigan and Jasper Lin , graduated this June with degrees in computer science and are now working as software engineers .
Christina Wright is also a recent graduate in computer science .
And Clare Bayley is a junior , majoring in computer science .
Jennifer
Shu , a recent MIT graduate in computer science who works as a software engineer , was added to the team to help them perfect the product .
The team 's application was one of 10 Google selected for the top prizes on Aug. 29 , out of 50 finalists that were chosen from hundreds of entries .
In addition to the cash prize , each of the winning applications will now be included with every new Android phone .
The first such phones are expected to be released before the end of the year .
Ten other teams won $ 100,000 each .

“ Logic demands that there be a link between the stated purpose and the command . ” ( 4 )
“ But apart from that clarifying function , a prefatory clause does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause . ” ( 4 )
“ But where the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not have operative effect . . . a court has no license to make it do what it was not designed to do . ” ( 4 )
“ Nowhere else in the Constitution does a " right ’ attributed to " the people ’ refer to anything other than an individual right . ” ( 6 )
“ " [ T ] he people , ’ refers to all members of the political community , not an unspecified subset . ” ( 6 )
“ We start therefore with a strong presumption that the Second Amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans . ” ( 7 )
“ [ T ] he most natural reading of " keep Arms ’ in the Second Amendment is to " have weapons . ' ” ( 8 )
“ The term was applied , then as now , to weapons that were not specifically designed for military use and were not employed in a military capacity . ” ( 8 )
“ [ T ] here are a few examples , all of which favor viewing the right to " keep Arms ’ as an individual right unconnected with militia service … ’ Keep arms ’ was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms , for militiamen and everyone else . ” ( 9 ) ( emphasis in original )
“ At the time of the founding , as now , to " bear ’ meant to " carry . ’. . .
When used with " arms , ’ however , the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for a particular purpose – confrontation . ” ( 10 )
“ Although the phrase implies that the carrying of the weapon is for the purpose of " offensive or defensive action , ’ it in no way connotes participation in a structured military organization . ( 11 )
“ Worse still , the phrase " keep and bear Arms ’ would be incoherent .
The word " Arms ’ would have two different meanings at once : " weapons ’ ( as the object of " keep ’ ) and ( as the object of " bear ’ ) one - half of an idiom .
It would be rather like saying " He filled and kicked the bucket ’ to mean " He filled the bucket and died . ’
Grotesque . ” ( 13 )
“ [ I ] f " bear arms ’ means , as the petitioners and the dissent think , the carrying of arms only for military purposes , one simply cannot add " for the purpose of killing game . ’
The right " to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game ’ is worthy of the mad hatter . ( 15 )
“ Putting all of these textual elements together , we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation . ” ( 19 )
“ Thus , we do not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation , just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for any purpose . ” ( 22 ) ( italics in original )
“ There seems to us no doubt , on the basis of both text and history , that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms .
Of course the right was not unlimited , just as the First Amendment ’s right of free speech was not [ . ] ” ( 22 )
“ It is true that the term " State ’ elsewhere in the Constitution refers to individual States , but the phrase " security of a free state ’ and close variations seem to have been terms of art in 18th - century political discourse , meaning a " free country ’ or free polity . ” ( 24 )
“ That history showed that the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able - bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people ’s arms , enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents . . .
During the 1788 ratification debates , the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in Anti-federalist rhetoric . ” ( 25 )
“ The prefatory clause does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason Americans valued the ancient right ; most undoubtedly thought it even more important for self - defense and hunting . ” ( 26 )
“ Our interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed adoption of the Second Amendment . ” ( 27 )
“ It is dubious to rely on [ the drafting ] history to interpret a text that was widely understood to codify a pre-existing right , rather than to fashion a new one . ” ( 30 )
“ " Legislative history , ’ of course , refers to the pre-enactment statements of those who drafted or voted for a law ; it is considered persuasive by some , not because they reflect the general understanding of the disputed terms , but because the legislators who heard or read those statements presumably voted with that understanding .
" Postenactment legislative history , ” a deprecatory contradiction in terms , refers to statements of those who drafted or voted for the law that are made after its enactment and hence could have had no effect on the congressional vote . ” ( 32 )
“ As we will show , virtually all interpreters of the Second Amendment in the century after its enactment interpreted the amendment as we do . ” ( 32 )
“ We have found only one early 19th - century commentator who clearly conditioned the right to keep and bear arms upon service in the militia – and he recognized that the prevailing view was to the contrary . ” ( 37 )
“ The 19th - century cases that interpreted the Second Amendment universally support an individual right unconnected to militia service . ” ( 37 )
“ Blacks were routinely disarmed by Southern States after the Civil War .
Those who opposed these injustices frequently stated that they infringed blacks ’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms .
Needless to say , the claim was not that blacks were being prohibited from carrying arms in an organized state militia . ” ( 42 )
“ Every late - 19th - century legal scholar that we have read interpreted the Second Amendment to secure an individual right unconnected with militia service . ” ( 44 )
“ It was plainly the understanding in the post - Civil War Congress that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to use arms for self - defense . ” ( 44 )
On the question of the Second Amendment ’s application to the States : “ With respect to Cruikshank ’s continuing validity on incorporation , a question not presented by this case , we note that Cruikshank also said that the First Amendment did not apply against the States and did not engage in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our later cases .
Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois , 116 U. S. 252 , 265 ( 1886 ) and Miller v. Texas , 153 U. S. 535 , 538 ( 1894 ) , reaffirmed that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government . ” ( 48 , footnote 23 )
“ And what is , according to JUSTICE STEVENS , the holding of Miller that demands such obeisance ?
That the Second Amendment " protects the right to keep and bear arms for certain military purposes , but that it does not curtail the legislature ’s power to regulate the nonmilitary use and ownership of weapons . ”
Nothing so clearly demonstrates the weakness of JUSTICE STEVENS ’ case .
Miller did not hold that and cannot possibly be read to have held that . ” ( 49 )
“ Miller stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right , whatever its nature , extends only to certain types of weapons . ” ( 50 )
“ Read in isolation , Miller ’s phrase " part of ordinary military equipment ’ could mean that only those weapons useful in warfare are protected .
That would be a startling reading of the opinion , since it would mean that the National Firearms
Act ’s restrictions on machineguns ( not challenged in Miller ) might be unconstitutional , machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939 . ” ( 52 )
“ We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law - abiding citizens for lawful purposes , such as short - barreled shotguns . ” ( 53 )
“ It should be unsurprising that such a significant matter has been for so long judicially unresolved .
For most of our history , the Bill of Rights was not thought applicable to the States , and the Federal Government did not significantly regulate the possession of firearms by law - abiding citizens .
Other provisions of the Bill of Rights have similarly remained unilluminated for lengthy periods .
This Court first held a law to violate the First Amendment ’s guarantee of freedom of speech in 1931 , almost 150 years after the Amendment was ratified , see Near v. Minnesota ex rel .
Olson , 283 U. S. 697 ( 1931 ) , and it was not until after World War II that we held a law invalid under the Establishment Clause , see Illinois ex rel .
McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist . No. 71 , ChampaignCty. , 333 U. S. 203 ( 1948 ) . ” ( 53 - 54 )
“ Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment , nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . ” ( 54 )
“ We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms .
Miller said , as we have explained , that the sorts of weapons protected were those " in common use at the time . ’ 307 U. S. , at 179 .
We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of “ dangerous and unusual weapons . ” ( 55 )
“ It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service – M - 16 rifles and the like – may be banned , then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause .
But as we have said , the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment ’s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service , who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty . ” ( 55 )
“ The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of " arms ’ that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose .
The prohibition extends , moreover , to the home , where the need for defense of self , family , and property is most acute .
Under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights , banning from the home " the most preferred firearm in the nation to " keep ’ and use for protection of one ’s home and family , ’ would fail constitutional muster . ” ( 56 - 57 )
“ It is no answer to say , as petitioners do , that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms ( i.e. , long guns ) is allowed .
It is enough to note , as we have observed , that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self - defense weapon . ” ( 57 )
“ Whatever the reason , handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self - defense in the home , and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid . ” ( 57 - 58 )
“ The District argues that we should interpret this element of the statute to contain an exception for self - defense .
But we think that is precluded by the unequivocal text , and by the presence of certain other enumerated exceptions . ” ( 58 )
“ Respondent conceded at oral argument that he does not " have a problem with . . . licensing ’ and that the District ’s law is permissible so long as it is " not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner . ’
We therefore assume that petitioners ’ issuance of a license will satisfy respondent ’s prayer for relief and do not address the licensing requirement . ” ( 59 )
“ We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding " interest - balancing ’ approach .
The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government – even the Third Branch of Government – the power to decide on a case - by - case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon .
A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges ’ assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all .
Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them , whether or not future legislatures or ( yes ) even future judges think that scope too broad .
We would not apply an “ interest - balancing ” approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo -Nazi march through Skokie .
See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie , 432 U. S. 43 ( 1977 ) ( per curiam ) .
The First Amendment contains the freedom - of - speech guarantee that the people ratified , which included exceptions for obscenity , libel , and disclosure of state secrets , but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong - headed views .
The Second Amendment is no different .
Like the First , it is the very product of an interest - balancing by the people - which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew .
And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation , it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law - abiding , responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home . ” ( 62-63 )
“ In sum , we hold that the District ’s ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment , as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self - defense .
Assuming that Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights , the District must permit him to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home . ” ( 64 )
“ Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation , where well - trained police forces provide personal security , and where gun violence is a serious problem .
That is perhaps debatable , but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct . ” ( 64 )
If you type “ WAIT6502, 1 ” into a Commodore PET with BASIC V2 ( 1979 ) , it will show the string “ MICROSOFT ! ” at the top left corner of the screen .
Legend has it Bill Gates himself inserted this easter egg “ after he had had an argument with Commodore founder Jack Tramiel ” , “ just in case Commodore ever tried to claim that the code was n’t from Microsoft ” .
In this episode of “ Computer Archeology “ , we will not only examine this story , but also track down the history of Microsoft BASIC on various computers , and see see how Microsoft added a second easter egg to the TSR - 80 Color Computer – because they had forgotten about the first one .
Stolen From Apple ?
This whole story sounds similar to Apple embedding a “ Stolen From Apple ” icon into the Macintosh firmware in 1983 , so that in case a cloner copies the ROM , in court , Steve Jobs could hit a few keys on the clone , revealing the icon and proving that not just a “ functional mechanism ” was copied but instead the whole software was copied verbatim .
Altair BASIC
Let ’s dig into the history of Microsoft ’s BASIC interpreters .
In 1975 , Microsoft ( back then still spelled “ Micro- soft ” ) released Altair BASIC , a 4 KB BASIC interpreter for the Intel 8080 - based MITS Altair 8800 , which , despite all its other limitations , included a 32 bit floating point library .
An extended version ( BASIC - 80 ) that consisted of 8 KB of code contained extra instructions and functions , and , most importantly , support for strings .
Microsoft BASIC for the 6502
In 1976 , MOS Technology launched the KIM - 1 , an evaluation board based around the new 6502 CPU from the same company .
Microsoft converted their BASIC for the Intel 8080 to run on the 6502 , keeping both the architecture of the interpreter and its data structures the same , and created two versions : an 8 KB version with a 32 bit floating point library ( 6 digits ) , and a 9 KB system with 40 bit floating point support ( 9 digits ) .
Some sources claim that , while BASIC for the 8080 was 8 KB in size , Microsoft just could n’t fit BASIC 6502 into 8 KB , while other sources claim there was an 8 KB version for the 6502 .
The truth is somewhere in the middle .
The BASIC ROMs of the Ohio Scientific Model 500/600 ( KIM - like microcomputer kits from 1977 / 1978 ) and the Compukit UK101 were indeed 8 KB in size , but unlike the 8080 version , it did n’t leave enough room for the machine - specific I / O code that had to be added by the OEM , so these machines required an extra ROM chip containing this I /O code .
In 1977 , Microsoft changed the 6 digit floating point code to support 9 digits and included actual error stings instead of two - character codes , while leaving everything else unchanged .
A 6502 machine with BASIC in ROM needed more than 8 KB anyway , why not make it a little bigger to add extra features .
The 6 digit math code was still an assembly time option ; the 1981 Atari Microsoft BASIC used that code .
In 1977 , Ohio Scientific introduced the “ Model 500 ” , which was the first machine to contain ( 6 digit ) Microsoft BASIC 1.0 in ROM .
Upon startup , it printed :
OSI 6502 BASIC VERSION 1.0 REV 3.2 COPYRIGHT 1977 BY MICROSOFT CO .
OK
In the same year , MOS started selling a tape version of 9 digit Microsoft BASIC 1.1 for the KIM - 1 .
Its start message was :
MOS TECH 6502 BASIC V1.1 COPYRIGHT 1977 BY MICROSOFT CO .
OK
Woz Integer BASIC
The 1976 Apple I was the first system besides the KIM to use the MOS 6502 CPU , but Steve Wozniak wrote his own 4KB BASIC interpreter instead of licensing Microsoft’s .
An enhanced version of Woz’ “ Integer BASIC ” came in the ROM of the Apple II in 1977 ; Microsoft BASIC ( called “ AppleSoft ” ) was available as an option on tape .
On the Apple II Plus ( 1978 ) , AppleSoft II replaced Integer BASIC .
Commodore PET
Commodore had bought MOS in October 1976 and worked on converting the KIM platform into a complete computer system .
They licensed Microsoft BASIC for 6502 ( also October 1976 ) , renamed it to Commodore BASIC , replaced the “ OK ” prompt with “ READY . ” , stripped out the copyright string and shipped it in the ROMs of the first Commodore PET in 1977 .
The Easter Egg
In 1979 , Commodore started shipping update ROMs with a version 2 of Commodore BASIC for existing PETs .
Apart from updates in array handling , it also contained the WAIT 6502 easter egg .
This is what the easter egg code looks like :
. ,D710 20 C6 D6 JSR $ D6C6 fetch address and value ., D713 86 46 STX $ 46 save second parameter ., D715 A2 00 LDX # $ 00 default for third parameter ., D717 20 76 00 JSR $ 76 CHRGOT get last character ., D71A F0 29 BEQ $ D745 no third parameter ., D71C 20 CC D6 JSR $ D6CC check for comma and fetch parameter ., D71F 86 47 STX $ 47 save 3rd parameter ., D721 A0 00 LDY # $ 00 ., D723 B1 11 LDA ( $ 11 ) , Y read from WAIT address ., D725 45 47 EOR $ 47 second parameter ., D727 25 46 AND $ 46 first parameter ., D729 F0 F8 BEQ $ D723 keep waiting ., D72B 60 RTS back to interpreter loop
On pre-V2 BASIC , the branch at $ D71A just skipped the next line :
If there is no third parameter , do n’t fetch it .
On V2 , the line is subtly changed to make the two - parameter case branch to a small patch routine :
.,D745 A5 11 LDA $ 11 low byte of address ., D747 C9 66 CMP # $ 66 = low of $ 1966 ( =6502 ) ., D749 D0 D4 BNE $ D71 F no , back to original code ., D74B A5 12 LDA $ 12 high byte of address ., D74D E9 19 SBC # $ 19 = high of $ 1966 ( =6502 ) ., D74 F D0 CE BNE $ D71 F no , back to original code ., D751 85 11 STA $ 11 low byte of screen buffer = 0 ., D753 A8 TAY index = 0 ., D754 A9 80 LDA # $ 80 high byte of screen buffer ., D756 85 12 STA $ 12 screen buffer := $ 8000 ., D758 A2 0A LDX # $ 0A 10 characters ., D75A BD 81 E0 LDA $ E081 , X read character ., D75D 29 3F AND # $ 3 F throw away upper bits ., D75 F 91 11 STA ( $ 11 ) , Y store into screen RAM ., D761 C8 INY ., D762 D0 02 BNE $ D766 no carry ., D764 E6 12 INC $ 12 increment screen buffer high address ., D766 CA DEX ., D767 D0 F1 BNE $ D75A next character ., D769 C6 46 DEC $ 46 . , D76B D0 EB BNE $ D758 repeat n times ., D76D 60 RTS back to interpreter loop
The text “ MICROSOFT ! ” is stored in 10 consecutive bytes at $ E082 , cleverly hidden after a table of coefficients that is used for the SIN ( ) function :
. ;E063 05 6 coefficients for SIN ( ) .;E064 84 E6 1A 2D 1B -(( 2* PI ) **11)/11 ! = - 14.3813907 .;E069 86 28 07 FB F8 ( ( 2 * PI ) * * 9)/9 ! = 42.0077971 .;E06E 87 99 68 89 01 -( ( 2* PI ) ** 7)/7 ! = -76.7041703 .;E073 87 23 35 DF E1 ( ( 2* PI ) ** 5)/5 ! = 81.6052237 .;E078 86 A5 5D E7 28 -(( 2* PI ) ** 3)/3 ! = -41.3147021 .;E07D 83 49 0F DA A2 2 *PI = 6.28318531 .;E082 A1 54 46 8 F 13 " SOFT ! " | backwards and with .; E087 8 F 52 43 89 CD " MICRO " | random upper bits
If we reverse the bytes , we get
CD 89 43 52 8 F 13 8 F 46 54 A1
The easter egg code clears the upper 2 bits , resulting in
0D 09 03 12 0 F 13 0 F 06 14 21
The easter egg code does not print the characters through library routines , but instead writes the values directly into screen RAM .
While BASIC used the ASCII character encoding , the Commodore character set had its own encoding , with “ A ” starting at $ 01 , but leaving digits and special characters at the same positions as in ASCII .
Thus , the 10 hidden and obfuscated bytes decode into :
MICROSOFT !
Microsoft ’s Code ?
Commodore engineers are known for putting easter eggs into ROM , but there would be no reason for them to encode the string “ MICROSOFT ! ” and hide it so well .
The “ WAIT 6502 ” easter egg did not show up in Commodore BASIC until version 2 , which is in contrast to almost all sources claiming Commodore licensed Microsoft BASIC for a flat fee and never returned to Microsoft for updates , but continued improving BASIC internally .
Commodore had indeed updated its source with Microsoft ’s changes since V1 .
6502 guru Jim Butterfield states :
Commodore paid Microsoft an additional fee to write a revision to the original BASIC that they had bought .
Among other things , spaces - in - keywords were changed , zero page shifted around , and ( unknown to Commodore ) the WAIT 6502 , x joke was inserted .
Targeting Commodore ?
While all of Microsoft BASIC only depends on the CPU , makes no other assumptions on the hardware it runs on ( be it Commodore , Apple , Atari , … ) , and does all its input and output by calling into ROM functions external to BASIC , the easter egg writes directly to screen RAM at a fixed address of $ 8000 , and uses the PET character encoding for it :
The easter egg has clearly been written specifically for the PET .
We can only speculate on the reasons why Microsoft and possibly Bill Gates himself added the easter egg .
A possible reason is that Microsoft wanted to make sure Commodore cannot take credit for “ Commodore BASIC ” – similar to the “ Stolen From Apple ” case .
Or it was only about showing the world who really wrote it .
Jim Butterfield :
As an afterthought , Microsoft would have liked to see their name come up on the screen .
But it was n’t in the contract .
Commodore ’s Reaction
The easter egg only exists in BASIC version 2 on the PET .
All later Commodore computers did n’t contain it :
The branch was restored and the extra code as well as the 10 bytes hidden after the SIN ( ) coefficients were removed .
Jim Butterfield : Shortly after that implementation , I show this to Len Tramiel [ of Commodore engineering ] at the Commodore booth of a CES show .
He was enraged : “ We have a machine that ’s short of memory space , and the # $# !* [ Gates ] put that kind of stuff in !! ”
Commodore employee Andy Finkel states that the “ Gates ” (! ) easter egg had to be removed for space reasons .
It had occupied 51 extra bytes .
Interestingly , starting with the BASIC V7 on the C128 six years later , Commodore started crediting Microsoft , like this :
COMMODORE BASIC V7.0 122365 BYTES FREE ( C) 1985 COMMODORE ELECTRONICS , LTD . ( C) 1977 MICROSOFT CORP .
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
According to Jim Butterfield , this is probably due to negotiations concerning Microsoft BASIC for the Amiga .
The Easter Egg before the PET
But Microsoft did not encode its company name specifically for Commodore :
The 9 digit BASIC 6502 version 1.1 for the KIM - 1 contained the 10 hidden bytes :
. ;3FAA 05 6 coefficients for SIN ( ) .
;3FAB 84 E6 1A 2D 1B -( ( 2* PI ) ^11)/11 ! = -14.3813907 .;3FB0 86 28 07 FB F8 ( ( 2* PI ) ^9) /9 ! = 42.0077971 .;3FB5 87 99 68 89 01 -( ( 2* PI ) ^7)/7 ! = -76.7041703 .;3FBA 87 23 35 DF E1 ( ( 2 * PI ) ^5)/5 ! = 81.6052237 .;3FBF 86 A5 5D E7 28 -( ( 2* PI ) ^3)/3 ! = -41.3147021 .;3FC4 83 49 0F DA A2 2 * PI = 6.28318531 .;3FC9 A6 D3 C1 C8 D4 " ! TFOS " .;3FCE C8 D5 C4 CE CA " ORCIM "
The extra bytes here are :
A6 D3 C1 C8 D4 C8 D5 C4 CE CA
If we XOR every byte with 0x87 , we get :
21 54 46 4f 53 4f 52 43 49 4d
which , again , is “ MICROSOFT ! ” backwards , but this time in the ASCII encoding .
( Note that no XOR or add / sub can be found for the 10 bytes in Commodore BASIC that would convert them into ASCII instead of PETSCII .
Also , thanks to Tom for his help here . )
The version of Microsoft BASIC for the 6502 - based Apple II , called “ AppleSoft “ , contains the same 10 bytes after the coefficients in all tape and ROM versions .
On AppleSoft II , for example , they are located at address $ F075 .
KIM -1 BASIC was released in 1977 , AppleSoft II in spring 1978 , and the V2 ROM of the PET in spring 1979 .
So Microsoft did n’t “ target ” Commodore with this at first , but probably put the data in for all their customers – possibly right after they had shipped the easteregg free V1 to Commodore .
And when Commodore came back to them , they changed their codebase to encode string differently and added the easter egg code to show the string .
The Easter Egg after the PET
After the second source drop to Commodore , they removed the “ WAIT6502 ” code again , but kept the 10 encoded bytes in their master codebase : Every non-Commodore post -1978 6502 Microsoft BASIC with the 40 bit floating point library contains the 10 encoded bytes after the SIN ( ) coefficients – still in PET encoding :
Tangerine Microtan 65
Tangerine Oric - 1 and Oric - Atmos
Pravetz 8D
This is a snippet from microtan / tanex_h2.rom :
0000 fd8 : 0f da a 2 a1 54 46 8f 13 .... TF.. 0000 fe0 : 8f 52 43 89 cd a5 d5 48 .RC ....H
The ROM of the Ohio Scientific Superboard II ( and its clone , the Compukit UK101 ) as well as the Atari Microsoft BASIC tape are based on the 32 bit floating point version and do n’t contain the easter egg data .
“ MICROSOFT ! ” on the 6800 and the 6809
It does n’t stop there :
Even the BASIC versions on the TRS - 80 Color Computer and the TRS - 80 MC - 10 , which were versions for the 6809 and 6800 CPU architectures , respectively ( BASIC - 69 and BASIC - 68 ) , had the encoded “ MICROSOFT ! ” string after the SIN ( ) coefficients .
Here is a snippet of Spectral Associates ’ disassembly of the CoCo ROM in his book “ Color Basic Unravelled II “

You can tell that Microsoft did n’t reimplement BASIC for the remaining 8 bit architectures , but practically converted the 6502 code , copying all constants verbatim , even the ones they did not understand , since these are still the obfuscated bytes in PET - encoding .
A Second Easter Egg on the Color Computer
The TSR - 80 Color Computer ( 1980 ) also has an easter egg in BASIC :
If you type “ CLS9 ” ( or any higher number ) , it will clear the screen and print “ MICROSOFT ” .
Let ’s see how it is done :
* CLS A910 BD 01 A0 CLS JSR RVEC22 HOOK INTO RAM A913 27 13 BEQ LA928 BRANCH IF NO ARGUMENT A915 BD B7 0B JSR LB70B CALCULATE ARGUMENT , RETURN VALUE IN ACCB A918 C1 08 CMPB # 8 VALID ARGUMENT ?

The string to be printed is stored here :
A166 4D 49 43 52 4 F 53 LA166 FCC ' MICROSOFT ' A16C 4F 46 54 A16 F 0D 00 LA16F FCB CR,$00
That ’s right , Microsoft added a different easter egg , and included the string “ MICROSOFT ” again , this time in cleartext .
They seem to have forgotten about the obfuscated 10 bytes intended for the PET that had been copied from the 6502 version to the 6800 during conversion , and had still been present in the Color Computer ROM .
The same easter egg exists on the 6800 - based TRS - 80 MC - 10 ( also 1980 ) , which also had the 10 PET bytes in ROM :
FBBF 27 13 BEQ $ FBD4 ; branch if no argument FBC1 BD EF 0D JSR $ EF0D ; get argument FBC4 C1 08 CMPB # $ 08 ; easter egg ?

Microsoft BASIC 6502 Timeline
Version 1.0 ( in the 6 digit version ) is used on the Ohio Scientific , and contains a major bug in the garbage collection code .
Version 1.0 ( in the 9 digit version ) is also used in the first Commodore PET as Commodore BASIC V1 .
It is the oldest known Microsoft BASIC to support 9 digit floating point .
Version 1.1 , which contained bug fixes , is used on the KIM - 1 .
It is the oldest version to contain the “ MICROSOFT ! ” string ( in ASCII ) .
AppleSoft BASIC
I is forked from Microsoft BASIC 1.1 .
It contains the ASCII string .
Microsoft BASIC version 2 changes the ASCII string to PET screencode , adds the easter egg code , and is given to Commodore .
The code is removed again after the source drop to Commodore .
The Tangerine Microtan is based on this .
Apple , Commodore and Tangerine continue development of their respective forks without the involvement of Microsoft .
The BASIC V2 used on the VIC - 20 and the C64 is actually a stripped - down version of PET BASIC 4.0 and not a ported version of PET BASIC V2 .
So did Bill Gates write it himself ?
Altair BASIC was written by Bill Gates , Paul Allen ( the founders of Microsoft ) and Monte Davidoff ( a contractor ) , as comments in the original source printout show :
00560 PAUL ALLEN WROTE THE NON - RUNTIME STUFF .
00580 BILL GATES WROTE THE RUNTIME STUFF .
00600 MONTE DAVIDOFF WROTE THE MATH PACKAGE .
Bill Gates wrote “ the runtime stuff ” ( which probably means the implementation of the instructions ) , as opposed to “ the non-runtime stuff ” ( probably meaning tokenization , memory management ) and “ the math package ” .
Consequently , the implementation of the WAIT command would have been his work – on the 8080 , at least .
Now who wrote the 6502 version ?
The KIM - 1 BASIC manual credits Gates , Allen and Davidoff , the original authors of the 8080 version , but it might only be left over from the manual for the 8080 version .
Davidoff , who worked for Microsoft in the summers of 1975 and 1977 , had not been there when BASIC 6502 was written in the summer of 1976 , but he probably changed the 6 digit floating point code into the 9 digit version that is first found in BASIC 6502 1.1 ( KIM - 1 , 1977 ) .
The ROM of the 1977/1978 Ohio Superboard II Model 500/600 ( 6 digit BASIC 1.0 ) credits RICHARD W. WEILAND , and the 1977 9 digit KIM - 1 BASIC 1.1 as well as the 1981 Atari Microsoft BASIC 2.7 credit “ WEILAND & GATES ” .
Ric Weiland was the second Microsoft employee .
These credits , again , were easter eggs :
While they were clearly visible when looking at the ROM dump , they were only printed when the user entered “ A ” when BASIC asked for the memory size .
According to apple2history.org , Marc McDonald ( employee number 1 ) wrote the 6502 version , but it is more likely that McDonald wrote the 6800 simulator and Weiland ported 8080 BASIC to the 6800 and then McDonald adapted the 6800 simulator to the 6502 and Weiland wrote the 6502 BASIC .
This and the hidden credits in version 1.0 of 6502 BASIC suggest that Weiland was the main author of 6502 BASIC .
Gates is added to the hidden credits in the 1.1 version , so Gates probably contributed to the 1.1 update ..
So it is very possible that Gates wrote the easter egg code himself , given that he was responsible for the implementation of WAIT on the 8080 , he is credited in BASIC 6502 1.1+ , Finkel and Butterfield refer to WAIT6502 as “ Gates ' ” easter egg – and after all , he can write code .

Atari Microsoft BASIC images are very hard to find .
Why did Atari use the 6 digit version , if they extended it with lots of commands ( so size could n’t have been an issue ) ?

We may or may not be facing one of the gravest economic crises since the Great Depression .
What has astonished me in recent days is the degree of skepticism that remains widespread among the American populace .
That doubt has everything to do with the messengers .
At a time of a supposed economic national emergency , we are being asked to essentially take the word of an administration that shredded every ounce of credibility it has with people across the political spectrum .
Rather than defer to this message , our response has been : “ Prove it . ”
This credibility problem has been building slowly , and for years , mostly because of the buildup to the Iraq war .
But the specific problem is more recent .
As the mortgage crisis gathered momentum over the past two years , the president ’s economic team has insisted the economy is fine .
We were hearing that argument almost right up to the point when the administration announced the need for a bailout .
As Rep. Pete Stark said Monday : “ The fear - mongering over this turned me off . ”
Stark also pointed to the Bush administration ’s “ warnings of disaster ” regarding Iraq , “ which turned out to be a crock . ”
Either they were lying to us before , or they fundamentally misunderstood the situation .
Why should we suddenly trust them now ?
Next , on a gut level , it simply sounds suspicious to spring a deal on someone and then declare they have to act RIGHT NOW !
It sounds like a pitch from a telemarketer calling during dinner .
Adding to this credibility gap is the fact that the public face on this issue is Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , whose previous job was chief executive at Goldman Sachs .
In past times , this would have granted him an air of authority .
Now , it ’s a Scarlet Letter .
( Or , now it ’s an embarrassment . )
Of course , there are at least two groups that bought the bailout story .
But both groups have their own trust issues .
The first is Congress , including the two presidential candidates .
Those who supported this deal are among the minority willing to give the administration the benefit of the doubt .
But they have failed in their duty to demand answers about this crisis , and at best , have been lax in oversight in recent months .
And perhaps more troubling :
Over the past five years , the 205 members of Congress who voted for the bailout received 54 percent more in campaign contributions from banks and securities firms than the 228 members who voted against the bill , according to analysis by MAPlight.org , a nonpartisan group based in Berkeley that tracks campaign finance issues .
The other group rooting for the bailout is investors in the stock markets .
But keep in mind , the wild mood swings that drove the Dow down 777 points Monday were most likely caused by the very same people who are asking for this bailout .
Did you or any of your friends rush out and dump your portfolio Monday ?
Probably not , right ?
For most of us , there is simply too much that we do n’t know .
This is not because we are stupid , or because we do n’t have MBAs from Harvard .
It is because the administration has failed to provide the facts and answer the questions that would persuade us .
Institutions go bankrupt every day .
Airlines fail , but they keep flying .
So why is this crisis different ?
And why must the bailout happen right this second ?
We may not be financial geniuses , but we ’re adults .
When you ’re ready to give us the facts , we ’ll be ready to listen .
And maybe even believe you .

This is a java applet showing a simple resistive circuit .
The green color indicates positive voltage , and the gray color indicates ground ( or earth ) .
The movement of yellow dots indicates current ( in the conventional direction ) .
The left side of the circuit shows a voltage source providing 5 volts , and the current flows through a number of switches and resistors to the right .
The amount of resistance in ohms is shown to the right of each resistor .
To turn a switch on or off , just click on it .
If you move the mouse over any component of the circuit , you will see a short description of that component and its current state in the lower right corner of the window .
If there is only one switch closed on top and one closed on the bottom , then there is a single path through the circuit , and by Ohm's Law , the current will be equal to 5V divided by the total resistance through the current path .
If there are multiple current paths , you may have resistors in parallel .

Best naming practice today relies on more or less complete specimens
More details
Most of the newly discovered dinosaurs are just that - new to science , an assessment concludes .
With many past fossil finds named on the basis of partial remains , there has been concern that a lot of double counting has been taking place .
Recent studies had even suggested this error rate might be as high as 50 % - with some species being catalogued with several aliases .
But the journal Biology Letters reports that modern practice is now very good .
" My research suggests we 're getting better at naming things ; we 're being more critical ; we 're using better material , " said Professor Michael Benton from Bristol University , UK .
The scientist looked at the original descriptions of all 1,047 species of dinosaurs ever named , from 1824 to the present day .
He assessed the quality of the specimens on which the names were founded - the type specimens .
Professor Benton said some 500 were genuinely distinct , and the confidence surrounding the latest discoveries - about one new species a fortnight - was now very high .
" The bane of the dinosaurologist 's life is species that have been named on the basis of incomplete specimens , " Professor Benton explained .
" In Victorian times , palaeontologists were keen to name new species , and in the excitement of the great ' bone wars ' for example , from 1870 to 1890 , they rushed into print with new names for every odd leg bone , tooth , or skull cap that came their way .
" Later work , on more complete specimens , reduced more than 1,000 named dinosaurs to 500 or so . "
Professor Benton said science had now put in place far more rigorous naming protocols , dramatically reducing the " alias problem " .
Since 1960 , the great majority of new species are founded on more or less complete specimens , sometimes even whole skeletons .
Professor Benton has a critical interest in the topic because he studies the evolution of dinosaurs .
He tries to understand how this famous animal group changed and diversified over almost 200 million years .
" There 's no point somebody such as myself doing big statistical analyses of numbers of dinosaur species through time - or indeed any other fossil group - if you can't be confident that they really are genuinely different , " he told BBC News .
" This is important also for studies of modern biodiversity .
People have also been looking at our current knowledge of mammals and insects and other animal groups and asking the simple question : are the species totals and lists we use for important conclusions - including to give political advice about endangered species - are they correct ?
" There 's been a big debate about vast extinctions among amphibians .
We have to know what the species are first , before we can talk about that . "

I " production " car is one you can buy .
Until one is for sale , they are all engineering prototypes .
I absolutely guarantee that :1) This is not a production Volt ; and2 )
The car will change between now and the creation of a production Volt .
A company like GM has maybe 5 prototype phases .
True , the later ones start to closely resemble what will become a production model .
But they 're not production .
I would guess this one is maybe 2 or 3 more prototype phases away from production .
Phrased another way , as between the automotive media and the automobile , at least one of them is evolving .
He told the meeting : " I do think the branding of the name is something that can be looked at because what we 've been trying to do is to look at modernising the estate , focusing on re-offending , doing this in an efficient way for the taxpayer and making a difference by bringing together services where possible for the needs of the community . "
Bishop Franklin Corley
In September of 1945 , Bishop Franklin Corley was sent to the Japanese city of Hiroshima as part of the American occupation forces then entering that country .
As one of the first American soldiers to enter the stricken city , he encountered many of the people who were helping to re-establish order from the chaos .
One of these people was Father Johannes Siemes ( last name pronouced " Zee- Muss " ) , a German priest with the Novitists of the Society of Jesus in Nagatsuki .
Father Siemes had been an eyewitness to the atomic bomb 's detonation over the city on August 6 and he was directly involved in the post - bombing rescue .
Shortly after they met , Father Siemes gave a typed account of his observations to Mr.Corley , who then brought the manuscript back to the United States where it lay for fifty years .
Thanks to the kind cooperation of Mr. Corley 's son , a complete and unedited version of Father Siemes ' account is presented below .
His observations are a priceless insight into this event , as are his thoughts on the implications of total war and its results .
Shown along with the account are Bishop Corley 's photographs of Hiroshima , some of which were taken while the city still smoldered .
Eyewitness account of J. Siemes
Up to August 6th , occasional bombs , which did no great damage had fallen on Hiroshima .
Many cities roundabout , one after the other were destroyed , but Hiroshima itself remained protected .
There was almost daily observation planes over the city but none of them dropped a bomb .
The citizens wondered why they alone had remained undisturbed for so long a time .
There were fantastic rumors that the enemy had something special in mind for this city , but no one dreamed that the end would come in such a fashion as on the morning of August 6th .
August 6th began in a bright , clear , summer morning .
About 7 o'clock , there was an air raid alarm which we had heard almost every day and a few planes appeared over the city .
No one paid attention and at about 8:00 , the all - clear sounded .
I am sitting in my room at the Novitists of the Society of Jesus in Nagatsuki : during the past half year , the philosophical and theological section of our mission had been evacuated to this place from Tokyo .
The Novitists is situated approximately 2 kilometers from Hiroshima , half - way up the side of a broad valley which stretches from the town at sea level into the mountainous hinterland , and through which courses a river .
From my window , I have a wonderful view down the valley to the edge of the city .
Suddenly --- the time is approximately 8:15 -- the whole valley is filled by a garish light which resembles the Magnesium light used in photography , and I am conscious of a wave heat .
I jump to the window to find out the cause of this remarkable phenomenon , but I see nothing more than that brilliant yellow light .
As I make for the door , it does n't occur to me that the light might have something to do with enemy planes .
On the way from the window , I hear a moderately loud explosion which seems to come from a distance and , at the same time , the windows are broken in with a loud crash .
There has been an interval of perhaps ten seconds since the flash of light .
I am sprayed by fragments of glass .
The entire window frame has been forced into the room .
I realize now that a bomb has burst and I am under the impression that it exploded directly over our house or in the immediate vicinity .
I am bleeding from cuts about the hands and head .
I attempt to get out of the door .
It has been forced outwards by the air pressure and has become jammed .
I forced an opening in the door by means of repeated blows with my hands and feet and come to a broad hall - way from which open the various rooms .
Everything is in a state of confusion .
All windows are broken and all the doors are forced inwards .
The book - shelves in the hall - way have tumbled down .
I do not note a second explosion and the fliers seem to have gone on .
A few are bleeding in the room , but none has been seriously injured .
All of us have been fortunate since it is now apparent the wall of my room opposite the window has been lacerated by long fragments of glass .
We proceed to the front of the house to see where the bomb has landed .
There is no evidence , however , of a bomb crater ; but the southeast section of the house is severely damaged .
Not a door nor a window remains .
The blast of air had penetrated the entire house from the southeast , but the house still stands .
It is constructed in the Japanese style with a wooden framework , but has been greatly strengthened by the labor of our Brother Gropper as is frequently done in Japanese homes .
Only along the front of the chapel which adjoins the house have three supports given away ( it has been made in the manner of a Japanese temple , entirely out of wood ) .
Down in the valley , perhaps one kilometer towards the city from us , several peasant homes are on fire and the woods on the opposite side of the valley are aflame .
A few of us go over to help control the flames .
While we are attempting to put things in order , a storm comes up and it begins to rain .
Over the city , clouds of smoke are rising and I hear a few slight explosions .
I come to the conclusion that an incendiary bomb with an especially strong explosive action has gone off down in the valley .
A few of us saw three planes at great altitude over the city at the time of the explosion .
I , myself , saw no aircraft whatsoever .
Perhaps a half - hour after the explosion , a procession of people began to stream up the valley from the city .
The crowd thickens continuously .
A few come up the road to our house .
Their steps are dragging .
Many are bleeding or have suffered burns .
We give them first aid and bring them into the chapel , which we have in the meantime cleaned and cleared of wreckage , and put them to rest on the straw mats which constitute the floor of Japanese houses .
A few display horrible wounds of the extremities and back .
The small quantity of fat which we possessed during this time was soon used up in the care of the burns .
Father Nekter , who , before taking holy orders , had studied medicine , ministers to the injured , but our bandages and drugs are soon gone .
We must be content with cleansing the wounds .
More and more of the injured come to us .
The least injured drag the more seriously wounded .
There are wounded soldiers , and mothers carrying burned children in their arms .
From the houses of the farmers in the valley come word : " Our houses are full of wounded and dying .
Can you help , at least by taking the worst cases ? "
The wounded come from the sections at the edge of the city .
They saw the bright light , their houses collapsed and buried the inmates in their homes .
Those that were in the open suffered instantaneous burns , particularly on the lightly clothed or unclothed parts of the body .
Numerous fires spring up which soon consumed the entire district .
We now conclude that the epicenter of the explosion was at the edge of the city near the Yokogawa Station , three kilometers away from us .
We are concerned about Father Kepp , who , that same morning , went to hold Mass at the Sisters of the Poor , who have a home for children at the edge of the city .
He had not returned as yet .
Toward noon , our large chapel and library are filled with the seriously injured .
The procession of refugees from the city continues .
Finally , about 1:00 , Father Kepp returns together with the Sisters .
Their house and the entire district where they live has burned to the ground .
Father Kepp is bleeding about the head and neck , and he has a large burn on the right palm .
He was standing in front of the nunnery ready to go home .
All of a sudden , he became aware of the light , felt the wave of heat and a large blister formed on his hand .
The windows were torn out by the blast .
He thought that the bomb had fallen in his immediate vicinity .
The nunnery , also a wooden structure made by our Brother Gropper , still remained but soon it was noted that the house is as good as lost because the fire , which began at many points in the neighborhood , sweeps closer and closer , and water is not available .
There is still time to rescue certain things from the house and to bury them in an open spot .
Then the house is swept by flame , and they fight their way back to us along the shore of the river and through the burning streets .
Soon comes news that the entire city has been destroyed by the explosion and that it is on fire .
What became of Father Superior and the three other Brothers who were at the center of the city at the Central Mission and Parish House ?
We had up to this time not given them a thought because we did not believe that the effects of the bomb encompassed the entire city .
Also , we did not want to go into town except under pressure of dire necessity , because we thought that the population was greatly perturbed and that it might take revenge on any foreigners whom they might consider spiteful onlookers of their misfortune , or even spies .
Brother Stolto and Brother Balighagen go down to the road which is still full of refugees and bring in the seriously injured who have sunken by the wayside , to the temporary aid station at the village school .
There , iodine is applies to the wounds but they are left uncleansed .
Neither ointments nor other therapeutic agents are available .
Those that have been brought in are laid on the floor and no one can give them any further care .
What could one do when all means are lacking ?
Under these circumstances , it is almost useless to bring them in .
Among the passersby , there are many who are uninjured .
In a purposeless , insensate manner , distraught by the magnitude of the disaster , most of them rush by and none conceives the thought only with the welfare of their own families .
It became clear to us during these days that the Japanese displayed little initiative , preparedness , and organizational skill in preparation for catastrophes .
They despaired of any rescue work when something could have been saved by a cooperative effort , and fatalistically let the catastrophe take its course .
When we urged them to take part in the rescue work , they did everything willingly , but on their own initiative they did very little .
At about 4:00 in the afternoon , a theology student and two kindergarden children , who lived at the Parish House in the city , came and reported that the church , Parish House and adjoining buildings had burned down , and that Father Superior , LaSalle and Father Schiffer had been seriously injured and that they had taken refuge in Asano Park on the river bank .
It is obvious that we must bring them in since they are too weak to come here on foot .
Hurriedly , we get together two stretchers and seven of us rush toward the city .
Father Rekter comes along with food and medicine .
The closer we get to the city , the greater is the evidence of destruction and the more difficult it is to make our way .
The houses at the edge of the city are all severely damaged .
Many have collapsed or burned down .
Further in , almost all of the dwellings have been damaged by fire .
Where the city stood , there is a gigantic burned out sear .
We make our way along the street on the river bank among the burning and smoking ruins .
Twice we are forced into the river itself by the burning and smoking ruins .
Twice we are forced into the river itself by the heat and smoke at the level of the street .
Frightfully burned people beckon to us .
Along the way , there are many dead and dying .
On the Misasa Bridge , which leads into the inner city , we are met by a long procession of soldiers who have suffered burns .
They drag themselves along with the help of staves or are carried by their less severely injured comrades .... an endless procession of the unfortunate .
Abandoned on the bridge , there stand with sunken heads a number of horses with large burns on their flanks .
On the far side , the cement structure of the local hospital is the only building that remains standing .
The interior , however has been burned out .
It acts as a landmark to guide us on our way ... Finally we reach the entrance of the park .
A large proportion of the populace has taken refuge there , but even the trees of the park are on fire in several places .
Paths and bridges are blocked by the trunks of fallen trees and are almost impassable .
We are told that a high wind , which may well have resulted from the heat of the burning city , had uprooted the large trees .
It is now quite dark .
Only the fires which are still raging in some places at a distance , give out little light .
At the far corner of the park , on the river bank itself , we at first come upon our colleagues .
Father Schiffer is on the ground pale as a ghost .
He has a deep incised wound behind his ear and has lost so much blood that we are concerned about his chances for survival .
The Father Superior has suffered a deep wound of the lower leg .
Father Cieslik and Father Kleinserge have minor injuries but are completely exhausted .
While they are eating the food that we have brought along , they tell us of their experiences .
They were in their rooms at the Parish House -- it was 8:15 , exactly the time when we had heard the explosion in Nagatsuki -- when came the intense light and immediately thereafter the sound of breaking windows , walls and furniture .
They were showered with glass splinters and fragments of wreckage .
Father Schiffer was buried beneath a portion of a wall and suffered a severe head injury .
The Father Superior received most of the splinters in his back and lower extremity from which he bled copiously .
Everything was thrown about in the rooms themselves , but the wooden framework of the house remained intact .
The solidity of the structure that was the work of Brother Gropper again shown forth .
They had the same impression that we had in Nagatsuki : that the bomb had burst in their immediate vicinity .
The Church , school and all buildings in the immediate vicinity collapsed at once .
Beneath the ruins of the school , the children cried for help .
They were freed with great effort .
Several others were also rescued from the ruins of nearby dwellings .
Eve the Father Superior and Father Schiffer , despite their wounds , rendered aid to others and lent a great deal of blood in the process .
In the meantime , fires which had begun some distance away are raging even closer , so that it becomes obvious that everything would soon burn down .
Several objects are rescued from the Parish House and were buried in a clearing in front of the Church but certain valuables and necessities which had been kept ready in case of fire could not be found on account of the confusion which had been wrought .
It is high time to flee , since the oncoming flames leave almost no way open .
Fukai , the secretary of the Mission , is completely out of his mind .
He does not want to leave the house and explains that he does not want to leave the and explains that he does not want to service the destruction of his fatherland .
He is completely uninjured .
Father Kleinserge drags him out of the house on his back and he is forcefully carried away .
Beneath the wreckage of the houses along the way , many have been trapped and they scream to be rescued from the oncoming flames .
They must be left to face their fate .
The way to the place in the city to which one desires to flee is no longer open and one must make for Asano Park .
Fukai does not want to go further and remains behind .
He has not been heard from since .
In the park , we take refuge on the bank of the river .
A very violent whirlwind now begins to uproot large trees , and lifts them high into the air .
As it reaches the water , a water spout forms which is approximately 100 meters high .
The violence of the storm luckily passes us by .
Some distance away , however , where numerous refugees have taken shelter , many are blown into the river .
Almost all who are in the vicinity have been injured and have lost relatives who have been pinned under the wreckage or who have been lost sight of during the flight .
There is no help for the wounded and some die .
No one pays any attention to a dean man lying nearby .
The transportation of our own wounded is difficult .
It is not possible to dress their wounds properly in the darkness and they bleed again upon slight motion .
As we carry them on the shaky litters in the dark over fallen trees of the park , they suffer unbearable pain as the result of the movement , and lost dangerously large quantities of blood .
Our succouring angel in this difficult situation is an unknown Japanese Protestant Pastor .
He has brought us a boat and offers to take our wounded upstream to a place where progress is easier .
First , we lower the litter containing Father Schiffer into the boat and two of us accompany him .
We plan to bring the boat back for the Father Superior .
The boat returns about one - half hour later and the pastor requests that several of us help in the rescue of two children whom he had seen in the river .
We rescue them .
They have severe burns .
Soon they suffer chills and die in the park .
The Father Superior is conveyed in the boat in the same manner , as Father Schiffer .
The theology student and myself accompany him .
Father Cieslik considers himself strong enough to make his way on foot to Nagatsuki with the rest of us , but Father Kleinserge cannot walk so far and we leave him behind and promise to come for him and the housekeeper tomorrow .
From the other side of the stream comes the whinny of horses who are threatened by the fire .
We land on a sand spit which juts out of the shore .
It is full of wounded who have taken refuge there .
They scream for aid for they are afraid of drowning as the river may rise with the sea , and cover the sand spit .
They themselves are too weak to move .
However , we must press on and finally we reach the spot where the group containing Father Schiffer is waiting .
Here a rescue party had brought a large case of fresh rice cakes but there is no one to distribute them to the numerous wounded that lie all about .
We distribute them to those that are nearby and also help ourselves .
The wounded call for water and we come to the aid of a few .
Cries for help are heard from a distance , but we cannot approach the ruins from which they come .
A troop of soldiers comes along the road and their officer notices that we speak a strange language .
He at once draws his sword , screamingly demands who we are and threatens to cut us down .
Father Laures Jr. , seizes his arm and explains that we are German .
We finally quiet him down .
He thought that we might be Americans who had parachuted down .
Rumors of parachutists were being bandied about the city .
The Father Superior , who was clothed only in a shirt and trousers , complains of feeling freezing cold , despite the warm summer night and the heat of the burning city .
The one man among us who possesses a coat give it to him and , in addition , I give him my own shirt .
To me , it seems more comfortable to be without a shirt in the heat .
In the meantime , it has become midnight .
Since there are not enough of us to man both litters with four strong bearers we determine to remove Father Shiffer first to the outskirts of the city .
From there , another group of bearers is to take over to Nagatsuki ; the others are to turn back in order to rescue the Father Superior .
I am one of the bearers .
A theology student goes to warn us of numerous wires , beams , and fragments of ruins which block the way and which are impossible to see in the dark .
Despite all precautions , our progress is stumbling and our feet get tangled in the wire .
Father Kruer falls and carries the litter with him .
Father Schiffer becomes half unconscious from the fall and vomits .
We pass and injured man who sits all alone among the hot ruins and whom I had not seen previously on the way down .
On the Misasa Bridge , we meet Father Tappe and Father Lubmer , who have come to meet us from Nagatsuki .
They had dug a family out of the ruins of their collapsed house some fifty meters off the road .
The Father of the family was already dead .
The had dragged out two little girls and placed them by the side of the road .
Their mother was still trapped under some beams .
They had planned to complete the rescue and then press on to meet us .
At the outskirts of the city , we put down the litter and leave two men to wait until those who are to come from Nagatsuki appear .
The rest of us turn back to fetch the Father Superior .
Most of the ruins have now burned down .
The darkness kindly hides the many forms that lie on the ground .
Only occasionally in our quick progress do we hear call for help .
One of us remarks that the remarkable burned smell reminds us of incinerated corpses .
The upright , squatting form which had passed by previously is still there .
Transportation on the litter , which has been constructed out of beards , must be very painful to Father Superior , whose entire back is full of fragments of glass .
In a narrow passage at the edge of town , a car forces us to the edge of the road .
The litter bearers on the left side fall into a two meter deep ditch which they could not see in the darkness .
Father Superior hides his pain with a dry choke , but the litter which is now no longer in one piece cannot be carried further .
We decide to wait until Brother Kinjo can bring a hand cart from Nagatsuki .
He soon comes back with one that he has requisitioned from a collapsed house .
We place Father Superior on the cart and wheel him the rest of the way , avoiding as much as possible the deeper pits in the road .
About half past five in the morning , we finally arrive at the Novitiate .
Our rescue expedition had taken almost twelve hours .
Normally , one could go back and forth to the city in two hours .
Our two wounded were now , for the first time , properly dressed .
I get two hours sleep on the floor ; someone else has taken my own bed .
Then I read a Mass in gratiarum actienem ; it is the 7th of August , the anniversary of the foundation of our Society .
We then bestir ourselves to bring Father Kleinserge and other acquaintances out of the city .
We take off again with the hand cart .
The bright day now reveals the frightful picture which last night 's darkness had partly concealed .
Where the city stood , everything as far as the eye could reach is a waste of ashes and ruin .
Only several broken skeletons of buildings completely burned out in the interior remain .
The banks of the river are covered with dead and wounded , and the rising waters have here and there covered some of the corpses .
On the broad street in the Hakushima district , naked , burned , cadavers are particularly numerous .
Among them are the wounded who still live .
A few have crawled under the burnt - out autos and trams .
Frightfully injured forms beckon to us and then collapse .
An old woman and a girl whom she is pulling along with her , fall down at our feet .
We place them on our cart and wheel them to the hospital at whose entrance a dressing station has been set up .
Here the wounded lie on the hard floor , row on row .
Only the largest wounds are carefully dressed .
We convey another soldier and an old woman to this place but we cannot move everybody who lies exposed in the sun .
It would be endless and it is questionable whether those whom we can drag to the dressing station can come out alive , because even here nothing really effective can be done .
Later , we ascertain that the wounded lay for days in the burnt - out hall - ways of the hospital and there they died .
We must proceed to our goal in the park and are forced to leave the wounded to their fate .
We make our way to the place where our Church stood to dig up those few belongings that we buried yesterday .
We find them intact .
Everything else has been completely burned .
In the ashes , we find a few molten remains of the holy vessels .
At the park , we lead the housekeeper and a mother with her two children on the cart .
Father Kleinserge feels strong enough , with the aid of Brother Nobuhara , to make his way home on foot .
The way pack takes us once again past the dead and wounded in Hakushima .
Again no rescue parties are in evidence .
At the Misasa Bridge , there still lies the family which Father Tappe and Luhmer had yesterday rescued from the ruins .
A piece of tin had been placed over them to shield them from the sun .
We give them and those nearby , water to drink and decide to rescue them later .
At three o'clock in the afternoon , we are back in Nagatsuki .
After we have had a few swallows and a little food , Father Stelte , Luhmer , Erlinghagen and myself , take off once again to bring in the family .
Father Kleinserge requests that we also rescue two children who had lost their mother and who had lain near him in the park .
On the way , we were greeted by strangers who had noted that we were on a mission of mercy and who were carrying the wounded about on litters .
As we arrived at the Misasa Bridge , the family that had been there were gone .
They might well have been borne away in the meantime .
There was a group of soldiers at work taking away those that had been sacrificed yesterday .
More than thirty hours had gone by until the first official rescue party had appeared on the scene .
We find both children and take them out of the park : six year old girl who was uninjured and a twelve year old girl who had been burned about the head , hands , and legs , and who had lain for thirty hours without care in the park .
The left side of her face and the left eye were completely covered with blood and pus , and we thought that she had lost an eye .
When the wound was later washed , we noted that the eye was intact and that the lids had just become stuck together .
On the way home we took another group of three refugees with us .
The first wanted to know , however , of what nationality we were .
They too , feared that we might be Americans who had parachuted in .
When we arrived in Nagatsuki , it had just become dark .
We took under our care fifty refugees who had lost all their belongings .
The majority of them were wounded and not a few had dangerous burns .
Father Nekter treated the wound as well as he could with the few medicine that we could , with effort , gather up .
He had to confine himself in general to cleaning the wound of purulent material .
Even those with the smaller burns are very weak and all suffered from diarrhea .
In the farm houses in the vicinity , almost everywhere there are also wounded .
Father Nekter made daily rounds and noted in the capacity of a painstaking physician and was a great Samaritan .
Our work was , in the eyes of the people , a greater boast for Christianity than all our efforts during the preceding long years .
Three of the severely burned in our house died within the next few days .
Suddenly the pulse and respirations ceased .
It is certainly a sign of our good care that so few died .
In the official aid stations and hospitals , a good third or half of those that had been brought in died .
They lay about there almost without care , and very high percentage succumbed .
Everything was lacking ; doctors , assistants , dressings , drugs , etc .
In an aid station at a school at a nearby village , a group of soldiers for several days did nothing except to bring in and cremate the dead being in the school .
During the next few days , funeral processions passed our house from morning to night , bringing the deceased to a small valley nearby .
There , in six places , the dead were burned .
People brought their own wood and themselves did the cremation .
Father Dalrer and Father Yeures found a dead man in a nearby house who had already become bloated and who omitted a frightful odor .
They brought him to this valley and incinerated him themselves .
Even late at night , the little valley was lit up by the funeral pyres .
We made systematic efforts to track our acquaintances and the families of the refugees who we had sheltered .
Frequently , after the passage of several weeks , someone was found in a distant village or hospital but of many there was no news .
These were apparently dead .
We were lucky to discover the mother of the two children whom we had found in the park and who had been given up for dead .
After three weeks , she saw her children once again .
In the great joy of the reunion were mingled the tears for those whom we shall not see again .
The magnitude of the disaster that befell Hiroshima on August 6th was only slowly pieced together in my mind .
I lived through the catastrophes and saw it only in flashes , which only gradually were merged to give me a total picture .
What simultaneously happened in the city as a whole is as follows :
As a result of the explosion of the bomb at 8:15 , almost the entire city was destroyed by a single blow .
Only small outlying districts in the southern and eastern parts of the town excaped complete destruction .
The bomb exploded over the center of the city .
As a result of the blast , all the small Japanese houses in a diameter of five kilometers , which encompassed 99 % of the city , collapsed or were blown up .
Those who were in the houses were buried in the ruins .
Those who were in the open sustained burns resulting from contact with the substance or rays omitted by the bomb .
Where the substance struck in quantity , fires sprung up .
these spread rapidly .
The heat which rose from the center created a whirlwind which was effective in spreading fire throughout the whole city .
Those who had been cut off by the flames became casualties .
As much as six kilometers from the center of the explosion , all houses were damaged and many collapsed and caught fire .
Even fifteen kilometers away , windows were broken .
It was rumored that the enemy fliers had first spread an explosive and incendiary material over the city and then had created the explosion and ignition .
A few maintained that they saw the planes drop a parachute which had carried something that had exploded at a height of 1,000 meters .
The newspapers called the bomb an " atomic bomb " and noted that the force of the blast had resulted from the explosion of uranium atoms , and that gamma rays had been sent out as a result of this , but no one knew anything for certain concerning the nature of the bomb .
How many people were a sacrifice to this bomb ?
Those who had lived through the catastrophe placed the number of the deaths at least 100,000 .
Hiroshima had a population of 400,000 .
Official statistics place the number who had died at 70,000 up to September 1st , not counting the missing .... and 130,000 wounded , among them 43,500 severely wounded .
Estimates made by ourselves on the basis of groups known to us show that the number of 100,000 dead is not too high .
Near us there are two barracks , in each of which forty Korean workers lived .
On the day of the explosion they were laboring on the streets of Hiroshima .
Four returned alive to one barrack and sixteen to the other .
600 students of the Protestant girl 's school worked in a factory , from which only thirty to forty returned .
Most of the peasant families in the neighbourhood lost one or more of their members who had worked at factories in the city .
Our next door neighbour , Tamare , lost two children and himself suffered a large wound since as it happened , he had been in the city on that day .
The family of our reader suffered two dead , father and son ; thus a family of five members suffered at least two losses , counting only the dead and severely wounded .
There died the Mayor , the President of the Central Japan District , the Commander of the City , a Korean prince who had been stationed in Hiroshima in the capacity of an officer , and many other high - ranking officers .
Of the professors of the University , thirty - two were killed or severely injured .
Especially hard hit were the soldiers .
The Pioneer Regiment was almost entirely wiped out .
The barracks were near the center of the explosion .
Thousands of wounded who died later could doubtless have been rescued if the received proper treatment and care , but rescue work in a catastrophe of this magnitude had not been envisioned ; since the whole city had been knocked out at a blow , everything which had been prepared for emergency work was lost , and no preparation had been made for rescue work in the outlying districts .
Many of the wounded also died because they had been weakened by under nourishment and consequently the strength to recover .
Those who had their normal strength and who received good care slowly healed the burns which had been associated by the bomb .
There were also cases , however , whose prognosis seemed good who died suddenly .
There were also some later , after an inflammation of the pharynx and oral cavity had taken place .
We thought at first that this was the result of inhalation of the substance of the bomb .
Later , a commission established the thesis that gamma rays had been given out at the time of the explosion , following which the internal organs had been injured in a manner resembling that consequent upon Roentgen irradiation .
this produces a diminution in the number of the white corpuscles .
Only several cases are known to me personally where individuals who did not have external burns died later .
Father Kleinserge and Father Sieslik , who were near the center of the explosion , but who did not suffer burns became quite weak some fourteen days after the explosion .
Up to this time small incised wounds had healed normally , but thereafter the wounds which were still unhealed became worse and are to date ( in September ) still incompletely healed .
The attending physician demonstrated a leucoponis .
There thus seems to be some truth in the statement that radiation had some effect on the blood .
I am of the opinion , however , that their generally undernourished and weakened condition was partly responsible for these findings .
It was also noised about that the ruins of this city emitted deadly rays and that many workers who went there to aid in the clearing died , and that the central district would be uninhabitable for some time to come .
I have my doubts as to whether such talk is true and myself and others who worked in the rained area for some hours shortly after the explosion suffered no such ill effects .
None of us in those days heard a single outburst against the Americans on the part of the Japanese , nor was there any evidence of a vengeful spirit* .
The Japanese suffered this terrible blow as part of the fortunes of war ... something to be borne without complaint .
During this war , I have noted relatively little hatred toward the Allies on the part of the people themselves , although the press has taken occasion to stir up such feelings .
After the victories at the beginning of the war , the enemy was rather looked down upon , but when the Allied Offensive gathered momentum and especially after the advent of the majestic B - 29's the technical skill of America became an object of wonder and admiration .
The following anecdote shows the spirit of the Japanese : A few days after the atomic bombing , the Secretary of the University came to us asserting that the Japanese were ready to destroy San Francisco be means of a equally effective bomb .
It is dubious that he himself believed what he told us .
He merely wanted to impress upon us foreigners that the Japanese were capable of similar discoveries .
In his nationalistic pride , he talked himself into believing this .
The Japanese also intimated that the principle of the new bomb was a Japanese discovery .
It was only lack of raw materials , they said , which prevented its construction .
In the meantime , the Germans were said to have carried the discovery to a further stage and were about to initiate such bombing .
The Americans were reputed to have learned the secret from the Germans and they had then brought the bomb to a stage of industrial completion .
We have discussed among ourselves the ethics of the use of the bomb .
Some consider it in the same category as poison gas and were against its use on a civil population .
Others were of the view that in total war , as carried on in Japan , there was no difference between civilians and soldiers and that the bomb itself was an effective for tending to end the bloodshed , warning Japan to surrender and thus to avoid total destruction .
It seems logical to us that he who supports total war in principle cannot complain of a war against civilians .
The crux of the matter is whether total war in its present form is justifiable , even when it serves a just purpose .
Does it not have material and spiritual evil as its consequences which far exceed whatever the good that might result ?
When will our moralists give us a clear answer to this question ?
THE END
Over the next two months , a team of Japanese explorers hopes to obtain indisputable video evidence confirming the existence of the legendary yeti , the mysterious apelike creature long believed to inhabit the Himalayas of Nepal and Tibet .
A 7 - member crew of experienced climbers , led by veteran yeti hunter and mountaineer Yoshiteru Takahashi , will depart Japan on August 16 .
At their destination in the Dhaulagiri mountains in central Nepal , they will establish base camp at an elevation of 4,300 meters ( 14,000 ft ) and set up an array of automated infrared cameras along a ridge .
For six weeks , the men and their state - of - the - art motion - sensitive cameras will monitor the area for signs of the yeti .
The expedition is Takahashi's third attempt to find the elusive creature .
The 65 - year - old mountaineer first became interested in the yeti while on a climbing expedition in the Dhaulagiri region in 1971 , after fellow climbers saw a mysterious humanoid creature covered in gray fur that appeared to be about 150 centimeters ( 5 ft ) tall and walked upright .
In 1994 , when Takahashi returned to the region on his first mission to find the yeti , he reportedly found small humanoid footprints in a mountain cave that had a strong animal scent .
In 2003 , on his second expedition , Takahashi and his crew found more mysterious footprints and observed the silhouettes of unidentified humanoid creatures from a distance .
In a written statement on the Yeti Project Japan 2008 website , Takahashi describes the yeti sighting that took place in 2003 .
" Three dark silhouettes were observed at 12:25 PM on September 27 , 2003 on the southeast ridge of Gurja Himal , " he writes .
" They looked almost human and walked upright on two legs . "
According to Takahashi , the expedition crew had long expected to lay eyes on a yeti , but the sighting shocked them nonetheless .
At the same time , however , the incident brought a sense of relief because it confirmed that the creature was indeed out there somewhere .
Over the years , numerous yeti sightings have been reported in the region .
Takahashi's 2003 encounter -- the 4th sighting known to have occurred on the southeast ridge -- strengthened his convictions about the yeti .
In a recent interview with the Asahi Shimbun ( who , along with Suntory , is a co-sponsor of the current expedition ) , Takahashi said , " The yeti is not a bear or a monkey .
It is definitely an unknown creature that walks on two legs . "
Unfortunately , however , the 2003 expedition ( whose sponsors included Pepsi , Suntory , Nikon , and the Asahi Shimbun ) , failed in its goal to produce visual evidence of the yeti's existence .
But now , five years later , Takahashi and his crew are better equipped than ever to capture the yeti on camera , and they are sure they will succeed this time .
Takahashi , who believes clear photographs or video of the yeti will pave the way for future scientific research , says , " We are confident we can prove its existence this time , and once we do , we can start working to protect it . "

White Paper Justifying Iraq War Written
Three Months before Intel Report Arrived

A war based on deception and fraud Worldpassion cc
National Security Archive Stunner
Michael Collins
Washington , DC
The National Security Archive released a report Friday Aug. 22 , 2008 that sheds even more light on the premeditated lying and deception that took the United States to war in Iraq .
The findings are based on new evidence compiled by Dr. John Prados and published by the National Security Archive .
See " White Paper " Drafted before NIE even Requested , " Scoop " Independent News , Aug. 24 , 2008 .
Most notably , Prados shows the depth of the deception perpetrated against citizens and Congress regarding the alleged threat to U.S. security posed by Iraq .
It had appeared that the White House rewrote the Oct. 1 , 2002 National Intelligence Estimate and then issued that doctored report to Congress on Oct. 4 , 2002 .
Prados reveals convincing evidence that the Oct. 4 White Paper had already been written by July 2002 .
He shows that it was only slightly altered after the final NIE arrived .
This White Paper served as the basis for the war .
The unavoidable conclusion is that the Bush - Cheney White paper " justifying " the invasion was developed a full three months in advance of the intelligence data and analysis that should have served as the basis for that justification .
The National Security Archive summed it up succinctly :
" The U.S. intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to Bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of Iraq ,
" The documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis , which then conformed to public positions taken by Pentagon and White House officials .
For example , a July 2002 draft of the " White Paper " ultimately issued by the CIA in October 2002 actually pre-dated the National Intelligence Estimate that the paper purportedly summarized , but which Congress did not insist on until September 2002 . "
National Security Archive in " Scoop ' Independent News , August 24 , 2008 .
The seemingly endless war in Iraq has become a total disaster on multiple levels for all involved .
The awful toll in human deaths and casualties is largely ignored but real nevertheless .
Over 4,000 U.S. soldiers have been lost in battle and tens of thousands injured .
In excess of one million Iraqi civilians are dead due to civil strife unleashed by the invasion .
The U.S. Treasury is drained and the steep decline in respect for the United States around the world is just beginning to manifest .
The United States political establishment responds with collective denial on a scale that 's incomprehensible .
In the presidential campaign , the only sustained public commentary on the war comes from the Republican presidential candidate John McCain who makes the bizarre claim that U.S. is " surrendering " with victory in clear sight .
McCain touts the surge without noting that 4.0 million Iraqis are " displaced from their homes . "
Nearly ten percent of Iraq 's population is either dead or injured and there are 5.0 million Iraqi orphans .
This pathological view of victory claims the " surge ' is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services ; a nation where death continues on a shopping spree

Sustainable Bamboo Kitchen and Dinnerware
Later last week , I went to a local vineyard along with my fiancee and some friends .
Every week the vineyard has local farms musicians and food demonstrations .

A seafood restaurant was serving samples of oysters .
I was excited to see that when I went to grab a plate and fork , that they were all made of bamboo .
On the back of the plate was the name of the company , Bambu .
Bambu has a range of bamboo made products including plates , utensils , cutting boards and even cutlery .
All of their products are made from bamboo organic , meaning that is sustainably harvested and free of fertilizers or pesticides .
They even use environmentally friendly packaging .
The cardboard used is made from recyclable fibers and soy - based ink is used for the printing .
The biggest problem with Bambu products is the price .
I wanted to get an idea of how much some of their products cost and I was able to find that each plate costs about $ .80 per plate and under a dollar for a set of utensils .
That is pretty steep considering that they are disposable products .
I asked the chef about the plates and he said that he got a pretty good discount when buying in large quantities .
If you are serious about getting rid of plastic disposable products , these are the way to go .

Remember the old Comedy Central shows of the fighting robots ?
I used to love those shows and watched almost every single one .
The crazy combat between the various robots was extremely entertaining and sometimes also extremely ruthless .
The different competing robots has some nasty battles involving saws , knives , hammers and so many different weapons attached in order to bring on the demise of fellow competing robots .
Hey , there could be only one first place .
Whether it is kung fu fighting robots , shredding robots , cockfighting robots , hammering robots or a different original idea you have , you have the ability to design your very own and build it by yourself .
When taking on such a do it yourself project , you must first decide what size robot you would like to create because different sizes provide various abilities and also handicaps .
Afterward , you must decide your budget for such a diy project , design it …and of course … build it .

The California Supreme Court struck down the state ’s ban on same - sex marriage Thursday in a broadly worded decision that would invalidate virtually any law that discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation .
The 4 - 3 ruling declared that the state Constitution protects a fundamental “ right to marry ” that extends equally to same - sex couples .
It tossed a highly emotional issue into the election year while opening the way for tens of thousands of gay people to wed in California , starting as early as mid-June .
The majority opinion , by Chief Justice Ronald M. George , declared that any law that discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation will from this point on be constitutionally suspect in California in the same way as laws that discriminate by race or gender , making the state ’s high court the first in the nation to adopt such a stringent standard .
The decision was a bold surprise from a moderately conservative , Republican - dominated court that legal scholars have long dubbed “ cautious , ” and experts said it was likely to influence other courts around the country .

But the scope of the court ’s decision could be thrown into question by an initiative already heading toward the November ballot .
The initiative would amend the state Constitution to prohibit same - sex unions .
The campaign over that measure began within minutes of the decision .
The state ’s Catholic bishops and other opponents of same - sex marriage denounced the court ’s ruling .
But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who previously has vetoed two bills in favor of gay marriage , issued a statement saying he “ respects ” the decision and “ will not support an amendment to the constitution that would overturn ” it .
The ruling was greeted with loud cheering and whooping when it was released at the high court ’s headquarters here Thursday morning .
About 100 people lined up outside to purchase copies of the decision for $ 10 apiece .
Some people bought 10 to 15 copies , calling it a historic document .
One man said he planned to give them out as Christmas presents .
Gay groups planned celebrations up and down the state .

“ I can finally say I will be able to marry John , the man that I love , ” said Stuart Gaffney , one of the plaintiffs in the case , referring to his partner of 21 years , John Lewis .
“ Today is the happiest and most romantic day of our lives . ”
Conservative and religious - affiliated groups denounced the decision and pledged to bring enough voters to the polls in November to overturn it .
Mathew Staver , founder of Liberty Counsel , called the decision “ outrageous ” and “ nonsense . ”
“ No matter how you stretch California ’s Constitution , you cannot find anywhere in its text , its history or tradition that now , after so many years , it magically protects what most societies condemn , ” Staver said .
The decision came after high courts in New York , Washington and New Jersey refused to extend marriage rights to gay couples .
Only Massachusetts ’ top court has ruled in favor of permitting gays to wed .
Advertisement
The court ’s ruling repeatedly invoked the words “ respect and dignity ” and framed the marriage question as one that deeply affected not just couples but also their children .
California has more than 100,000 households headed by gay couples , about a quarter with children , according to 2000 census data .
“ Our state now recognizes that an individual ’s capacity to establish a loving and long - term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individual ’s sexual orientation , ” George wrote for the majority .
“ An individual ’s sexual orientation -- like a person ’s race or gender -- does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights . ”
Many gay Californians said that even the state ’s broadly worded domestic partnership law provided only a second - class substitute for marriage .
The court agreed .
Giving a different name , such as “ domestic partnership , ” to the “ official family relationship ” of same - sex couples imposes “ appreciable harm ” both on the couples and their children , the court said .
Advertisement
The distinction might cast “ doubt on whether the official family relationship of same - sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite - sex couples , ” George wrote , joined by Justices Joyce L. Kennard , Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos R. Moreno .
All but Moreno were appointed by Republican governors .
George was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson in 1991 .
The ruling cited a 60 - year - old precedent that struck down a ban on interracial marriage in California .
The three dissenting justices argued that it was up to the electorate or the Legislature to decide whether gays should be permitted to marry .
In 2000 , 61 % of California voters approved a ballot measure , Proposition 22 , that said “ only marriage between a man and a woman is valid and recognized in California . ”
Advertisement
Since then , the Legislature has passed one of the strongest domestic partnership laws in the country , giving registered same - sex couples most of the rights of married people .
“ In my view , California should allow our gay and lesbian neighbors to call their unions marriage , ” Justice Carol A. Corrigan wrote in the first sentence of her dissent .
“ But I , and this court , must acknowledge that a majority of Californians hold a different view and have explicitly said so by their vote .
This court can overrule a vote of the people only if the Constitution compels us to do so .
Here , the Constitution does not . ”
Justice Marvin R. Baxter , joined by Justice Ming W. Chin , said the ruling “ creates the opportunity for further judicial extension of this perceived constitutional right into dangerous territory . ”
Advertisement
“ Who can say that in 10 , 15 or 20 years , an activist court might not rely on the majority ’s analysis to conclude , on the basis of a perceived evolution in community values , that the laws prohibiting polygamous and incestuous marriages were no longer constitutionally justified ? ”
Baxter wrote .
The decision takes effect in 30 days .
Gay couples would then be permitted to marry in California , even if they do not live in the state , gay rights lawyers said .
Under federal law , however , other states would not have to recognize those marriages as valid .
And same - sex couples would remain ineligible for certain federal benefits , including Social Security benefits for spouses and joint filing for income taxes .
Lawyers on both sides of the debate said they were uncertain how a victory for the proposed November initiative -- which both sides predict will qualify for the ballot -- would affect gay couples who marry during the next several months .
University of Santa Clara law professor Gerald Uelmen , who has closely followed the state high court for decades , said he was “ blown away ” and “ very surprised ” by the ruling .

“ The court is exerting some leadership here , and I think it needs to be said that it is a new role for the court , ” Uelmen said .
“ This has not been a court that has been willing to stick its neck out and lead the way on cutting - edge issues like this that involve such strong political feelings . ”
Uelmen said the court ’s vote probably reflected the fact that a growing number of Californians favor marriage for gay couples .
He noted the case attracted a record number of friend - of - the - court briefs , most of them in favor of same - sex marriage .
Although critics of the ruling , including the dissenters , argued the court should have waited for the voters to decide the question of same - sex marriage , “ the majority is not always supposed to have its way ” in constitutional democracies , said University of Pennsylvania constitutional law professor Kermit Roosevelt , one of many legal scholars who weighed in on the case Thursday .
Advertisement
Roosevelt predicted more states would follow California ’s example and that the U.S. Supreme Court would eventually rule in favor of same - sex marriage .
“ That decision will come at the end of a process that is now just beginning , ” Roosevelt said .
He predicted it would follow the pattern of state courts that struck down laws banning interracial marriage decades ago .
The decision followed several recent rulings by the state high court recognizing the rights of same - sex parents , including those not biologically related to their children .
The children in those families figured prominently in the court ’s reasoning in those cases .
The road to Thursday ’s ruling began with San Francisco ’s highly publicized same - sex weddings , which in 2004 helped spur a conservative backlash in an election year and a national dialogue over gay rights .
Advertisement
Several states later passed constitutional amendments banning gay marriage , and same - sex marriage became an issue in the race for president .
After a month of jubilant gay weddings here , the California Supreme Court intervened and ordered the city to stop issuing licenses to same - sex couples .
The state high court later invalidated the licenses , saying the city should have waited for a judicial ruling before acting .
The plan by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , City Atty .
Dennis Herrera and gay rights lawyers to challenge state law by marrying same - sex couples was carefully drawn .
Advertisement
City officials chose the first couples to wed , hoping their long unions and sympathetic stories would put a face on same - sex marriage that courts would find difficult to reject .
The city also decided to begin the weddings on a day when courts were closed to deprive opponents of quick legal intervention .
One of the first couples to wed has since separated .
The long parade of weddings at City Hall -- across the street from the California Supreme Court -- provided a dramatic backdrop for the gay rights debate .
As the issue moved into the high court , Brad Sears , executive director of the Williams Institute at UCLA ’s law school , which examines sexual orientation and the law , said the state ’s broad domestic partner law had undercut the traditional argument that children were better off being raised by opposite - sex parents .
“ Taking those issues off the table , which the domestic partners act did , might have made this an easier case for everyone , ” Sears said .
Once the state recognized the right of gays to rear children , the fight for same - sex marriage was shaped as “ the right to have a family ” and the ruling became “ about family being protected . ”

The court concluded that giving gays a separate institution -- domestic partnership -- “ marked gays and lesbians as second - class citizens , ” Sears said .
The Massachusetts high court ruling that permitted gays there to marry did not give sexual orientation the same kind of constitutional protection that Thursday ’s decision did , nor was the Massachusetts ruling as explicit in stating that marriage licenses must be given to same - sex couples in the immediate future , legal analysts said .
Sears said recent polls show that Californians are divided over same - sex marriage .
Forty - three percent of Californians supported gay marriage in a Field Poll taken a year ago .
He added that the issue was likely to affect the political debate even outside California .

“ It is going to give some new teeth to an issue that was losing its potency in terms of being a wedge issue , ” Sears said .

MOSCOW , Aug 4 ( Reuters ) - Kazakh and Russian oil exports via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium ( CPC ) to the Black Sea fell to 616,675 barrels per day in July , down by 10.8 percent from 691,716 bpd in June , the consortium said on its website on Monday .
The consortium did not give the reason for the decline .
The pipeline group is led by U.S. major Chevron CVX.N and includes Russian pipeline company Transneft TRNF_p.RTS , ExxonMobil XOM.N , Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L , LUKOIL LKOH.MM and BP BP.L .
The group exports oil CPC-E from a terminal near the Russian port of Novorossiisk .
Russian companies such as Rosneft ROSN.MM , Surgutneftegas SNGS.MM and TNK - BP TNBPI .RTS also ship crude via CPC .
In 2007 , CPC exported 32.6 million tonnes of oil , up from 31.1 million tonnes in 2006 .

You do n't hear too many folks suggesting that Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE ) have enough money anymore ( except for this nutbag Citi analyst ) , and even the Democrats think the forthcoming bailout should wipe out shareholders .
So it 's really just a question of when and how and how you define " wipe out " .
Most estimates of the cost of a bailout -- in terms of capital injected into the companies - - top out at around $ 40 billion , which once seemed breathtaking .
If you 've gotten comfortable that number , however , you might want to consider another one .
Bennet Sedacca of Atlantic
Advisors thinks the tab will end up being an order of magnitude higher :
When the Treasury peels back the onion , I believe they will find a hornet 's nest .
I think we will see an initial bailout of $ 100 billion or so , with 2/3 - 3/4 going to Fannie ( as it is a larger organization ) .
The scenario I foresee however , just as happened at Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley , is that they came to the financing window expecting to have borrowed enough , but then find they have to keep coming back repeatedly until the buyers go away or until " We The People " have thrown at least $ 500 billion at Fannie / Freddie to get them back on their feet again .
This will also likely take an Act of Congress to raise the Treasury 's Debt ceiling quite dramatically .

Advertisement Researchers in the US say that they have solved the mystery of why flies are so hard to swat .
They think the fly 's ability to dodge being hit is due to its fast acting brain and an ability to plan ahead .
High speed , high resolution video recordings revealed the insects quickly work out where a threat is coming from and prepare an escape route .
The research suggests that the best way of swatting a fly is to creep up slowly and aim ahead of its location .
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology .
Most people will have experienced the curiously frustrating sensation of carefully attempting to swat a fly , only to swing and miss while the intrepid insect buzzes off to safety .
Over the years there have been different theories put forward to explain the fly 's uncanny ability to outwit our whacking endeavours .
when the fly makes planning movements prior to take - off , it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
Michael Dickinson , Caltech But scientists at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) say it is down to quick - fire intelligence and good planning .
They filmed a series of experiments with fruit flies and a looming swatter .
The researchers discovered that long before the fly leaps it calculates the location of the threat and comes up with an escape plan .
Flies put their bodies into pre-flight mode very rapidly - Within 100 milliseconds of spotting the swatter they can position their centre of mass in the right way so that a simple extension of their legs propels them away from any threat .
The scientists found that flies were able to put themselves into this rapid reaction position no matter whether they were grooming , feeding or simply walking .
According to Caltech 's Professor Michael Dickinson this illustrates the speed and complexity of the fly 's brain .
Threat perception " We 've found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take - off , it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat , " he explained .
" Our experiments showed that the fly somehow ' knows ' whether it needs to make large or small postural changes .
" This means the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from , with mechano - sensory information from its legs , which tells it how to move to reach the proper pre-flight pose . "
So can this data make us more efficient swatters ?
Possibly .
It is best to creep up on a fly with stealth , as they are unable to register slow movements .
When it comes to striking the blow , Professor Dickinson said it was a good idea not to aim at the fly 's starting position .
" It 's best to aim a bit forward of its location and try and anticipate where the fly will jump when it first sees your swatter , " he explained .

What are these ?
Forget economic stimulus checks .
Same - sex marriages may give California just the financial boost it needs .
Wedding planners , bakers and hotels began booking more business almost immediately after the state Supreme Court ’s May 15 decision overturning a ban on gay marriage .
Citing pent - up demand , one UCLA study projects that same - sex unions could provide a $ 370 - million shot in the arm to the state economy over the next three years .
“ Being in West Hollywood , we ’ve been inundated , ” said Tom Rosa , owner of the Cake and Art bakery on Santa Monica Boulevard .
“ After the ruling , the phone really picked up . ”
Rosa said couples who had waited for decades to legally marry were splurging on 5 - foot - tall confections shaped like carousels and cakes featuring handcrafted birds of paradise .

Mike Standifer and Marc Hammer were already planning a commitment ceremony for October , but when the court ruling came out , they decided to throw an even bigger bash and get married .
They plan on spending about $ 25,000 , which includes renovations on their Hollywood home so they can have the party in their backyard .
The new price tag includes rings , their suits and those of their wedding party , and the cost of flying in Standifer ’s priest from Tennessee -- all costs they would n’t have incurred if they were just having a party .
“ The wedding dynamic in the last two weeks changed everything , ” Standifer said .
The wedding businesses he ’s worked with so far seem thrilled .
“ I think it ’s because the economy ’s not so great , but the vendors have been treating us like royalty , ” he said .
By some estimates , weddings and commitment ceremonies for same - sex couples generate $ 1 billion a year in revenue .

PlanetOut , a media and entertainment company that conducts surveys about gay and lesbian consumers , says gay consumers earn 20 % more than their straight counterparts , on average , and spend about 10 % more on nuptials .
The court ruling comes at a good time for many small wedding - related businesses , which are finding that their traditional customers are spending less on weddings because of the economy .
“ Brides are being more frugal with things they do n’t see as a priority , ” said Richard Markel , president and director of the Assn. for Wedding Professionals International .
Things really slowed down in February , said Michael Willms , owner of Entertainment Design Events , an event planning company that ’s done big bashes such as a wedding for actress Lindsay Price , who stars in the NBC show “ Lipstick Jungle . ”

But they ’ve picked up now .
The day after the ruling , Willms booked a $ 55,000 same - sex wedding .
“ These weddings will be much more lavish , ” he said .
“ Everybody ’s been waiting for it to be legal to throw the big party . ”
California counties can begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples beginning June 17 .
M.V. Lee Badgett , research director at the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at the UCLA School of Law , estimates that gay weddings could provide a $ 370 - million boost to the state economy .
Advertisement
That estimate presumes that about half of California ’s 92,000 same - sex couples will tie the knot , multiplied by $ 8,040 , the amount of money from savings accounts that Badgett figures same - sex couples will use on their weddings .
Event planners , restaurants , tent and chair rental companies , florists , caterers and hotels should all get a piece of that pie , she said .
“ There ’s an opportunity to get a big wedding windfall , ” she said .
There are , of course , some caveats .
No one can accurately project how many gay couples will spend thousands on weddings .
And the legality of gay weddings is potentially short - lived , as officials verify petition signatures for a proposed Nov. 4 ballot initiative that would prohibit same - sex marriage .
Advertisement
Still , wedding - related companies that traditionally market to the gay and lesbian community are finding business is picking up .
Mitch Goldstone , president of Irvine - based photo service ScanMyPhotos.com , said he had gotten more than 300 requests for wedding invitations with photos on them since the court ruling .
“ I guess people are still concerned about dealing with unsympathetic local photo labs , ” he said .
Rosa , the baker , said a lesbian couple came to him for their cake after a bakery in San Bernardino said it was booked for the summer and could n’t make their wedding cake when a clerk saw the two women together .
Advertisement
Other businesses are trying to capture the attention of gay and lesbian couples .
Susan Goldman , a wedding photographer , registered the domain name biggayweddings.com a month ago so she could market her services to same - sex couples .
The Ramada hotel in West Hollywood is promoting a honeymoon special , and the West Hollywood Marketing & Visitors Bureau is launching an ad in a magazine for the gay community , selling West Hollywood as a good place for weddings and honeymoons .
The bump in advertising targeted at same - sex couples is good for publications .
Bill LaPointe , publisher of the Orange County and Long Beach Blade , anticipates a 10 % to 15 % increase in advertising from wedding vendors .
The Blade caters to gay , lesbian and transgender readers .
Macy ’s published a full - page ad for its wedding and gift registry in the Los Angeles Times and San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday , captioned “ First comes love .
Then comes marriage .
And now it ’s a milestone every couple in California can celebrate . ”
Advertisement
Same - sex couples can obtain a marriage license in California whether or not they live in the state .
That means hotels and airlines might see business from same - sex couples and their guests flying to California to marry .
“ It will be the only place where couples from any state can be married legally , ” said Michael C. Green , president of the Palm Springs Hospitality Assn. and owner of the Triangle Inn , a Palm Springs hotel catering to gay men .
That ’s a boon to places like Palm Springs , which is a popular gay resort destination .
“ Our city has been barraged with phone calls from folks who want to come visit and find out how quickly we ’ll be able to issue licenses , ” he said .
Sue Jennings and the Rev. Cindi Love , executive director of the gay - oriented Metropolitan Community Churches , live in Texas but will fly to Los Angeles to get married this month .
They ’re planning on spending about $ 5,000 on a dinner for their guests , flowers , a photographer and clothes for the wedding , even if it means a big credit card bill .

“ We ’ve been together 28 years , ” Love said .
“ We want to have a ceremony and that acknowledgment of one another . ”

The first high - resolution structural connection map of the human cerebral cortex was published earlier this month in the journal PLoS Biology .
The study reveals regions that are highly connected and central , forming a structural core network [ 1 ] .
Intriguingly , this core network consists of many areas that are more active when we ’re at rest than when we ’re engaged in a task that requires concentration .
In the human brain , a complex network of fiber pathways link all regions of the cerebral cortex .
This “ brain wiring ” is responsible for shaping neural activation patterns .
To better understand the structural basis of functional connectivity patterns in the human brain , researchers at Indiana University and Harvard Medical School in the U.S. , and at University Hospital Center and the University of Lausanne in Lausanne , Switzerland , used a brain imagining technique called diffusion spectrum imaging to map out axonal pathways in cortex white matter .
The outermost layer of the cerebrum is termed gray matter .
Below the grey matter of the cortex , white matter , consisting of myelinated axons , interconnects different regions of the central nervous system .
Axons or nerve fibers are long filaments that project from a nerve cell ( called a neuron ) and carry electrical impulses away from the cell body to other neurons .
Myelinated axons are axons surrounded by an electrically - insulated phospholipid layer ( meaning a fat - soluble molecule , think insulated brain wiring ) .
The end of the axon comes close to but does not contact the next nerve cell ; this gap between neurons is referred to as a synapse or synaptic junction .
Diffusion spectrum imaging is a type of MRI that identifies water molecules and monitors how they move .
In nerve fibers , water molecules can be used to discern brain structural connectivity since they move along the length of fiber .
The noninvasive technique offers researchers the ability to compare neural connection variability between participants and to relate it to differences in individual functional connectivity and behavior .
The scientists used network theory , usually applied in social network analysis , to measure network properties such as degree and strength ( i.e. the extent to which the node is connected to the rest of the network ) , centrality and efficiency ( i.e. how many short paths between other parts of the network pass through the node ) , and betweenness .
Using measures from five healthy people ( participants A — E ) , they calculated brain regions that were highly connected and contained numerous connector hubs .
The researchers found evidence for the existence of a structural core composed of densely connected regions at the top and back of the brain , straddling both hemispheres ( figure ) .
An earlier imaging study measured blood flow to different parts of the brain [ 2 ] .
It positively correlated with the level of white brain matter axonal connectivity in individual participants .
Interestingly , regions that are in the most connected brain areas have been shown in various studies to have high levels of energy utilization and activation at rest [ 2 ] , and significant deactivation during goal - directed tasks [ 2 - 4 ] .
Termed the brain ’s “ default network ” , it has been suggested to be involved with stimulus - independent thought ( daydreaming ) [ 5 ] and other internally focused thoughts and cognitions , such as remembering the past , envisioning future events and considering the thoughts and perspectives of other people [ 6 ] .
These tasks all activate multiple regions within the default network .
According Dr. Olaf Sporns , co-author of the study and neuroscientist at Indiana University [ 7 ] :
This is one of the first steps necessary for building large - scale computational models of the human brain to help us understand processes that are difficult to observe , such as disease states and recovery processes to injuries .
Indeed , the default network is disrupted in several human disorders , including autism , schizophrenia and Alzheimer ’s disease [ 6 ] .
Using this technique to map out axonal pathways in the cortical network of patients with such diseases should help scientists identify default network regions that are disrupted .
Researchers hope that they can better understand these disorders based on changes in the brain ’s connectivity map .

国立情報学研究所は5月23日、コンピュータプログラムの技術を応用して物流を効率化し、トラック輸送による大気汚染や燃料消費を抑制する「エコ物流」を実現する研究成果を発表した。
日本全体 のCO2排出量のうち、運輸部門は約20％、さらにその中の約90％を自動車が占めるといわれている。特にその多くを占める物流トラックのCO2排出量削減は、地球温暖化対策にとって急務とされている。
トラック輸送の効率化を実現する手段としては、複数の企業で配送業務を共同で行う「共同配送」や、少数のトラックで複数の集荷先を巡回する「ミルクラン方式」などがあるが、現状では普及が進んでいない。その理由を国立情報学研究所教授の佐藤一郎氏は「現実の物流の世界では、あらかじめ決められた集配時間や、鮮度が求められる食品の集配時間を削るための集配順序など、さまざまな制約や要求がある。従来は、こうした制約や要求を満たす個別のトラック集配経路を定め、運用していた。しかし共同配送やミルクラン方式では、個別のニーズを満たす最適の共同集配経路を効率的に探し出す方法がない」と説明する。
国立情報学研究所 教授 佐藤一郎 氏
同研究所では、こうした問題に対してコンピュータプログラムの技術を応用して解決を図る研究を行ってきた。具体的には、トラックの集配経路や集配条件を簡潔に記述できるプログラミング言語を開発した。集配業者は自社のトラック運行経路をこの言語で記述し、システムのデータベースに登録する。一方、集配先は自社が望む集配条件を同じく記述し、システムに問い合わせる。するとシステムの経路選択エンジンが登録済みの集配経路から条件にマッチし、さらにトラックの移動距離が最短で済むものを独自アルゴリズムで選択・提示するという仕組みだ。このアルゴリズムに、コンピュータプログラム実行・検証の技術が応用されている。
佐藤氏はこの仕組みのメリットについて「CO2排出量削減のためには、トラックの運行距離を減らさなくてはいけない。しかしトラックの運行が集約・効率化されるほど、細かな集配条件・要求に応えることが難しくなる。しかしこの方式なら、共同配送やミルクランのトラック経路の中から条件にマッチしたものを効率的に探し出すことができるので、この相反する2つの課題を両立させることができる」と述べた。
同研究所ではすでにシステムのプロトタイプを構築、動作検証を完了した。トラックの運用計画書からプログラム言語への自動変換が可能で、トラックへの機材搭載は不要だという。また、システムに対する集配経路や集配条件の入力はブラウザ経由で行うため、専用端末は不要。導入・運用コストを最小限に抑えることが可能だという。さらに、このプログラミング言語はRFIDタグや2次元バーコードに記述することもできるため、商品に添付したタグやバーコードから最適な集配トラックを選択することも可能だという。
同様の技術はすでに、博物館の来場者案内システムで導入・運用され、実績を上げているという。今後同研究所では、この技術の物流業界への啓蒙活動を始めるともに、実証実験を行っていく予定だという。

" I think that culture plays a very important role , " he said .
" Part of what we have to do is to look across society and look among the ethnic minority groups where there is a very strong attachment to education and try to learn from that . "
President Robert Mugabe and his ruling party were defeated in presidential and parliamentary elections , according to the opposition and independent observers , but there was deafening silence Sunday from the Zimbabwe Election Commission , which released almost no results .
Tension was high here in the capital , as large numbers of riot police patrolled deserted streets after dark .
There were also reports of riot police in the crowded urban townships .
Fear grew that the count was being rigged as the delay in announcing results wore on .
The first official results are usually released within hours of the polls closing .
Mugabe , 84 , faced the strongest challenge in his 28 years of power from Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ; and a ruling party defector , Simba Makoni .
Unconfirmed reports said a swath of key ministers and Mugabe loyalists had lost their seats in parliament .

“ The wave of change was too strong , ” said one shocked politician who lost office , a member of the ruling ZANU - PF party who spoke on condition of anonymity .
He said conditions in the ruling party were extremely tense .
Tsvangirai ’s party maintained that he won 67 % of the vote in 150 of the 210 constituencies .
The figures were based on final tallies posted at individual polling stations after being signed off by electoral officials , the first time these counts have been posted .
The posting of final tallies at polling stations makes fraud easier to detect and follows recent reforms to election law after pressure from a regional body , the Southern African Development Community .
The opposition MDC ’s secretary - general , Tendai Biti , said the final support figure for Tsvangirai was expected to decline to about 55 % as figures from Mugabe ’s rural strongholds in Mashonaland province came in .
Advertisement
In a briefing to diplomats , independent election observers put the result at 55 % for Tsvangirai , 36 % for Mugabe and 9 % for Makoni , with 66 % of votes counted .
George Chiweshe , head of the Election Commission , said official results would be issued starting at 6 a.m. today .
“ It ’s an involving and laborious process .
It takes time for the results to filter through , ” he said , explaining the delay .
He added that only commission results were legitimate .
When the first returns were announced , they included only six parliamentary seats , split 3 - 3 between ZANU - PF and the opposition .

The country ’s desperate economic problems have increased opposition to Mugabe .
Zimbabweans face the highest inflation in the world and the sharpest economic collapse in any country not at war .
The official inflation figure is 100,000 % , but independent observers put the figure at 200,000 % with predictions that it could go to half a million percent within months .
Even in some ruling party heartland areas like Manicaland province , Tsvangirai was well ahead , according to the final posted tallies .
In one Manicaland district , Nyanga , Tsvangirai won about 65 % of the vote in the final tally posted at the polling booth , with 330 votes , while Mugabe got 177 and Makoni 53 .
In the contest for another rural Manicaland seat close to the Mozambique border , Tsvangirai won 70 % .
“ We ’ve won this election , ” said an exhausted Biti .
“ The results coming in show that in our traditional strongholds , we are massacring them .
In Mugabe ’s traditional strongholds they are doing very badly .
There is no way Mugabe can claim victory unless it is through fraud .
He has lost this election .
Advertisement
“ We must savor these scenes , as for the rest of our lives we ’ll say we were there . ”
Information Ministry spokesman George Charamba , a close Mugabe ally , warned against an opposition claim of victory before the results came down :
“ It is called a coup d’etat and we all know how coups are handled , ” he told the state - owned Sunday Mail .
David Coltart , from a small MDC faction split from the Tsvangirai group , said there were many reports of top Mugabe allies losing their seats .
“ If that is true , this is literally a tsunami , ” he said .
Advertisement
Coltart said the sweeping result made it difficult for the government to rig the count .
“ I think they ’re going to be very hard pressed now , ” he said , adding that Mugabe “ is not sure where the military is , especially the rank and file .
He ’s not sure where the civil service is .
He ’s clearly run out of money .
He knows that . ”
The lack of information from official sources was eerie .
Rumors flew around the country and cellphone networks could not get calls through .
But an upbeat state television bulletin Sunday night announced that Election Commission officials were “ verifying ” results , then cut to interviews across the country on how smooth and peaceful the elections had been .
Noel Kututwa , chairman of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network , a pro-democracy group , said the delay in results was creating tension and speculation , and called on the Election Commission to release the results .
Advertisement
“ Clearly the delay is fueling speculation that something might be going on , ” he said .
Elliot Manyika , the ruling ZANU - PF ’s political commissar and elections manager , said the party was winning and its mood was optimistic .
“ We are winning .
We get into the election in order to win , ” he said speaking before any results came down .
“ We are expecting the announcement to come and when it comes we expect to win because we have the superior candidate in Comrade Mugabe .
He ’s experienced ; the others are people who came too late ” into politics , Manyika said .
Advertisement
Fears of rigging were fueled by a headline in the state - owned Herald the day before the election , saying Mugabe would win with about 57 % of the vote , based on a University of Zimbabwe poll .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice condemned Mugabe ’s government Sunday during a visit to Jerusalem .
“ The Mugabe regime is a disgrace to the people of Zimbabwe and a disgrace to southern Africa and to the continent of Africa as a whole , ” she said .
But an observer from the Southern African Development Community reported Sunday that the election was “ a peaceful and credible expression of the will of the people . ”
Western observers and most Western correspondents were denied accreditation for the elections .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans drove 9.6 billion fewer miles in May compared with a year earlier , according to a report Monday from the Federal Highway Administration .
" We have seen the longest decline in vehicular miles traveled since we started collecting this data , " said U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters in a conference call with reporters .
Peters said that in the first four months of this year , Americans traveled 40.5 billion miles less compared with the same period in 2007 .
She said the decline in usage means less tax revenue for highway system .
Many of these commuters are flocking to trains , buses and bikes , or telecommuting from home .
Rising gas prices are to blame for the driving decline , and the use of public transportation is soaring , said Virginia Miller , spokeswoman for the American Public Transit Association , a private trade group .
" It does seem that we are on track to beat last year 's record [ public transportation ] ridership , " she said , noting that the 2007 tally of 10.3 billion public transit trips was a 50 - year high .
" That can really only be explained by the large increase in gas prices , " said Miller .
Gasoline prices soared in May , rising for 24 consecutive days in the month , and breaking the psychologically significant $ 4 - a - gallon barrier in many states , according to data from motorist group AAA .
The FHA said that driving in May experienced the third - largest monthly drop since the agency , a division of the U.S. Department of Transportation that manages the nation 's highways and bridges , began collecting data 66 years ago .
It was the largest drop for any May , a month that usually sees driving increase due to the Memorial Day holiday , the agency said .
Three of those largest monthly declines have occurred since December , as unusually high fuel prices take a toll on drivers .
Trains , buses , bikes , telecommuting
Many of these drivers switched to public transportation .
Usage jumped in the first three months of the year by 88 million trips from a year ago , for a total of 2.6 billion , according to the most recent figures available from the APTA .
Some of the most dramatic increases occurred in the light rail systems in Baltimore , Minneapolis and St. Louis , the commuter rails of Seattle and Harrisburg , Penn. , the buses of San Antonio and Denver , and the subways and elevated rails of and Boston .
The Boston Globe reported Monday that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority broke a ridership record of 375 million passengers in fiscal year 2008 , which is 21 million more than the prior year .
Other commuters , like Eric Creese , a senior database administrator in Eagan , Minn. , switched to muscle power for commuting .
Creese , a former triathloner , said that high gas prices inspired him to " get back " into biking .
" I asked myself , ' Why drive 150 miles a week when I can save my car , my money and do something good for my body and environment , ?' " said Creese , who said he has biked 1,000 miles to work since May and saved about $ 250 in gas .
Now Creese runs a Web site - GasFreeCommute.com - for bike commuters , with calculators to estimate calories burned and gasoline saved .
His co-workers have logged their miles on his site , totaling 5,400 so far .
And if commuters really want to save money , they 'll stay at home , said Chuck Wilsker , president and co-founder of The Telework Coalition .
Wilsker estimates the nationwide tally of telecommuters to increase by 4 or 5 million workers this year , from an estimated 28 million at the start of 2008 .
" If you want to quickly reduce your commuting costs by 20 % , leave your car at home one day a week ; if you want to reduce your costs by 40 % , leave your car at home two days , " said Wilsker , who telecommutes from his suburban Maryland home to Washington , D.C .
Not only does Wilsker save on gas , but he said he saves on automotive wear and tear , lunch and dry cleaning .
" You know what I 'm wearing ? " said Wilsker .
" I 'm wearing shorts , sandals and a tank top .
I 'm sitting here working from home .
My dry cleaning bill is none . "
Feds get squeezed on taxes
As high fuel costs led many to rely on other forms of transportation , such as mass transit , and to cut back their miles on the road this year , the reduced driving also sliced tax revenue that would normally go toward highway maintenance , the FHA said .
The federal tax on gas generates 18.4 cents per gallon of regular gas sold and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel , which gets pumped in to the federal Highway Trust Fund .
Some states also add a tax of their own to fund various projects .
The FHA budget totaled $ 42.18 billion in fiscal year 2008 .
The Bush Administration has requested $ 40.14 billion for fiscal year 2009 .
As Americans drive less , new ways are needed to fund the national road system , the highway agency said .
Even though fewer drivers are using the highways , funding is still critical , party because of a backlog in highway projects .
Peters said she would unveil a new plan on Tuesday to " fundamentally reform our nation 's transportation . "
She said much of the plan will focus on calculating a better cost - benefit analysis for maintaining the national highway system , as well as " weaning ourselves from the gas tax over time . "
The Surge : Working Overtime
“ The surge is working . ”
It ’s an incessant mantra , forever on the lips of politicians and “ journalists ” these days .
It ’s as if they can simply will it into truth .
Yes , there has been a reduction in violence in Iraq , if the stats are to be believed .
But it ’s a mistake to think that ’s primarily due to an increase in troop strength .
What is working in Iraq is the Awakening , a movement of Sunni tribes against al Qaeda in Iraq ( which , while a franchisee of the al Qaeda trademark , is really an entirely separate group ) .
Essentially what has happened is that the Sunni Arabs have grown weary of al Qaeda ’s tendency to wantonly murder their own people , and to start civil wars and stuff like that .
So they ’ve started taking money from the Pentagon instead of bin Laden , and things have quieted down somewhat .
This change was bound to occur , and preceded the surge .
In fact , if Bush had eschewed the surge , and instead sent the equivalent amount of money for bribes and salaries , it would have been much more effective .
What seems long forgotten is the original rationale for the surge , which was not simply to quell violence but to establish Iraq ’s ability to govern itself , setting the stage for American withdrawal .
That would constitute true “ success , ” although leaving has already been designated “ surrender ” by both Bush and McCain .
But the real reason for the surge has always been to indefinitely prolong the conversation about withdrawal that was made inevitable by the 2006 elections .
And in that sense , the surge has been an unparalleled success .
The New Yorker Cover
This was really one of the strangest cartoon controversies yet , revealing just how humor - challenged people really are .
Admittedly , if the same cover had been on the Weekly Standard , it might have pissed me off too , but context is everything .
What I find most alarming is the apparently widespread notion that satirists are required to present only jokes that are immediately obvious to every gump alive , and could n’t possibly be subject to misinterpretation .
That ’s the death of comedy , right there .
The rush to condemn the cover came at least in part because it did n’t take seriously enough the smears against Obama that it mocked .
It rightly said , “ Look at this .
Is n’t this fucking ridiculous ? ”
And it is .
It is ridiculous , and it is fit to be ridiculed .
But to see The New Yorker maligned as a “ right wing rag ” by pea-brained bloggers was probably the funniest thing about this whole controversy .
McCain ’s War on Reality
The guy has referred to “ Czechoslovakia ” at least four times this year , after it was already a minor gaffe for him in 2000 .
He ’s called the Sudan “ Somalia . ”
He ’s referred to “ President Putin of Germany . ”
He ’s worried about the “ Iraq / Pakistan border ” -- perhaps an oblique reference to Iran ?
He does n’t know Shiite from Sunnis , and thinks the Iranians are helping al Qaeda .
He thinks the surge caused the Awakening .
All of these mistakes would be deeply damaging to a less coddled candidate .
But McCain is an elderly war hero , and there is a natural tendency to hold back on blasting him for his poor information retention .
But what about the football story ?
McCain has been telling a story , at least since he wrote it in Flags of our Fathers in 1999 , of substituting the names of the Green Bay Packers defensive line for his squadron mates when pressed by Vietnamese interrogators .
It ’s a great story , as All - American as can be .
He discussed it in 2005 , when A&E did a movie version of the book , including the inspirational scene .
Again in 2005 , McCain used the story to illustrate how torture yields bad information .
On July 9th , McCain told the story again at a press conference in Pittsburgh — only this time is was the Steelers defensive line .
Setting aside the rank stupidity of destroying a great piece of image work for a cheap hometown shoutout to a regional media market , this fib stabs at the heart of McCain ’s straight - talking war hero mythology .
It ’s a breathtakingly brazen and completely unnecessary lie , at least as bewildering as Hillary Clinton ’s “ sniper fire ” silliness , except that , Hillary was n’t running as a special forces agent .
It calls into question every unconfirmed detail about McCain ’s POW years — how many other stories is he just making up ?
And what kind of man would sully his service with such pointless embellishments ?
But , dissimilarly to Hillary ’s sniper snafu , McCain ’s Packers / Steelers switcheroo slid by largely unnoticed , chuckled at by the media momentarily and tossed away .
And they ’re in the tank for Obama ?
Shilling and Drilling
It ’s amazing what the PR industry can do to divert an issue .
While the truth that carbon emissions are going to alter our planet in unpleasant ways in the near future is more and more well established , somehow the topic has been changed from reducing the use of fossil fuels to “ independence from foreign oil . ”
So now , after a few - week push , Americans are ready to start drilling offshore and in Alaska .
You ’ve gotta hand it to the oil industry ; only they could take multiple crises for which they are responsible and turn them into a win for their agenda .
Never mind that it will take years to have what will ultimately be a negligible effect on the price of oil .
Gas is expensive , and people are easy to fool , especially if you play to their moronic fears of all things foreign .
Meanwhile , it turns out that American oil burns just as dirty as it does anywhere else , and no meaningful emissions regulation is on the horizon .
Get yourself some flood insurance .
Gramm : Crackers ?
John McCain ’s recently - fired principal economic adviser Phil Gramm ’s comments about America being a “ nation of whiners ” in a “ mental recession ” are worthy of forced drowning .
This golden asshole , drafter of the Enron loophole , Vice President at the disgraced and near - defunct Swiss bank UBS , and emitter of similarly foul , wealth - arrogant quotations about not feeling sorry for destitute 80 - year - olds ( “ Most people do n't have the luxury of living to be 80 years old , so it 's hard for me to feel sorry for them , ” says Gramm ) , thinks the economic downturn is all in your head , and has nothing to do with the collapse of the mortgage and credit industries or the unsound practices that were encouraged by an anarchist regulatory philosophy of which Gramm himself is a huge proponent .
McCain and Gramm have been tight for years , and although he had no choice but to dump Gramm for the duration of the campaign , fellow money - saturated dickhead Steve Forbes assures us Gramm will be back , to help combat the whining poor and their paranoid delusions about hunger and homelessness .
We ’re Winning What Now ?
McCain and Bush continually iterate their will to “ win ” in Iraq .
But what is winning in this context ?
After all , we are not looking to colonize Iraq , at least not officially .
In other words , there is no winning or losing in Iraq — only staying or leaving .
Neither constitutes victory , but one is a hell of a lot cheaper .
Penniless Elitists
A common complaint among Democrats is that it makes no sense to label Obama ( or whatever politician is the target du jour ) an “ elitist , ” since so many Republicans , including McCain and Bush , are children of wealth and power , and have considerably more money than Obama , while both Obama and his wife come from humble origins and attained their status through their own hard work .
On the surface , this seems to make sense , but it ’s a misapprehension of what the elitist label has truly come to signify : education and intellect .
McCain and Bush may be of the upper crust , but it ’s clear to all who observe them that they ’re not very bright .
Obama , on the other hand , clearly was paying attention at Harvard .
That ’s why the label sticks to him .
Excessive intelligence is a liability in American political campaigns ; there can be no doubt of that , and when people speak of Obama as “ not one of us , ” that is , at least in part , what they ’re talking about .
It ’s anti-intellectualism that brought us eight years of Bush , as well as eight years of Reagan .
Americans love a simple - talkin ’ good ole boy , even if he does lower their wages and spend their retirement .
Luckily for Obama , McCain is such a stiff that this factor will be somewhat mitigated .
Soundbitten
Take a moment to recall Wesley Clark ’s supposed slander against McCain ’s military service from last month .
Here ’s how the exchange went on “ Face the Nation ” :
SCHIEFFER : I have to say , Barack Obama has not had any of those experiences either , nor has he ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down .
I mean ...
Gen. CLARK : Well , I do n't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president .
Of course , virtually none of the abundant , breathless stories which ensued bothered to mention that the “ getting shot down ” construct was Bob Schieffer ’s , and that Clark was merely repeating it .
Nope , the story was that Clark said , “ I do n’t think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president . ”
Obviously , this sounds much worse , as if Clark is criticizing McCain ’s piloting skills .
I do n’t love Wesley Clark , but it seems pretty damn unfair to put words in his mouth like this and then pretend the phrase was his own invention .
Now , this does n’t mean the press is on McCain ’s side ; they just know a sensational story when they see it , and this one was much more outrageous when amputated from the context of Schieffer ’s preceding statement .
This is something to remember when you see unfair coverage of either candidate :
The media bias is n’t usually left or right ; the bias is toward profit .
If a half - assed story is more appealing than a full examination , then half - assed it ’ll be .
If , one the other hand , a news source risks alienating its audience — by , say , questioning McCain ’s POW narriative a la the Packers / Steelers gaffe , they ’ll shy away .
Irreconcilable Deferences
It turns out white Americans do n’t like Michelle Obama as much as they like her husband .
Why ?
A big factor in Mrs. Obama ’s unpopularity is that , unlike her husband , she is culturally African - American .
She reminds whites of stereotypes that are specific to black women : too loud , too rude , too pushy — not dainty at all .
They much prefer a dead - eyed robo - spouse like Laura Bush or Cindy McCain , because it implies a domineering , controlling , in - charge man , just the type they imagine to be suited to running a global empire .
If Obama ’s deferential to his wife , how will he handle the Iranians ?
And what kind of table settings will she pick out for dinner with the Putins ?
I hear grown women expressing their distaste for enduring eight years with “ that woman ” in the White House , as if her skin color will rub off on the walls .
It ’s goddamn revolting , but that ’s America .
Bomb Bomb Iran
Even as we discuss ways of extracting ourselves from the disaster we ’ve created in Iraq , we find ourselves moving inexorably closer to attacking Iran , or at least supporting an Israeli attack on Iran .
Amazingly , we hear the same bullshit WMD justifications coming from the same people who so expertly fooled us into invading Iraq , and even more amazingly , it seems to be working again .
Personally , I never understood how Iraq hawks like Bill Kristol and Charles Krauthammer were ever able to find work after the WMD hoax ran its course , but they are more prominent than ever somehow .
It ’s almost as if they were being rewarded for playing their roles convincingly .
But even now , after rejecting the idea that weapons inspectors should complete their work in Iraq sealed our fate there , the very idea that Obama might go so far as to talk to the Iranians before bombing the crap out of them is seen as naïve .
Iran is not like Iraq in one way , though :
They have a real military and they will not be content to just let us in and take occasional potshots at us .
They will fight back .
And we will once again find ourselves overextended in a war we did n’t really want , but were convinced by known liars to start .
And then we will ... probably still not learn our lesson .

May 2 , 2008 Aurora Flight Sciences has revealed the design of the aircraft it hopes will achieve the ambitious goals set out in DARPA 's ambitious Vulture program : sustained uninterrupted flight for over five years at altitudes of 60,000 - 90,000 feet .
Known as Odysseus , the solar - powered concept aircraft is as radical as the mission it is designed to accomplish , combining three self - sufficient “ constituent aircraft ” in a unique Z wing configuration that spans almost 500 feet ( 150 meters ) .
The modular design provides several advantages - the shape of the aircraft can be adjusted to maximize the solar collection properties during the day and spread flat for aerodynamic efficiency at night - time , when energy stored in onboard batteries is used to drive the aircraft 's electric motors .
Because each of the constituent vehicles is capable of autonomously docking at altitude , the design also facilitates the replacement of one section of the plane whilst it is still aloft , meaning continuous flight can be maintained even if something goes awry .
Designed to fly in the stratosphere , Odysseus will be used for surveillance and reconnaissance , communications relay and environmental monitoring with the potential for roles in global climate change research and regional - scale telecommunications .
Each autonomous section of the plane has three high efficiency electric brushless motors turning Low Reynolds number propellers giving the aircraft the ability to cruise at 63 m/s during daytime and 45 m/s during nighttime and carry a payload of 500kg .
The onboard batteries are designed to be recharged each day via double sided cells optimized for energy collection efficiency at high latitudes , and adding to the redundancy built in to the plane 's architecture , Odysseus ' electronics are adapted from spacecraft designs which have already proven their reliability in missions lasting several years .
One of three contractors recently chosen for the Vulture program ( along with Boeing and Lockheed Martin ) , Aurora Flight Sciences will develop a half scale demonstrator followed by a full scale prototype aircraft in 5 years .
The company was formed in 1989 by the former head of the Daedalus Project , Dr. John S. Langford , and several colleagues from M.I.T. and Harvard .
BAE Systems ( sensors and concept of operations ) , C.S. Draper Laboratories ( ultra - high - reliability electronic controls ) , and Sierra Nevada Corporation ( the rendezvous and docking system ) will also contribute to the Odysseus program .
There ’s some tweets and such like about Ecmascript Harmony today .
I also saw a nice demo of Ecmascript 1.7 goods today .
Really , I ca n’t get excited about future versions of Ecmascript and ca n’t get emotionally all in a tangle about the trials and tribulations of Ecmascript .
I mean , Javascript is arguably the most popular language in the world , so it ’s cool to know it ’s maturing over time .
But , you know , I ’m only interested in learning about a language ( version / dialect ) when at least one of the following applies :
It can be used in practice , today .
Learning it will broaden my mind in some way .
Using it in practice , today ?
No .
New versions of Ecmascript cannot really be used today , not by me anyway .
I mostly write public web apps and enterprise web apps , and in both cases , it ’s essential to target Internet Explorer .
Ecmascript version N is only worth learning when most of the world has abandoned every version of IE prior to that which supports version N.
When you see a new specification being mooted , you have about 10 years of thinking music before the spec is actually released ( 2 - 4 years ) , integrated into all major browsers ( 0 - 5 years if ever ) , and moreover , previous versions have died out ( 5+ years ) .
Maybe as society accelerates to the singularity , these lengths will become shorter and you ’ll be able to deploy a new version of Ecmascript three times a week .
For now , though , it ’s fairly pointless from a practical perspective .
If you take an agile attitude , why bother investing the time and focusing on something that end up changing or being abandoned altogether ?
Okay , this is exaggerated - there are people who can put in practice new versions fairly quickly .
Firefox is not only quick to incorporate new versions of Ecmascript , but also happens to be a platform where browser - specific code is sometimes warranted .
I refer to browser extensions ( and , relatedly , Greasemonkey scripts ) .
If you happen to be writing Firefox browser extensions , you might choose to use Ecmascript as soon as it ’s baked into Firefox .
You ’ll still be breaking compatibility with previous versions , but Firefox users constantly update anyway .
This will continue to be the case for as long as most global enterprises force their workers to install Firefox on the sly .
Which will be a long time .
So you can happily use the latest Ecmascript if you ’re writing extensions .
There are also people targeting the Flash platform for whom all this stuff is more important today .
Not me , not right now .
The other case , of course , is when you ’re using Ecmascript outside of the browser .
e.g. server - side Javascript ( yum ! ) .
Entirely valid .
But this is still rare .
Learning it will broaden my mind ?
Not much .
Javascript is a quite interesting language , so new features will be interesting too .
But not hugely , since Javascript is n’t that different from other dynamic languages .
And most Ecmascript enhancements are either trying to mould JS into Python or the Java / C++/C* OO model .
So they ’re not about creating interesting “ native ” features .
You ’d be better off learning something completely different in order to expand your coding brain .
Try one of these .
I mean , do n't get me wrong
Do n’t get me wrong .
The thought leaders need to be thinking about this stuff and making the long term efforts .
But for the average Ajaxer on the street , it ’s all thirsty fish in the desert sand .
Feds predict $ 4.15 gas while Senate GOP kills energy plan As Senate fight rages , feds predict $ 4.15 - a- gallon gas
GOP blocks energy package containing new taxes on big oil
WASHINGTON — Government forecasters Tuesday predicted American motorists would see $ 4.15 - a- gallon gas by summer 's end , but lawmakers trying to respond to consumer anger over fuel prices were stuck in idle .
In a fuel - fight steeped as much in election - year politics as energy policy , senators jousted Tuesday over a doomed Democratic energy package intended to slap new taxes on the major oil companies .
In the end , Senate Republicans successfully blocked any action on the bill , although lawmakers took the opportunity to engage in the kind of rhetoric that has characterized the two parties ' continuing debate over what to blame for soaring energy prices — restrictions on exploration or oil company greed .
But behind the scenes , lawmakers were working to craft a compromise plan that would try to rein in some of the speculators that many experts believe have helped send oil prices skyward .
" I think we could come to a consensus on the speculators issue , " said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas .
The confrontation on the Senate floor came on a day when the U.S. Energy Information Administration had more bad news for consumers : gasoline prices , the agency said , will peak at $ 4.15 in August and average $ 3.92 in 2009 .
Previously , agency analysts had predicted gasoline prices would have topped out by now .
On Tuesday , regular gas was selling for a record $ 4.04 a gallon nationwide , according to AAA 's Daily Fuel Gauge Report , and an all - time high of nearly $ 3.91 a gallon in Houston .
Oil prices , meanwhile , are expected to average $ 122 a barrel this year — $ 50 higher than the 2007 average — and climb to $ 126 a barrel in 2009 , the Energy Information Administration said .
Just a month ago , agency analysts thought oil prices might soften next year .
Light , sweet crude for July delivery fell $ 3.04 Tuesday to close at $ 131.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
What the bill proposed
Lawmakers are getting an earful from constituents about gas prices .
" You go to weddings and christenings and people are saying , ' What about gas prices , ' " said Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y .
" It 's on everyone 's lips . "
Sen .
John Cornyn , R - Texas , said the worries about high prices were evident in conversations he had with constituents this week at the Houston Food Bank .
" This is not an esoteric debate here in Congress , " Cornyn said .
Democrats launched the skirmish by bringing up an energy package they were all but certain would be unacceptable to Republicans .
Calling for " oil company accountability , " the Democrats proposed hitting the five largest oil companies with a 25 percent windfall profits tax unless the companies increased investments in renewable energy and refining capacity .
The measure also would have gutted $ 17 billion in oil company tax breaks .
And the legislation would have made price gouging a federal crime and branded as illegal efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to control the price of oil worldwide .
The proposal attracted an immediate veto threat from the White House .
" Rather than addressing the principal cause of fuel price increases — rising world petroleum demand without a similar increase in supply — ( the bill would ) undercut U.S. energy security and decrease U.S. energy production , thus exacerbating market tightness and increasing energy prices , " the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement .
A 51 - 43 procedural vote in the Senate was insufficient to avoid a GOP filibuster .
Senate Republicans also blocked any action on a second bill that would have extended tax credits for renewable and alternative energy sources .
Republicans , who have dismissed the Democratic - led House and Senate as a " drill - nothing Congress , " are calling for oil and gas exploration in offshore areas where drilling is n't permitted now and in Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Democrats have made clear they hope to hammer Republicans with these energy provisions throughout the summer and into the fall .
" We believe if we bring this up again and again and again , they 'll break , " Schumer said .
This energy package , he said , " is politically the most damaging to them . "
Speculators targeted
The two senators expected to claim their parties ' presidential nominations — Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain — did not participate in the voting Tuesday .
The Democratic package also would have tried to cool speculative trading in the oil markets by preventing traders from routing transactions through offshore markets and requiring them to put down more money to trade in energy futures .
This was the only part of the bill that did not prompt a veto threat , although the White House was not fond of the language .

September 15th was the 45 year anniversarry of the 16th Street Church Bombing .
Some background , for those who do n’t know .
In 1963 , a group of white men who were members of the KKK planted bombs in a black church on a Sunday morning .
When the bomb went off it destroyed a good portion of the church , blew out the windows of nearby buildings , and instantly killed four young girls .
I guess those uppity negros learned their lesson , right ?
It took decades for all of the men involved in the bombing to be arrested , tried , and convicted .
Even though they bragged about it to friends and family .
Even though the FBI had evidence that they did it .
Why did it take so long ?
Not just because it was the South in the 60s , which was bad enough , but because dear old J Edgar Hoover saw fit to withold that evidence from prosecutors .
Just so you understand what I ’m saying : in 1963 officers of our government purposefully withheld evidence that these men were guilty of killing four young girls and injuring at least 22 others because the government officials in question were dirty , racist bastards .
It was n’t until 1978 that the first of the murdering psychopaths was put in jail , and it was n’t until 2002 when two others finally had their asses handed to them .
The forth one died before he could be convicted .
1978
2002
This is how long families had to wait for justice .
I told you that story to tell you this one .
On Friday , September 26 , the end of a week in which thousands of copies of Obsession : Radical Islam ’s War Against the West — the fear - mongering , anti-Muslim documentary being distributed by the millions in swing states via DVDs inserted in major newspapers and through the U.S. mail — were distributed by mail in Ohio , a “ chemical irritant ” was sprayed through a window of the Islamic Society of Greater Dayton , where 300 people were gathered for a Ramadan prayer service .
The room that the chemical was sprayed into was the room where babies and children were being kept while their mothers were engaged in prayers .
A Kos diarist posted about it , and the local Dayton media reported on it , but a cursory Google News search shows that hardly anyone is reporting on this .
Someone , or a group of someones , attacked children in a house of worship .
Could have , and probably intended to kill children and adults in a house of worship .
What the fuck is wrong with this goddamned country .
And no , I do not care if at some time or in some place a Muslim individual has also killed or harmed children or people in a house of worship .
That does not fucking excuse this behavior .
It is not ever , EVER okay to respond to ideological differences of opinion or faith by ATTEMPTING TO KILL PEOPLE .
Attacking children in a house of worship is on a short list of things that make you so worthless that shit starts to look like a good candidate for president .
And how many years do you think it will take for these families to see justice for this ?
How many more years do we have of it being all right to attack Muslims or people we think might be Muslims the way it was completely okay to attack black people in 1963 ?
Which government officials will claim the glorious honor of being the ones to hush up evidence , or turn a blind eye , or just not give a shit hard enough in the victims ’ general direction ?
People who might be Muslim , or Arab , or look kinda Muslim or Arab or brown or strange have been sent to Guantanamo for being on the wrong side of the street on a Tuesday .
If we ever deign to catch these worthless bastards , will our government prosecute them as terorists ?
Or will they decline to even label it a hate crime ?
People ( usually white people ) often wonder why I ’m not patriotic .
This .
Is .
Why .
If you won the lottery , how much would you spend on an entertainment room ?
Probably less than music producer Jeremy Kipnis .
He has put a cool $ 6 million into his “ home theater ” .
What do you get for $ 6 Million ?
How about a Stewart Snowmatte laboratory - grade screen , a Sony ultra - high - resolution 4,096 x 2,160 digital projector , 30 amplifiers (! ) , 16 subwoofers , 10 tweeters and 8 tower speakers
The home theater , which he calls “ Kipnis ’ outer limits theater ” , is an 8.8 channel channel audio system ( although there are a lot more speaker than that ) and delivers a frequency response of 10 Hz to 100 kHz .
The amplifiers are a combo of audiophile tube and solid state technology , and can deliver a mind - blowing 11,000 watts of power into audio geek level speakers .
The room is 33 feet long , 26.5 feet wide and goes from 8 feet high in the back to an 18 foot high screen at the other screen end of the room .
Of course even the power conditioners is top - notch ( 13,800 volt step - down transformers ) , and even all the cabling is super high end , right to the cryogenically - treated breakers .
He is n’t using the same $ 1.80 HDMI cable ( really , it ’s that cheap ) that we mere mortals tend to buy .

Terrified Mexicans splash out on chip implants so satellites can trace them if they 're kidnapped
Middle - class families in Mexico are having tiny transmitters implanted under their skin so that satellites can track them if they are kidnapped .
Sales of the device have jumped by 13 per cent this year after kidnappings surged by almost 40 per cent in the country between 2004 and 2007 .
The crystal - encased chip , which is the size and shape of a grain of rice , is injected into clients ' bodies with a syringe .
A transmitter in the chip sends radio signals to a device , carried by the client , with a global positioning system in it , say makers Xega .
A satellite can then pinpoint the kidnap victim 's location .
Kidnap appeal : A victim 's family used a giant billboard depicting a member of the gang which took their son in Mexico City
Detractors say the chips , which cost £ 2,000 plus an annual fee of £ 1,100 , give a false sense of security .
Mexico ranks with conflict zones such as Iraq and Colombia as among the worst countries for abductions .
One client , Cristina , 28 , who did not want to give her last name , said : ' It 's not like we are wealthy , but they 'll kidnap you for a watch .
Everyone is living in fear .'
The recent kidnapping and murder of Fernando Marti , 14 , the son of a well - known businessman , sparked an outcry in a country already hardened to crime .
Target : Businessman Alejandro Marti , centre , whose 14 - year - old son Fernando was kidnapped
Most kidnappings in Mexico go unreported , many of them cases of ' express kidnapping ' where the victim is grabbed and forced to withdraw money from automatic cash machines .
Official statistics show 751 kidnappings in the country last year , but the independent crime research institute ICESI says the number could have exceeded 7,000 .
Xega , based in the central Mexican city of Quererato , designed global positioning systems to track stolen vehicles until a company owner was kidnapped in broad daylight in 2001 .
Frustrated by his powerlessness to call for help , the company adapted the technology to track stolen people .
Most people get the chips injected into their arms between the skin and muscle where they can not be seen .
Customers who fear they are being kidnapped press a panic button on an external device to alert Xega , which then calls the police .
Chips are down : AGPS satellite like this one is used to pinpoint where potential hostages are
' Before , they only kidnapped key , well - known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners .
Now they are kidnapping people from the middle class , ' said Sergio Galvan , Xega 's commercial director .
Katherine Albrecht , a U.S. consumer privacy activist , says the chip is a flashy , overpriced gadget that only identifies a person and cannot locate someone without another , bigger GPS device that kidnappers can easily find and destroy .
She said fear of kidnapping was driving well - off Mexicans to buy a technology that had yet to prove useful .
' They are a prime target because they 've got money and they 've got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is , ' she said .
President Felipe Calderon has come under heavy pressure to stamp out violent crime .
He hosted a meeting on Thursday of security chiefs and state governors .
Outside of Mexico , U.S. company VeriChip Corp uses similar radio - wave technology to identify patients in critical condition at hospitals or find elderly people who wander away from their homes .
Xega sees kidnapping as a growth industry and is planning to expand its services next year to Brazil , Colombia and Venezuela .

Is there a mystery woman in Cindy McCain 's life ?
And why does she look so familiar ?
Hmmmm ? ( see photo here )
Last Tuesday , NPR broadcast a story about Cindy McCain 's business and charity work .
In it , Ted Robbins described McCain as the only child of Jim Hensley , a wealthy Arizona businessman .
The next morning , NPR received an e-mail from Nicholas Portalski of Phoenix , who heard the story with his mother .
" We were listening to the piece about Cindy McCain on NPR , All Things Considered , and it just struck us very hard , " Portalski said .
His mother , Kathleen Hensley Portalski , is also Hensley 's daughter .
:: brakes screeeeeeeeeech !!::
Huh ?
Cindy Lou has a sister ?
Since when ?
And where , why , has she been hiding her ?
The Portalski family is accustomed to hearing Cindy McCain described as Hensley 's only child .
She 's been described that way by news organizations from The New Yorker and The New York Times to Newsweek and ABC .
McCain herself routinely uses the phrase " only child , " as she did on CNN last month .
" I grew up with my dad , " she said then .
" I 'm an only child .
My father was a cowboy , and he really loved me very much , but I think he wanted a son occasionally .
" McCain 's father was also a businessman — and twice a father .
Why oh why are they shunning Kathleen ?
Are they ashamed of her ?
She 's not Republican or wealthy enough for them ?
Not enough face lifts ?
No P.O.W. creds ?
Ca n't draw crosses in dirt ?
" I'm upset , " Kathleen Portalski says .
" I 'm angry .
It makes me feel like a nonperson , kind of . "
Uh , yeah , one might be a tad upset if one 's very famous , dare I say " celebrity " , sister of beer wealth / presidential nominee wife fame is ignoring her very existence .
Documents show Kathleen Anne Hensley was born to Jim and Mary Jeanne Hensley on Feb. 23 , 1943 .
They had been married for six years when Kathleen was born .
Jim Hensley was a bombardier on a B - 17 , flying over Europe during World War II .
He was injured and sent to a facility in West Virginia to recuperate .
During that time , while still married to Mary Jeanne , Hensley met another woman — Marguerite Smith .
Jim divorced Mary Jeanne and married Marguerite in 1945 .
Wowzers !
He 's just like Cindy 's husband , John Sidney McAdulterer !
They have so much in common , you 'd think they'd be the closest sisters ever , would n't you ?
Cindy Lou Hensley was born nine years later , in 1954 .
She may have grown up as an only child , but so did her half sister , Kathleen , who was raised by a single parent .
Portalski says she did see her father and her half sister from time to time .
" I saw him a few times a year , " she says .
" I saw him at Christmas and birthdays , and he provided money for school clothes , and he called occasionally . "
The monetary gifts lasted 10 years .
And then daddykins got really rich and the payments stopped .
But wait !
Our soap opera , " As the Beer Ferments " , is only just beginning :
When Hensley died in 2000 , his will named not only Portalski but also a daughter of his wife Marguerite from her earlier marriage .
So , Cindy McCain may be the only product of Jim and Marguerite 's marriage , but she is not the only child of either .
She was , however , the sole inheritor of his considerable estate .
Kathleen Portalski was left $ 10,000 , and her children were left nothing .
It 's a fact Nicholas Portalski says his sister discovered the hard way .
" What she found in town — on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral — was that the credit card did n't work anymore , " Nick says .
Looks like they treated Kathleen the way J Sid treats most of America .
They also say they are Democrats , but Nicholas Portalski says he had another reason for coming forward .
" The fact that we do n't exist , " he says .
" The fact that we 've never been recognized , and then Cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something that 's not true .
Recently , again and again .
It 's just very , very hurtful . "
Kathleen Portalski says she 'd like an acknowledgment and an apology .
NPR asked the McCain campaign — specifically , Cindy McCain — to comment or respond .
Neither replied .
Lying and deception is everywhere in the John Sidney McCain / Cindy Lou Hensley household .
No telling what you 'll find if you look hard enough .

Medical researchers are homing in on a new wonder drug that can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease , cancer , diabetes and many other diseases – sunshine .
A study released today found that men who are deficient in the so - called sunshine vitamin , vitamin D , have more than double the normal risk of suffering a heart attack .
Another study last week found that low levels of vitamin D increase the risk of diabetes , and a study last month linked deficiencies to an increased risk of dying from breast cancer .
The findings join a body of evidence indicating that an adequate level of the vitamin , which most people can get from 20 daily minutes in the sun , is crucial to maintaining good health .
“ We do n’t have a cause - and - effect relationship here yet , ” said biochemist Hector DeLuca of the University of Wisconsin , to prove that higher doses of vitamin D prevent these diseases .
DeLuca was the first to demonstrate how the vitamin interacts with the endocrine system , which manages the body ’s hormonal balance .
But the links are so suggestive “ that we have to pay attention to keeping blood levels up where they will protect , ” he said .
Until recently , vitamin D was viewed primarily as a protective agent against diseases of the bone , such as rickets , osteomalacia and osteoporosis .
Recommendations for the vitamin are based on preventing these disorders and call for a small intake – a minimum of 400 international units ( IUs ) per day and perhaps twice that for elderly people .
The primary sources of vitamin D in the diet are milk , which is fortified to yield about 100 IUs per glass , and oily fishes , which have a high content .
To have an adequate intake , most people must take supplements or spend more time in the sun – a recommendation that dermatologists generally oppose because of the risk of skin cancer .
In the new analysis , Dr. Edward Giovannucci of the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues studied 18,225 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow - up study , a subgroup of a larger ongoing study .
For a cool $ 1000 , you can buy the Sonos Bundle 150 and wirelessly play music from a single remote control in two separate rooms in your house .
On the other hand , for about $ 100 or less if you 've already got the right equipment , you can get the same functionality from your iPhone or iPod touch .
Let 's take a closer look at how to use the iTunes Remote application for the iPhone 2.0 with inexpensive equipment you may already have to remote control music playback wirelessly in any room in your home .

The Sonos homepage describes its popular but expensive product thusly :
To start playing music , just grab the full - color wireless Controller and simply pick a room , pick a song and hit play .
With the Controller in hand you 'll have instant access to your entire music collection ....
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
When you 're done here , any iPhone or iPod touch will do exactly the same thing , in addition to all that email , calendar , internet , and mapping functionality that 's made them so popular already — and for hundreds of dollars less .
You can play music in any room individually , or in several rooms with the music playback synced between rooms .
The special sauce in this setup is a feature of Apple 's AirPort Express wireless routers called AirTunes , which streams iTunes music wirelessly over your home network to any room in your house .
AirTunes is n't new by any means , but with the advent of the new Remote app for the iPhone and iPod touch running 2.0 software , its usefulness has increased dramatically ; it 's become a Sonos killer .

What You 'll Need
I 'm going to price out the cheapest ( or nearly cheapest ) version of this setup , including the price of the iPhone or iPod touch .
If you already have any of the necessary equipment , the price drops significantly .
Advertisement
1. iPhone or iPod touch : $ 199 ( 8GB iPhone minus wireless costs ) or $ 299 ( 8GB touch )
2. Linksys WRT54GL Wireless Router : $ 50 ( not the only supported router ; see below )
3. Headphone - to - RCA
Cable : $ 2 ( I 'm estimating , but you can get these things cheap at your local RadioShack . )
4. Apple AirPort Express : $ 100
Advertisement
Grand Total : $ 351 ( iPhone ) or $ 451 ( iPod touch )
Cutting Costs
I actually had all of these things on hand , so it did n't cost me a dime .
If you 've already got an iPhone or iPod touch , the price drops to a meager $ 151 for the router , headphone - to - RCA cord , and AirPort Express router .
Advertisement
The Linksys WRT54GL router is not required , but it 's inexpensive and it's what I 'm using .
It 's likely you 've already got a basic wireless router on your home network , and as long as you can set it up as a Wireless Distribution System ( WDS ) , you probably wo n't need to buy a new router .
The Apple AirPort Extreme ( $ 180 ) is the easiest to set up with an AirPort Express , naturally .
In my setup below , I used the much cheaper , much cooler WRT54GL running the free , open - source Tomato router firmware ( which I showed you how to install here ) .
The previously mentioned DD - WRT firmware supports WDS as well .
If your current router supports WDS , you can shave an extra $ 50 off the setup price .

Because it 's made specifically to extend iTunes wirelessly , the $ 100 AirPort Express wireless router is the one must - have piece of equipment — no substitutions here .
You 'll need one for every additional set of speakers you want to add to your set wireless remote control setup .
( Of course you can find them cheaper on Craigslist or eBay . )
The added bonus to all of this is that we 're setting up the AirPort Express as a wireless network bridge .
That means that not only will it give you the very cool music functionality — it'll also extend the range of your wireless network by boosting your signal in the room you 've got it installed .
It 'll still show up as one Wi -Fi network to all of your wireless devices , so you do n't have to do anything special to take advantage of it once you 've set it up .

Gather Your Setup Information
Before you get started tweaking settings , let 's write down a few important bits of information to make things easier on us down the road .
You may find this information in varying places depending on your base router , but the information you need to gather is the same .
Advertisement
First , head to the Basic Network settings page ( Tomato link ) on your router and find the section Wireless section .
Copy your Wireless MAC address , which should look something like XX:00 :X0:0X:00 :XX .
Also write down your SSID and Channel , and take note of your B/G mode .
Advertisement
Next , plug your AirPort Express into a power outlet and connect it to your router with an Ethernet cable .
( I 'm setting up the AirPort Express on a Mac , but it should work similarly on a Windows PC . )
Open the AirPort Utility , and after a few seconds it should scan and recognize your AirPort Express on your network .
Once it does , click on the Express in the AirPort Utility sidebar and write down the AirPort ID ( which is really just the MAC address ) .
Advertisement
Now that you 've got all that , you 're ready for the heavy lifting .
Set Up Your Base Router
This setup should work with any router that supports WDS — check your router 's manual and / or administration interface to find out if it does .
If you want to follow along exactly with me , I 'm using the open - source Tomato firmware ( if you do n't have it installed on a supported device , here 's how ) .
Advertisement
Return to the Basic Network settings page ( Tomato link ) .
The first thing you need to do is change your Wireless Mode to Access Point +
WDS .
Advertisement
Next head down to the Security section and change your wireless security type to WEP if it's not what you 're using already .
Set a passphrase and generate your keys ( or just let Tomato randomly choose a secure option for you ) .
Copy down your first key — you 'll need it later to set up the AirPort Express and to connect other devices to your wireless network ( including your iPhone or iPod touch ) .
Advertisement
( NOTE : WEP security was an unfortunate concession ; I normally recommend the more secure WPA2 Personal , but I had trouble getting the AirPort Express to connect correctly as a wireless bridge using WPA2 security .
WEP 128 , on the other hand , worked fine . )
Advertisement
Finally , move down to the WDS section and enter the MAC address of your AirPort Express ( the AirPort ID we wrote down earlier ) .
Make sure the drop - down is set to Link With .
Once you 've finished all these steps , hit Save at the bottom of the page .
Your router will update your settings , and you 're ready to set up the AirPort Express .
Set Up Your AirPort Express Router
Advertisement
Start up the AirPort Utility , again with the AirPort Express plugged into your main router with an Ethernet cord .
Click the AirPort Express name in the sidebar .
This time , click the Manual Setup button .
We 'll be making a lot of changes in the AirPort Express setup to get it working as a wireless bridge ( and iTunes extender ) , so make sure you 've got the information we gathered above on hand .
Advertisement
First , click the Base Station tab and give your AirPort Express a name ( this is the name that will show up in iTunes and on your iPhone remote ) .
I chose Living Room , because that 's where my AirPort Express will be .
Next , set a password for the AirPort Express .
This password is n't actually important for our setup as far as I can tell , but it 's unavoidable .
Make it anything you want .
Advertisement
Now head to the Wireless tab and change the Wireless Mode drop - down to Participate in a WDS network .
Set the network name to the SSID , the Radio Mode to the wireless B/G mode , and the channel to match the broadcast channel of your base router as you wrote them down above .
Set your wireless security to WEP 128 bit , and enter the key you generated above .
Now click on the WDS tab , where you should select WDS remote in the WDS Mode drop - down and paste your base router 's MAC address ( the one we wrote down above ) in the text box labeled WDS Main .
Advertisement
Next click on the Internet tab at the top of the AirPort Utility .
You should n't have to do much here , but make sure that you 're connecting using WDS ( you should n't have a choice at this point ) , set Configure IPv4 to " Using DHCP , " and set Connection Sharing to Off ( Bridge Mode ) .
Advertisement
At this point , you 've got just one more thing left to do .
Go to the Music tab and tick the checkbox next to Enable AirTunes .
If you want to , set a speaker password ( I would n't unless you 've got a good reason to ) .
Advertisement
Once you 've done all that , click the Update button .
The AirPort Utility will update your AirPort Express with all your new settings and your AirPort Express will restart .
If everything went as planned , your AirPort Express is now set up as a wireless bridge for your base router , and you 're ready to stream your music wirelessly to any room in your house .
( Hint : Your router will glow amber until it 's working , at which point it 'll glow green .
If it 's flashing amber , that means there was a problem . )
Hook Up the AirPort Express to Your Stereo
Unplug your AirPort Express from the router and the power outlet and move it to wherever you plan on setting it up ( mine 's behind my TV ) .
Plug it in , and plug the headphone - to - RCA converter into it and your stereo .
If you have a fancier stereo than I do , the AirPort Express supports digital signals , so the right kind of S / PDIF cord would work as well .
Advertisement
Enable AirTunes in iTunes
Advertisement
The next to last thing you need to do is open up the iTunes preferences and tell your computer to look for remote speakers with iTunes .
You 'll find this checkbox in the Advanced tab of the iTunes preferences .
Advertisement
Once this is done , you 've already got wireless streaming set up in iTunes .
When it 's working , you should see a drop - down in the bottom right corner of iTunes where you can choose which speaker set you want playing or choose multiple speakers .
Finally , it 's time to set up our iPhone or iPod touch as remotes .
Install and Set Up Remote on Your iPhone or iPod touch
Advertisement
After all the sweat you 've put in so far , this step is dead simple .
We 've already covered how to set up the Remote App on your iPhone , so I wo n't go into all the details here .
Once Remote is set up and running on your iPhone or iPod touch , you can play back and remotely control your entire iTunes library from anywhere in your house you 've got an AirPort Express set up .
To toggle your speakers , just hit Settings in the Remote app and toggle the speakers on or off .
Advertisement
How Does It Work ?
After a short time , I can tell you nothing feels better on an afternoon of household chores than walking around your home to a unified soundtrack in every room .
I 've only got one AirPort Express with AirTunes set up on my network , but you could easily add more rooms and speakers at just $ 100 or so a pop .
If I 'm just going to be hanging out in the living room , I 'll turn off the computer speakers and just play from there .
Likewise , the music stays at my computer when that 's where I am .

The iPhone Remote app also works with the Apple TV , but I have n't tried it with this setup .
If you have — or you 've done multi-room remote control with your iPhone or iPod touch and AirTunes — share your experience in the comments .

As Murray Waas wrote about yesterday , Attorney General Michael Mukasey , acting on the guidance of the DoJ Inspector General , has decided to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the USA firing scandal .
Unfortunately , there will be no grand jury for Gonzo .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Bloomberg :
Attorney General Michael Mukasey named a special prosecutor to investigate possible crimes arising from the Bush administration 's firing of nine U.S. attorneys .
An internal Justice Department review of the dismissals recommended the appointment today after finding there was a possibility officials made false statements , obstructed justice or committed wire fraud .
The report said the matter warranted further investigation by an attorney who has the ability to compel witnesses to cooperate .
" The Justice Department has an obligation to the American people to pursue this case wherever the facts and the law require , '' Mukasey said in a statement .
PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain is working hard to win over supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton who may not be ready to back Sen. Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee .
Sen . John McCain is reaching out to Democrats who backed Sen. Hillary Clinton .
McCain reached out to Clinton 's base this week by resurrecting Obama 's controversial comments during the primaries that blue - collar voters " bitter " about the nation 's economy were " clinging " to guns and religion .
" I do n't agree with Sen .
Obama that they cling to their religion and the Constitution because they are bitter , " McCain said Wednesday in Philadelphia .
On the economy , McCain also told voters he understands the pain caused by rising gas prices , but he did n't mention his proposal for a gas tax " holiday . "
His advisers had said it was a winning argument that he would be pushing all week .
The presumptive GOP nominee spoke off the cuff Wednesday instead of a planned speech on climate change .
The town hall - type meeting was in the style of campaigning with which McCain is the most comfortable and an attempt , his advisers admit , to recover from last week 's stumbles when he read from a teleprompter .
Watch how McCain tries to get back on message »
At an event Tuesday in Washington , McCain said he would " veto every beer " that contained earmarks during a speech on economic issues .
McCain has been pushing for a series of town hall meetings with Obama in which the two candidates would take audience questions .
The Obama campaign has said the senator from Illinois is interested in the idea , but the two sides have not agreed to a specific format .
Watch the candidates spar over the economy »
McCain also was knocked off his message Wednesday when NBC's Matt Lauer asked him whether he had an estimated date for U.S. troops to begin returning home from Iraq .
McCain told the " Today " show host , " No , but that 's not too important .
What 's important is the casualties in Iraq .
Americans are in South Korea .
Americans are in Japan .
American troops are in Germany .
That 's all fine .
American casualties and the ability to withdraw ; we will be able to withdraw . "
Democrats quickly pounced on the " not too important " remarks .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said McCain 's statement showed that he " just does n't get the grave national security consequences of staying the course . "
Joe Biden of Delaware , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a former 2008 Democratic presidential candidate , said , " Sen. McCain 's comment is evidence that he is totally out of touch with the needs of our troops and the national security needs of our nation .
I think many of our brave soldiers and their families would disagree that it's ' not too important ' when they come home . "
The Democrats ' reaction recalled what happened in January when McCain tried to make a similar point , saying he was OK if the U.S. stayed in Iraq " for 50 years , maybe 100 . "
" As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed , it 's fine with me , and I hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training , recruiting , equipping and motivating people every single day , " McCain said then .
The latest Democratic attacks forced the McCain campaign to scramble and pull together a conference call with reporters to fight back .
The call featured allies who said the candidate 's words had been distorted .
" I view the attacks on Sen. McCain this morning as another partisan attempt ... to distract the American people from the fact that John McCain has been both courageous and right about the ' surge ' in Iraq , and Barack Obama has , unfortunately , been consistently wrong , " Sen .
Joe Lieberman said during the call , referring to the boost of additional troops in Iraq last year .
" I mean , the obvious fact is that , more than most any American , Sen .
McCain knows the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make and the burden that their families bear .
And it really is wrong to suggest otherwise , " Lieberman said , noting that McCain 's son Jimmy has served with the Marines in Iraq .
McCain chose his words on the Iraq war more carefully at the town hall meeting later Wednesday in Philadelphia , saying the current strategy that increased troop levels was working .
" Sen . Obama claims it 's not succeeding in defiance of all the facts on the ground .
Is it long , hard and difficult , and are the causalities painful to us , even one ?
Of course . "
By Thursday , McCain was back on message , pointing out the length of time since the Democrat had visited Iraq and questioning his leadership .
" There is no disputing the facts on the ground , " McCain said in Boston , Massachusetts .
" We 're now in the 800 and something or other day since Sen . Obama has visited Iraq , even before the surge even began .
And incredibly , he has still not asked to sit down with Gen . [ David ]
Petraeus , our commanding general , and asked to be briefed by him on the situation in Iraq . "

Where There ’s Smoke , There ’s Government Intrusion
by John R. Lott , Jr. by John R. Lott , Jr.
DIGG THIS
This is still a free country , right ?
Last week , the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to more closely regulate the wages that firms pay workers and to more strictly regulate tobacco products by putting them under FDA supervision .
The Los Angeles City Council also approved a one - year moratorium on new fast - food restaurants in a 32 - square - mile low - income area in the city ; the poor , after all , have above - average rates of obesity  and must be protected from themselves .
Perhaps the government may just want to ask people if they are poor before we let them enter certain restaurants .
Barack Obama promises a national ban on smoking in public places .
Such micro-managing of people ’s behavior will likely only get worse , as anyone who has been to countries such as Sweden can attest .
When I visited Sweden in back in 1979 , Swedes were worried that binge drinkers were damaging their health .
But should n’t how much people drink in the privacy of their own home be their own business ?
Not to other Swedes , who worried that the government health care system meant they would have to pick up others ’ medical costs .
I watched the television news in horror as police broke into homes and took people to detox centers after neighbors alerted the government to people who they felt were drinking too much .
But they were equally outraged that people would do things to their bodies that would make others pay for their health care .
The Democrats ’  Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act is a strange creature .
It prevents the FDA from banning existing tobacco products .
However , products introduced after Feb. 15 , 2007 , must receive FDA approval , a process that may take up to a couple of years even to start .
The bill allows the remaining forms of advertising and the promotion of cigarettes to be banned .
The regulations would actually benefit existing tobacco companies , protecting them from competition .
Academic research has found that the 1970 TV and radio advertising ban actually increased tobacco company profits because it protected established brands from competition .
The FDA approval process for new cigarettes only adds to this protection .
Congressmen backing the legislation point to estimates that 400,000 people die each year from smoking .
But while smoking undoubtedly causes illnesses and deaths , it is hard to take such estimates seriously .
No matter what other risk factors a person might have , when a smoker dies , the death is attributed to tobacco .
But smokers are more likely to drink heavily , less likely to exercise , be overweight , and have poor nutritional habits .
If a smoker who is obese , never exercises and has a long family history of heart problems dies from a heart attack , why should it automatically be classified as due to smoking ?
The ultimate question , though , is whether we should let people make choices for themselves .
Should ice cream be banned ?
Surely it adds to obesity , causing some heart attacks .
But some people amazingly enough like the way ice cream tastes and are willing to take the risks .
Are they making a mistake ?
Smokers , like those who eat ice cream , have trade - offs .
Some might like the taste , others its calming effects .
But smoking may also reduce the risk of Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s diseases as well as cancers of the thyroid , breast and skin .
In any case , whether it is hang gliding or smoking , it ought to be the customers ’ preferences that count .
Proposals such as Obama ’s for a national ban on smoking in public places have their own problems .
The ultimate objection to smoking focuses on the harm that it imposes on others .
The evidence for harm from second - hand smoke is extremely weak , but , for the sake of argument , let ’s accept the claim .
Environmental problems arise because the costs of polluters ’ actions are passed on to other people .
The classic case is the common pool or overfishing problem .
Fishermen tend to overfish an area until the fishery is depleted .
If one fisherman lets a fish go so that it can spawn , there is no guarantee that another fisherman wo n’t catch that same fish .
But this problem is eliminated in privately - owned fisheries , such as private lakes or fish farms .
If a fishery is running low on fish , the owner can leave fish to spawn , knowing that no one else will catch them .
Outdoor air pollution suffers a similar common pool problem ; if too many individuals or companies emit too much pollution , the combined result can produce illness and even death .
Everything from cars to power plants emits byproducts that can be classified as harmful , but no one would argue that we should eliminate cars and power plants because their pollution costs outweigh all their benefits .
Similar to fishermen out at sea , individual car makers or factory owners are unlikely to take into account the cost that their pollution imposes upon others .
Altruism only goes so far .
This creates a legitimate space for government intervention — governments can regulate pollution levels by limiting , taxing , or otherwise restricting pollution emissions .
Allowing the government — whether federal , state , or local — to regulate pollution may be necessary , but we can only watch with dismay as the government uses this authority to steadily expand its coercive powers .
In doing so , it inevitably begins mandating solutions to tangential problems  that are best left to the market to solve .
Solutions that actually make the country poorer .
This is most evident today in the restaurant industry , where local governments are becoming increasingly intrusive in ensuring clean air .
A restaurant owner will face competitive pressures to decide whether his customers want to be allowed to smoke , just as he must figure out what food to serve , how big the portions will be , and what kind of décor to have .
Restaurants that do n’t satisfy their customers on these issues will quickly go out of business .
That ’s why smoking in restaurants should not be considered a common pool problem subject to government intervention .
Restaurants that allow smoking do n’t base their policy merely on their love of smokers ; they are responding to competitive pressures and customer preferences .
And , of course , the choice does n’t have to be between perfectly pristine air and air so cloudy that you ca n’t see more than a few feet ahead ; many restaurants simply create smoking and non-smoking sections .
But this solution , too , is outlawed by government smoking bans .
If restaurants can go out of business when they do n’t get small things right , such as whether to include an extra side dish with a meal or what kind of background music is played , why is there any less reason to believe their decision on smoking will likewise reflect customer demand ?
If anything , the fact that people feel so strongly about smoking — both for and against it — implies that restaurants will very carefully tailor their smoking policies to their customers ’ wishes .
The situation is no different for employees at the restaurant .
If employers provide a work environment that employees do n’t like ( say , because some object to smoky air ) , employers have to pay more to get people to work there .
Restaurant smoking is more like a private fishery than a common pool .
Nonsmokers may feel better off because of bans , but what they gain is less than what smokers lose .
If the opposite were true , it would n’t be necessary to impose the bans .

PRINCETON , NJ -- President George W. Bush 's disapproval rating is at 69 % -- which is not only the highest of the Bush administration , but the highest disapproval rating in Gallup Poll history .
President Bush 's approval rating now is at 28 % , which ties for the lowest of his administration , but is not the lowest in Gallup Poll history .
Harry Truman reached a 22 % approval rating in 1952 , and Richard Nixon had two 24 % job approval scores in 1974 .
In other words , although Bush 's disapproval rating is the highest in Gallup history , his approval rating is not the lowest .
This seeming anomaly is mostly because of differences over the years in the percentage of respondents who say " do n't know / no opinion " when asked to rate a president .
Harry Truman's 22 % approval rating was accompanied by a 64 % disapproval rating , leaving 14 % of those interviewed who did not offer an opinion about his job performance .
Richard Nixon 's two 24 % job approval ratings in 1974 were paired with 63 % and 66 % disapproval ratings , leaving 13 % and 10 % with no opinion .
In the most recent poll for Bush , his approval rating is 28 % while his disapproval rating is 69 % , leaving only 3.5 % ( rounded to 4 % ) who do n't have an opinion .
There is no single explanation for why the percentage who decline to give an opinion of the president 's job performance is lower now than in the past .
However , one hypothesis is as follows .
When Gallup polled in the Truman and Nixon years , respondents may have been more likely to say they did n't have an opinion in lieu of saying they disapproved of the president .
In other words , respondents who did not approve of the president 's performance -- rather than flat - out saying they disapproved -- may have simply told interviewers they did n't have an opinion .
Today , as the percentage of " no opinion " responses to the presidential job approval question has declined , Americans appear to be more willing to give a negative response , resulting in the situation in which Bush 's disapproval rating is at a record high while his approval rating is not at a record low .
Interviewing in the Truman and Nixon years was conducted in respondents ' homes rather than by telephone , which may be related to some differences in the percentages of respondents who gave " no opinion " answers to the job approval question .
But an interesting contrast is provided by polling conducted in the administration of the current president 's father , George H.W. Bush , who in one poll in 1992 had a 29 % approval rating -- only one point higher than his son 's current approval rating .
In that 1992 poll , the senior Bush had only a 60 % disapproval rating , leaving 11 % with no opinion , similar to the " no opinion " percentages in the Truman and Nixon polls .
Yet the 1992 poll was conducted by telephone in similar fashion to polling today , suggesting that the mode of interviewing per se is perhaps not the sole explanation for the differences over the years .
It may well be that the current president Bush is simply a more polarizing figure , one who generates strong opinions in the negative direction and therefore fewer ambivalent , no-opinion responses than was the case for George H.W. Bush , Truman , or Nixon at the nadirs of their administrations .
The bottom line remains that -- perhaps for several reasons -- the 69 % disapproval rating generated by the current president is the highest such rating recorded over the years in which Gallup has been measuring the public 's approval and disapproval of each president 's job performance .
Survey Methods
Results for the current poll , including the latest George W. Bush approval ratings , are based on telephone interviews with 1,016 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted April 18 - 20 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Macros
Yet another gr8 feature is VIM macros .
You can record a series of actions and use it whenever needed .
To Record :
q< handle > - handle is where you wanna record .
This will start to record your actions .
q again will stop recording .
qa will record to a , qf will record to f .
To Execute :
@ < handle > - handle is where the recording is :D
@a will execute the macro recorded in a , @f will execute the macro in f .
5 @a will execute the macro in a 5 times .
Example :
Suppose you want to comment printf in a couple of c files .
- Start VIM
- : grep -rn " printf " * ( - r is for grep_ing recursively )
- qc ( this will start recording to c )
- i ( now in insert mode )
- Type // ( commenting printf )
- ESC ( back in normal mode )
- :w ( save the file )
- q ( stop recording )
( Now c has the recorded data . )
- :cn ( go to the next place where printf is )
- @c ( will add the // and save the file )
- Repeat :)
Ctags
Ctags is a way to traverse source tree very easily and effectively .
You must install ctags before using .
You can get latest version
To generate tags , run ctags –R * at the parent directory .
- R - Recursive
* - All files
This will generate a file named tags in the parent directory .
Always start vim from the directory where the tags file is located to get the ctags functionality .
You can place the cursor under a variable or function and to jump to the definition ,
g ] OR CTRL + ]
It will go to the location ( file and line number ) where it is defined .
If there are multiple definitions , it will list all occurrences and you can select one giving its number .
To go back ,
CTRL + T OR CTRL + O .
You can directly go to a variable or function ,
vim –t < VARIABLE NAME >
If you are inside VIM , and you need to go to definition of a variable which is not under cursor ,
:ts < VARIABLE NAME >
The location to which ctags take you is based on the tags file .
So , as you change the code , you must update the tags file .
Yet another gr8 feature is VIM macros .
You can record a series of actions and use it whenever needed .

After the outstanding response to Part 2 , here is the Part 3 of the series on various Tips & Tricks for using VIM Effectively ... We can runandfrom inside VIM .
How ? :) Justorwith arguments ( of course ) : DMake
: It will executeand if any errors or warnings found , it will directly go the particular locations in the files !!!
Grep : It will executeand show each occurance in the files directly .
Do n’t forget to use -n option in grep ( it tells grep to show line numbers ) .
Once you are at the location of the first output entry , there are commands , very easy to remember .( see next ) - Go to the next entry ( see previous ) -
Go to the previous entry - Skip 4 entries forward - Skip 4 entries backward -
Go to entry 5 You can just browse through all the files and do modifications as you go :)
Save the modifications , else it will not jump to the next file :)
We do n’t attend to everything we see .
As Andy Clark has written in Natural Born Cyborgs , our brains do n’t bother to create rich inner models of the world .
We ca n’t create such models because there is simply too much information out there for us to process it all .
Further , the world is generally available to revisit periodically , so why bother ?
In other words , we use the world as its own best model–we “ cheat ” ( because we must cheat ) .
But this cheating can be exposed through dramatic experiments .
I ’ve previously posted on some of those experiments here ( by Quirkology ) .
Here are some additional experiments demonstrating our need to “ cheat . ”
In this experiment , done by Dan Simons and Dan Levin , only 50 % of the subjects noticed that the person to whom they were talking had changed .
Here are additional demonstrations by Simons , along with a bit of explanation .
Here ’s a more elaborate write - up on the “ door ” experiment .
And see here .
When I use the word “ cheat , ” I ’m being facetious .
Our strategy of using the world as an adequate model is one of the many cognitive heuristics we must use in order to survive .
Here is a another good example of “ change blindness ” for me ( I ’ll put the answer at the bottom of this post , in case you ’d like to try it ) .
This example ( and these ) were assembled by Ronald Resnick .
At this site , he explains that we need to attend in order to see change .
A related topic is our obliviousness to incremental change .
That was the subject of my post about the disappearance of tigers .
Here are several dramatic demonstrations of our inability to notice gradual changes [ watch them in real time ; if you do n’t notice the changes – I didn ’ t–grab the “ knob ” on the progress bar and slide it quickly ] .
I ’ve often considered the moral an political ramification of our limited ability to attend to all of our surroundings .
That we focus on some things to the exclusion of others , and that we are limited in our ability to attend to all of our surroundings , makes us susceptible to many bad arguments .
This susceptibility is dramatic because we also carry around a prejudice that we have full knowledge ( or , at least , adequate knowledge ) where ever we go .
We are epistemologically cocky , and this makes us vulnerable .
We can be led to focus only on some data , to the exclusion of other data .
Magicians take good advantage of this tendency .
So do some politicians , who lead us to focus only on human differences , rather than the vast number of things humans have in common ( Bill Clinton once gave a moving speech on this issue ) .
I ’ve long believed that attentional frailties , combined with fatigue and the illusion of adequate knowledge , are the battleground for many moral and political issues .
[ Hint : The airplane engine disappears ] .
I was recently notified – somewhat to my suprise – that the Japanese publisher Ohmsha is publishing a Japanese translation of Practical Common Lisp which should now be avaliable in bookstores and on amazon.
co.jp .
I had known that there was a small group working on a translation but had n’t realized they had found a publisher .
My thanks to those translators and to Masako Omata at Franz who , as I understand it , did a fair bit of work to make it all happen .
I got my copy in the mail the other day .
Looks good though I ca n’t say much about the quality of the translation other than that it seems to contain quite a number of Japanese characters .
I ’ll be interested to hear from any Japanese readers what they think of it .

Anderson Cooper Rants About Living Lohan ( Video )
guest hosted today withon Live with Regis and Kelly .
Filling in for , Cooper became very expansive about reality television .
He reports that It 's Complicated starring Denise Richards is really quite good but he has some real problems with Living Lohan .
Anderson used some interesting phrases to capture the essence of Dina Lohan and her family : ' a train wreck ' , ' atrocious ' , ' horrific people ' and more .
He went a little easier on 14 year old Ali Lohan , but did insinuate that she might become a ' strip tease person ' .
Kelly Ripa , like any good co-host worth her salt , tried to draw out the stand - in because she could see that he was striking a cord with the audience .
She baited him mercilessly , becoming the straight ' man ' while he unleashed his mini rant .

I do n’t have too much interest in either party ’s convention or presidential run this time around .
I was into it a little in 2004 , but since then a deep sense of apathy and cynicism has prevented me from giving a rat ’s ass about the elections this year , and probably for the rest of my life .
So instead of a watching a bunch of partisan speeches proclaiming Barack Obama to be greatest human being to grace the Earth since Jesus H. Christ , I ’ve decided that I ’m looking for nothing more than pure entertainment and excitement from this year ’s Democratic Convention .
And given the enormous scope and media coverage of such an event , the possibilities for all kinds of shenanigans are practically endless .
The convention will begin normally enough , with a bunch of Kool - Aid drinking derelicts marching down the parade route to the convention center .
During some stupid chant about political feel - good nonsense like “ voting for change ” , a giant chasm will open up along the parade route , releasing thirty million flesh - eating locusts into the air , and the locusts will feast on their flesh .
In order to quell the chaos , the military will quickly mobilize and drop sixty thousand tons of Raid on metropolitan Denver , asphyxiating everyone within three miles .
At this point , things begin to get out of hand .
With a few hundred thousand dead Coloradans and a cloud of poisonous chemicals engulfing the city , the fifty or so people who have managed thus far to survive the locusts and chemical warfare will quickly move through Denver .
Their mission is to gather critical life - saving supplies : hair dryers , toothpaste , light bulbs , greeting cards , and thirty - eight copies of Evening Shade on DVD .
Once their emergency supplies are safely in hand , our survivors ’ outlook will begin to improve , until the Secret Service shows up to begin preparations for Obama ’s acceptance speech at Invesco Field .
Not willing to risk their candidate being devoured on live television by locusts , the Secret Service will cover the entire city with the world ’s only known form of flesh - eating locust repellent the cheese filling from Beef - n - Cheddar Hot Pockets .
With the City safely locust - free thanks to all that cheese , politicians from across the country will begin to show up to start spewing their bullshit to our small group of survivors .
What they do n’t anticipate , however , is that Beef - n - Cheddar Hot Pocket filling is a favorite condiment of zombies , as they ( zombies ) find that the cheddar cheese is a perfect compliment to their main source of food ( brains ) .
The zombies will go largely unnoticed , snacking on delegates and volunteers here and there ; after all , the people who would go to such a conventions are probably zombies anyways .
However , poeple take note when one of the victims is vice - presidential candidate Joe Biden .
Unfortunately , the demeanor of zombie Biden is also similar to that of regular , non-zombie Biden , no one notices until the Senator - turned - zombie Biden eats Hillary Clinton on the main stage , which is greeted with mostly cheers and applause .
Obama , watching the chaos unfold before his eyes , decides to use the events to attack his opposition , stating that Biden ’s feast of Clinton is just like what is going to happen to the GOP in November , and that Biden ’s political appetite is even greater than his appetite for brains .
At this point , Obama begins to twitch and jerk uncontrollably , and everyone stops and stares and the bizarre spectacle .
Then , suddenly , a large , ass - kicking super - robot breaks out of Obama ’s skin , and in a dark and sinister voice , the evil robot says he proudly accepts his party ’s nomination for President of the United States .
This just might be the most thrilling political convention since 2004 .
Goddamnit , we were happy .
My uncle and I were finally leaving the Sierra Madre mountains , finally giving up the fight against gravity and letting Manuel , our 4 - door Korean econobox , coast .
For the last untold number of hours , we were stranded in Simojovel , straining the transmission up and down the dirt one - ways , trying to find our way out to the next town .
Part of the problem was our map — we still did n't have one .
Almost a week in and we were still following the very small , very inaccurate map inserted between pages 664 and 665 of last year 's Lonely Planet guide .
As you might imagine , this was n't going well .
Especially when we figured out that Simojovel was a town with a very lovely entrance and no exit .
It must have been an hour driving through the mountains to reach Simojovel and at least an hour trying to find our way out .
Three more hours wasted behind the overflowing busses , sweating through road construction , always dead at 30 miles per hour and always running out of gas .
And now we were running out of daylight .
But , we did n't want to think about that .
We were out of the mountains .
We were happy , goddamnit .
Aside from a small stretch between Palenque and Agua Azul , I occupied the passenger 's seat , doing my part to guess at directions and keep the conversation afloat .
In turn , my uncle fought with the steering wheel , fought with the manual transmission , fought to keep the two of us out of a ditch and , because of all the fighting , fought to keep a cool head .
I suppose I was getting the easier share of the workload .
Actually , it was worse than that .
I spent an annoying amount of time in the front seat , camera in hand , my telephoto lens blocking my uncle 's view of the road , straining to take photographs of the continuous explosion of color and form and shape and life that was happening for the split second we were driving by , never to be seen in exactly that way again .
So , naturally , I had to capture it .
Naturally , I had to be annoying .
But , as we pulled into our 10th Pemex gas station to refuel , none of that mattered .
The need to capture every fleeting moment faded with the sun ; my camera was safely tucked away in the trunk .
We were safe ; we were happy ; we were full .
It was the perfect time to break the rules again and drive off into the night .
Only this time , I was behind the wheel .
We set off with an impressive slide from reverse to 1st , not too much on the throttle and no stalling .
The headphone cable from my iPod swung between us , the right earbud in my ear , the left in my uncle's .
Finally , we had music .
Sure , we looked ridiculous , two thin men in a thin car with thin tires , but it was dark outside and you probably could n't see that much anyways .
I know I could n't — it started to softly rain on the windshield .
I told my uncle he could play whatever song he wanted , I was content to finally be of some use on the trip , content that my uncle could finally stop fighting and rest .
And I was more content when Pink Floyd 's " Time " came through my single earbud , the volume too loud in the interest of rocking out .
Driving was fine , just fine , except for the massive truck in front of us and the lightening and the small , two - lane road that we were driving on .
But it was fine — David Gimour was just getting to the guitar solo …
And then the crash happened .
A thud so loud from the right side of the car that it could n't have been just a pothole .
It did n't feel like we just hit a pothole either ; it felt like we hit a trench .
The car was straining just to turn the wheels around .
And now we had a flat tire .
At night .
In Mexico .
_____________
When I was a kid , I used to dream that all of the windows in my life were just television sets .
The traveling back and forth between parents was n't really travel at all .
I would sit in the car for an hour or so while they changed the set , my parent 's homes switching off every other weekend in an endless tide of custody visitation .
Of course , I figured out their secret .
If I ever got up enough courage to open the door on one of the long and quiet car rides , I would see a black stage , my father making friends with all the crew members , or my mother directing the stagehands to plant the dogwood tree in the backyard to shade the swing set .
When we were driving street - by - street in Simojovel , trying to find a way out , when we were running out of gas in the Sierra Madre mountains , I thought of this .
I thought of the two of us , impenetrable and air - conditioned , exploring from a distance , sometimes not even bothering to roll down the window before taking photos .
Now , with one flat tire , we were quite penetrable .
Now , I had to get out of the car .
_____________
There was no blowout lane , no side of the road .
A black VW , likely flattened by the same pothole , stopped dead in the right lane , orange safety reflectors already dispatched fore and aft .
My uncle opened his door .
" It 's both of them .
They 're both flat . "
I wanted him to be joking .
He was n't .
In under five minutes of driving , I managed to paralyze the entire right half of our car .
Both cheap alloy rims were caved - in from the impact of the pothole .
Now we would have to decide which tire to change ; we only had one spare .
Our Huyndai had to be front - wheel - drive , it just had to be .
There was n't much time to think .
The men from the VW had finished changing their tire and were now walking over to our car .
My uncle and I tried quickly to think of a Spanish approximation for " Fix - A - Flat " in case they had some to spare .
But before we could ask , they deflated their orange reflector , stuffed it in the trunk and drove off .
We were alone again .
We had two flashlights , and both were flickering .
My uncle balanced one in his teeth to change the tire .
I waved the other one behind the car to warn the traffic coming on .
The stars were out .
The ornamental grasses on either side of the road swayed between the trucks .
It was impossible to be detached now ; we were outside .
And then my uncle called me back to the car .
The tire was bolted down .
We threw the tools and the two defeated tires in the hatchback and drove on , my uncle reclaiming his place at the wheel .
The car started slowly , a long line of drivers growing behind our hazard lights , our back right wheel dragging reluctantly before them .
My uncle pressed on the accelerator , too much for comfort , as we drove through dark towns and over dark hills , the next one hopefully containing a Vulcanizadora , the small - town Mexican tire repairmen that dot the countryside , their telltale tractor trailer tire signage painted and hung from telephone poles .
The next hill crested with no hope in sight .
Now there was no more acceleration , only momentum .
We sailed up the next hill .
In the distance , next to a bar , there stood the painted tire sign .
I spotted it long before my uncle and yelled , thrilled to finally get something right .
The Vulcanizadora 's tin shack was closed , but the bar standing next door was still loud .
We both hoped he was still inside .
The bar was loud but empty for a Saturday night .
A lone couple danced next to an old electric jukebox producing an unlikely amount of bass .
They stopped dancing long enough for us to shout for the Vulcanizadora over the music .
They went to the back of the bar to get the proprietress who , in turn , woke up the Vulcanizadora , drunk and asleep from his Saturday revelry .
Dressed in a very clean Polo shirt , the Vulacizanadora shuffled through the parking lot , opened the front door of his shack with a flourish of keys , allowing the harsh lamplight and bugs access to his tools , his bed and his roommate , who was asleep on a cot at the edge of the dirt floor .
He found a large sledgehammer and took to banging our bent rims into a circular submission .
He could n't have been older than 25 .
I could n't help but thinking that this was his one night away from the tin shack .
Away from the rubber and the hammer and his one roommate , even if ' away ' just meant ' next door ' .
Saturday night was his one night of culture and style , a night ended the minute two gringos pulled into the parking lot with their two flat tires .
All hope for escapism vanished when the young Vulcanizadora took off his Polo shirt and got to work .
After a half hour of exasperation and sweat , the news was n't good .
During our drive , the ragged edge of the rim dug into our sinking tire , grating the rubber into a black , industrial powder and rendering the tire undrivable .
The solution was to combine the one salvageable rim with the one tire we did n't destroy .
For his after - hours , overtime , half - asleep , mostly - drunk manual labor , the Vulcanizadora charged us about $ 5 .
This was a man who lived his life outside our car .
A man who we never would have met until my clumsiness forced the car door open , exposing not a set or a stage but the Vulcanizadora himself , his Polo shirt still clean and his door open , just like mine .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Weighed in gold , Michael Phelps is worth about $ 3 million .
In reality the face of the Beijing Olympics is probably worth 10 times that amount each year .
Marketing experts said the 23 - year - old American , who is now the most successful Olympian with 11 gold medals , will become the richest professional swimmer ever , far surpassing the money earned by the former most decorated U.S. swimmer , Mark Spitz .
“ He ’s the greatest Olympian in the world and he ’ll be able to earn money everywhere as he’s an international brand , ” Australia - based celebrity agent Max Markson told Reuters .
“ He ’s a billion dollar man .
He wo n’t have to get a job ever .
He can live off this for 50 years . ”
Olympic sports have meant big business since the Olympic movement allowed professional athletes to compete 20 years ago .
But none has banked the sums earned by charismatic megastars like Tiger Woods , David Beckham or Michael Jordan whose names are globally known and set cash registers ringing everywhere .
Eli Portnoy , chief brand strategist at the Portnoy Group , a U.S. consultancy specialized in branding , doubted Phelps -- or any Olympian -- would match the earning power of Woods who is estimated to become the first billionaire athlete by 2010 .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
Phelps reportedly earns about $ 5 million a year from endorsements although his agency Octagon declined to comment .
Portnoy forecast this rising to about $ 30 million , short term .
“ In the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless , but you have to pull back and look at someone like Tiger Woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world , ” he said .
“ The Olympics is only held once every four years .
After a year to so Americans forget about the Olympics and move to stars they see more .
Kids want someone else on their Weetabix box . ”
THE PHELPS PHENOMENON
Phelps is already the epitome of the modern American corporate Olympian with the Phelps Machine in full swing before he topped the record nine gold tally held by Spitz and Carl Lewis , Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi and Soviet gymnast Larysa Latynina .
Phelps , who became a professional swimmer at 16 and a millionaire by 18 , has sponsors , agents , lawyers , accountants , charities , his own website in English and Chinese , and even his own logo with a wave - like blue M and red P over his name .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
An Octagon spokesman said his sponsors were credit card company Visa Inc. , Speedo , watch maker Omega , AT&T Wireless , energy food company PowerBar .
Kellogg ’s , Rosetta Stone , and PureSport .
He declined to say what they paid Phelps .
Within seconds of Phelps ’s snapping up his 10th gold medal , Visa released a special edition television commercial commemorating his title as the most decorated Olympian .
“ You need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property , Michael Phelps , ” said Michael Lynch , head of global sponsorship management at Visa whose relationship with Phelps dates back to 2002 .
“ His performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation ... and his earning ability will increase , there ’s no question of that . ”
Portnoy said Phelps ’s youth and composure under pressure made him a marketer ’s dream .
The only blotch on his record was an arrest for drinking and driving in 2004 for which he apologized .
“ In the short term , he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure , young , strong and visionary about America .
We have n’t had anyone of this significance since Mark Spitz , ” said Portnoy .
“ Guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the Olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability . ”

The folks in Idaho , according to a release by the Environment News Service , are apparently tickled pink that the French Company , AREVA , is planning construction of a $ 2 billion uranium enrichment plant near Idaho Falls , Idaho .
It ’s AREVA ’s first such facility in the U.S. and it plans to serve the nuclear power industry .
There are no nuclear power stations in Idaho , but it does host the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls .
According to its website , the INL is an applied engineering national laboratory , “ dedicated to supporting the U.S. Department of Energy ’s missions in nuclear and energy research , science , and national defense . ”
Idaho ’s Governor , C.L. “ Butch ” Otter , is quoted as saying , “ It ’s a great match that will result in secure jobs and a stronger economy . ”
The state actively courted AREVA with tax incentives , and was picked over three other possible locations .
The Idaho Legislature gladly capped the firm ’s property tax valuation at $ 400 million , if , the company spends at least $ 1 billion on the plant .
AREVA was also exempted from sales taxes on production equipment .
They Said What ?
So far , so good , the Environment News Service presented a good article , until I read this paragraph :
“ Although there are other problems with nuclear power , such as waste disposal and the potential for devastating accidents , it emits no heat - trapping greenhouse gases ” .
That ’s the kind of “ oh well ” thinking I ’ve been carping about all these months , and here it is again .
The biggie here is , “ it emits no heat - trapping greenhouse gases . ”
That remark was a quote from the text , not from an official of either the state or AREVA .
I am forever amazed at how the “ other problems ” are minimized , in preference to steam emanating from huge towers .
Up and Operating by 2014
AREVA officials say construction of the plant promises “ thousands of jobs ” , and when completed and operational , the plant would employ about 250 persons , making an average salary of $ 70,000 a year .
The U.S. Department of Energy operates one uranium enrichment company in Paducah , Kentucky .
It opened in 1952 , and has been enriching uranium for nuclear power reactors since 1960 .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says two new uranium enrichment plants are under construction , one in New Mexico and the other in Ohio .
If all goes well , Idaho may someday have its own nuclear power facility .
Nevada - based Alternative Energy Holdings is reportedly planning a 1,600 - megawatt reactor in southwestern Idaho .
Not In Anyone ’s Back Yard !
Obviously , not everyone is excited about the new facility at Idaho Falls .
The Snake River Alliance , which is based in Idaho , has gone on record opposing the enrichment plant , saying it did n’t matter where it was built , they oppose uranium enrichment wherever it takes place .
Andrea Shipley , Executive Director of the alliance , is quoted as saying :
“ It is premised on expanding nuclear power , which is an expensive and dirty power source . ”

A big part of my extreme home office makeover was setting up ambient lighting around my desk and keyboard using inexpensive LED rope lights .
Many of you were interested in more details , so let 's take a look at the step - by - step of my desk setup , and how to incorporate ambient lighting into other living spaces the same way .

The core of my ambient lighting system is inexpensive LED rope lighting .
I purchased my LED rope lights for ~ $ 8 per 18 foot strand .
Here 's a 12 - footer for under 10 bucks on Amazon .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Conveniently , the strands come with tension clips .
While these clips are there to secure the lighting to the side of a home around the holidays , they work just as well for securing the lighting to the underside of the desk .
Despite facing downward the clips are more than strong enough to hold the roping in place ( see the image on the right ) .
If the clips were n't included , I would have used small zip ties and a staple gun to safely secure the roping .

The diagram below is a bird 's eye view of the the lighting system layout under my desk .
To keep things simple I drew it as though the desk were clear and you could see the underpinnings .

The yellow line is the LED strand , the blue dots are the clips securing the strand to the desk , and the green line is the wire connecting the push button switch , the red dot , to the outlet .

The push button switch is actually a foot switch , the kind commonly used to turn Christmas tree lights on and off .
I stuck it to the underside of the desk with mounting tape .
Prior to adding it to the light system , I had to plug and unplug the cord for the LED lights which made me use the lighting less frequently .
The easier it is to turn your lights on , the more often you will .
The ambient light around the desk proved to be so enjoyable in the office , that I used the leftover ropes in the master and guest bedrooms .
Check out the following two pictures from the master bedroom .
I used the same techniques in the other bedrooms .

Just as I secured the rope lighting to the bottom of the desk , I attached it to the back of the two wardrobes .
Both are turned on an off by a foot switch , as is the under bed lighting .
The lighting under the bed is attached loosely to the slats of the bed frame with zip ties .
The rope lights do n't get more than a few degrees warmer than the room itself thanks to the efficiency of the LEDs inside , making them a safe choice for the bed .

What started as an attempt to light up my keyboard with some LED rope lights I scammed from the bargain bin at a local big box store ended with soothing ambient light in both my office and bedrooms .

“ In too many cases , claims of state secrets have succeeded in keeping important cases out of court entirely or preventing courts from considering evidence vital to the outcome of a case , ” said Rep. John Conyers , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , at a January 29 hearing on “ Reform of the State Secrets Privilege . ”
The record of that hearing has just been published .
In one recent case , a federal judge did what others have often failed to do in state secrets cases , which is to critically examine the basis for the assertion of the state secrets privilege .
Judge Sidney I. Schenkier of the Northern District of Illinois conducted hearings as well as in camera review of documents that the government insisted were protected by the state secrets privilege .
In an April 16 , 2008 ruling ( pdf ) in the case of M. Afikur Rahman v. Michael Chertoff , he rejected some of the government ’s privilege claims and affirmed others .
The 1953 Reynolds case that established the Supreme Court precedent on the state secrets privilege was examined most recently by writer Barry Siegel in the new book “ Claim of Privilege : A Mysterious Plane Crash , A Landmark Supreme Court Case , and the Rise of State Secrets ” ( Harper Collins , June 2008 ) .

DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) --
And now the selling begins .
CNN 's Wolf Blitzer says Democrats need to sell Barack Obama to voters .
The Democrats need to do some major marketing at their party convention in Denver , Colorado .
First and foremost , they need to sell Sen. Barack Obama .
They need to convince American voters that he 's the right man to lead the country .
That sales campaign kicks off Monday night with the focus on Obama 's personal story .
It is an amazing success story that will be told on the big screen inside the Pepsi Center .
The video , we are told , will be dramatic and highly produced , including some powerful music .
And it will be amplified by his wife , Michelle , who speaks Monday night .
iReport.com : Share your photos , videos from the convention
Barack Obama 's sister Maya Soetero - Ng , and Michelle 's brother , Craig Robinson , will also speak .
It also will be an emotional night as the Democrats pay tribute to Sen .
Ted Kennedy , who has brain cancer .
Beyond the personal and the emotional , the sales campaign moves to more substance Tuesday night with the focus on issue No. 1 : the economy .
The Democrats are calling their theme that night " Renewing America 's Promise . "
Sen . Hillary Clinton will be the headline prime - time speaker .
This will be a critically important speech because so many of her supporters remain unconvinced about Obama .
The tone she sets and the words she utters will send out a powerful message .
Former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner will deliver the keynote address that night .
He is running for the U.S. Senate to succeed John Warner ( no relation ) .
There 's a history to these speeches .
Obama delivered the keynote address at the Democrats ' last convention , and we know where he wound up .
Bill Clinton , then the governor of Arkansas , delivered the keynote address at the 1988 convention , and we know where he wound up .
The focus shifts to national security and foreign policy Wednesday night in what the Democrats are calling " Securing America 's Future . "
Sen .
Joe Biden , the vice presidential nominee , will deliver the big speech .
He will speak and make the case for Obama and , perhaps even more important , make the case against McCain .
Knowing Biden as I do , this will be a feisty moment .
Former President Clinton will weigh in that night with a major speech of his own .
That also should be a moment .
Finally , the festivities move to INVESCO Field at Mile High Stadium for the biggest night of the week : when Obama accepts his party 's nomination .
About 80,000 people will fill the stadium .
Tens of millions will be watching at home .
No surprise on his theme for the night : " Change You Can Believe In . "
That message brought him to the big dance , and he and his team believe that it can get him to the finish line .
All About Democratic National Committee • Barack Obama • Mark Warner
Mr Sarkozy said French children had to know the truth French President Nicolas Sarkozy has defended his plan to make every 10 - year - old schoolchild honour Jewish child victims of the Holocaust .
" We do not traumatise children by giving them the gift of the memory of the country , " Mr Sarkozy said .
He was speaking after French teachers and historians said the plan was misconceived and could upset children .
Some 11,000 Jewish children in France were killed during the Nazi occupation during World War II .
" We must tell a child the truth , " President Sarkozy said in the central French town of Perigueux .
He is foisting on 10 - year - olds an emotional charge that is way beyond them
Patrick Gonthier
France 's UNSA - Education union " If you do not talk to them of this tragedy , then you should not be surprised if it repeats itself .
" It is ignorance that prompts the repetition of abominable situations , not knowledge , " Mr Sarkozy said .
He was defending his proposal - made earlier this week - that French pupils in their last year of primary school should be " entrusted with the memory of a French child victim of the Holocaust " .
Mr Sarkozy argued that children would find it moving to read the story of another child the same age at them who had shared the same " interests and hopes " .
' Emotional gimmick '
But the proposal unleashed a storm of protests from many teachers and parents and also historians .
Six million Jews perished under the Nazis
They said children at such young age would suffer psychological damage by having to explore the lives of individual Jewish children , many of whom perished in Nazi concentration camps .
" He is foisting on 10 - year - olds an emotional charge that is way beyond them , " Patrick Gonthier , general secretary of France 's UNSA - Education union was quoted as saying by the Associated Press .
Other critics said the proposal would unfairly burden children with the guilt of previous generations .
Jewish organisations are split over Mr Sarkozy 's proposal - some believe it is an excellent way to remember the Holocaust while others feel it is an emotional gimmick , the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby in Paris says .
It is not the first time Mr Sarkozy has ruffled feathers at French schools .
Shortly after his election last year , he called for a letter from a World War II Resistance hero , the 17 - year - old communist Guy Moquet , to be read out in all French high schools as an example of a young man 's resistance to oppression .
The political left accused Mr Sarkozy of stealing a communist icon , our correspondent says .

PARIS – Cheese , pastries , foie gras – France 's culinary delights are full of dietary sins .
Now child obesity is rising and the myth is fading that French people can eat anything and stay thin .
So the government is fighting back .
The latest anti-fat idea being presented to French officialdom : an increase in sales taxes on extra-fatty , salty or sugary products .
Previous government efforts included posters suggesting that subway riders take the stairs instead of escalators , and advisories prominently displayed on ads for junk food telling people to eat at least five fruits and vegetables a day .
An expert report suggesting increasing taxes on unhealthy food items from the current 5.5 per cent to up to 19.6 per cent , was submitted to the health and budget ministries in late July , an official from the Budget Ministry confirmed Wednesday .
The official could not be cited by name because of ministry rules .
The findings of the report – which remains confidential because it is still under discussion – were leaked to Les Echos newspaper Tuesday .
Details of the tax remain to be hammered out .
It was not yet clear , for example , whether it would apply to famously fatty cheese that French consumers buy at outdoor markets and to eclairs from the bakery , or just processed junk foods that have nutritional content listed on their packaging .
The higher sales taxes , if implemented , would go in part toward patching a huge deficit in the French state health - care system .
Last year , France 's senators had called for so - called nutritional taxes , but then stepped back from the plan , instead commissioning the expert study to look into its feasibility .
The findings will be presented to legislators in September , said the Budget Ministry official .
Legislators could then debate the measures suggested , either in part or as a whole package .
However , the idea of increasing the sales tax already faces stiff opposition from Budget Minister Eric Woerth .
" It is out of the question to raise sales taxes on food products , even more so given the difficult context of the French population 's purchasing power , " he said Wednesday .
Decreased purchasing power – caused by inflation and stagnant salaries – is a growing concern in France , as gas and food prices have shot up over the past year .
President Nicolas Sarkozy 's conservative government has been working on reforms to make good on his campaign promise to improve spending power .
The expert report was written by France 's inspection agencies on social affairs and on finances .

Credit : Dell
Watched a DVD they owned : 67 percent
Watched a rented DVD : 50 percent
Watched video - on - demand : 18 percent
Watched a movie on their portable media devices : 8 percent
" Downloaded a movie from a free file - sharing service and watched on a computer or television " : 6 percent
" Paid for a digital video download from the Web " : 2 percent
We 've seen some pretty wild promotions in our day , but Dell 's latest really has us scratching our heads .
Starting today and for a limited time only , you can get Iron Man preloaded on a select Dell laptop or desktop for an additional $ 20 .
This is not the Iron Man DVD or Blu-ray disc , but a digital movie file ( Windows Media format ) pre-loaded onto the system 's hard drive .
Currently the three system options are an Inspiron 1525 ( starting at $ 649 ) , an XPS 420 ( starting at $ 899 ) , and an XPS 630 ( starting at $ 1,299 ) .
Do n't get us wrong -- we think Iron Man was one of the best movies to come out in 2008 , and have been chomping at the bit to own a copy of it .
But does the ability to purchase a copy of the movie that can only be played back on a single system and that also costs more than the DVD , really seem like an enticement to purchase a computer ?
( Actually , the pre-loaded Iron Movie can also be streamed from the computer to a Windows media extender , Xbox 360 , or a Slingbox , etc. )
The DVD costs $ 14.99 at Amazon , and can also be downloaded from iTunes for $ 14.99 .
Okay , Dell promises " a special digital edition with a bonus featurette " ; but even if the Dell version is the equivalent of the Iron Man ( Two - Disc Special Collectors ' Edition ) , Amazon sells that DVD for $ 22.99 .
We 'd also wager a fair bet that the image quality of the pre-loaded file does n't quite measure up to that of the DVD .
( The Blu-ray version is $ 25.95 at Amazon . ) A promotional page on Dell 's site states , " by getting your content preloaded , you can start enjoying your favorite movie as soon as you get your new Dell without the hassle of searching for and downloading your content , saving you time . "
While the digital entertainment revolution is upon us , the vast majority of people simply do not choose to watch movies on the computers as their primary means of viewing films .
In fact , DVDs still reign supreme as we reported a few weeks ago .
An NDP Group study actually found that less than one percent of U.S. consumers purchased or rented digital movies or TV shows online .
Here are some other relevant findings from the study that just makes
Dell 's move that much more confusing :
Of U.S. consumers who says they " watched a full - length movie in the past three months " : Preloading Iron Man is actually just the tip of the iceberg for Dell .
It plans on ramping up similar promotions in the months ahead .
In a press release from Dell , the company states , " Dell plans to expand future entertainment selections and will continually refresh its offerings to include the most exciting Hollywood blockbuster and perennial classic movies .
More information about the Dell Movies is available at www.dell.com/movies . "
As of when this news story was written , that link points to the Iron Man promotion .
Dell XPS M1530 , now available with Iron Man on board ...
In our opinion , a more appealing deal would be to also include the DVD or Blu-ray disc ( depending on the configuration we ordered ) .
Are we not seeing the forest for the trees here ?
Is this , in fact , the greatest idea since sliced bread and we 're just too dense to get it ?
What do you think of Dell 's promotion ?

The Amazing Rusting Aluminum Rust can hold an airplane together or dissolve it to bits .
Unless you are a representative of a national meteorological bureau licensed to carry a barometer ( and odds are you 're not ) , bringing mercury onboard an airplane is strictly forbidden .
Why ?
If it got loose , it could rust the plane to pieces before it had a chance to land .
You see , airplanes are made of aluminum , and aluminum is highly unstable .
Wait , is n't one of the great things about aluminum that , unlike iron , it does n't rust ?
Am I talking about the same aluminum ?
Yes !
Your aluminum pot is made of a highly reactive chemical .
It simply has a trick that lets it disguise itself as a corrosion - resistant metal .
When iron rusts , it forms iron oxide - a reddish , powdery substance that quickly flakes off to expose fresh metal , which immediately begins to rust , and so on until your muffler falls off .
But when aluminum rusts , it forms aluminum oxide , an entirely different animal .
In crystal form , aluminum oxide is called corundum , sapphire or ruby ( depending on the color ) , and it is among the hardest substances known .
If you wanted to design a strong , scratchproof coating to put on a metal , few things other than diamond would be better than aluminum oxide .
By rusting , aluminum is forming a protective coating that 's chemically identical to sapphire - transparent , impervious to air and many chemicals , and able to protect the surface from further rusting :
As soon as a microscopically thin layer has formed , the rusting stops .
( ' Anodized ' aluminum has been treated with acid and electricity to force it to grow an extra - thick layer of rust , because the more you have on the surface , the stronger and more scratch - resistant it is . )
This invisible barrier forms so quickly that aluminum seems , even in molten form , to be an inert metal .
But this illusion can be shattered with aluminum 's archenemy , mercury .
Applied to aluminum 's surface , mercury will infiltrate the metal and disrupt its protective coating , allowing it to ' rust ' ( in the more destructive sense ) continuously by preventing a new layer of oxide from forming .
The aluminum I - beam below rusted half away in a few hours , something that would have taken an iron beam years .
I 've heard that during World War II , commandos were sent deep into German territory to smear mercury paste on aircraft to make them inexplicably fall apart .
Whether the story is true or not , the sabotage would have worked .
The few - micron - thick layer of aluminum oxide is the only thing holding an airplane together .
Think about that the next time you 're flying .
Or maybe it 's better if you do n't .
Scan of printed version :
My periodic table poster is now available !
Just a small amount of mercury paste starts turning this aluminum I - beam to dust .

Another message floats along the column of soldiers : " Prepare to move . "
I look down the line and see young faces illuminated by the glow of cigarettes being sucked for the final time .
Others are hauling their impossibly heavy packs on to their backs .
There is a flurry of activity and then , without ceremony , we move silently beyond the walls of Patrol Base Inkerman .
After 20 minutes we stop in a small hamlet and a soldier crawls towards me and whispers : " If we get ambushed and you find yourself in the killing zone , stick with me . "
I ask him what he means by " the killing zone " .
" It 's the area of ground in an ambush where you have the greatest chance of being killed .
If you 're in it , you 're in the s**t . "
He then smiles and says : " And if I 'm dead , you 're probably f****d . "
Obama Aide Concedes ' Dollar Bill ' Remark Referred to His Race
A top aide concedes Obama's " dollar bill " remark referred to his race .
Aug. 1 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama 's chief strategist conceded that the Democratic presidential candidate was referring to his race when he said Republicans were trying to scare voters by suggesting Obama " does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . "
The comment had triggered a charge Thursday from Sen.
John McCain 's campaign manager that Obama had " played the race card ... from the bottom of the deck . "
Playing the Race Card
Obama 's camp initially denied the remark was a reference to Obama 's race .
Obama is poised to become the first black man to be the presidential nominee of a major political party when he claims the Democratic nomination on Aug. 28 -- the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King , Jr. 's " I Have a Dream " speech .
" He was referring to the fact that he did n't come into the race with the history of others , " Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said Thursday .
" It is not about race . "
But Obama 's chief strategist , David Axelrod , acknowledged on " Good Morning America " Friday that the candidate was referring , at least in part , to his ethnic background .
When pressed to explain the comment , Axelrod told " GMA " it meant , " He 's not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the United States .
He 's new to Washington .
Yes , he 's African - American . "
That seemingly obvious reference sparked the first real fireworks between the two camps as backers of both candidates accused the other of trying to subtly inject race into the presidential contest .
McCain Attack Ad Raises Tensions
The tension between the campaigns was escalated by a new McCain attack ad released earlier this week that mocked Obama as a celebrity like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
Axelrod lashed out at McCain for airing the ad , saying it was " insulting … to the American people . "
" It 's beneath Sen. McCain , " Axelrod told " GMA " , referring to McCain 's pledge to run a respectful campaign .
" What happened to John McCain ?
What happened to the campaign he promised to run ? "
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis , however , said he was delighted with the " celebrity " commercial .
" I think the ad is a great ad .
I think it 's getting a lot of attention which was what it was designed to do , " Davis said on " Good Morning America . "
He called the furor over the ad " much ado about nothing .
Everybody 's talking about it and we 're having a great time with it . "
But Davis talked tough when it came to any suggestion that McCain employed a racist tactic .
" I will not allow anyone in this campaign to attack John McCain on race .
It 's never happened before , and it never will again , " Davis said .
The Obama campaign made clear Thursday that they did not believe McCain was using Obama 's race , but accused the Republicans of " low road politics . "
Education
The most important programming language
Original image by Ezu
One of the common questions that comes up among students new to Computer Science and Programming is along the lines of “ what is the best programming language ? ” .
And the the brief answer to that is simple :
You ’re doing it wrong .
This requires some elaboration .
When one asks “ what is the best programming language to learn ? ” or “ what is the best programming language to build video games with ? ” , it seems that the intent is to get some experience with one specific technology , and stop there .
That is a failure of an approach .
A programming language is a tool .
Tools have specific purposes .
Tools change .
New tools , technologies , and techniques becomes available .
It does n’t make much sense to specialize in wielding a hammer over a screwdriver , if one lacks the core skill of following assembly instructions .
However unlike this construction analogy , technological tools change rapidly .
“ Java will guarantee a corporate job ” ; “ PHP is required for web development ” ; “ Ruby is growing at 400 % per year ” .
A lot of people claim to have a solid idea of where the industry will be and are quick to offer advice , but this ca n’t possibly be the case .
All of those languages — Java , PHP , Ruby , have first appeared in 1995 .
This means that all the hype that you are supposed to “ know ” right now , did n’t even exist just 13 years ago .
So if you plan on sticking to your favourite high school programming language , chances are that by the time you graduate from a University , you ’ll show up at the playfield with a wrong type of bat , so to speak .
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni ( episode 9 )
But then the question still stays : “ what should one learn next ? ” .
Algorithms , data structures , complexity , math …
Learn the core abstracts , ideas , and skills that are language independent , and that transfer from one syntax to another .
Learn the ability to learn .
When a new opportunity with new technology comes along , you should be able to get over the learning curve fairly quickly .
So your “ best language ” ; your “ most important programming language to learn next ” is the one that will help you do the above .
As a tool .
As a palette with which to express and explore your ideas .
It might be one with the cleanest syntax , or the most documentation , or one that you are already familiar with the most .
It would n’t make sense to pick up a yet - another - programming - language just to be able to do what you already can , only with a somewhat different syntax .
It ’s useless to write the same basic sort in 12 different languages , if all of them are too slow to finish in a reasonable time .
Worse yet if you do n’t understand why this is so .
So lets drop this obsession with learning to say “ hello world ” ( or some more complicated version of essentially the same ) in every programming language one can name .
Lets also drop the idea of finding “ one language to rule them all ; and retire ” .
Once we put the Science back in Computer Science , it would n’t matter which language you ’ll end up using .

While the surprise announcements that did come out of the Square Enix DKΣ3713 Private Party were definitely post - worthy , Final Fantasy Agito XIII coming to the PSP is a big deal does n't hold a candle to oddball product cross-collaborations .
The biggest news to come out of the weekend event was that Square Enix and Roen would be releasing Final Fantasy Versus XIII formal wear , real world items worn by in - game characters — perfect for the prom !
It looks like the collaboration works both ways , as this is more than just cheap cosplay stuff .
Roen looks to have worked with Square Enix on character designs for Versus XIII .
Before you excitedly whip out the credit card , be warned that Roen is obscenely expensive .
Sure , their tank tops are just dazzling , but even we balk at $ 240 price tags .

Men ages 75 and older should not be screened for prostate cancer .
This is the important and definitive conclusion of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , which for the first time has made a specific recommendation about the value of screening for prostate cancer .
To many doctors , the new guidelines will not come as a shock .
Quite a few believe that because prostate cancer often progresses slowly , not causing symptoms for 10 years or longer , it ’s inappropriate to look for it in healthy older men .
A man aged 75 or older may well die of another cause long before his prostate cancer becomes a problem .
And treatment of prostate cancer has significant drawbacks , often leading to impotence , incontinence and a variety of other complications that reduce a patient ’s quality of life .
But what doctors know and what happens in practice often are two different things .
Prostate screening involves a simple blood test to check for prostate - specific antigen , or PSA .
Many doctors find it easier just to do a PSA test than take the time to explain the pros and cons to a patient .
Patients themselves , many accustomed since their late 40s or early 50s to getting tested , are n’t always comfortable with the idea of stopping the screening once they reach older age .
And interestingly , doctors say the wives of many older men , themselves firm believers in screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer , sometimes push their husbands and doctors to continue screening for prostate cancer .
The statistics on inappropriate screening are surprising .
In one study of 600,000 men treated by the Veterans Administration , screening rates were 64 percent for men ages 70 to 74 , 56 percent for men ages 75 to 80 , 45 percent for men ages 80 to 84 — and a surprising 36 percent for men ages 85 and older .
“ For some men , it ’s a tough issue to face , ” said Dr. Ned Calonge , chairman of the task force and chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment .
“ It is n’t that we know when you ’re going to die , or that it ’s all over so do n’t worry about anything else … .
We ’re very poor at predicting how much longer you ’re going to live .
If you take it from the standpoint of risk versus benefit , the chances are more that screening is going to harm you . ”
Dr. Calonge hopes the new guidelines will trigger another round of discussion about PSA testing between doctors and patients .
“ Even before this , we were really trying to recommend to physicians that given the uncertainty about benefit for screening , you should really discuss on an individual basis the pros and cons of screening , ” Dr. Calonge said .
“ What we find in practice is that adds additional time and effort that ’s not compensated as part of normal clinical care .
It ’s easier to just draw the blood test .
I think what we hope now is that it will be just as easy to not do the blood test . ”
What do you think ?
Will you be ready to give up PSA testing when you or your spouse reaches the age of 75 ?

SURVEY : A SOBER OUTLOOK SURVEY : A SOBER OUTLOOK American adults surveyed take a dim view of the USA 's status as a world science leader .
70 % believe the USA is not now the world leader in science achievement .
35 % believe the USA will be the world science leader in the next 20 years .
79 % agree that science is not receiving the attention it deserves in schools .

For decades , educators and employers have worried that too few Americans are preparing for careers in science .
But there 's evidence to support a new , broader concern in this election year : Ordinary Americans may not know enough about science to make informed decisions on key questions .
Seventy - six percent of Americans say presidential candidates should make improving science education a national priority , according to a national Harris Interactive survey of 1,304 adults in November and December .
Results were released this spring .
TEST YOURSELF : Take a true / false science quiz
But only 26 % believe that they themselves have a good understanding of science .
And 44 % could n't identify a single scientist , living or dead , whom they 'd consider a role model for the nation 's young people .
These results are disturbing , science education experts say , because scientists are n't the only ones who must distinguish solid scientific methods from bogus ones .
Some important scientific questions are being debated this year , including food safety , imported - product safety and the effect of biofuels .
Finding trustworthy sources
Whether a person is planning a child 's diet or staking out a position on global warming , insights from science are indispensable , experts say , but only if someone knows which findings to trust .
" People will respond to demagoguery if they do n't believe they have sufficient knowledge and sufficient confidence in their ability to weigh arguments and assess what 's behind them , " says Walter Massey , a board member of Chicago 's Museum of Science and Industry , which commissioned the survey .
" The danger is that we move increasingly toward being a society where the most important decisions are ultimately made by fewer and fewer people . "
Even figuring out which organizations to trust for guidance requires some basic knowledge of what constitutes good research methodology , Massey says .
Non-scientists can use Internet resources to get a handle on technical subjects as long as they exercise " healthy skepticism , " says Donald Kennedy , former editor in chief of Science .
His tip : Consider credentials .
Research that has an economic stake in particular outcomes is n't as trustworthy as research that is independent and published in peer - reviewed journals .
Such journals , in which studies submitted for publication are judged by an independent panel of experts , include Science , Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine .
Good places to start researching technical subjects are websites of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences ( aaas.org ) and the National Academy of Sciences ( nasonline.org ) , Kennedy says .
Working with science - based knowledge " is a game that can be played by anybody with a serious interest in discovery , " he says .
Americans are making progress on the science front , says Jon Miller , a Michigan State University political scientist who has been studying scientific literacy for 20 years .
For example , in the late 1980s , most Americans believed that antibiotics killed both viruses and bacteria .
Now , Miller says , about 60 % know that antibiotics kill only bacteria , not viruses .
" It 's a kind of learning that occurs through interaction with health care professionals , " Miller says .
Experts contend that people need some health - related science knowledge for their own well - being .
For instance , should you be more worried about germs on your kitchen table than about your smoking habit ?
No , but you would need a bit of science to recognize that smoking presents the bigger health risk , says Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a health advocacy group .
More rigor needed
Other day - to - day questions require a measure of science acumen :
Which chemicals should be avoided ?
Of the cure - all - type products sold only via television and the Internet , which ones should you buy , if any ?
Informed scientific opinion and an ability to identify weak evidence go a long way in making such judgments , Miller says .
Some science educators worry that Americans still are n't rigorous enough in deciding which sources to trust .
" We have in this country a major crisis of people listening to people they feel comfortable with ( rather than ) listening to a variety of groups and critically thinking through their messages , " says Gerry Wheeler , executive director of the National Science Teachers Association .
Scientific knowledge is n't a silver bullet for building an informed citizenry .
In public - policy decisions , technical insight matters only up to a point , Kennedy says .
He notes that nuclear waste controversies hinge on how much risk a community is willing to tolerate , which is not a matter decided by science .
Likewise , debates on the use of embryonic stem cells in scientific research routinely boil down to moral beliefs about when life begins .
" Public policy is for everybody ( to make ) — it 's not just a science game , " Kennedy says .
" But you have to be able to weed out the scientific arguments that are n't right . "

Since April 1 when Nova Scotia outlawed the use of hand - held cellphones while driving , sales of hands - free devices have gone through the roof .
It seems everyone ’s driving — even walking — with tiny electronic devices tucked into their ears .
Conventional wisdom says they ’re safer .
With wireless technology such as Bluetooth becoming commonplace , you can still conduct business , order pizza or talk to mom while keeping both hands on the wheel .
But is the mind on the road ?
A Dalhousie PhD student in experimental psychology says hands - free cellphones are not safer and indeed may even be more dangerous than hand - held .
Killam scholar Yoko Ishigami presented her paper , “ Is a hands - free phone safer than a hand - held phone ? ” at the national conference of the Canadian Association of Road Safety Professionals held last month in Whistler , B.C.
She was awarded first place in a national student paper competition .
“ Talking and listening are such complicated tasks , especially if you ’re thinking ahead to what you ’re going to say , ” says Ms. Ishigami , an international student from Shizuoka , Japan .
“ The conversation is what takes all your attention . ”
She surveyed current scientific research on cellphone use , showing that talking on the phone , regardless of phone type , has negative impacts on performance , especially when the driver is confronted by complex or unpredictable situations .
Performance while using a hands - free phone was rarely found to be better than that using a hand - held phone .

Some studies found drivers compensate for the harmful effects of cellphone use when using a hand - held phone — by driving slower or pulling over to finish a call — but neglect to do so when using a hands - free phone .
“ People tend to be over confident with hands - free and drive faster .
They ’re thinking , ‘ I ’m OK because I ’ve got on the headgear , ” she explains .
“ Whereas if they were driving with a hand - held phone , they tend to drive slower . ”
Ms. Ishigami says the topic of cellphone use while driving has interested her since she was an undergraduate psychology student at the University of Victoria .
She recalls being at a pedestrian crosswalk ready to cross the road as a car approached .
Locking eyes with the driver , she proceeded across , but had to jump back to curb when she realized the driver was n’t going to stop .
The driver , who was holding up a phone to her ear , did n’t even see her .
“ When you ’re talking on the phone , your attention is on the conversation .
You may be looking at things but that does n’t mean you ’re processing that information . ”
One Canadian study Ms. Ishigami reviewed demonstrated that talking on a cellphone while driving increased the risk of an accident four - fold , and that whether the phone was hand held or hands free made no difference to the risk .
Considering all the research , she concludes all cellphone use while driving should be banned .
advertisement
So far , Newfoundland and Labrador , Quebec and Nova Scotia in Canada , and California , Connecticut , New Jersey , New York and Washington in United States have banned hand - held cellphones while driving .
India may be the only country in the world which bans both hand - held and hands - free phones while driving .
In Nova Scotia , penalties , including court costs , are just under $ 165 for a first offence .
In Newfoundland and Labrador , the first province to enact a cellphone law in 2003 , fines can be as high as $ 400 , plus demerit points .
Ontario is considering similar legislation to stop drivers from using cellphones and BlackBerrys while behind the wheel .
“ I think what ’s troubling is that hands - free devices are rarely banned , and indeed even encouraged , ” says Ms. Ishigami .
Dalhouse psychology professor Raymond Klein hopes legislators will pay attention to Ms. Ishigami ’s research .
“ No one should be surprised that driving while talking on a cellphone is dangerous .
But finding that this danger is not much reduced , or reduced at all , by using a hands - free phone is news , ” says Dr. Klein .
“ It is correct but incomplete to think ‘ we drive with our hands ’ and therefore using them for another activity ( dialing , eating , etcetera ) might be unsafe .
We drive with our minds too … and it ’s essential that our attention is devoted entirely to the task of driving . ”
( CNN ) -- Soaring gas prices , nearing a national average of $ 4 per gallon , are causing long - distance commuters to burn holes in their wallets along with the fuel in their gas tanks .
This is what Aaron Everett sees for most of his evening commute in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
One iReporter , who asked not to be identified , plods through a three - hour commute each way , every day , that includes driving and public transit .
iReport.com :
See the path he takes to work
He does it for the sake of lower housing prices .
Most mornings , he leaves at 6:30 a.m. and might get home sometime between 10 and 11:30 p.m. , depending on conditions .
There 's a 30 - mile drive each way that requires him to fill his four - cylinder vehicle 's gas tank seven times per month .
At around $ 4 per gallon , each trip to the pump costs him about $ 50 , creating a significant expense .
His travel time does n't stop when he stops driving .
The 30 - mile car trip takes him to a commuter rail train .
He then heads to the New York subway system and reverses the route on the way home .
It 's a difficult commute that costs $ 200 per week and becomes more expensive and more crowded as gas prices rise .
On the weekend , he says he is so tired that he spends much of the time sleeping .
Despite his commuter fatigue , he tries to make time to see friends and keeps up with people he knows using Facebook .
One day , he hopes , he wo n't get home so late that he misses his young son 's waking hours .
But he also says he wo n't be living this way forever .
" It 's permanent in the sense that I 've been doing it for two years , but for the long term , it 's not something I 'm going to be doing forever , " he said .
" It 's just not possible . "
The iReporter 's story on iReport.com received more than 130 comments from readers like footballer , who wrote in about their own commutes and how costly they are in time and money .
" Dude , you need to figure something out , " footballer wrote .
" I 'm not hammering you because you sound like a hard working guy who is just trying to succeed .
It 's a shame , though , that you do n't see the time you 're wasting .
For someone who does n't mind working , ca n't you see the benefit in having more free time ? "
The iReporter wrote two responses to all the comments , telling readers he understood their concerns , but felt in his heart he was making the right decision .
" Please note ( in response to comments ) I am not complaining , " he wrote .
" I am just telling my story ... yes , it 's been a hard two years , but it will all be worth it when I move closer , or get a job closer to home . "
Another Pennsylvania resident , Aaron Everett of North Versailles , shared his own story of a long commute .
Everett said he wishes he could take public transit to work .
iReport.com : Everett 's story
He recorded video behind the wheel of his onerous morning drive to illustrate the thick traffic he faces each day .
He said he felt little danger in doing so since the car was n't making any progress through the sea of brake lights .
Watch brake lights aglow in Pittsburgh - area gridlock »
The 15 - mile daily journey often takes 45 minutes in the morning and up to an hour and a half in the evening , he says .
" It 's frustrating that there 's no good way to get from Point A to Point B , " says Everett , who decided that he would rather have a home with a large backyard for his kids and adequate parking than a smaller lot in the city .
Still , he bemoans the thick traffic and the tunnel along his route that bottlenecks drivers and exacerbates an already difficult commute .
" Every day , I sit watching the gas gauge go down and the clock tick by , " Everett wrote .
" Welcome to commuting in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . "
The problem is n't isolated to the Northeast .
Even Southerners are facing lengthy drives .
Derek Letson , a 24 - year - old Scottsboro , Alabama , native , travels 55 miles to work each morning .
iReport.com : See Letson 's route and read about Southern commutes
He and his wife have cut back on eating out and are even eating lunch at work to afford the gasoline .
He says a lot of people in his area drive long distances to their jobs because that is basically the only transit option available to them .
He enjoys the beauty of the drive and all the interesting things he sees on the way .
Beautiful woods , fishing docks on the Tennessee River and the characters along the road are all features of the trip , he says .
" I drive into a small town called Guntersville , where every morning there 's a man in his 50s walking his dog and listening to his Walkman and doing a little jig , " Letson says .
" This guy is out there in light rain , sleet or snow . "
But pushing these pleasantries aside , Letson says he imagines a bleak future if things do n't improve .
" If the government does n't do something about this , we will see a depression , not recession , in the South , " Letson says .
" Because some people wo n't be able to even drive to work .
We will see the sick unable to get the medical attention they need . "
The three men said they will plod through their long commutes until things improve .
Until then , they 'll keep opening up their wallets at the pump and watching the dashboard clock as day turns into night .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
In certain “ hot zones ” where multidrug - resistant tuberculosis is prevalent , patients treated with standard TB drugs have high rates of failure and relapse , new research indicates .
An inmate sits in the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR - TB ) ward in a prison hospital in the Siberian city of Tomsk , east of Moscow , June 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Thomas Peter
In countries where “ drug sensitivity testing ” is not performed routinely , the current standard anti-TB drug regimens “ may be contributing to worsening drug resistance levels , ” a multinational research team warns in a report published Friday .
Dr. Dick Menzies , from McGill University in Montreal , and colleagues analyzed the association between drug resistance and treatment outcome in 103 countries , which were selected because their multidrug - resistant TB prevalences were known and because they had each reported on outcomes for more than 250 cases treated with standard treatment regimens in 2003 and / or 2004 .
The researchers calculated that every 1 percent increase in the initial prevalence of multidrug - resistant TB was associated with a 0.3 percent increase in treatment failure among new cases , a 1.1 percent increase in failure among retreatment cases , and a 1 percent increase in relapse .
The results are statistically significant , the researchers note .
Menzies and his team believe that in countries where initial multidrug - resistant TB prevalence is at least 3 percent , “ it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing , or to reexamine standardized ( initial treatment and retreatment ) regimens . ”
In these countries , more than 20 percent of treated patients required retreatment , their report indicates .
Moreover , in all countries , retreatment outcomes were generally poor , with high rates of default , failure , and death .
The investigators warn , “ Failure to act now will mean far more resources will be needed in the long run to address global drug resistance . ”
Drs. Marcos Espinal and Mario C. Raviglione , with the World Health Organization in Geneva , Switzerland , agree , noting in an editorial that current tools for managing multidrug - resistant TB “ are decades old , complex to use , time consuming , and more importantly , not designed for case management of multidrug - resistant TB . ”
“ Unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold , we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come , ” the editorial concludes .

Yes , Brad !
Fox has mislabeled normal citizen dissent and activism as coming from wild - eyed lefties .
When will they recognize that their brand of " journalism " is nothing short of being just another arm of the executive branch .
The imperial presidency and the national security state include America 's executive branch and Fox " news . "
I am sooo envious that you are THERE !
I 'd like to see a video spoof making fun of their characterization of normal citizen dissent as raucous and out of control .
Gee , during the French Revolution they were guillotine - ing 800 people a week there for a while .
Now THAT is raucous and out of control .

Unfortunately , the problem is bigger than just FOX News .
It 's the corporate media cartel that covers up serious issues such as impeachment and even lies to the public to protect itself from being exposed .
Check out my article Let ’s See How Our ' Free Press ' Covers Impeachment for news about the impeachment coverage blackout and ways to counteract it .
Also , do n't miss the link in the comments to the laughable CNN coverage of the impeachment hearing .
It ’s a must see !
CNN completely embarrasses itself and dispels any notion that it covers news .
I hope that Jon Stewart uses it !
Unfortunately , Jon did n't ask Pelosi about impeachment , so it seems like even Jon is not allowed to talk about impeachment .
If you think that a “ news ” blackout is bad , then you might be very worried to learn that the “ news ” media would lie to prevent public access TV from exposing its lies .
If you want the truth , see Welcome to the Twilight Zone Where an Increase is a Cut !?!
So , while F**k FOX News is a good chant , I think that F **k the lying news media would be even better .
Thankfully , we have great news outlets like the Brad Blog to help us find the truth .

Is n't the Net fantastic !
Prediction :
Fox will hire some goons acting as " protesters " to really get things going .
If you doubt this , do a little history research on the 60s .
Of course there is a slight difference .
This sort of " mischief " used to be handled by the public sector ( FBI -- J.Edgar Hoover era , CIA , U.N.C.L.E.? , etc. ) but times are changing , and it has been privatized !
To the newshound from Fox : " Freedom of speech " is what the crowd was illustrating !
The crowd seemed to be diverse , but not dangerous , unless you can't take a little cussin ' .
Information free of ( Fox ) editing , distributed this widely and rapidly gives me hope .

I hate the fact that they are who they are and they 've done what they 've done .
I hate Fox News because Fox News was the mouthpiece of these murderous , moronic hacks .
That remedial joke of a man , Bush even hired former Fox News propagandist Tony Snow to be one of his shit - spewing press secretaries ( high turnover rate for that gig ) .
Fuck Fox News , fuck them in their stupid faces .

They cannot substantiate that Fox lies , yet they just say it without thinking in terms of objectivity or substantiation .
They just say what they want and try to rationalize it with " freedom of speech , " how laughable yet sad .
" Objectivity " is the key word that seems to mean nothing these days , especially to the zombie protesters hopped - up on kool - aid .

Based on what I saw , the " protesters " are the ones who do n't know what " raucous " or " out of control " or " freedom of speech " or even " taunting " mean .
All the reporter from Fox did was ask them for their point of view and he was then verbally abused .
Why ?
Because Fox News is not left wing and does n't represent the left view and so they should be vilified .
So , based on what I saw in the video , I come to the conclusion that to the protesters " raucous " would actually mean " riot " to the rest of us and " out of control " would means " mayhem " , " freedom of speech " would mean the left point of view only and based on the posted comments supporting mayham etc. , it appears I am correct in my assessment .
Oh , and " taunting " ?
That would mean just being there .
Welcome to the new world .

Poor little " Preston " , I pity people so brain dead that they cant see that Faux Noise lies continuously .
I mean really , virtually every word from these morons is a bald faced lie and can be and has been proven to be countless times in the past 8 years .
These Faux Noise sycophants are scary .
Only the seriously reality challenged could possibly be part of this group .
I have a theory I have been working on for about 10 years now and so far it appears to me that a lot of our problems like this , ( Delusional people that believe every word Faux Noise spews , that do n't question the blatantly obvious election fraud , that argue against impeachment of Treasonous war criminals , that believe handing over the rights to virtually our entire coastline to Big Oil under the pretext that " offshore drilling " is some how going to magically cure our dependence on foreign * Canadian , Mexican , Venezuelan * oil , when in fact it will make ZERO difference within 8 years and less than 1 % difference after that and even then ONLY IF they build more refineries ) I can go on & on but you get the gist .
My theory is that the root of this delusional psychosis is based on Religious Indoctrination .
These people have completely divorced themselves from factual reality already , they believe the Earth was " created " by their sun god 6000 years ago , they live in a world where demons , angels , talking snakes , miracles , wishing * praying * will cure all ills , every animal & human being on this planet came from a single small ark built by a 600 year old man .
To put it bluntly these people are stark raving insane .
Once you have completely divorced yourself from reality like this then it becomes child 's play to convince this group of ANYTHING .
All they have to do is make them " want " to believe it and that 's it after that they will swallow whatever bullshit the media says no matter how crazy or easily debunked it is .
Even when it is so obvious to the rest of us they are lying , so obvious they have stolen elections , so obvious they attacked us in a false flag attack on 9/11 AND the Anthrax .
All of these things are excruciatingly obvious to anyone SANE .
I do n't think it is just a coincidence that the percentages of religiously insane ( fundamentalist of any flavor ) happen to match almost exactly with the 25 - 30 % of the population that still supports this war criminal Bush .
They are also a very large part of those that do n't believe the elections were stolen and that 9/11 happened just like the official conspiracy theory states .
I have little hope for this country as long as it is 100 % mandatory that any elected official , president , congress etc .
Must prove that they are clinically insane before they run for office .

I would n't say " F*** Rense " ; I would instead point out that rense.com is an utterly crackpot Jew - hating website .
And there you have it .

These elections were not stolen ( unless you 're talking about the possible theft in Washington State 2004 ) , President Bush and his cabinet members are " not treasonous war criminals " , and Fox News is a lot more accurate than A - Mess - NBC will ever hope to be , particularly with Keith " Go F*** Your Mother " Olbermann leading that network over the cliff .
Who cares about your 10 - year - old theory ?
It sounds like people who are theorizing that we never landed on the moon .
Theories crafted under the influence of hallucinogens are n't worth much .

OMG , LOL
Bush and his crime syndicate have been proven to be treasonous war criminals many times over .
Been found guilty of all charges in 3 separate War Crimes Tribunals .
Both elections were clearly and blatantly stolen , also proven well beyond any reasonable doubt .
Talking about " hallucinating " .
Not only cant you handle the truth you apparently cant even handle REALITY .
You are in serious need of psychiatric care , someone in your delusional state should not be walking the streets freely .

" Found guilty of all charges in 3 separate war crimes tribunals ... "
Tribunals led by who ?
Wacked - out college professors and other self - appointed " experts " who conducted kangaroo court circus trials .
It has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt that this stolen - election blather is a laughable collection of internet twaddle , mathematical noodling and leaps of logic that would safely clear the Grand Canyon .
Bush won .
Kerry lost .
Gore lost .
I will be walking the streets once again after I am done here , so put that in your bong and smoke it .

All 3 tribunals lead by patriots from over 11 different countries .
Granted they were not hand picked Reich wing sycophants but would you expect for the Mafia to condemn themselves and then arrest themselves for instance ?
Apparently you would because regardless of whom was on the tribunal it would make no difference to you and you damn well know it .
The information they gathered and the verdict they all came to were well documented and only a complete lunatic could have come up with any other decision given the vast amount of irrefutable evidence they had to go on .

There is another one coming up soon .

As for the election fraud , cant get any plainer than this site right here that the election have been stolen , but of course you know that you are just in some sort of psychotic denial .
Oh well , nothing can be done with people like you .
You are akin to a Young Earth Creationist , no amount of irrefutable evidence from 1000s of the most respected sources will ever make a bit of difference to someone that is clearly delusional .
you are a waste of time .

Like I said , kangaroo court " tribunals " that are led by crackpot academia , and that includes Velvel , who even wants President Bush executed .
Hey Velvel , you make any attempt to kill President Bush or any other cabinet members , and we will throw you in prison .
These " tribunals " carry no weight .
They are based in hallucinogenic fantasy .
These elections were not stolen .
I will continue to make valuable use of my time by saying so .

In a way it must kinda nice being so delusional since you have absolutely no idea what is going on around you , but I cant help feeling very sorry for people like you .
I am done wasting my time discussing anything with someone that has proven they need psychiatric care , it serves no purpose be like trying to teach my cat calculus .
So you are on / ignore .
Seek therapy , I would suggest taking a stroll to your nearest Sanitarium , as you are walking up to the front desk tilt your head back and close your eyes while waving your arms back N forth shouting " praise him " and spew any verse of your choosing .
When you feel the net drop over you just keep your eyes closed , you will feel a sharp sting of the needle but do n't fight it , they are there to help you .

( Natural News ) Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of heart attacks , strokes and other cardiovascular events , according to a study conducted by researchers at the Harvard Medical School and published in the American Heart Association 's journalResearchers followed 1,739 people for five years , assessing their vitamin D levels by means of regular blood tests .
The average age of participants was 59 .
All participants were white , had no prior history of cardiovascular disease , and were the children of the original participants in the multigenerational Framingham Heart Study .
Participants with low levels of vitamin D had a 60 percent higher chance of experiencing a cardiovascular event , including heart attack , heart failure or stroke , during the study period than participants with high blood levels .
The correlation remained even after researchers adjusted for other risk factors such as diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol .
Those who had both vitamin D deficiency and high blood pressure had twice the risk of cardiovascular events as those who had vitamin D deficiency alone .
" There is a growing body of experimental literature suggesting that vitamin D may have some actions on the heart and major blood levels , " said lead researcher Thomas Wang .
" As a corollary , the lack of vitamin D may be associated with the development of cardiac abnormalities .
" The connection between Vitamin D and bone health is well - established , due to the vitamin 's role in helping the body absorb calcium .
Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a bone softening disorder in children known as rickets , and can increase adults ' risk of osteoporosis .
More recent research has also suggested that high vitamin D intake may also protect against certain cancers and the neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis .
The body naturally produces vitamin D upon exposure to sunlight .
Health professionals recommend that light - skinned people get 10 to 15 minutes of sunshine exposure at least three times per week , and that darker skinned people get up to twice that amount .
Folding urban bike is great concept of flexibility .
Today a lot of emphasis is being given to flexibility and sustainability with respect to mode of transport .
In these lines comes the concept designed by English designer Thomas Jowen .
He has named this conceptual design as ‘ One ’ , which is an urban bike that can be folded when not in use .
The bike has a standard handle with saddle as in any bike but the difference being that it looks sporty .
When it is folded , it makes a compact round shaped design which hardly occupies any space .
It surely looks a good solution to road congestion .

Antifascist Calling …
August 15 , 2008
Operation Sentinel , a new program unveiled by the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , would encircle Manhattan with thousands of surveillance cameras that photograph every car or truck entering and exiting the city across its network of bridges and tunnels .
Information captured by this intrusive project would be stored in a huge database for an undisclosed period of time .
Additionally , a network of sensors installed at toll plazas would allegedly be able to capable detect radiological materials that could be used in potential terror plots , the New York Times reports .
However , the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) has denounced the proposal as " an attack on New Yorkers ’ right to privacy . "
NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman lambasted this outrageous proposal saying ,
" The NYPD ’s latest plan to track and monitor the movements of millions of law - abiding people is an assault on this country ’s historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone .
That this is happening without public debate , and that elected officials have had no opportunity to study this program is even more alarming . "
( " NYCLU : NYPD Plan to Track Millions of Law - Abiding People is an Assault on Privacy Rights , " New York Civil Liberties Union , August 12 , 2008 )
Last month I reported on a high - tech surveillance system under development by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) called " Combat Zones That See " ( CTS ) .
The 2003 program was predicated on the notion that once thousands of digital CCTV networks were installed across occupied or " homeland " cities , CTS would provide occupying troops–or police –with " motion - pattern analysis across whole city scales . "
Based on complex algorithms linked to the numeric recognition of license plate numbers and scanned - in human profiles , CTS would furnish troops–or cops–real - time , " situational awareness " of the " battlespace . "
Despite repeated attempts by NYCLU to obtain information on Operation Sentinel , NYPD and DHS have refused to provide any information about their mega - surveillance system .
While all traces of CTS disappeared from DARPA ’s website , portions of the program have resurfaced with a vengeance , courtesy of the NYPD and DHS .
According to New York Times reporter Al Baker ,
Data on each vehicle–its time - stamped image , license plate imprint and radiological signature –would be sent to a command center in Lower Manhattan , where it would be indexed and stored for at least a month as part of a broad security plan that emphasizes protecting the city ’s financial district , the spokesman , Paul J. Browne , said .
If it were not linked to a suspicious vehicle or a law enforcement investigation , it would be eliminated , he said .
( " City Would Photograph Every Vehicle Entering Manhattan and Sniff Out Radiation , " The New York Times , August 12 , 2008 )
While preventing terrorists from detonating a radiological dirty bomb or a nuclear device in Manhattan–or anywhere else for that matter–is certainly a salutary government function , the misuse of such a system for illegal surveillance of the citizenry cannot be ruled out in advance nor dismissed out of hand as mere paranoia .
In addition to civil liberties concerns–no small matter after all , given the repressive nature of NYPD and DHS–Operation Sentinel ’s grandiose scheme bank on technological systems which do not exist .
The Times dryly notes , the proposed plan " relies on integrating layers of technologies , some that are still being perfected . "
In other words , the program is rife with potential abuse by enterprising security contractors , many with documented histories of promising much , delivering little and with substantial cost overruns borne by the public .
The department currently deploys portable radiation vehicles known as TRACS , or Tactical Radiation Acquisition and Characterization System , which the Times claims can detect radiological agents such as cesium and cobalt , and differentiate " between dangerous ones and ones used in products like smoke detectors or medical devices . "
However , as I reported in June , another system under development , the " Advanced Spectroscopic Portal " or ASP , allegedly a more " advanced " system than those currently used , failed , as do today ’s systems , to differentiate between the components of a radiological dirty bomb and natural radiation emitters such as kitty litter , ceramics and bananas !
As I noted , the ASP program is already tens of millions of dollars above the original estimate provided by Raytheon , other contractors and DHS .
Why therefore , would any sane person believe that the system currently under consideration would be anymore functional or cost effective ?
Unless that is , Operation Sentinel ’s real purpose is to enhance an already - formidable surveillance state .
NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and his staff have been " urging the creation of a London - style surveillance system for the financial district that relies on license plate readers , movable roadblocks and 3,000 public and private security cameras below Canal Street , all linked to a coordination center at 55 Broadway .
Known as the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative , the center is to open in September , " according to the Times .
NYPD spokesperson Paul J. Browne " could not say , when the program [ Operation Sentinel ] would be completed , " though " the Lower Manhattan Initiative is expected to be in place by 2010 . "
Since 2007 , NYPD have been using CTS - type CCTV systems to read license plates linked to databases for ( unspecified ) " intelligence purposes . "
And if the illegal handling of the 2004 Republican National Convention protests are an indication of Operation Sentinel ’s intended purpose , New York City residents ’ outrage with the proposal are fully justified .
The Times revealed their own proclivities on this score when they prominently featured the " analysis " of so - called " terrorism expert , " Steven Emerson , the executive director of the Washington - D.C. - based Investigative Project on Terrorism , a right - wing think - tank with close ties to the Bush administration and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani .
When civil libertarians ( unnamed by the " newspaper of record " ) voiced concerns over the intrusive nature of Operation Sentinel and the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative , Emerson dismissed their apprehensions out of hand ,
" It is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically , or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions , it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and –if need be–track down the drivers or the passengers , " he said .
" The bottom line is they ca n’t frisk everybody coming into Manhattan ; they cannot wand everyone , as they do at airports .
This is a passive collection of data that is not as personally invasive as what they do at airports . "
An Islamophobe with a long record of blaming Muslims and the left for every act of terrorism under the sun , Emerson demonstrated his bona fides in 1995 when he claimed that " Arab terrorists " were responsible for the horrific bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City .
The blast claimed 168 lives , including 19 children in a daycare center while wounding hundreds of others .
Attentive readers may recall that the Murrah building bombing was in fact , carried out by a neo -Nazi gang linked to Timothy McVeigh and the Aryan Republican Army .
While Emerson claims Operation Sentinel is " a passive collection of data , " as the American Civil Liberties Union reports , there are currently more than one million names in an FBI - administered database known as the Terrorist Screening Center .
Such an unwieldy monstrosity is hardly a tightly - focused list of potential " threats " !
But let ’s be clear : Operation Sentinel , and a host of other programs cooked - up by Bush regime war criminals and their corporatist allies is another sordid scheme to keep Americans terrorized , while destroying our civil liberties under cover of " homeland security . "

Apple 's adventures with Mac clones had at best , mixed results , and Steve Jobs quickly ended the program in 1997 after his return as CEO .
While a company named Psystar ignored that memo when it decided to release its own unofficial Mac clones earlier this year , there 's no way it 's going to miss Apple 's latest memo , which came in the form of a just - uncovered lawsuit filed earlier this month .
This past April , Psystar made instant waves by announcing a bargain - basement Mac clone for $ 399 that could run Leopard , the latest version of Apple 's Mac OS X. Psystar 's PC is an upgradeable tower with a respectable amount of features which , at face value , starts $ 200 lower than Apple 's cheapest — and highly unconfigurable — Mac mini at $ 599 .
Despite drawbacks like incompatibility with some Apple software updates , a flood of orders brought the company 's site down for days at a time .
While Apple 's EULA forbids running Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware , Ars received a " no comment " from Psystar in April about the issue , and the company 's clones eventually began shipping .
Even Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak who is no longer with the company said that he " may get one . "
Shipments have reportedly remained slow and steady since the initial storm that met the clones ' launch .
Meanwhile , Apple remained tight - lipped about the issue — until now .
A ZDNet reader tipped the site to the fact that Apple has finally filed suit against Psystar in the US District Court for the Northern District of California .
The lawsuit accuses Psystar of violating Apples licenses and trademarks , as well as copyright infringement .
While the lawsuit comes as no surprise , the fact that Apple waited to file suit until July 3 to sue Psystar is .
Strangely enough , a copy of the complaint is not yet available on PACER , although there 's no indication that it 's under seal .
Reached by phone , Psystar declined to comment to Ars , and attempts to reach the company 's CEO have been unsuccessful .
Apple has also yet to respond to our requests for comment on the lawsuit .
Psystar has not filed its response to Apple 's complaint .
According to court documents seen by Ars , initial filings are due in October , with a case management conference scheduled for October 22 .

The fusillade of belligerence fired at “ major powers ” came as Tehran was poised to reject demands to curtail its nuclear programme .
The country ’s chief nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , spoke to Javier Solana , the EU ’s foreign affairs supremo , to tender a belated response to an offer of compensation in return for a suspension of its uranium production .
Officials in Tehran said the country was not yet ready to accept the core requirement that its suspect research programme is abandoned .
In advance of the discussion Iran announced it had developed a “ unique ” new surface - to - ship missile with a range of 200 miles .
General Mohammad Ali Jafari , the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp ( IRGC ) hinted the missile would boost Iran ’s defensive capabilities in the Gulf , the key oil artery where it regularly contests the dominance of the US Navy .

Huge cliffs and vast basins were revealed in the survey
By Mike McKimm
Science Correspondent , BBC Northern Ireland
It 's a landscape no human has even seen .
And those who live right beside it had no idea it even existed .
Deep below the sea , off the north coast of Northern Ireland , a dramatic geological mystery has been discovered .
Huge cliffs , vast basins and plateaus , a lake and even rivers have been found .
But so far no - one is certain what caused them to end up like this deep under the sea .
The discovery was made when the seabed was being surveyed to update old Admiralty charts , drawn up in the mid-1800s .
Funded by the European Union and backed by the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency , a survey vessel has been scanning the seabed along most of the north coast of Ireland , including the seabed north of Rathlin Island .
Marine biologists have been surveying the sea bed Most of the bottom was largely flat and unremarkable , but as the survey headed east it suddenly came across an unexpected landscape .
For the first time marine biologists could understand what was down there and the scale of it all .
" I 'm always very envious of my terrestrial biologist colleagues " , said Joe Breen , Head of Aquatic Science with Northern Ireland 's new Environment Agency , who has dived the area for years .
" They can go out on land and see where their habitats are .
Underwater we 've never had that luxury .
" On a dive you can only see about 15 metres so it 's like operating in fog .
Now , with this survey , we can report on the true extent of the features .
" For the European Habitat Directive , we have to report the extent of our reefs and sandbanks .
This will help with the whole concept of marine spatial planning .
" So , if someone wants to put in renewable energy or extract aggregate , we now have a blueprint and can see how they 're going to interact and if it 's sustainable . "
The survey is to update old Admiralty charts of the area
One of the most striking details is a large lake or crater on what was once the top of huge cliffs towering above the plateau below .
The streams and rivers that fed it are still clearly defined .
And that raises one of the mysteries .
Why did coastal erosion not obliterate all that detail as the sea slow rose over the land ?
Could it mean that some cataclysmic event took place that allowed the sea to overwhelm the land before erosion could begin ?
But already the marine scientists are excited about what they 've found .
" We can now get a true idea of the true extent of the rare and endangered species and habitats " , said Mr Breen .
" We can now see that we have got more of certain features which we were n't aware of - like sandbanks and reefs .
The sandbank features in particular are stunning . "
The survey is part of a 2 m euro cross - border collaboration with the Marine Institute of Ireland .
The area covered is a three nautical mile strip ranging from Tory Island off Donegal to Torr Head near Ballycastle .

Islamist Angst How Germany Is Dismantling Civil Rights amid Terror Fears
Germany has so far been spared a bloody Islamist terror attack .
But it only took two planned attacks in Germany to persuade a majority of the population to support a massive dismantling of civil rights .
Von Jochen Bölsche
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a $ 612.5 billion defense spending bill for fiscal 2009 , including $ 70 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As passed by the Senate on an 88 - 8 vote , the bill would authorize $ 103.9 billion for Pentagon procurement , $ 1.2 billion more than President George W. Bush ’s request .
Overall , Bush had asked for $ 611.1 billion for national defense .
The bill shifts more of the costs of Iraq ’s reconstruction onto Baghdad .
It also imposes further restrictions on contractor personnel working in Iraq , including prohibitions on interrogations and the performance of “ inherently governmental functions ” in combat .
The bill must now be reconciled with the version passed by the House of Representatives on May 22 .
The Senate bill also trims Bush ’s request for spending on missile defense programs .
The truth about the Georgian / Russian conflict is slowly coming out .
The western media can only spin and lie so much , but eventually the real truth of what Georgia has done and is doing filters through .
Steve Harrigan chased by Georgian gunmen " This is an irregular , undisciplined , chaotic , angry , humiliated Georgian force .
They do n't listen to orders .
They fire on civilians , from what we have just seen .

Obama camp condemns song : Ludacris ' should be ashamed '
Barack Obama 's campaign is condemning a song by the rapper Ludacris that praises Obama and bitterly attacks Senators Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
" As Barack Obama has said many , many times in the past , rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny , materialism , and degrading images that he does n’t want his daughters or any children exposed to , " said spokesman Bill Burton .
" This song is not only outrageously offensive to Senator Clinton , Reverend Jackson , Senator McCain , and President Bush , it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear .
While Ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics . "
" Hillary hated on you , so that bitch is irrelevant , " say the lyrics .
" McCain do n't belong in ANY chair unless he 's paralyzed Yeah I said it cause Bush is mentally handicapped . "
The song also celebrates Obama 's rise .
" The first black president is destined and it's meant to be , " go the lyrics , calling on voters to " paint the White House black .
The song notes that Obama has praised Ludacris , and calls on him to " give Luda a special pardon if I 'm ever in the slammer . "
" The world is ready for change because Obama is here ! " it concludes .

Bob Novak , the rightwing columnist who treasonously revealed the clandestine identity of CIA WMD investigator Valerie Plame , has been diagnosed with a brain tumor , but recently returned to producing short squibs for his syndicate , including the latest on Joe Lieberman 's chances of being named as John McCain 's VP on Friday :
Reports of strong support within John McCain 's presidential campaign for Independent Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman as the Republican candidate for vice president are not a fairy tale .
Influential McCain backers , plus McCain himself , would pick the pro-choice liberal from Connecticut if they thought they could get away with it .
But they can't get away with it --- and this has been made clear to McCain by none other than Joe Lieberman himself .
Lieberman surely does n't know that much about Republican politics , but he has close Republican friends .
One of them prevailed on Lieberman to tell McCain that a McCain - Lieberman ticket would be a disaster for all concerned , and especially for the GOP .

From bread and circuses to theater of the absurd .
In this Faux News video from Denver , a " reporter " who would double for Clark Kent , attempts to interview " far left " protesters from the government provocateur operation , Recreate 68 .
Of course , for the corporate media , anybody against the occupation of Iraq and the possible invasion of Iran is with Recreate 68 .
It ’s a joke .
The " far leftists " are mostly of high school age , they surround Clark Kent and he gets tussled a smidgen , they shout obscenities and refuse to play Faux ’s game .
" Fuck corporate media , " declares an " anarchist " with a red bandanna over his face .
" Not all of them are Obama fans , " Clark Kent says , " that ’s perhaps the biggest surprise of all . "
Right .
Big surprise , Clark .
In other words , the supposed far leftists , organized by COINTELPRO operatives determined to antagonize the militarized police and get people beaten to a pulp , do not fit nicely in Faux ’s little false right - left paradigm construct .
According to Clark , the marchers are against " free speech " because they refuse to talk to him , Rupert Murdoch , and the blond bimbo back in New York holding down a desk .
Faux ’s coverage is not theater of the absurd , it is theater of the lame .
In fact , it is a fine example of government orchestration and spin all around — from the government op Recreate 68 , designed to make people who have legitimate grievances with the government look like " far left " radicals and bomb - throwers , to a seriously biased corporate media determined to hook the banker ’s choice , Barack Obama , up with Ward Churchill .

hey !
This is a great recipe , just do n't follow it !
Recipe asks for a can of refried beans , cook your own pound of pinto beans , add extra garlic ( a whole head ) , maybe 4 chopped Serrano peppers , six or eight Tomatillos , and a pound and a half of bacon and simmer for 3 hours .
But after a couple hours remove one quarter .
Add that quarter back in after mashing the original three quarters .
Add bunch of destemmed cilantro just before cooking finishes .
I fried my own quartered corn tortillas , a lot , using peanut oil .
I added some sea salt after cooking .
I used a shredded fresh Mexican cheese and some sharp Cheddar on top of the chips just before microwaving .
Then , after in the center I put some home made Salsa Verde and homemade Guacamole ( look for recipes to try )
Follow this recipe , just make it all yourself !
Really great , you will be invited to parties !
“ It ’s quite a big change to go from an incident - based system to a course of conduct over time that involves power and control and intimidatory tactics , ” said Hayley Foster , the chief executive of Women ’s Safety NSW , which is one of the advocates of the change .
“ The legislative reform will be a really important step . ”
Part of the impetus for the measure came from former ABC journalist Jess Hill , who wrote a book about women under the control of violent partners , See What You Made Me Do , which has been lavished with awards .
Ms Hill has cited the example of a husband who forced his wife to sleep in their car with their newly born child .
She was only allowed inside the family home to clean and for sex , according to Ms Hill .
The number of murders by an intimate partner have ranged between 49 and 64 each year this decade , according to the national homicide monitoring program .
“ Introducing a new offence for coercive control in NSW would be a highly complex but potentially very worthwhile reform and one which absolutely merits thorough research and consultation , ” Mr Speakman said .
‘ Orwellian Liberals ’
Some conservatives have expressed concern that the law would penalise men for behaviour that upsets their wives but should not be considered criminal .
Mark Latham , One Nation ’s leader in NSW , said husbands could be jailed for 14 years for withdrawing money from a joint bank account and driving the family car without permission .
“ The NSW Orwellian Liberals are now aiming to put marriages and families on trial for the newly invented DV [ domestic violence ] offence , coercive control , ” he tweeted .
“ A shocking , misleading grab for power . ”
Ms Foster said the examples cited by Mr Latham were “ preposterous and quite absurd ” .
Labor ’s draft law includes a defence that specifies that unreasonable behaviour is not necessarily criminal to ensure “ people who behave poorly do n’t end up with a criminal sanction ” , said Trish Doyle , Labor ’s spokeswoman for the prevention of domestic violence and sexual assault .
The law would not , however , require prosecutors to prove that a victim had been harmed psychologically or physically .
Instead , courts would assess if they believed the perpetrator intended to harm the victim , or was recklessly indifferent to the harm they might have caused .
“ Because , if we require the victim to prove actual psychological harm , it becomes a long , drawn - out case , ” Ms Foster said .
“ They have to prove their victimhood . ”
The easier legal test makes prosecutions more likely .
In Britain , 73 per cent of men charged with coercive control in 2017 pleaded guilty , according to research cited by Women ’s Safety NSW .
Even advocates acknowledge that the new law may not work .
In 2004 , Tasmania prohibited economic abuse and emotional abuse or intimidation .
The offences have rarely been prosecuted , in part because police have n’t been trained to use them , according to women ’s safety advocates .
Does the Bailout Ignore Homeowners , Execs ?
The final bill has weaker help for homeowners and lax limits on executive pay .
Sept. 29 , 2008  --
The compromise financial industry bailout bill -- like most things out of Washington -- has a little bit of everything for all parties but also falls short of what some had hoped to get out of the bill .
Nobody seems in love with it , but leaders from both parties called its passage essential to get the U.S. economy back on track .
There are limits to executive pay and requirements to help homeowners struggling with their mortgages , but neither of those sections of the bill are as strong as originally proposed .
" It 's not a bill that any one of us would have written .
It 's a much better bill than we got .
It 's not as good as it should be , " Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , the House Financial Services Committee chairman , said Sunday night .
CLICK HERE for the full text of the bailout legislation in PDF form .
" This agreement , while not perfect , will help stabilize the economy , " added Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid during the same news conference .
The main thrust of the bill , called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , gives the Treasury Department $ 250 billion to immediately start buying up troubled assets -- such as mortgages -- from banks and other financial institutions .
The president can spend an additional $ 100 billion if needed , and a final $ 350 billion is available unless Congress votes not to spend it .
Republicans also added in a provision to create a program that allows banks to buy government insurance to back their existing investments , rather than selling them outright to the government .
It 's a way to protect any ultimate losses for the banks ' current investments , and it's what Wall Street wanted .
President Bush said this morning that this is a " bold bill that will help keep the crisis in our financial system from spreading throughout our economy . "
" Every member of Congress and every American should keep in mind .
A vote for this bill is a vote to prevent economic damage to you and your community , " Bush said .
But Americans might be disappointed by a couple provisions .
Main Street had called for limits on how many millions of dollars Wall Street executives could be paid and asked for help for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages .
The bill falls short of original expectations in both areas .
Executive Pay
There are pay caps written into the bill , but only for companies that sell more than $ 300 million in troubled assets to the government .
Those companies will be prohibited from making any new employment contracts with their top five senior executives that provide a golden parachute in the event of " involuntary termination , bankruptcy filing , insolvency or receivership . "
But that applies only to new contracts .
Executives with such big payouts already written into their contracts would be exempt from the new restrictions .
A senior treasury official , in a conference call with reporters Sunday night , was very clear that the government would not be breaking existing executive employment contracts .
" We are not abrogating contracts , " he said .
" Those are contractual obligations between the companies and their employees .
This is on a go - forward basis . "
Executives in participating companies would no longer be taxed at the normal personal income tax rate for stock options or severance , and would face an additional 20 percent tax on such payouts .
Executives of bailed - out firms who receive bonuses or other awards that later turn out to be based on " materially inaccurate " financial reports will need to give that money back .
The participating companies would also lose part of an existing tax break : Instead of being able to deduct up to $ 1 million each for the top five executives in the company as part of payroll taxes , they could deduct up to $ 500,000 each .
" The bill ensures that failed executives do n't receive a windfall from your tax dollars , " Bush said this morning .
But some disagree .
" The bailout hardly restricts executive compensation , " said Peter Morici , a professor at the University of Maryland 's Robert H. Smith School of Business .
" Those provisions are vague , except for golden parachutes , and really only apply to banks the government would take over . "
" Restrictions on compensation do not apply to work performed by incumbent employees until a bank goes bust , " Morici added .
" Hence , the banks will be free to continue to pay executives through bonus systems that encourage reckless decisions and get banks in further trouble .
Only after banks get in trouble again , can the government get involved in compensation and management practices . "
So why did n't the bill go further on executive compensation ?
Government officials wanted to encourage healthy companies to participate in the program to get rid of their bad assets and be more willing to make new loans .
They feared that creating stricter compensation rules would serve as a disincentive .
" We want to encourage all institutions , very healthy institutions , to participate .
So we think this is the appropriate way to protect the taxpayers and also get maximum participation , " said one treasury official .
" Congress missed a golden opportunity to use the leverage of the bailout to put tough controls on an out - of - control executive pay system , " said Sarah Anderson , the global economy project director of the Institute for Policy Studies .
" Without clear limits on pay , the public is being asked to put their trust in [ Treasury ] Secretary [ Henry ]
Paulson , a man who made hundreds of millions of dollars as a Wall Street CEO , to decide what 's ' excessive . ' "
Help for Homeowners
For homeowners , the legislation would require the treasury secretary to implement " a plan to mitigate foreclosures " and to " encourage servicers of mortgages to modify loans . "
That language is weaker than a proposal that was circulated late last week , which called for the government to " maximize and coordinate efforts to modify mortgages for homeowners at risk of foreclosure . "
Basically the government will work through Hope for Homeowners and other programs to refinance high - rate mortgages into more affordable fixed - rate mortgages .
There is no money in the bill specifically allocated for homeowner help , and the Treasury Department still has to set up a plan outlining specifically which homeowners would get help and how much .
But as the new owner of these mortgages , it would be in the government 's financial interest to stop the tide of foreclosures .
How practical that will be is still very unclear .
Mortgages were broken into pieces and sold to a number of investors .
If some investors participate in the plan and others do n't , the government might be unable to work out a refinancing plan for some mortgages .
Taxpayers on the Hook
Nobody knows exactly how much money this bailout will cost taxpayers .
The government can spend up to $ 700 billion to buy the bad assets , but lawmakers hope to ultimately spend less .
First , not all assets will be purchased outright .
Some companies could choose to purchase insurance instead , saving the government millions of dollars .
Next , the government will be given ownership stakes in companies whose assets are purchased .
If those companies start turning large profits once they get rid of the bad debt , the government stands to reap some of those profits .
" I know many Americans are worried about the cost of the bill , and I understand their concern , " Bush said this morning .
" This bill commits up to $ 700 billion taxpayer , because a large amount of money is necessary to have an impact on our financial system .
However , both the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget expect that the ultimate cost to the taxpayer will be far less than that .
In fact , we expect that over time , much -- if not all -- of the tax dollars we invest will be paid back . "
If the government is still losing money on the program after five years , the president will have to submit a plan to somehow recoup a portion of the losses from the companies that participated in the bailout .
The catch :
If the companies do n't exist in five years there is no way to get money back from them .
" It does entail risk , taxpayer risk , but we 've reduced the taxpayer risk considerably , " said Rep. John Boehner , the House minority leader .
" Nobody wants to have to support this bill , " the Ohio lawmaker added in comments Sunday night .
But , " I 'm encouraging every member whose conscience will allow them to support this . "
Big Brother database recording all our calls , texts and e-mails will ' ruin British way of life '
Plans for a massive database snooping on the entire population were condemned yesterday as a ‘ step too far for the British way of life ’ .
In an Orwellian move , the Home Office is proposing to detail every phone call , e-mail , text message , internet search and online purchase in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime .
But the privacy watchdog , Information Commissioner Richard Thomas , warned that the public ’s traditional freedoms were under grave threat from creeping state surveillance .
Big Brother : Critics warn our surveillance culture is going too far
Apart from the Government ’s inability to hold data securely , he said the proposals raised ‘ grave questions ’ .
‘ Do the risks we face provide justification for such a scheme in the first place ?
Do we want the state to have details of more and more aspects of our private lives ?
‘ Whatever the benefits , would such a scheme amount to excessive surveillance ?
Would this be a step too far for the British way of life ? ’
It is thought the scheme would allow the police or MI5 to access the exact time when a phone call was made , the number dialled , the length of the call and , in the case of mobile phones , the location of the handset to within an accuracy of a few hundred yards .
Similarly for e-mails , it would provide details of when they were sent and who the recipients were .
Police recovering a suspect ’s computer would then be able to trawl through hard - drive records and recover particular messages .
The content of telephone calls could not be recovered unless they were being intercepted at the time .
Mr Thomas ’s warnings were backed by privacy campaigners , who claimed such Big Brother powers would give Government agencies unprecedented abilities to trawl through intimate details of ordinary people ’s private lives at will .
He used the launch of his annual report to speak out after ministers signalled their intentions in their programme of legislation earlier this year , describing the new Bill as ‘ modifying procedures for acquiring communications data ’ .
Warning : Information Commissioner Richard Thomas
There are fears that the data will be shared with foreign governments – such as the Americans demanding personal details of air passengers – accessed by internet hackers or lost by bungling civil servants .
Opponents pointed out that town halls are already using extraordinary surveillance powers under the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act to investigate minor issues such as littering , or checking whether parents are abusing school catchment area rules , and they could be given access to almost unthinkable levels of personal data under the new scheme .
Currently police and MI5 can access customer records stored by telephone companies , but only with a warrant to examine individual accounts .
Mr Thomas said : ‘ I am absolutely clear that the targeted and duly - authorised interception of the communications of suspects can be invaluable in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime .
‘ But there needs to be the fullest public debate about the justification for , and implications of , a specially created database – potentially accessible to a wide range of law enforcement authorities – holding details of everyone ’s telephone and internet communications .
' Do we really want the police , security services and other organs of the state to have access to more and more aspects of our private lives ? ’
Opposition MPs said the Government ’s dismal records on safeguarding private data – most notably the loss of the entire child benefit database holding millions of people ’s financial details – showed it was incapable of safeguarding such a vast volume of information safely , and the scheme should be dropped immediately .
An estimated 3 billion emails are sent in Britain every day and last year 57 billion text messages were sent .
The Home Office yesterday defended the need to keep its surveillance powers up to date with changing internet technology , and said full details of the plans would be published this year as part of a new Communications Data Bill .
Officials said the internet was rapidly revolutionising communications and it was vital for surveillance powers to keep up with technology in order to fight serious crime and terrorism .
DNA database
Britain 's crime - fighting DNA database was the world ’s first , in 1995 , and is now the world ’s largest .
Originally samples were taken from those arrested but destroyed if they were not convicted .
Today anyone who is arrested - even if innocent - has DNA taken without consent , even if it has nothing to do with the case .
It is added to the database , and stays there forever .
It is virtually impossible to have it removed .
Unsurprisingly , new entries are being added at the rate of more than a million a year .
Number plate checks
Police forces use hundreds of Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras across the UK , some at fixed sites and some in cars .
Computers are able to compare numbers with a national database of cars which may be stolen , or whose owners are wanted for questioning .
Each check takes around four seconds .
Since last year , the Government has been developing a central database which also records the details every time a car passes an ANPR camera , anywhere in Britain .

Mark David Chapman was denied parole yesterday , for the fifth time .
The man who murdered John Lennon on December 8 , 1980 was sentenced to 20 years to life for his crime .
The week before his parole hearing , the parole board received 50 letters and a petition signed by 1000 people opposing Chapman ’s release .
He had three letters of support .
Chapman has long claimed that the peace - loving Beatle would have forgiven him , but Lennon ’s widow , Yoko Ono , told the Daily News that she is opposed to Chapman receiving parole , and believes he should remain incarcerated for his own safety , saying , “ There are so many people out there who dislike him .
It 's safer for him to stay in jail . "
And Chapman ’s time in prison has n’t exactly been what you ’d call “ hard ” time .
Although he ’s been behind bars at Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York since 1981 , he ’s enjoyed 42 - hour conjugal visits in a private modular home with his wife Gloria since 1992 .
He has his own prison cell in a special housing unit for at - risk prisoners and allegedly spends a lot of time in the library .
He also claims to be a Christian now and has said if paroled he would “ … go from place to place , at least in the state , church to church , and tell people what happened to me and point them the way to Christ . "
( Read more of Chapman ’s comments from his 2000 parole hearing here ) .
Chapman will be eligible for parole again in 2010 .

The pill that 'll get you fit ... and you wo n't have to move a muscle
A pill that makes the body fit without the need for exercise has been hailed by scientists following astonishing test results .
The drug fools the muscles into thinking they have worked out long and hard , which means they rapidly burn fat and boost fitness .
It has been hailed as the couch potato 's dream , giving the benefits of exercise without leaving the sofa .
Scientists found the drug boosts fat burning and stamina in inactive mice
Experts say it could combat ills from obesity to muscle - wasting diseases .
Even the frailty of old age could be eased by the drug 's muscle - building powers , the U.S. scientists believe .
Researcher Ronald Evans , a world - leading biologist , said : ' We have exercise in a pill . '
But its arrival on pharmacy shelves is believed to be several years away .
Professor Evans , of the Salk Institute in California , showed that the drug , known as AICAR , boosts fat burning processes and stamina in inactive mice .
' Couch - potato ' animals that took AICAR for four weeks burned more calories and had less fat than untreated mice .
When tested on a treadmill , they could run almost 50 per cent longer than untreated mice .
Effectively , they had become fit without moving a muscle , which Professor Evans said left him ' blown away ' .
' It is tricking the muscle into " believing " it 's been exercised daily , ' he said .
' It proves you can have a pharmacological equivalent to exercise . '
A second drug , GW1516 , produced even better results , but only in conjunction with regular exercise , the journal Cell reports .
After a month of taking that drug and exercising , mice could run 70 per cent further than other mice that had worked out on the treadmill but did not get
the drug .
' The dramatic effect of the drug was stunning , ' said the professor .
It is thought the drugs reprogramme the muscles , boosting the number of fat - burning fibres and allowing them to contract repeatedly without tiring .
They flick a ' master switch ' in muscle metabolism , increasing the production of ' slow - twitch ' muscle fibres which burn fat rather than sugar for energy .
AICAR also raises levels of an enzyme that tells muscles they are running low in energy and need to burn some fat .
The researchers say their work offers hope for the obese , those with muscle - wasting diseases and those who cannot exercise because of a medical condition .
The pills could also offer the benefits of exercise to those who cannot find time to fit the gym into their hectic working day .
' Almost no one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise , ' said Professor Evans .
' For this group of people , if there was a way to mimic exercise , it would make the quality of the exercise that they do more efficient . '
Fellow researcher Dr Vihang Narkar cautioned that a pill would not be a panacea , saying a healthy diet and exercise are ' cardinal ' to good health .
AICAR , the version that worked without exercise , is already in advanced human testing to see if it can prevent a particular complication of heart bypass surgery .
The second drug was being tested as a cholesterol - lowering pill .
However , trials were halted over concerns about safety .
Professor Stephen Bloom , of Imperial College London , said : ' Even if these particular agents turn out to have side - effects , the proof of principle is still there and we can look forward to someone making something which is safe and effective . '
Dr Colin Waine , of the National Obesity Forum , called the research ' important ' but added that at the moment the best way to tackle weight problems was with healthy eating and increased physical activity .

Karzai told journalists in Kabul that as long as Pakistan - based insurgents attack Afghanistan , destroy its infrastructure , and kill its children , the Afghan government equally has the right to target Taliban leaders and bases inside Pakistan .
" Afghanistan has the right of self defense , " he said .
" When [ the Taliban ] cross the territory from Pakistan to come and kill Afghans and to kill coalition troops , it exactly gives us the right to go back and do the same . "
Personal Warning
Karzai cited the names of several Pakistani Taliban leaders and warned that they could be targeted in their homes .
" Baitullah Mahsud should know that we will go after him now and hit him in his house , " Karzai said .
" Fazlullah should know the same that we will go after him and hit him in his house and in his bases .
And the other fellow , Mullah Omar of Pakistan , should know the same .
This is a two - way road in this case and Afghans are good in the two - way road journey .
We will complete the journey and we will get them and we will defeat them and we will avenge all that they have done in Afghanistan for the past so many years . "
However , Karzai made it clear that Afghanistan has no desire to fight against the people of Pakistan .
And he argued that any Afghan efforts against the Pakistan - based Taliban would help liberate Pashtuns in Pakistan from the tyranny of terrorism .
Some 30 million Pahtuns live in Pakistan , concentrated mostly along the border with Afghanistan and with some living in territories now controlled by Taliban .
Karzai said that " Baitullah Mahsud , Mullah Omar of Pakistan , and Fazlullah all are the creation of Pakistani intelligence agencies together with some Pashtuns of Pakistan and some Afghans . "
He said that " these people have been tasked with burning schools in the Pashtun regions of Pakistan , preventing their daughters from going to schools , destroying their livelihoods , killing the Pashtun tribal leaders in Pakistan . "
And he added , " It is the duty of Afghanistan to liberate the Pashtuns of Pakistan from a life of tyranny and terror . "
Pakistani Response
In Pakistan , Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said his country will not allow anyone to interfere in its affairs .
Speaking to AP , Gilani said the Afghan - Pakistan border is too long to prevent people from crossing , " even if Pakistan puts its entire army along the border . "
The NATO - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) said it will not comment on the issue .
Tensions between the Afghan and Pakistani governments have been rising in recent months as the Pakistani government engages in a cease - fire and negotiates peace deals with Pakistani Taliban leaders .
Afghan authorities and NATO have repeatedly complained about an increase in cross - border attacks following the Pakistani peace deals .
In recent days , ISAF has stepped up their efforts to target Taliban fighters in the Pakistan border region .
AFP reported that a missile strike in the village of Makeen in Pakistan ’s insurgency - plagued South Waziristan tribal district killed one militant on June 14 .
Pakistani officials told the news agency that an unmanned drone aircraft reportedly launched the strike after coming under fire .
On June 11 , the U.S. - led coalition forces bombed fleeing Taliban insurgents in Pakistan ’s Mohmand tribal districts .
The air strike brought criticism from the Pakistani government , which says the bombs did not kill insurgents but instead 11 paramilitary soldiers .
Washington has expressed regret over the loss of Pakistani life , but has not taken responsibility for the deaths .

Until now , environmental and consumer activists who have questioned the safety of bisphenol A , or BPA , have relied on studies showing harm from exposure in laboratory animals .
But British researchers , who published their findings on Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association , analyzed urine and blood samples from 1,455 U.S. adults aged 18 to 74 who were representative of the general population .
Using government health data , they found that the 25 percent of people with the highest levels of bisphenol A in their bodies were more than twice as likely to have heart disease and , or diabetes compared to the 25 percent of with the lowest levels .
“ Most of these findings are in keeping with what has been found in animal models , ” Iain Lang , a researcher at the University of Exeter in Britain who worked on the study , told a news conference .
“ This is the first ever study ( of this kind ) that has been in the general population , ” Lang said .
Steven Hentges of the American Chemistry Council , a chemical industry group , said the design of the study did not allow for anyone to conclude BPA causes heart disease and diabetes .
“ At least from this study , we cannot draw any conclusion that bisphenol A causes any health effect .
As noted by the authors , further research will be needed to understand whether these statistical associations have any relevance at all for human health , ” Hentges said in a telephone interview .
A U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel of outside experts on Tuesday will hear testimony on health effects from BPA as it reviews a draft report it issued last month calling BPA safe .
“ The study , while preliminary with regard to these diseases in humans , should spur U.S. regulatory agencies to follow recent action taken by Canadian regulatory agencies , which have declared BPA a ‘ toxic chemical ’ requiring aggressive action to limit human and environmental exposures , ” Frederick vom Saal of the University of Missouri and John Peterson Myers of the nonprofit U.S. - based Environmental Health Sciences , wrote in a commentary accompanying the study .
BOTTLES TO UTENSILS
BPA is used to make polycarbonate plastic , a clear shatter - resistant material in products ranging from baby and water bottles to plastic eating utensils to sports safety equipment and medical devices .
It also is used to make durable epoxy resins used as the coating in most food and beverage cans and in dental fillings .
People can consume BPA when it leaches out of plastic into liquid such as baby formula , water or food inside a container .
In the study , the team said the chemical is present in more than 90 percent of people , suggesting there is not much that can be done to avoid the chemical of which over 2.2 million tons is produced each year .
The researchers , who will also present their findings at the U.S. FDA session on Tuesday , added it was too early to identify a mechanism through which the chemical may be doing harm .
Animal studies have suggested the chemical may disrupt hormones , especially estrogen .
The researchers also cautioned that these findings are just the first step and more work is needed to determine if the chemical actually is a direct cause of disease .
“ Bisphenol A is one of the world ’s most widely produced and used chemicals , and one of the problems until now is we do n’t know what has been happening in the general population , ” said Tamara Galloway , a University of Exeter researcher who worked on the study .
Canada ’s government in April decided BPA was harmful to infants and toddlers and announced plans to ban some products .
The European Union ’s top food safety body said in July the amount of BPA found in baby bottles cannot harm human health .
There has been a mid-air collision between two small planes near Melbourne 's Moorabbin Airport .
One of the planes landed safely but the other crashed and one of the pilots was killed .
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority ( CASA ) says a Cessna 150 , which is a two - seater training plane , collided just after 12:30 pm with a Piper Warrior , which seats four people .
The Cherokee landed safely at Moorabbin Airport but the Cessna crashed in a property near the corner of Dandenong and Warrigal Roads .
Witnesses say the Cessna crashed into the garage roof of a unit on Silver Street and burst into flames , killing the pilot .
Alex Mickham lives in the unit next door and was just 10 metres away when the plane came down .
" I did n't realise that it went right in the garage and it burst and the fire started .
It was all red and I was in such shock that I got him out , " Mr Mickham said .
Peter Gibson from the CASA said both planes were light training aircraft operated by the Royal Victorian Aero Club , which is a major flight training organisation .
He said Moorabbin Airport does have air traffic control but it is not clear if the planes were operating under their control or independently .
He said that would be examined as part of an investigation .
Cheltenham East Primary school , which is near the scene , has been shut down but police say the students are safe .
Well that did n’t take long .
It was less than 24 hours ago that Hillary spoke with congressional leaders about her insistence on continuing her fairy tale campaign for the presidency .
As we reported last night , our congressional leaders ( that would be Reid and Pelosi ) said it was fine for Hillary to continue wasting our time , our money , and our focus for yet another month .
But , they said that she would n’t be going negative .
Oops .
Hillary is race - baiting again .
Gee , no one could have predicted that one .
I wrote yesterday how it was rather odd that , within one 24 hour period , Hillary and two top allies kept saying that Obama ’s voters were n’t very good because they ’re black , and that her voters were better because they ’re white .
The language was stark – starker than politicians normally use when talking about race – and even the journalists covering the comments noted as much .
It smelled to me like more than a coincidence .
For some reason , Hillary wanted to drop the word “ white ” and “ black , ” and that somehow mentioning the races , reminding voters that she is white and Obama is black , would help her win .
Considering the Clintons recent history of race - baiting Obama , the reappearance of racial talking points is disturbing .
And now Hillary is doing it again .
This from today ’s USA Today :
“ I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on , ” she said in an interview with USA TODAY .
As evidence , Clinton cited an Associated Press article “ that found how Sen .
Obama ’s support among working , hard - working Americans , white Americans , is weakening again , and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me . ”
“ There ’s a pattern emerging here , ” she said .
You can listen to Hillary boast of her “ white ” support here .
There sure is a pattern emerging here .
The Clintons are using racism to try to win the nomination against a black man .
And our party leaders are okay with it .
( Well , in all fairness , our congressional leaders said that Hillary had better not adopt a “ negative tone . ”
They never said she could n’t adopt a racist one . )
Is it any wonder blacks are n’t voting for Hillary ?
They should n’t vote for Hillary , ever again .
If our party continues to give a thumbs - up to race - baiting in American politics in the year 2008 , race - baiting in our own party , I ’d be very surprised if blacks came out for us in November .
Nor should they .

Solar Power From Outer Space Could Reduce Fossil Fuel Dependence
July 28th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Rising fuel costs have spurred some pretty wacky ideas .
One that maybe is n’t so crazy is harvesting solar power from space .
While the idea is n’t new — NASA and The US Department of Energy studied it throughout the 1970s — the time has come when it might not be too expensive to start pursuing it .
Pravna Mehta , the director of India operations for Space Island Group , a company working to develop solar satellites , thinks space energy has excellent potential .
According to his vision , satellites would electromagnetically beam solar energy to ground - based receivers , where the energy would be converted to electricity and transferred to power grids .
Since satellites in high Earth orbits are unaffected by earth ’s shadows , the energy would be available every day without fail .
Unfortunately , it may be awhile before we see any concrete results from this idea .
While a 2007 Pentagon report encourages the development of space power , Charles Miller of the Space Frontier Association estimates that it will only be possible within the next ten years if we act now .
At the same time , getting into space is n’t cheap , the robotic technology to create solar satellites is not yet available , and someone has to take care of the billion dollar bill for the whole thing .
But with interest from Russia , China , the European Union , and India — and growing anxiety around the world about energy access — perhaps we might be using energy from outer space within our lifetimes .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
In late 1986 , a beach party celebrating the summer solstice marked the first official Burning Man .
Within a few years , its participants had become so many , and its activities so outlandish , that founder Larry Harvey and his friends decided to move the festival to somewhere more appropriate .
They chose the Black Rock desert , a 100 - mile prehistoric lakebed in north - western Nevada , where temperatures regularly reach 110 °F .
By 1997 , Burning Man was already well on the way to becoming a cultural phenomenon .
That year 10,000 people turned up to experience a week of desert living , far outside the mainstream culture of the United States .
Within " Black Rock City " , participants abide by a gift economy , in which commerce of any type is expressly forbidden .
" Burners " must bring all their own food , camping equipment and water ; and are expected to " participate " in one form or another .
Many choose to construct extraordinary temporal pieces of art : full size buildings made of driftwood and junk , flashing sculptures belching flames into the night .
Walking around the desert after dark , this formerly empty expanse shimmers with a thousand projections and creations , impromptu performances , DJ booths , fantastical art cars resembling pirate ships and dragonflies .
" It 's like stepping through the looking glass , " one Burner told me .
" The default world – which is what we call the world outside – just can't compare with this . "
In 2007 , numbers at Burning Man reached 35,000 .
There were people of every age group , from every stratum of society .
I was among them , knowing no one , expecting little more than a fun week in a somewhat surreal environment .
And yet , like thousands before me , the week was transformative , life changing , instantly addictive .
This third largest city in Nevada ( vanishing " without a trace " after the festival ' ) was spotlessly clean , full of highly creative and considerate individuals .
People travelled everywhere by bicycle , some of them naked .
Everywhere I went , people offered me food , free rides on their " mutant vehicles " , invitations to all - night parties , yoga lessons , fire juggling demonstrations .
Dressed in bizarre costumes , wearing sand goggles and dust masks , it seemed easy to take people at face value , little caring what they did outside Black Rock .
The annual theme , which last year was entitled Green Man , seemed to perfectly mesh with the zeitgeist .
Invention and great creativity was needed to rethink the carbon - based structure of our world .
At Burning Man that world seemed to rise up in the present moment , ecologically sound and full of laughter .
It would be all to easy to write off Burning Man as a desert rave , an escape valve for overstressed executives , a 21st - century update on Woodstock .
But more than any of those things , Burning Man is a philosophy , an attempt to reinvent the parameters and constraints of society .
Within the most advanced capitalist economy in the world , participants choose to free themselves from commerce .
Art works are anonymous , often destroyed at the end of the week , even in the case of colossal structures taking months to build .
People make an effort to help each other – a necessary step , actually , given the potentially hostile natural environment .
Unlike any other festival I 've visited , it 's one without celebrity , corporate logos , or personal egos of any kind .
" Given the current cultural and political climate in the United States , " Geoffrey told me , a veteran Burner of seven years , " this is really the only sane place left .
I 've been incredibly broke this year and was n't sure I was going to make it , but then I realised that I had to be here , it 's the only truly sacred experience open to me right now . "
Perhaps more even than the enlightening effects of doing without money , running water or cell phone connection , Burning Man seems to effect a spiritual magnetism on those who attend .
From above , the circular design of the city , carefully zoned each year , seems akin to some ancient pagan site .
With its fire worship , close connection to nature , and emphasis on participation , Burning Man offers a transcendent experience to all comers .
Each year , a Temple of Forgiveness invites people to inscribe the names of loved ones who have passed away on its walls and ceilings , before the whole structure goes up in flames , in a grand gesture of emancipation .
A central tent hosts Wiccan dances , group zazen , chanting and tribal drum circles , invoking a spiritual dimension without dogma or belief .
For myself , as I rode my bicycle far out on to the prehistoric lakebed at midnight , looking backwards on the glittering utopia that is Black Rock City , Burning Man seemed like the freest place on earth .
Behind me , people from all over the world were gathered in what felt like some kind of non denominational worship .

| Julie Fischer McCain calls lobbyists ' birds of prey '
LAS CRUCES , N.M. — Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) called lobbyists “ birds of prey ” Wednesday and vowed to enforce a lifetime ban on lobbying for members of his administration .
“ Whenever there ’s a corrupt system , then you ’re going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils , ” McCain said in a half - hour interview with Politico following a town - hall meeting in the southern part of this swing state .

McCain , clearly weary of vice - presidential speculation , began by saying preemptively that he was not going to say anything about the hot topic .
His mood initially seemed sour , and his answers were clipped , although he warmed as the conversation went on .
“ Let me just begin by saying that to save you some time , I ’m not going to comment on the vice president , ” he said .
“ You can ask away , but … I ’m sure you understand . ”
The topic of lobbyists is sensitive for McCain because several of his top aides had lucrative lobbying practices .
His tough new language is designed to build his case that he would be an agent of change in a race against an opponent who has built his entire campaign on the premise that he will reform the political status quo in Washington .
“ I point out what my record is , which is one that has not won me Miss Congeniality over the years , ” he said .
“ People want change in America — we all know that — and very legitimately so . ”
The senator went so far as to say : “ Lobbyists do n’t come to my office .
Because they know they ’re not going to be an earmark .
They know they ’re not going to get a pork - barrel project .
Senator Obama ’s gotten lots of ’em . : ”
McCain ’s plan for the strict admonition on future lobbying by White House aides is part of a policy he imposed on his campaign staff this spring after questions were raised about their past clients .
“ I would not allow anyone who worked for my administration to go back to lobbying , ” McCain said .
“ They would have to make that pledge . ”
On other matters , McCain was eager to talk about the response of his opponent , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , to Russia ’s seizure of strategic points in Georgia , which top Republicans said will be a key issue this fall .
“ I have , and continue to question his judgment , whether it be his initial reaction to the Russian invasion of Georgia , or whether it be his failure to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded , or his opposition to nuclear power , among others , ” McCain said .
“ So I question the judgment .
I do n’t question the patriotism . ”
Asked if he could deal with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , whom he has consistently excoriated on the stump , McCain flashed a smile and said : “ I ’ve faced bad guys in my time . ”
“ I ’d be glad to meet with him , ” McCain added .
“ It would be important to have some kind of framework for the meeting .
In other words , there would have to be some kind of predetermined , at least outcome about some aspects of the meeting … for example , some progress in some area that was agreed upon earlier – the Nixon in China , Reagan - Gorbachev , et cetera .
It would have to be something besides just a , quote , meeting . ”
McCain took the opportunity for a mulligan on his careless answer to Pastor Rick Warren at the Saddleback Church forum Saturday , where he said that he would define “ rich ” as $ 5 million – a comment that he immediately , and correctly – predicted would be distorted .
He still did not give a number .
“ I define rich in other ways besides income , ” he said .
“ Some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them .
Others are poor if they ’re billionaires . ”
Although McCain ’s campaign has become increasingly sharp in its attack on Obama , spending was one of the few times the senator even mentioned his opponent .
“ Senator Obama has asked for nearly a billion dollars in earmarked pork - barrel projects .
And he rails against lobbyists ?
I ’ve never taken a single one , ” McCain said .
In response to a question about the influence industry , McCain noted : “ I think there are too many lobbyists in Washington . ”
“ But the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease , ” he continued .
“ As long as you have earmarking and pork - barrel spending and bridges to nowhere and money for DNA of bears in Montana and museums and all that , then you ’re going to have lobbyists .
“ So it ’s kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem , which is the earmark .
They ’d all be out of business – most of ’em would be out of business if we stopped pork - barrel and earmark spending . ”
On other topics , McCain :
-- Punted on several opportunities to whack Obama , including when he was asked whether Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) is better prepared to be president ( “ I do n’t know ” ) , and whether the country would be more vulnerable to a terrorist attack under a President Obama than under a President McCain .
“ I ’m sure that if Senator Obama were president of the United States , if the American people chose him to be their president , that he would act as a president who would get my full and complete support , ” McCain said .
-- Said he was n’t comfortable having his campaign aided by a best - selling attack book , “ The Obama Nation , ” that revives questions about Obama ’s connections to Islam and makes other unsubstantiated personal accusations about the Democrat .
“ Of course not , ” McCain said “ As you know , I have condemned the [ commercials invoking Obama pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright ] that were done by various people . ”
McCain would not , however , denounce the book , written by Jerome Corsi , the same author who penned the book attacking Sen. John F. Kerry ’s Vietnam service .
“ I have n’t read the book , so I do n’t know – I ca n’t comment , ” McCain said .

Eight hundred years of financial folly
Carmen Reinhart
This column , first posted 19 April 2008 , argues that sovereign debt crises have historically followed financial crises .
Although data covering only the last thirty years might have given few hints about Greece 's current problems , the Reinhart - Rogoff database spanning eight centuries reveals that today 's event are very much in line with historical experience .
History is indeed little more than the register of the crimes , follies , and misfortunes of mankind .
– Edward Gibbon1
The economics profession has an unfortunate tendency to view recent experience in the narrow window provided by standard datasets .
With a few notable exceptions , cross-country empirical studies of financial crises typically begin in 1980 and are limited in other important respects .
2
Yet an event that is rare in a three - decade span may not be all that rare when placed in a broader context .
In a recent paper co-authored with Kenneth Rogoff , we introduce a comprehensive new historical database for studying debt and banking crises , inflation , currency crashes and debasements .
3
The database covers sixty - six countries across all regions .
The range of variables encompasses external and domestic debt , trade , GNP , inflation , exchange rates , interest rates , and commodity prices .
The coverage spans eight centuries , going back to the date of independence or well into the colonial period for some countries .
In what follows , I sketch some of the highlights of the dataset , with special reference to the current conjuncture .
We note that policymakers should not be overly cheered by the absence of major external defaults from 2003 to 2007 , after the wave of defaults in the preceding two decades .
Serial default remains the norm ; major default episodes are typically spaced some years ( or decades ) apart , creating an illusion that “ this time is different ” among policymakers and investors .
We also find that high inflation , currency crashes , and debasements often go hand - in - hand with default .
Last , but not least , we find that historically , significant waves of increased capital mobility are often followed by a string of domestic banking crises .
The big picture
What are some basic insights one gains from this panoramic view of the history of financial crises ?
We begin by discussing sovereign default on external debt .
Default cycles
For the world as a whole ( or at least the more than 90 percent of global GDP represented by our dataset ) , the current period can be seen as a typical lull that follows large global financial crises .
Figure 1 plots for the years 1800 to 2006 the percentage of all independent countries in a state of default or restructuring during any given year .
Aside from the current lull , one element that jumps out from the figure is the long periods where a high percentage of all countries are in a state of default or restructuring .
Indeed , there are five pronounced peaks or default cycles in the figure .
The first is during the Napoleonic War while the most recent cycle encompasses the emerging market debt crises of the 1980s and 1990s .
Figure 1 .
Source : Reinhart and Rogoff ( 2008a ) .
Serial default on external debt — that is , repeated sovereign default — is the norm throughout nearly every region in the world , including Asia and Europe .
Our dataset also confirms the prevailing view among economists that global economic factors , including commodity prices and centre country interest rates , play a major role in precipitating sovereign debt crises .
During the past few years , emerging markets have benefited from low international interest rates , buoyant world commodity prices and solid growth in the United States and elsewhere .
4
If things ca n’t get better , the odds are that they will get worse .
US interest rates are likely to remain low , which helps debtor countries enormously .
Weaker growth in the US and other advanced economies soften growth prospects for export - dependent emerging Asia and elsewhere ; inflation is on the rise .
Is this cycle different ?
Financial liberalization , capital inflows and financial crises
Another regularity found in the literature on modern financial crises is that countries experiencing large capital inflows are at high risk of having a debt crisis .
Default is likely to be accompanied by a currency crash and a spurt of inflation .
The evidence here suggests the same to be true over a much broader sweep of history , with surges in capital inflows often preceding external debt crises at the country , regional , and global level since 1800 , if not before .
Also consonant with the modern theory of crises is the striking correlation between freer capital mobility and the incidence of banking crises , as shown in Figure 2 .
Periods of high international capital mobility have repeatedly produced international banking crises , not only famously as they did in the 1990s , but historically .
The figure plots a three - year moving average of the share of all countries experiencing banking crises on the right scale .
On the left scale , we employ our favored index of capital mobility , due to Obstfeld and Taylor ( 2004 ) , 5 updated and backcast using their same design principle , to cover our full sample period ; while the index may have its limitations , it nevertheless provides a summary of de facto capital mobility based on actual flows .
Figure 2 .
Sources : Reinhart and Rogoff ( 2008a ) , Obstfeld and Taylor ( 2004 ) .
Domestic debt and the “ this time it ’s different ” syndrome
As noted , our database includes long time series on domestic public debt .
6
Because historical data on domestic debt is so difficult to come by , it has been ignored in many empirical studies on debt and inflation .
Indeed , many generally knowledgeable observers have argued that the recent shift by many emerging market governments from external to domestic bond issues is revolutionary and unprecedented .
7
Nothing could be further from the truth , which has implications for today ’s markets and for historical analyses of debt and inflation .
The topic of domestic debt is so important , and the implications for existing empirical studies on inflation and external default are so profound , that we have broken out our data analysis into an independent companion piece .
8
Here , we focus on a few major points .
The first is that contrary to much contemporary opinion , domestic debt constituted an important part of government debt in most countries , including emerging markets , over most of their existence .
Figure 3 plots domestic debt as a share of total public debt over 1900 to 2006 .
For our entire sample , domestically issued debt averages more than 50 percent of total debt for most of the period .
Even for Latin America , the domestic debt share is typically over 30 percent and has been at times over 50 percent .
Furthermore , contrary to the received wisdom , these data reveal that a very important share of domestic debt – even in emerging markets – was long - term maturity .
Figure 3 .
The inflation - default cycles
Figure 4 on inflation and external default ( 1900 to 2006 ) illustrates the striking correlation between the share of countries in default on debt at one point and the number of countries experiencing high inflation ( which we define to be inflation over 20 percent per annum ) .
Thus , there is a tight correlation between the expropriation of residents and foreigners .
As noted , investment banks and official bodies , such as the International Monetary Fund , alike have argued that even though total public debt remains quite high today in many emerging markets , the risk of default on external debt has dropped dramatically because the share of external debt has fallen .
Figure 4 .
This conclusion seems to be built on the faulty premise that countries will treat domestic debt as junior , bullying domestics into accepting lower repayments or simply defaulting via inflation .
The historical record , however , suggests that a high ratio of domestic to external debt in overall public debt is cold comfort to external debt holders .
Default probabilities depend much more on the overall level of debt .
Policy issues
This brings us to our central theme – the “ this time is different ” syndrome .
There is a view today that both countries and creditors have learned from their mistakes .
Thanks to better - informed macroeconomic policies and more discriminating lending practices , it is argued , the world is not likely to again see a major wave of defaults .
Indeed , an often - cited reason these days why “ this time it ’s different ” for the emerging markets is that governments are managing public finances better , albeit often thanks to a benign global economic environment and extremely favourable terms of trade shocks .
Such celebration may be premature .
Capital flow / default cycles have been around since at least 1800 .
Technology has changed , the height of humans has changed , and fashions have changed .
Yet the ability of governments and investors to delude themselves , giving rise to periodic bouts of euphoria that usually end in tears , seems to have remained a constant .
On a more positive note , our research at least raises the question of how a country might “ graduate ” from a history of serial default .
Interesting cases include Greece and Spain , countries that appear to have escaped a severe history of serial default not only by reforming institutions , but by benefiting from the anchor of the European Union .
Austria , too , managed to emerge from an extraordinarily checkered bankruptcy history by closer integration with post - war Germany , a process that began even before European integration began to accelerate in the 1980s and 1990s .
We shall wait and see which emerging markets can graduate from serial default .

External debt , on the other hand , was typically in foreign currency , and held by foreign residents .

Biogeoscientists show evidence of 90 billion tons of microbial organisms -- expressed in terms of carbon mass -- living in the deep biosphere , in a research article published online by Nature , July 20 , 2008 .
This tonnage corresponds to about one - tenth of the amount of carbon stored globally in tropical rainforests .
The authors : Kai -Uwe Hinrichs and Julius Lipp of the Center for Marine Environmental Sciences ( MARUM ) at University of Bremen , Germany ; and Fumio Inagaki and Yuki Morono of the Kochi Institute for Core Sample Research at the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) concluded that about 87 percent of the deep biosphere consists of Archaea .
This finding is in stark contrast to previous reports , which suggest that Bacteria dominate the subseafloor ecosystem .
To reach this conclusion , the researchers investigated sediment cores collected from several hundred meters beneath the seafloor of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Black Sea .
The cored sediments included samples that were the result of research expeditions conducted by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program ( IODP ) .
According to co-author Prof. Kai -Uwe
Hinrichs , a biogeochemist who led the research team , two main objectives were pursued : " We wanted to find out which microorganisms can be found in the seafloor , and how many of them are living down there . "
For a long time , scientists believed that extreme conditions such as high pressure , lack of oxygen , and low supply of nutrients and energy would make deep , subseafloor environments inhabitable for any life form .
Nonetheless , sea -going investigations have proven the existence of the deep biosphere .
" In general , life below the seafloor is dominated by minute monocellular organisms , " explains co-author Julius Lipp , who has just completed his PhD on the subject .
" According to our analyses , Bacteria dominate the upper 10 centimeters of the seafloor .
Below this level Archaea appear to take over the major fraction of the biomass pool . "
According to Lipp , Archaea make up at least 87 percent of organisms that colonize the deep biosphere .
" These subsurface Archaea can be viewed as starvelings , " he continues .
" Compared to Bacteria , Archaea appear to be better adapted to the extreme , chronic deficiency of energy that characterizes this habitat -- a consequence of the only food being fossil remnants of plants that were pre-digested by generations of other microorganisms . "
Next to Bacteria , Archaea represent a distinct domain in the three - domain system of life .
Both groups can be identified by fat - like molecules , so - called lipids that make up their cell membranes .
To date , estimations of the deep biosphere biomass range from about 60 to 300 billion tons of carbon .
Says Prof .
Hinrichs ,
" Our measurements , determined by entirely independent means , are right in this bracket . "
The authors assume that about 200 million cubic kilometers of mud below the ocean floor are inhabited by microorganisms -- a volume that roughly corresponds to a 600 kilometer - long cube .
Drs. Inagaki and Morono , both geomicrobiologists , studied DNA in this project .
" Given the strong indication of the Archaea world in the marine subsurface , " says Dr. Inagaki , " we intend to study their lifestyle and metabolism , strategy for long - term survival , and ecological roles using subseafloor materials cored by CHIKYU and other drilling platforms . "
CHIKYU is the world 's only riser - equipped research vessel , one of three drilling platforms supported by IODP .
Because all current techniques used to detect biomass in the deep biosphere arrive at different conclusions regarding quantity and composition , Prof .
Hinrichs has initiated an international " ring experiment . "
Currently , he and colleagues in German , European , U.S. , and Japanese laboratories investigate standardized sediment samples from the seafloor using varied methods .
To gain a more reliable picture of life in the deep biosphere they need to find out whether identical methods applied in different labs lead to dissimilar results .
In September , the researchers involved in the ring experiment will present and discuss their findings .
The participants hope " this experiment will shed a bit more light on the dark , deep biosphere , " says Prof .
Hinrichs .
The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program ( IODP ) is an international marine research drilling program supported by 23 countries dedicated to advancing scientific understanding of Earth by sampling and monitoring subseafloor environments .
Through multiple platforms , preeminent scientists explore IODP 's principal research themes : the deep biosphere , environmental change , and solid earth cycles .
The man is being treated for serious injuries A doctor had her car stolen when she stopped to help a pensioner who had been hit by a bus in Salford .
The doctor was driving on Eccles Old Road , in Weaste , when she saw the man , who is in his 70s , had been badly hurt .
She stopped to help , but in her haste left the keys in the ignition and her red Renault Clio car was stolen .
The man was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition .
Anyone who sees the car , registration NY05 RZN , is urged to contact police .
' Opportunistic thief '
The doctor , who declined to be identified , said she was disheartened by the theft on Wednesday afternoon but that it would not put her off helping people in similar circumstances in the future .
" I am very disappointed at what has happened , but I would do the same again , " she said .
The Insp John Kelly said : " Its unthinkable why someone would take someone 's car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt .
" This woman 's compassion has been totally taken advantage of by a pathetic opportunistic thief , and we are determined to catch whoever was responsible . "

Building and infrastructure projects are fuelling economic growth
Increased exports and a boom in the construction industry helped the rapid expansion during 2007 .
But officials warned that overheating remained a danger , despite a slight slow - down in the fourth quarter .
Inflation is also a serious concern , with many Chinese people hit by recent dramatic increases in food prices .
' Still developing '
Announcing the figures , National Statistics Bureau chief Xie Fuzhan said Beijing was paying " close attention " to the US credit crisis .
He said Beijing would respond by making " timely and proper adjustments " in exchange and interest rate policy , but gave no details .
Speculation has been mounting among analysts over whether China has overtaken Germany to become the world 's third - largest economy .
But Mr Xie played down the comparison , saying : " It 's not really important to know whether China is the fourth - largest or the third - largest .
" Even if the total surpasses Germany , China is still a developing country - in particular , the per capita GDP of China is really low . "
Price controls
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville , in Shanghai , says economic growth is not a problem in China , but keeping the ever - expanding economy under control is proving tricky .
It took six interest rate rises by the government last year to slow the expansion .
The last quarter of 2007 saw growth ease to 11.2 % .
But while other governments around the world are cutting interest rates , China will likely have to raise them again if it is to keep its economy growing at a sustainable level , our correspondent says .
Another headache for Beijing last year was inflation .
Despite its growing wealth , China still has a large number of poor people struggling with dramatic increases in the price of daily essentials such as pork , which jumped by 50 % .
Inflation hit an 11 - year year high in November .
Thursday 's figures show that it fell back in December , although at 6.5 % it remains a worry .
The government has introduced a range of price controls recently aimed at bring the cost of ordinary goods , particularly food , under control .
Dramatic price rises have led to social unrest in the past and Beijing cannot afford for its millions of poor to go hungry .

World number two Nadal has won his last 29 matches Rafael Nadal continued his seemingly unstoppable march towards the world number one spot by capturing the Toronto Masters title .
The Spaniard brushed aside Nicolas Kiefer 6 - 3 6 - 2 to clinch his fifth straight tournament and take his winning streak to 29 matches .
Nadal is now only 300 points behind Roger Federer in the world rankings .
The 22 - year - old has a chance of ending the Swiss star 's reign at the Cincinnati Masters this week .
" I think I have to be happy , very happy if I am number one or number two , " said Nadal , the French Open and Wimbledon champion .
" If I am number two it 's because in front of me there is an amazing player like Roger .
606 : DEBATE Rafa can one day win a hard - court slam
rafareal #1 " Every player wants to be number one .
I would love to be .
But I 'm number two now .
I 'm very happy for that . "
Nadal will become number one if he wins the Cincinnati title and Federer loses before the semi-finals .
If not , Federer 's four - and - a - half year stint at the top of the rankings seems likely to end on 18 August when he loses the 850 points he gained for reaching last year 's Toronto final and winning in Cincinnati .
Nadal , by contrast , will only lose 230 points .
The Toronto title was Nadal 's 30th , making him the third youngest player after Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors to reach that landmark " I 'll think about the record when my career is over , " said the 22 - year - old .
" Right now , my most important goal was to win Toronto . "
Unseeded German Kiefer was playing in his first Masters Series final at the age of 31 - but he was no match for an in - form Nadal .
The Spaniard broke serve for the first time to go 3 - 2 up and took the first set when Kiefer double - faulted .
And once Nadal had come through an epic game at 2 - 2 in the second , he proved unstoppable .

What are these ?
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - The United States , Europe and Japan planned joint intervention to rescue the dollar when it was plunging in March at the time U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns collapsed , the Nikkei business newspaper reported .
A U.S. dollar bill is displayed in Toronto in this posed photo , March 26 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mark Blinch
Officials from the U.S. Treasury Department , Japan ’s Finance Ministry and the European Central Bank reportedly drew up a currency contingency plan over the weekend of March 15 - 16 , the Nikkei said , citing sources familiar with the situation .
An international financial source with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters that foreign exchange authorities from the three were in close contact at the time and discussed joint intervention if the dollar ’s fall intensified .
Analysts said even though a rescue never took place , any such agreement on intervention would be important in the future if the dollar were to tumble again or other exchange rates move very sharply .
The officials did not specify levels for initiating the dollar rescue plan , but in the event of a free - fall they agreed to coordinate aggressive buying of the greenback and sell yen and euros , the newspaper said .
“ If downside risks to the dollar emerge from here on , the market will keep in mind the possibility of similar action by authorities , ” said Takahide Nagasaki , chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities SMBC .
The Nikkei report had little immediate impact on currencies , since the dollar has already rebounded 10 percent from a record low it struck against a basket of major currencies in March , analysts said .
“ The report would have had a huge psychological impact if it had come out when the dollar was trading around 100 yen , ” said Tomoko Fujii , head of economics and strategy for Japan at Bank of America .
The United States , Europe and Japan have not intervened jointly in the currency market since September 2000 , when they acted to prop up a sliding euro .
Japan ’s last intervention was in March 2004 .
Even as the dollar slid after the flare - up of the credit market turmoil last August , there had been a perception among market players that U.S. authorities were willing to tolerate falls in the dollar in a policy of “ benign neglect ” , to help support U.S. exports as the economy faltered .
But market players detected a shift in U.S. officials ’ stance towards the dollar in June when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke issued a rare warning on the inflation risk posed by a weak dollar , and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson declined to rule out intervening in currency markets .
Under the intervention framework , Japan was to supply yen through currency swaps .
The plan also called for using a previously established swap mechanism between the United States and Europe .
No coordinated intervention took place , however , as the dollar began recovering shortly after U.S. authorities brokered JP Morgan Chase ’s buyout of Bear Stearns -- the biggest victim so far in the year - old credit crisis .
As measured by the dollar index , the currency plunged to that record low on March 17 , the first market day following the announcement of the Bear Stearns deal , but later recovered .
The dollar tumbled to a 13 - year low of 95.77 yen that day but is now near 109 yen .
A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman , the Federal Reserve and the ECB declined to comment on the report .
Japan ’s top financial diplomat , Naoyuki Shinohara , also said he had no comment .
Japanese Finance Minister Bunmei Ibuki told Reuters the nation ’s monetary authorities will decide how to deal with any sharp foreign exchange moves in the future based on economic fundamentals at the time .
“ If anything , the fact that officials recognized the concern about the dollar ’s decline seems somewhat supportive for the dollar as maybe benign neglect was not so neglectful , ” said Marc Chandler , head of global FX strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York .
“ At the end of the day , however , President Bush is still set to be the first American president since at least the break - up of Bretton Woods that has not authorized intervention in the FX market , and given the recent price action the distinction looks relatively safe . ”
How it affects real life : Literally changes the way you view the world .
Just try grinding through Hawkman 's immensely skate - able world without constantly comparing it to real - world locations .
After a few hours , let alone several days of intense ' boarding , it 's almost impossible to walk down the street and not view every awning , rooftop , fence and power line as a gravity - defying combo string .
Above :
If only
The Hawk games are also known for secret locations opened via complicated maneuvers and linked combos .
Pro Skater 2 , for example , has a drained pool that 's only accessible after grinding a specific rail .
Spend a month scouring virtual cityscapes like this and eventually you 'll find yourself looking at buildings in your own neighborhood as an in - game level , complete with combos like " grind across the grocery store roof and do a handstand on the church steeple to unlock the skating rink . "
After years of playing , it 's hard for us to look at the world without a Tony Hawk veil draped over every block .
" After playing a gerbil ’s lifetime of Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater , I ca n’t walk around any city without eyeing roof ledges wondering which would grind me into the best line .
Everyday objects all blurred together as one unbreakable chain of ollies , kickflips and reverts , the point where it actually became distracting .
On the plus side , at least this was my addiction and not Burnout ... "
How it affects real life :
You 'll never look at interior design the same again .
Tony
Hawk tricks you into mentally converting the mundane into the fantastic .
Conversely ,
The Sims forces you to apply cold gaming logic to your jam - packed , far - too - busy life .
This can manifest itself in a couple ways , the most obvious of which is the hallucinated grid you place on your own home .
God help you if you move into new digs and have to arrange furniture - you 'll be positioning and repositioning couches , desks , beds , mirrors , anything that is n't nailed down until sun comes up .
It has to perfectly comply with arbitrary feng shui that dictated your Sim 's virtual home .
A paradoxical benefit from overplaying The Sims boosts your time - management skills .
Should you spend the next hour of your evening watching TV or studying ?
The average person would probably choose the first option , but some GR staffers admit to tackling the problem from a Sim 's point of view and reading a book , raising some mental " stats " instead of vegging out .
It 's a bit ironic though - if people spent less time playing The Sims , they'd have more time to get all their shit done and would n't have to reduce their life decisions to binary " this or that " equations .
" After playing The Sims for so many years , those green status bars have become real .
When I feel a little down , I 'll wonder which of my ' needs ' requires a boost .
I 've randomly phoned a friend to increase my Social .
I 've cleaned my apartment only because I worried my Environment bar was approaching red .
Sounds crazy , but it worked . "
How it affects real life :
The daily goings - on of your animal town will trump real - world plans .
From a strict gameplay perspective , Animal Crossing and The Sims are quite similar .
Both transmit the same time - consuming addicto - beams directly into your brain , but only Animal Crossing forces you to play on its own terms .
Each version runs off a real - world clock , so 12:34 am to you is 12:34 am to Animal Crossing , and certain events , awards and visitors can only be met at specific times .
An annual , literally once a year event like Christmas will come and go if you do n't hop in and sift through town searching for the entire Holiday Furniture collection .
Stuff like this happens all year round , usually resulting in broken plans with angry friends just so you can meet KK Slider at the railroad tracks Saturday at 10 pm - but hey , as long as your animal friends are n't pissed , it 's all good .
Oh sure , you can mess with the clock , constantly setting it back or advancing to June 2054 , but cheaters never win , and winners do n't use drugs .
If you 're one of " those people " that effs with the clock , consider yourself banned from the village .
You have to cancel plans and alter habits just like everybody else .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) --
The Web site for a Utah company that had offered a sock monkey named for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama now says the toy wo n't be manufactured .
Some had called the toy racist .
On Saturday , Sock Obama LLC issued a statement saying it did n't mean to anger anyone .
On Sunday , a statement on the company Web site said , " We are very apologetic to all who were upset by our toy idea .
We will not be proceeding with the manufacturing of this toy . "
The company that was going to manufacture the doll also issued an apology on its Web site .
Rob Bishop , owner of Binkley Toys Inc. , says he did n't realize the toy would be offensive until angry e-mails began pouring in .
" I personally apologize to anyone who found this toy idea offensive , and I am sorry I did not make the negative connection myself , " Bishop 's statement said .
Jeanetta Williams , president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , had called the toy " pure racism at its extreme . "

Magnetic Air Car Could Be Ready by 2010
September 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
[ social_buttons ]
Last week , I took a trip down to San Jose for West Coast Green , an environmentally - focused conference with an emphasis on sustainable building .
One booth stood out from the crowd — Magnetic Air Cars , Inc. .
The San Jose - based company claims that it is working on the world ’s first fuel - less car ( as opposed to the World ’s Most Fuel Efficient Car ) .
The Magnetic Air Car uses three on - board substations to harness compressed air .
The resulting airflow is channeled , modulated , and converted to torque that propels the car .
According to company representative Paul Donovan , the car uses a silicon salt battery that has 30 % more mass power than a lead acid storage battery and can charge completely within an hour .
The 95 percent recyclable battery can also can be used in a temperature range from - 40 degrees Celsius to 50 degrees Celsius .
Though the Magnetic Air Car has not yet been tested , Donovan hopes to have it ready for production by 2010 .
The company plans on building its first prototype at Club Auto Sport in San Jose in the near future .
The vehicle draws comparisons to Tata Motors ’ 106 mpg air car , but Donovan says that the Tata Motors design uses pistons while the Magnetic Air Car design uses magnetic technology .
Unfortunately , there are n’t any more details available on the Magnetic Air Car at this time .
But if the prototype is successful , I ’m sure we ’ll hear plenty more about this company .

Researchers at the University of Minnesota have published a study showing that the degree of internalized homonegativity ( negative attitude towards homosexuality ) among homosexual men is what predicts poor mental and sexual health – not the act of being homosexual .
As part of attending an HIV prevention seminar , 422 Midwestern gay and bisexual men completed surveys assessing their degree of homosexuality , their degree of positive or negative attitudes towards homosexuality , and a range of mental and sexual health variables .
In all cases , internalized homonegativity , not being homosexual , predicted poorer mental health ( particularly increased depression ) and worse sexual health .
The study appears in the September issue of the Journal of Homosexuality .
The study helps inform the debate of whether or not being homosexual is healthy , said Simon Rosser , Ph.D. , a researcher in the School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study .
" This study is a missing link in our understanding of the relationship between sexuality and health , " he said .
" It provides new evidence that negative attitudes towards homosexuality , not homosexuality itself , are associated with both poorer mental and sexual health outcomes seen in sexual minorities .
Conversely , positive attitudes towards homosexuality are associated with better mental and sexual health . "
For more than 150 years , scholars and educators have debated whether homosexuality is an objective disorder or whether societal prejudice , not homosexuality , leads to the elevated rates of depression , drug use , and HIV / STD epidemics seen in studies of gay men , Rosser said .
This study tested both theories .
" Given the debates in many religious denominations about homosexuality , and in society about homosexuals and civil rights , it 's also timely , " Rosser said .
" In particular , the old advice to gay men to fight , deny , or minimize their homosexuality likely only increases depression , greater isolation , and poorer sexual health .
In short , viewing homosexuality as a disorder is not only inaccurate , it may be harmful as well . "

Nasa scientists said today they had discovered the first direct evidence that the surface of Saturn 's largest moon , Titan , has lakes of liquid hydrocarbons - the only object other than Earth to have standing liquids on its surface .
But do n't expect Titan to become a holiday resort any time soon : it is 1.2bn kilometres away , has temperatures falling to - 139C and features the occasional downpour of methane rain .
Titan is the second largest moon in the solar system after Jupiter 's Ganymede .
It has a thick atmosphere and is larger than the planet Mercury .
Nasa 's research used data from the Cassini - Huygens probe - a joint venture by Nasa , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency - which arrived there in 2004 .
More than 40 flybys of Titan by the probe established that the moon did not have large global oceans of methane , ethane and other light hydrocarbons as scientists had previously suspected .
Instead , Cassini sent back images of hundreds of dark lake - like features , but it was not clear whether these were liquid or dark solid material .
The researchers looked closely at a 20,000 square - mile dark region called Ontario Lacus near Titan 's south pole that was observed by Cassini in December last year .
The team trained an instrument on the lake that can chemically identify material based on the way it absorbs and reflects infrared light .
They confirmed that Ontario Lacus was liquid ethane .
The results were published in today 's edition of Nature .
" This is the first observation that really pins down that Titan has a surface lake filled with liquid , " said Dr Bob Brown of the University of Arizona , Tucson , who was involved in the research .
Due to Titan 's distance from the sun and an anti-greenhouse effect caused by Titan 's orange - hazy atmosphere , no liquid water can exist on its frigid surface .
The moon 's atmosphere is 95 % nitrogen , with the rest methane , but ethane and other hydrocarbons can form from the breakdown of methane by sunlight .
" Detection of liquid ethane confirms a long - held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on Titan , " said Dr Larry Soderblom from the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff , Arizona .
" The fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated , and at a slanted viewing path through Titan 's atmosphere , raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument . "
Cassini has also observed a dark beach fringing the foot - shaped lake .
A shelf and more of the beach are being exposed as Ontario Lacus evaporates .
Phony anarchist group calls Alex Jones “ agent provocateur ” and a racist during confrontation
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , August 26 , 2008
During Alex Jones ’ confrontation with Neo -Con poster child Michelle Malkin at DNC yesterday , the phony right - wing ideologue enjoyed the support of seemingly strange bedfellows , the self - proclaimed liberal anarchist group Re-Create 68 , who subsequently attempted to smear Jones in front of the media by implying he was a racist .
Jones called out Malkin for her pro-torture stance and her refusal to retract a story concerning Marines in Iraq killing puppies , which Malkin maintained was a faked video .
Malkin found an ally in Recreate 68 ’s ( Kenneth ) Sanchez , reports Fort Collins Now , “ Who pushed his way into the crowd of TV cameras to yell at Jones : “ Michelle Malkin is a true patriot ! ”
Recreate 68 co-founder Glenn Spagnuolo then said of Jones , “ He ’s the true agent provocateur , he was so busy hating , he missed all the love . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
What this aimless , arrogant and ineffective gaggle defined as “ the love ” was about as indefinable as the rest of the Communist trash they were spewing about redistribution of wealth .
But the group ’s support for Michelle Malkin , a neo - fascist poster child for the fake right - wing and an advocate of torture and internment camps for dissenters and other undesirables , speaks volumes about the meaningless and transitory nature of their immature and vacuous political outlook .
Accepting of the fact that their whiny effeminate voices , stupid cowardly pseudonyms ( one calling himself the Yippie Pie Man ) , and ridiculous wizard costumes could not compete with the booming ferocity of Jones , members of the group chose to question the talk show host through a bullhorn , calling him a “ white populist ” for daring to criticize extremist Mexican separatist groups and their “ Plan of an Diego , ” a revolutionary call to arms to re-invade the southwestern United States and kill all blacks and whites .
Jones has previously led demonstrations against MECHA and La Raza ( as well as their contemporaries the Ku Klux Klan ) , backed up in force by dozens of Hispanics .
Apparently , pointing out that genocide and ethnic cleansing is a bad thing is only OK if white people are behind it , God forbid you denounce any other color for wanton mass slaughter or you ’re a racist , according to Re-Create 68 .
In reality , Jones ’ mini-documentary , Battle For The Republic , urges Mexicans to overthrow their corrupt system and reject the NGO - funded propaganda about “ The Race ” and “ La Reconquista ” .
In contrast , MECHA and La Raza like to carry billboards with drawings of decapitated white people and declare , “ Por La Raza todo .
Fuera de La Raza nada . ”
“ Everything for the race .
Everything outside the race , nothing . ”
Who are the real racists here ?
People who call themselves “ the race ” and advocate ethnic cleansing of blacks and whites , or those who criticize them ?
Re-Create 68 ’s attempt to smear Jones by playing the race card has only resulted in the exposure of themselves as ninnying Socialist twits , with no grasp whatsoever about the painful truth behind such issues , which run deeper than mindless empty platitudes and name - calling .
Watch Alex Jones ’ description of events and the confrontation itself in the You Tube clips below .

Excessive or impacted earwax affects 1 in 10 children and 1 in 20 adults .
You should n't stick any object smaller than your elbow into your ear , including cotton swabs , doctors say .
The gooey , golden stuff that builds up inside your ears should stay there , according to national guidelines on earwax removal released today .
" [ Earwax ] is not intrinsically evil stuff , and consequently does not have to be removed merely because it 's present , " said Peter Roland , an ear , nose and throat doctor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas .
" In fact , it serves a function and so if you do n't need to take it out , you should just leave it alone . "
Roland chaired a panel of doctors in charge of the new guidelines for earwax removal issued by the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation ( AAO - HNSF ) .
The guidelines are intended to serve two purposes : to determine under what circumstances earwax needs to be removed , and to give doctors the scoop on which removal methods work best .
They hope the guidelines wo n't fall on deaf ears : About 12 million people a year in the United States seek medical care for impacted or excessive earwax .
Impaction , they say , can cause pain , pressure , itching , foul odor , ringing of the ears , ear discharge and , in extreme cases , hearing loss .
Good - for - you goo
So there 's a reason for the goo .
Earwax is a self - cleaning agent , with protective , lubricating and antibacterial properties , doctors say .
That 's why tiny glands in the outer ear canal constantly pump out a watery substance , which gets mixed with bits of dead hair and skin and together is called earwax or cerumen .
Excess earwax normally treks slowly out of the ear canal , with an extra boost from chewing and other jaw movements , carrying with it dirt , dust and other small particles from the ear canal .
Then , dried - up clumps of the stuff fall out of the ear opening .
When this natural earwax train malfunctions , or when individuals poke around in their ears with cottons swabs or other foreign objects such as bobby pins or matchsticks , earwax can build up and block part of the ear canal .
" Then there are lots of people wearing earplugs for one reason or another , either because they 've got hearing aids or they 're transcriptionists at work or because they 're addicted to their walkman , " Roland told LiveScience , " and that can increase the likelihood that the wax does n’t come out on its own . "
Older adults are more prone to earwax buildup then younger individuals .
" The wax gets much thicker and drier , and plus you actually end up with more hair in your ear , when you 're older , and so it traps it , " Roland said .
He added , " Unfortunately , many people feel the need to manually ' remove ' cerumen from the ears .
This can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal . "
He said the saying , " Do n't put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear , " holds true .
Leave your ears alone
For the everyday individual , the new guidelines suggest you leave your ears alone unless you experience symptoms that you think are associated with too much earwax .
" If they 're going to do something at home , they should probably use drops of some sort , " Roland said .
The panel found no evidence that one type of over - the - counter drops works better than another , or better than just plain sterile water or sterile saline , he said .
The drops help to loosen the earwax and then the ear often can do the rest , he added .
The guidelines also state that cotton - tipped swabs or other objects should not be used to remove earwax .
Oral jet irrigators and the alternative medicine technique called ear candling are also strongly advised against .
Ear candling involves making a hollow tube from fabric and soaking that in warm beeswax , which is cooled and hardens .
Once cooled and hardened , the beeswax cone is stuck into the ear .
The outer end of the tube is lit and burns for about 15 minutes , a process that supposedly draws the wax out of the ear .
Studies have shown , however , that the drawn - out stuff is material from the candle itself .
Doctors have also reported seeing patients who have burned the outer parts of their ears with this method .
If the drops do n't relieve your symptoms , or if you dislike drops but still have symptoms , it 's time to see a doctor , Roland said .
The panel found that three common techniques for earwax removal at the doctor 's office work best , with no single method outshining the others .
These include flushing the ear out with a water solution ; manually removing the earwax under a microscope using medical instruments ; and sending the patient home with ear drops .
While at the doctor 's office , Roland urges patients not to be embarrassed by a little earwax .
" I get a lot of people in here who are horrified when I see a little wax in their ear , and then they start apologizing for being dirty and they 're just very upset it 's present at all , " Roland said .
" And I think the big message there is that it has a physiological function , and unless there 's a reason to remove it , you should just leave it alone .
It 's OK . "

A little known fungus tucked away in the gut of Asian longhorned beetles helps the insect munch through the hardest of woods according to a team of entomologists and biochemists .
Researchers say the discovery could lead to innovative methods of controlling the invasive pest , and potentially offer more efficient ways of breaking down plant biomass for generating biofuels .
Microbes in the gut of insects are known to break down cellulose , but little is known about how , or whether , insects degrade lignin .
This natural polymer helps plants stay upright and protects them from most forms of microbial attack .
" Lignin is nature 's plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier , " said Ming Tien , study co-author and Penn State professor of biochemistry and molecular biology .
" We suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin . "
Before this report , it was thought that insects are unable to extensively break down lignin , and that they get around the problem either by feasting on wood that has already degraded , or by living close to fungi that can degrade the wood for them .
But this theory fails to explain the ability of insects to feed and grow within healthy living trees .
" How these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall [ lignin ] and get at the goodies , the sugars , behind it has remained a mystery , " said Tien , who was recruited by Kelli Hoover , co-author and Penn State associate professor of entomology , and Scott Geib , lead author and Penn State doctoral student in entomology , to tease out an explanation .

The Asian longhorned beetle is one such insect that attacks healthy trees and bores through the hard wood to get at the succulent energy - rich matter inside .
In the process , this invasive pest from China grows nearly 300 - fold from being about the size of a grain of rice to a few inches in length .
Hoover and her colleagues speculated that the beetle could be harboring a community of microbes in the gut , which helps in breaking down lignin .
The researchers compared the chemical structure of non-degraded wood before and after it had passed through the gut of two wood - eating insects .
To measure the degree of change in the lignin , they first fed pin oak wood to Asian longhorned beetles .
Next they fed ponderosa pine wood to the Pacific dampwood termite , an insect that typically eats only dead wood .
Chemical analyses of feces from the two bugs indicated that they are able to alter the chemical structure of lignin by selectively adding or removing certain groups of molecules from the polymer .
Such alterations , said Geib , make it easier for the insect to break down wood .

" This fungus has genes that then make enzymes , " explained Hoover , whose team 's findings appear today ( Aug. 18 ) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We have been able to detect messages from the [ fungal ] DNA , which get translated into enzymes . "
While the researchers have identified the fungus residing in the gut of the Asian longhorned beetle , they have yet to find one in the gut of the termite .
" The types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white - rot fungus , " said Geib .
" Changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown - rot fungus .
The chemical changes to the lignin are similar . "
However , Geib cautions that while the gut - borne fungus is certainly a key player in degrading wood , it may just be part of a bigger picture .
" It is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus , hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut , and the insect itself , " explained Geib .
" It is a consortium that is doing the job . "
If researchers manage to identify some of these key microbes , he says it might be possible to selectively target just those bacteria to impair the growth of Asian longhorned beetles , which have the potential to severely damage the lumber and maple syrup industry .
Both Geib and Hoover , who study Asian longhorned beetles , believe they may have stumbled upon a novel evolutionary adaptation in the insect world .
" This type of fungus [ in the Asian longhorned beetle ] is known to cause disease in plants , " said Hoover , whose work is funded by the Alphawood Foundation and the Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences .
" But this particular strain appears to be unique .
It looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood . "
She also points out that these fungi are more efficient than their free - ranging counterparts .
While those fungi take months , even years , to break down wood , the gut - borne fungi seem to do it much faster .
Researchers say the speedy process could potentially be harnessed to produce biofuel .
" Getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass , " said Geib .
The team 's discovery , he added , could lead to the potential development of cheaper and more efficient enzymes for converting wood into ethanol .
Other researchers on the paper include Timothy R. Filley , associate professor , department of earth and atmospheric sciences , Purdue University ; Patrick G. Hatcher , the Batten endowed chair in physical sciences and professor of chemistry and biochemistry , and Rachel L. Sleighter , doctoral candidate , both at Old Dominion University ; John E. Carlson , professor of molecular genetics , director of Schatz Center for Tree Molecular Genetics , School of Forestry ; and Maria del Mar Jimenez - Gasco , assistant professor of plant pathology , both at Penn State .
Roy Miller , a housing counselor at nearby Belair - Edison Neighborhood Inc. , said most of the distressed homeowners he saw were unwilling to rent part of their houses to strangers , especially if there were children at home .
Most home - sharing agencies have fewer than 100 matches at any time .
But Miss
Terry did not know where else to turn .
She was behind on mortgage payments , but the idea of placing an advertisement in the newspaper or online scared her — anyone might show up at her door .
( In the current movie “ Kit Kittredge : An American Girl , ” in which a Depression family takes in boarders to save its home , a motley assortment of strangers unsettle family life . )
Miss Terry turned to St. Ambrose , she said , on the advice of her supervisor , who said the agency would screen potential housemates to find a match .
Like other home - sharing agencies , St. Ambrose conducts background checks on both parties , screening out people with criminal records or histories of drug or alcohol abuse , or those who cannot afford to be stable homeowners or renters .
A 10 - point questionnaire sorts candidates ’ feelings about pets , smoking , overnight guests and other points of compatibility .
“ So far we ’ve had no bodily damage , ” said Annette Brennan , the program ’s director ( St. Ambrose provides a full range of housing services ) .
“ I say that quietly so as not to jinx it . ”
In some communities , local zoning laws or homeowner associations may limit the number of nonrelated people who can live in a house .
Ms. Brennan said that home - sharing could help some people caught in the housing downturn , but that its benefits were limited .
“ Where we see it being of value is if someone is having short - term problems , ” she said .
“ The average stay of a sharer is about a year , and some are much less .
It ’s good for someone leaving a marriage or a relationship , or going to school .
You ca n’t count on it as a regular income .
It ’s a stopgap . ”
After counselors from St. Ambrose interviewed Miss Terry and Ms. Ongiri , Miss Terry drove to the house where Ms. Ongiri was living alongside three men .
Right away , Miss Terry said , “ I ’m like , she do n’t need to be living here with three males .
I felt as if I could help her , get her out of that area and that living arrangement .
I hoped she felt the same way . ”
If you think you ’ve seen what ’s possible with Photosynth , then you ’ve seen nothing yet .
The collaborative research team from the University of Washington and Microsoft Research who only two years ago in 2006 published their paper “ Photo Tourism ” and their technology demonstration “ Photosynth ” have again pushed the boundaries of what can be achieved by intuitively processing the abundance of digital images shared on the web .
This week at SIGGRAPH 2008 they ’re sharing with the world some even better technology they ’ve been working on which they call “ Finding Paths through the World ’s Photos “ .
Do n’t let the name fool you , it ’s damn cool .
If you ’re not much of a reading person like me , take a look at this video demonstration .
( Watch it till the end )
This technology is much better than Photosynth simply because instead of just presenting individual photographs in a cool 3D environment , it actually manipulates the photo to give you a seamless and more lifelike experience .
It ’s one thing to click around different photos taken at a particular museum , it ’s a whole other story to “ walk through ” the museum .
Now if you want to know exactly how they did it , and you ’re a rocket scientist , take a look at their conference paper .
For the rest of us , just take it for granted .

The Soviet dissident writer and Nobel literature prize winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn has died aged 89 , according to the Interfax news agency .
The agency said he died of a stroke , although his son Stepan Solzhenitsyn said his father died of heart failure .
The author had suffered from ill heath , including high blood pressure , in recent years .
Solzhenitsyn served with the Red Army in the Second World War but became one of the most prominent dissidents of the Soviet era , enduring labour camps , cancer and persecution under the Soviet regime .
His experience of the network of labour camps was vividly described in his work One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich .
His key works , including " The First Circle " and " Cancer Ward " brought him world admiration and the 1970 Nobel Literature prize .
He was stripped of his citizenship and sent into exile in 1974 after the publication of " The Gulag Archipelago " , his monumental history of the Soviet police state .
Solzhenitsyn then moved to the United States , returning to post -Soviet Russia as a hero in 1994 .
He was born on December 11 1918 , studied physics and mathematics at Rostov University and became a Soviet army officer after Hitler 's invasion in 1941 .
Introduced less than a month ago , Resolution 362 , also known as the Iran War Resolution , could be passed by the House as early as next week .
The bill is the chief legislative priority of AIPAC .
On its Web site , AIPAC endorses the resolutions as a way to ” Stop Iran ’s Nuclear Program ” and tells readers to lobby Congress to pass the bill .
In the Senate , a sister resolution , Resolution 580 , has gained co-sponsors with similar speed .
The Senate measure was introduced by Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh on June 2 .
It has since gained 19 co-sponsors .
The bill ’s key section “ demands that the president initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political , and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by , inter alia , prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
“ Imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ” can be read to mean that the president should initiate a naval blockade of Iran .
A unilateral naval blockade without UN sanction is an act of war .
Resolution 362 has already gained 170 co-sponsors , or nearly 40 percent of the House .
It has been referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee , which has 49 members , 24 of whom , including the ranking Republican , are co-sponsors .
The Iran Nuclear Watch Web site writes , “ According to the House leadership , this resolution is going to ‘ pass like a hot knife through butter ’ before the end of June on what is called suspension â€ “ meaning no amendments can be introduced during the 20 - minute maximum debate .
It also means it is assumed the bill will pass by a 2/3 majority and is non-controversial . ”
Our national legislators deem it non-controversial to recommend to a president known for his recklessness and bad judgment that he consider engaging in an act of war against Iran .
Those of you who consider this issue controversial can go to the Just Foreign Policy Web site and tell your representative to oppose this resolution .

New York state Governor David Paterson has directed state agencies to respect marriages of same - sex couples performed in other jurisdictions , including California , Massachusetts , and Canada .
" For the first time ,
couples in New York who have never known true security for their
families will be officially entitled to treatment by our state
government that respects their rights .
They should now finally get a
taste of the family protections other married couples and their
children enjoy , " Donna Lieberman , executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , said in a statement .
The directive affects as many as 1,300 statutes and regulations governing relationship recognition , reports the New York TImes .
The directive comes as a response to an appeals court ruling in a marriage recognition lawsuit , in which an employee of a state community college in Rochester sought health care benefits for her spouse , whom she had married in Canada .
After a ruling finding the state was obligated to recognize the plaintiff ’s marriage , the New York Supreme Court declined to review the case .
Gay rights advocates in the state have been pushing for legalization of same - sex marriage throughout this legislative session ; this directive makes New York the third state in the country to recognize same - sex marriages performed elsewhere while not performing their own .

The choices we make now will make or break our collective environmental future .
Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than with the dispute over West Virginia ’s Coal River Mountain , one of the last mountains still intact in the Coal River Valley .
But the future of the mountain is in jeopardy .
A subsidiary of Massey Energy has recently applied for strip mine permits that would destroy 6600 acres of the Coal River Mountain , or almost 10 square miles .
Not only would this plan destroy a beautiful area , but it would also dump waste into valleys that fill almost every neighboring headwater stream .
The 15 year mining plan would destroy almost all viable wind power potential on the mountain .
This would be a huge tragedy , as a wind farm atop Coal River Mountain would provide enough energy for 150,000 homes indefinitely and create hundreds of jobs in one of the poorest areas of the country .
At the same time , tax income from the project could be used to construct new schools in the county .
This is a classic example of the dilemma between extracting unsustainable resources ( thus ruining the area that supplies the resources ) and securing our future with alternative energy programs .

Diablo III is so in right now .
After the unsurprising announcement about Blizzard Entertainment 's latest game , we pinned down man of the moment , lead designer Jay Wilson , down for a chat about the latest installment in the Diablo franchise .
Advertisement
Kotaku :
So , Jay , what can you tell us about the storyline of Diablo III ?
Jay Wilson :
In the previous two games , Diablo and his two brothers , Mephisto and Baal , were the three Prime Evils of a world called Sanctuary .
Where we start off in Diablo III , it 's twenty years later ( after Diablo II : Lord of Destruction ) and the brothers are gone , they 've been vanquished .
Essentially everyone was kind of geared for Hell to actually invade .
At the end of Lord of Destruction , the Worldstone was destroyed , it left a giant crater and everyone was expecting the hordes to come pouring out of it and nothing happened .
So , Deckard Cain is one of our main characters from the first two games , he 's spent the last two decades trying to find out where the last two Evils are , what they 're doing and why the invasion did n't happen .
A lot of the rest of the story focuses on Tyrael , the Angel of Justice , and what 's happened to him since that event as he was actually the angel who destroyed the world .

Kotaku :
From a lore point of view , the mythology of Diablo seems just as complex as it is for Warcraft or Starcraft , do you think this is important ?
Jay Wilson :
Yes , absolutely , it 's one of our main focuses of the game .
What was funny was that when I gave you the synopsis of the game , it feels so simple !
We love the story .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Kotaku :
You said earlier that you 'd been working on the game for what , four years ?
Do you think that taking longer over a game improves the final product significantly ?
Jay Wilson : Four ….
or five , somewhere in that area .
I think taking as long as a game needs to take guarantees that it 's a good game .
It 's hard to say whether it improves the end product but sometimes it 's necessary .
Blizzard only releases great games so if it's not great we just do n't release it .
One of the things I would want to say , especially to our most patient fans – the ones that have been hoping for Diablo III - is that I hope they see it 's a testament of our love for the franchise that we would n't release it before it 's good and ready .
We 've really spent this time trying to make a sequel that was worthy of them .

Kotaku :
In the demo you showed during the Opening Ceremony , you gave us a glimpse at the Witch Doctor class which seems to use several spells similar to those found in World of Warcraft .
Do you worry that some fans will think you 're just copying aspects of WoW ?
Jay Wilson : No .
Do I think people will say that ?
Yes , I think they will .
One of the things I like to remind people is that it 's okay to steal from ourselves .
A good idea is a good idea and a good skill is a good skill and so when we look across all our games we borrow from each other all of the time .
But the really key and important thing is do we play like World of Warcraft ?
No !
We do n't play anything like it , Diablo has a different feel to it and that 's fine .
If we look at the history of Blizzard games , at Warcraft I and II , the spell Blizzard appeared , it also appeared in WoW and Diablo II .
I almost think it 's more like a signature but as long as a game has enough original stuff that it stands on its own and plays like its own game , that 's what matters .
Kotaku :
In that case do you think that this might work in your favour , that WoW players , for example might be persuaded to try Diablo III ?
Advertisement
Jay Wilson : Yeah , actually , I do think that .
I think players like things that they are familiar with and I do n't think there 's anything wrong with them saying : " Oh , this class is like the warrior in WoW .
Cool , I wanna play that ! "
Especially if it 's going to get them into the game .
I think we gain as much as we could lose , people love to see something familiar and the reaction to Whirlwind was a great example .
Kotaku :
You only joined Blizzard recently , does your passion for Diablo stretch back further than that ?
Jay Wilson : Yes , I am a Blizzard fan .
My first Blizzard game was Rock N' Roll Racing so yeah .
Warcraft I , II , StarCraft - I 'm a huge StarCraft fan , Diablo I and II ; Diablo used to be spoken of in hushed tones in my house because I was so excited and I pretty much played Diablo II since the day it came out .
It 's one of those games that 's great to go back to .
Kotaku :
Why do you think Diablo has captured so much attention ?
Jay Wilson : I think you could pick out a lot of things : the setting 's darker and people like that , especially now .
I actually think Diablo II wins on the fun scale .
All of the Diablo games , they 're fun to play and that 's important .
You could take the most flawed game in the world and as long as it's fun it 's okay .
Diablo II 's super easy to play , you could teach your grandmother to play it in five seconds .
Kotaku :
With the popularity of WoW and other online games , Battle .net seems to have nearly disappeared into the background .
Do you think Diablo III will breathe new life into the service ?
Jay Wilson : I can't really talk about Battle .
net but I will say , Battle .
net will not be a background .
I 'll be huge , the next version will be absolutely Blizzard 's focus .
Everyone is going to be thrilled when they see the kind of stuff we have planned !
It feeds into our overall focus of providing a really great service for our players .
Not exactly political , but after looking at election statistics and political cartoons all day , it cracked me up .

A team of UC Irvine scientists has been awarded a $ 4 million grant from the U.S. Army Research Office to study the neuroscientific and signal - processing foundations of synthetic telepathy .
The research could lead to a communication system that would benefit soldiers on the battlefield and paralysis and stroke patients , according to lead researcher Michael D’Zmura , chair of the UCI Department of Cognitive Sciences .
“ Thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speech recognition and in brain imaging at other universities to research a brain - computer interface with applications in military , medical and commercial settings , ” D’Zmura says .
The brain - computer interface would use a noninvasive brain imaging technology like electroencephalography to let people communicate thoughts to each other .
For example , a soldier would “ think ” a message to be transmitted and a computer - based speech recognition system would decode the EEG signals .
The decoded thoughts , in essence translated brain waves , are transmitted using a system that points in the direction of the intended target .
“ Such a system would require extensive training for anyone using it to send and receive messages , ” D’Zmura says .
“ Initially , communication would be based on a limited set of words or phrases that are recognized by the system ; it would involve more complex language and speech as the technology is developed further . ”
D’Zmura will collaborate with UCI cognitive science professors Ramesh Srinivasan , Gregory Hickok and Kourosh Saberi .
Joining the team are researchers Richard Stern and Vijayakumar Bhagavatula from Carnegie Mellon ’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and David Poeppel from the University of Maryland ’s Department of Linguistics .
The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Defense ’s Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative program , which supports research involving more than one science and engineering discipline .
Its goal is to develop applications for military and commercial uses .

The recently announced Google Ajax Libraries API caught our attention because it offers some significant performance improvements if you use a popular Javascript library ( e.g. JQuery , prototype , script_aculo_us , MooTools or dojo ) on your site .
You can now reference these libraries at Google rather than having to host your own copy .
The benefits of this approach are :
The libraries are hosted on Google ’s high speed global network providing fast access from most locations world wide
HTTP compression minimizes the size of the download
Minimized versions of the each library are available to further reduce download size
The library that your site uses may already be in the user ’s browser cache if the user has visited another site that uses the Google hosted libraries
You can specify which version of a library should be used with a hard coded URL or allow for automatic version upgrades using the google .
load ( ) function
function Downloading from a different hostname ( i.e. ajax.googleapis.com ) frees up an HTTP connection in the browser that can be used to download other resources from your site
Google picks up the bandwidth bill for the hosted Javascript libraries
Based on these benefits , we decided to upgrade our Ajax gallery page to use the Google hosted version of jQuery .
To do this we simply changed the script tag to use the URL of the minimized version of jQuery 1.2.6 at Google :
< script src = " http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js " > < / script > < script src= "
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.2.6/jquery.min.js " > </ script >
The Google hosted version of the jQuery library gave us a consistent decrease in page load time of about 0.5 seconds .
This benefit was largely achieved through the use of a different hostname ( ajax.googleapis.com ) which avoided Blocked time on the library download .
You can see this clearly by first looking at the HttpWatch time chart of the Ajax page load in IE 7 using our own hosted copy of jQuery :
and then the time chart of the page load using the Google hosted version :
We also saw a reduction in the Wait time displayed in HttpWatch .
It reduced from about 150 ms with our hosted version to about 60 ms from Google .
This was probably due to the use of Google ’s Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) .
Our web server is hosted in Dallas , Texas and has a ping time of about 140 ms from our office in the UK .
The Google host ajax .
googleapis.com has a much lower ping time of 29 ms from here in the UK .
However , the overall response time for the library download , ignoring Blocked time , was slightly longer from Google because it incurred an extra DNS look - up and TCP connection .
Here is the request level time chart for our hosted version of the library :
and the Google hosted version :
One slight disappointment was that Google has set the cache expiration time of the library to one year in the future :
On most other Google sites they use very long expiration times as described in our Two Simple Rules for HTTP Caching post .
They could have done this here , but it probably helps them to gather some usage statistics on these libraries and the chances of a cached Javascript library surviving in a browser cache for more than a year are fairly low .
In the end though , we hit one problem that stopped us using the Google hosted library .
There appears to be no support for using HTTPS to download the library .
Our Ajax page can be used in HTTP and HTTPS mode .
If we simply hard - coded the HTTP download URL for Google we would end up with the dreaded ‘ Do you want to display nonsecure items ? ’ that we described in a previous post :
So , if you are only using HTTP there are some excellent performance benefits from using the Google hosted Javascript libraries , but if your site needs HTTPS you ’ll be forced to use your own hosted version on secure pages .
Let ’s hope that Google adds SSL support to ajax.googleapis.com .

When I failed my test at the NSA , no follow investigation was even done to establish whether I was deceptive on the test
Croddy V FBI pretty much established that NSA does n't have to conduct followup investigations on applicants to verify polygraph results if they do n't want to .
When a hiring authority uses polygraph screening tests for employment purposes they accept the possibility of false positives and false negatives and adjust their scoring criteria to purposely reduce the likelihood of a false negative with the full knowledge that by reducing false negatives they will have an increased rate of false positives .
They can do this because the potential cost to National Security is much greater from a false negative than the consequences of failing to hire an applicant because of a false positive .
They are the ones with the jobs to fill and they get to decide who they will hire and what criteria they will use .
Polygraph employment tests for government jobs are legal .
When you entered the application process you were not entitled to a job and they were not obligated to hire you whether you passed or failed your polygraph exam .
You really do n't know why you were rejected by NSA it may have been something in your background they did n't like .
One of your neighbors may have told them some negative information about you .
Maybe it was a combination of polygraph and negative background .
YOU DON " T KNOW .
You just assume it was only because of polygraph because they told you failed your test .
Neither one if us know if you really failed your test or maybe the spooks at NSA just told you failed to get you into a " Stress Interview " situation to monitor how or IF you react under pressure .
If NSA has 25 jobs and 50 applicants 40 of which pass their polygraph test .
Why should they bother at all with the 10 who failed ?
It would waste time and resources because they have enough people who passed to fill their needs ?
You can Boo Hoo all you want , but NSA did n't owe you anything , They used a screening tool that it was legal for them to use and you do n't have to like it , but you need to learn to live with it .
As to your constant commentary about the NAS study , maybe you should read the whole thing .
If you did , you would find that it is not the scathing indictment of polygraph you seem to think it is .
You would also find that the National Academy of Sciences did not conduct any new or original laboratory or field research on polygraph testing .
Their effort was confined to a review of the research on polygraph testing and in particular to that which pertains to personnel screening .
In doing so , the academy relied on only 57 of the more than 1,000 research studies available .
They also lost any semblance of a balanced inquiry by inviting persons against polygraph to offer testimony and prohibiting polygraph experts from giving testimony at any point during their review .
All that being said , in the five years since the release of their report , completed studies and studies now under way have taken NAS recommendations and included them in their research .

* Illustration : T.J. Tucker * Suppose you need to reach me with an urgent email ?
Try hitting Send at precisely 10:47 am .
Statistically speaking , that 's when my most crucial messages arrive each day — and when I 'm most likely to ping you back .
How do I know this ?
Because I 've been using a new software app called Xobni to manage my horribly overstuffed inbox .
Among other cool tricks , Xobni spots hidden patterns in your email usage .
It identifies , for instance , who your most important contacts are , what time of day they typically send email , and how long it takes you to reply to one another .
I discovered that the missives I care about most — from my wife , editors , and closest friends — tend to arrive in bursts during the mid-morning and late afternoon .
This is incredibly useful knowledge .
These days , instead of leaving my email open all the time and jumping with Pavlovian slaver at each ding , I check in only during what I now know are my two " hot zones . "
I can work uninterrupted most of the day with the confidence that I 'll be online when the on - fire messages arrive .
Artificial intelligence in the service of life - hacking :
It 's the future of email .
And God knows we need a better future for email , because the present is intolerable .
This once - miraculous productivity tool has metastasized into one of the biggest timesucks in American life .
Studies show that there are 77 billion corporate email messages sent every day , worldwide .
By 2012 , that number is expected to more than double .
The Radicati Group calculates that we already spend nearly a fifth of our day dealing with these messages ; imagine a few years down the road , when it takes up 40 percent of our time .
" It 's madness , " says Merlin Mann , who runs 43 Folders.com , a leading productivity blog .
" We 're all desperately trying to figure out how to cut stuff so we can get through the day , and it just gets harder and harder . "
( Mann advocates dealing with incoming messages immediately so your inbox is always empty .
Me , I 've got 12,802 messages in there right now . )
Why has email spun so badly out of control ?
Because it 's asymmetric — incredibly easy to send but often devilishly burdensome to receive .
For example , in one minute I can send an email to a thousand coworkers asking them to review a document .
Let 's say each recipient spends five seconds disgustedly discarding it .
Boom :
In just one minute , I 've wasted 5,000 seconds — 1 hour , 23 minutes — of my organization 's time .
Equally insidious is the growing plague of semi-meaningful emails — friend requests , one - word replies from your boss .
Email apps were n't designed to recognize such idiocies , which is why our inboxes become unruly messes , with important messages pushed offscreen and out of mind .
Thankfully , this has begun to change in the past year with the arrival of AI - equipped email monitors like Xobni .
Another of my favorites is ClearContext , which identifies your most valued contacts — people you reply to quickly and frequently — and flags their incoming messages .
It also endows you with superpowered sorting .
If a work - related thread goes off the rails — like when colleagues hijack a project discussion to argue about Lost — you can zap it .
From that point on , new messages in the thread are filtered out and deleted automatically .
For my money , though , the best part of these nü- email apps is more subtle .
They give you insight into yourself — how and why you email at all .
After a few days of using these tools , I began to see that much of my supposedly " crucial " correspondence was n't really all that urgent .
I was wasting a lot of time on endless volleys that could have been dispatched with a quick phone call .
( Helpfully , Xobni auto - extracts phone numbers from emails , making this a snap . )
I 've started typing less and dialing more .
A really good email app , in other words , encourages you to use email less .
And that seems like the best solution of all .

AP :
Parts of the Endangered Species Act may soon be extinct .
The Bush administration wants federal agencies to decide for themselves whether highways , dams , mines and other construction projects might harm endangered animals and plants .
New regulations , which do n't require the approval of Congress , would reduce the mandatory , independent reviews government scientists have been performing for 35 years , according to a draft first obtained by The Associated Press .
Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said late Monday the changes were needed to ensure that the Endangered Species Act would not be used as a " back door " to regulate the gases blamed for global warming .
In May , the polar bear became the first species declared as threatened because of climate change .
Warming temperatures are expected to melt the sea ice the bear depends on for survival .
" We need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good , " Kempthorne said in a news conference organized quickly after AP reported details of the proposal .
" It is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species .
It is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species . "

Although many health researchers and professionals have recommended that doctors stop prescribing antibiotics for sinus infections , the practice is still widespread .
A new study , conducted by Swiss researchers and published in the , found that a third of all doctor 's visits for upper respiratory infections in the United States end in a diagnosis of rhinosinusitis , or nasal / sinus inflammation .
Approximately 80 percent of these patients are prescribed antibiotics .
But most rhinosinusitis infections are caused by viruses , which are not affected by antibiotics .
In thestudy , researchers found that for every 15 adult rhinosinusitis patients treated with antibiotics , only one would receive any benefit from the drug .
Antibiotics were equally ineffective regardless of the patients ' age or the length or severity of their symptoms .
" Antibiotics offer little benefit for patients with acute rhinosinusitis - like complaints , " the researchers wrote .
" Antibiotics are not justified even if a patient reports symptoms for longer than 7 - 10 days .
" In addition to placing patients at risk of side effects , the unnecessary use of antibiotics contributes to the development of drug - resistant bacterial strains .
An earlier study , published in the , found that 83 percent of acute and 70 percent of chronic rhinosinusitis infections in the United States are treated with at least one antibiotic .
According to Donald A. Leopold , chairman of the department of otolaryngology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center , many doctors prescribe antibiotics simply because they can't think of anything more effective to use .
" We as physicians do n't have very good medications for chronic rhinosinusitis , " he said .
" The only other drugs in contention are topical steroids , and they are not great .
As a group , I suggest we are frustrated at not having good drugs .
"
In addition , many patients insist on being given drugs and doctors are reluctant to stand up to them .
" Many patients call up and ask for specific antibiotics , " he said .
" The patients know these names .
They have been marketed to them , so they know the drugs are available .
And antibiotics do give some relief . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States has not accurately tracked about $ 6 billion it gave to help the Pakistani government fight terrorism since 2001 , according to a report released Tuesday .
The Department of Defense says Pakistani troops have been key allies in the war on terrorism .
Pakistan is the largest recipient of payments from the Coalition Support Funds , which gives money to 27 partner countries to help combat terrorism .
The country , which the Department of Defense considers a key ally in the war on terrorism because of its proximity to large swaths of ungoverned tribal land , has received $ 5.56 billion of $ 6.88 billion given out since September 11 , 2001 .
But a report released Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs said the Coalition Support Funds cannot prove that the money went to projects or operations specifically fighting terrorists .
While calling the program critical to the war on terrorism , the GAO found numerous concerns about the accuracy of the Pakistani accounting .
" As a result , we conclude that Defense cannot accurately determine how much of the $ 5.56 billion in costs reimbursed to Pakistan since 2001 were actually incurred , " the report said .
The report drew ire from Congress , as some members said Pakistan is bilking the United States to " boost its conventional warfare capability , " committee Chairman Howard L. Berman said .
The Department of Defense responded to the report by saying Pakistan has contributed significantly to the war on terrorism but acknowledged some problems tracking the money .
" At the U.S. request , the Pakistan Army deployed major ground forces for the first time to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to attempt to capture the remnants of al Qaeda and Afghan Taliban fleeing into Pakistan from the Tora Bora Area of Afghanistan , " the department said .
" The cost to Pakistan of these operations , in human terms , has been significant .
Approximately 1,400 Pakistani security forces members have lost their lives since 2001 in the [ Global War on Terrorism ] , " the statement continued .
The watchdog arm of Congress found the Defense Department paid more than $ 200 million for an air defense radar but failed to check why it was needed , because the Taliban and al Qaeda do not have air forces .
The report also cited payments of about $ 45 million to the Pakistani government for road and bunker construction for the Army .
The United States failed to get evidence that the roads and bunkers were ever built .
At times , the United States may have paid more than once for the same thing .
The GAO found that Pakistan received about $ 3.7 million each year for to operate a fleet of fewer than 20 vehicles for the country 's Navy .
The GAO said the United States paid for " vehicle damage " and " cost of vehicles repaired " without any explanation of the difference between the two .
Defense Department officials have said Pakistan is the United States ' key ally in the war on terrorism because of the country 's location .
The vast , ungoverned tribal area known as the Federally Administered Tribal Area is considered a protected region for terrorists .
The area is in western Pakistan , along the Afghan border .

Four - dollar gas has fueled a boom in the number of Bay Area drivers shedding some wheels to cut their commuting costs .
This year 's soaring gas prices have spurred a growing number of motorists to park , or even sell , their cars , and instead use two - or sometimes three - wheeled vehicles to get around .
Fuel - sipping motor scooters and gas - free bicycles appear to be the most popular alternatives , though more motorcyclists are zipping down the road , and even motorized bicycles are making a comeback .
Scooters , long a fixture on the streets of Europe , are quickly gaining popularity in the United States .
Nationwide , sales of major brands of scooters are up 66 percent in the first six months of the year , according to the Motorcycle Industry Council .
In the Bay Area , dealers say , scooters are buzzing off showroom floors .
" We 're up over 200 percent over last year , " said Darragh Howard , who owns Rockridge Two Wheels in Oakland and Vespa Walnut Creek .
" It 's been a bit of a crazy time .
July was our best month ever .
We sold over 60 bikes . "
Ironically , Two Wheels is the nation 's leading seller of Vespa 's three - wheeled MP3 scooter , Howard said .
In San Francisco , undoubtedly the scooter capital of the Bay Area , sales have also soared .
Dave McAteer , a salesman at Vespa SF , said sales have doubled to 60 to 80 scooters a month .
" Sales are through the roof , " he said .
Scooters are even enjoying newfound popularity in suburbia .
At Vespa Walnut Creek , saleswoman Kristin Gallagher said they 're selling a couple of scooters a day .
" Saturdays are crazy , " she said .
" The place is packed . "
In the past , scooters were ridden mostly by hipsters and those who considered them cute or fun .
But rising gas prices attracted a whole new crowd .
Scooters can get anywhere from 60 to 100 miles per gallon .
New Vespas range from $ 2,000 to $ 9,000 , with the average cost being $ 5,000 .
" A lot of moms come in and want something they can use to run down to the store and pick up a few things , " said Gallagher .
" As gas hit $ 3.50 then $ 4 , they started getting sick of taking their SUVs out . "
Kerry Brothers , 33 , a retail manager who lives in Oakland , is among the converts .
She and her husband bought scooters for recreation a little more than a year ago when they lived in San Antonio .
But after moving to the Bay Area six months ago , they started using them to run errands and to get around .
" Today is the first day in a month and a half that I drove my car , " she said .
" I 'll probably sell it in December . "
Ky Boe , 39 , an Oakland race car mechanic , and his wife , Linda , 43 , bought a scooter with a top speed of 80 mph in October , and she uses it to commute across the Bay Bridge to work .
It gets about 100 mpg , he said .
" She fills up completely for $ 6 or $ 7 , and goes for weeks , " he said .
Gallagher , who owns a Subaru Outback and a scooter , said she can fill her scooter 10 times for what it costs to gas up her car .
She also works as a pet - sitter , a job that requires a lot of short trips .
" I find the scooter to be far more efficient , " she said .
Scooters are also convenient , said Boe , especially for finding parking or avoiding congestion .
" It makes life so much simpler and easier , " he said .
Biking to work
Gas prices have also driven more people to commute by bike .
BART officials report an increase of 10 to 15 percent in bicycles aboard trains , and bike racks at stations are fuller than ever .
In San Francisco , a traffic count by the Municipal Transportation Authority in July found that during a one - hour stretch of the morning commute , there were more bicycles than cars , taxis , buses and streetcars heading eastbound on Market Street .
According to Judson
True , an authority spokesman , 509 bike riders were tallied compared with 400 cars , 43 taxis and 30 transit vehicles .
On Bike to Work Day in May , he said , officials counted twice as many bikes as motorized vehicles .
" In the Market Street corridor , there 's been a significant shift to bicycles for commuting , " he said .
" I do n't think anyone could stand on the sidewalk during the commute and not notice it . "
Dan Sankey , 31 , a sales manager at Mike 's Bikes in San Francisco , has noticed .
He pedals to work around 10 a.m. and has noticed a big surge in bike ridership in recent months , far beyond the usual summer increase .
" Now at 10 a.m. , Market Street is like rush hour , " he said .
" And at rush hour , it 's nuts .
It tends to be raceway . "
Bicycle sales have increased slightly , but steadily , he said , and technicians are seeing more riders dragging dusty bikes out of garages and closets , and bringing them into Bay Area bike shops for tuneups .
The bike industry has also responded by introducing new lines of bikes with more racks and storage space , catering to commuters , Sankey said .
Electric power
Electric bikes , which enjoyed brief popularity in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , are also reappearing , though they 're clearly outnumbered by scooters and bicycles .
Bike riders , scooter aficionados and environmentalists are all happy to see the boom and expect it to continue , despite the cooler , wetter weather ahead .
" They 've been doing this for years in Europe .
There 's no reason the Bay Area can't emulate that , " said McAteer .
" We do n't really see any slowdown coming . "

At a violin camp for kids in my neck of the woods , the students divided into four groups : bad boys , bad girls , good boys , good girls .
No one had to divide them .
They sorted quickly based on human volition .
The groups ate together , walked to and from class together , and sat together .
As the week went on , the sex separation reduced , so that by the end , there were only two groups : good kids and bad kids .
The good kids paid attention in class .
They spoke respectfully to teachers .
They practiced at the appointed hours .
They had nice table manners .
They did n’t use vulgar language .
They were in bed somewhat early and they woke early .
They were neatly dressed .
The girls were modest and the boys did n’t wear hats indoors .
They excelled in sports .
But as this was a strings camp , what matters is how they played .
The good kids all played well .
They were at the top of the sections , whether violin , viola , or cello .
They aced the theory exams .
They all got along with each other .
The bad kids cursed .
They girls dressed poorly and the boys wore hats indoors .
They rolled their eyes during lectures and did n’t pay attention .
They whispered to each other in rehearsals .
The girls gossiped constantly .
The boys had baggy pants that showed their underwear , and they did idiotic things like rolled up dollar bills and sniffed salt as if it were cocaine .
They were rude to adults .
What about the bad kids and their musicianship ?
Were the bad kids great musicians , and so could get away with their behavior because they are good at what they do ?
No .
There was no exception .
The bad kids were all bad musicians too .
They occupied the lowest chairs in every section .
I ’m telling you this so that you believe : the caricature of these two types of kids is not a myth .
How dare we so wickedly divide kids into such broad groups ?
Because it reflects reality .
The divisions are quite strict even though they are unenforced .
Remember the Highlights cartoon called Goofus and Gallant ?
Goofus was mean and rude and terrible .
Gallant was nice , polite , and had ability .
I recall thinking how childish this division was , an adult invention that oversimplified the world .
Apparently I was wrong .
It pretty much sums up the way the kid population divides itself up .
Now , think for a moment about egalitarianism , the theory that all people are equal and so the spoils of society should be equally divided among them .
Do you see how this flies in the face of the daily experience of every living person ?
Imagine the damage that would come to the camp by evenly distributing the positions in the orchestra .
The good kids would not be rewarded , and so would face a disincentive for continuing excellent behavior .
The bad kids would conclude that there is no cost to being a jerk .
The orchestra would n’t sound as good , since bad players would be responsible for harder and more exposed spots .
So who would win under egalitarianism ?
I suppose that the winner would be the sicko powermonger who did the dividing .
That person would gain some measure of satisfaction merely from the thrill that comes from upending the natural order of things .
This individual has a name in the world in which we live : the state .
If the state gets away with this , it wrecks the orchestra of society .
It discourages goodness and subsidizes badness .
Cultural decline defines the new reality , and there is a descent straight to the gutter .
As for the state , it wins solely by its desire to do what it is designed to do : coerce people and enjoy watching people obey .
In contrast , a state of freedom and justice leads to excellence all around .
Those with good behavior enjoy reward and those who behave badly must languish in their low status and incompetence .
They must suffer as those with good behavior excel in all ways .
In education circles , there is a lot of talk about character education .
But much of the discussion of this issue assumes institutional neutrality , as if it does n’t matter how society is structured .
But the truth is that all issues of personal character are deeply influenced by institutional context .
Under freedom , there is a direct relationship between success in life and goodness of character .
The same is true of bad character : it will be punished in the long run .
These two tendencies working together produce an interesting dynamic that seems to keep society and culture on track .
Bad kids will always be with us .
What we need as a society is a framework that discourages or , at least , does n’t provide long - term rewards for bad behavior .
Similarly we must have social structures that grant people who behave properly certain advantages that arrive by virtue of their own excelling .
Fortunately we do not have to build such structures .
They are embedded as part of the social matrix of freedom .
I tend to be skeptical of claims that society is going to Hell in a handbasket .
And yet , there is a certain point here .
As government grows , people become worse .
The worst get on top and their bad behavior trickles down to everyone else .
The good are not permitted the freedom to flower .
As one example , consider inflation .
It rewards short - term thinking and punishes long - term thinking .
It rewards debtors and punishes savers .
To that extent , it degrades our characters and causes cultural decline .
Laissez - faire is sometimes seen as an “ anything goes ” philosophy .
It might more accurately be described as a “ reap what you sow ” philosophy .

A 40 - year - old man was charged on Friday with second degree murder after a fellow passenger was stabbed to death aboard a Greyhound bus on the Canadian Prairies and then beheaded .
REUTERS / Fred Greenslade
WINNIPEG , Manitoba ( Reuters ) - A 40 - year - old man was charged on Friday with second degree murder after a fellow passenger was stabbed to death aboard a Greyhound bus on the Canadian Prairies and then beheaded .
The killing occurred on Wednesday as the Greyhound moved east on the TransCanada Highway near Portage la Prairie , Manitoba , and the gruesomeness of the death sent shock waves across the country .
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Vince Weiguang Li of Edmonton , Alberta , has been charged with second degree murder .
Li looked down during his first court appearance on Friday , nodding his head when asked whether he was using his right to remain silent , according to media reports from Portage la Prairie , a small city about an hour ’s drive west of the Winnipeg .
Police have not speculated on a motive , but the charge of second degree murder is usually filed when police do not believe the killer planned the murder or targeted the victim in advance .
Witnesses have said that the killer , who brandished a “ Rambo ” - style hunting knife , did not appear to know the sleeping victim and that the attack began without warning .
The attorney prosecuting the murder charge asked that Li have a psychiatric assessment , but the judge said Li would first need to get a lawyer , the Canadian Broadcasting Corp said .
If evidence shows the attacker was mentally ill and did not understand what he was doing , criminal charges may not stand up , Fred Shane , a Manitoba forensic psychiatrist , told Reuters .
Friends told local media the victim was Tim McLean , 22 , who had been working at a carnival in Edmonton before returning to his Winnipeg home .
Police have not confirmed this .
In the good old days most Australian and New Zealand workers belonged to unions .
Pay rises were negotiated centrally .
Employers paid a fixed hourly rate for the job , higher rates for overtime and that was that .
Each year the union representatives and the management would lock themselves in a smoke - filled room .
They would order rounds of take - away sandwiches and hammer out an agreed pay rise .
Of course the process could get nasty .
Strikes , lockouts , mass - sackings and even riots were not unknown .
Pay bargaining was even tougher in America where negotiation sometimes involved guns .
Generally negotiations would settle with an agreement that saw every worker in the organization getting the same percentage pay rise .
The managers negotiating with the unions often got the same pay rises as union members .
In those days merit pay and bonuses were relatively rare .
As a young manager in the UK , I was once put in this position myself .
Guess how hard I was with the union negotiators during that pay round ?
Negotiate benchmarks
Non-union workers , or workers belonging to less powerful unions often got pay rises close to the rates negotiated by the stronger groups .
A powerful group would establish the ‘ norm ’ and then everyone else would use this the benchmark when starting their negotiations .
In countries like Australia , Britain and New Zealand individual pay bargaining gave way to centralised pay negotiations in the 1970s .
Union leaders still trooped into smoke - filled rooms , instead of facing local company management they would talk to government and industry heads .
The economic reforms that swept the English - speaking world in the 1980s and early 1990s saw centralised bargaining give way to a system where individuals increasingly had to negotiate their own terms .
New Zealanders went on to individual contracts .
Many Australian workers – particularly those further down the pecking order were still reliant on centralised negotiations until relatively recently but most white - collar workers and polo shirt - collared knowledge workers have to handle their own negotiations .
Status quo
Employers prefer the new status quo because it allows them to reward valued employees more than people who contribute little to the bottom line .
On the whole this is a good thing that few knowledge workers will argue with – during the boom years we all did well out of this system .
Some of us did spectacularly well .
However , from our point of view the down side of individual salary negotiation is that it puts a lot of power in the hands of the employers .
That ’s because of the asymmetric information flow inherent in one - on - one salary negotiations .
Information is central to any negotiation – if one side has better or more complete information that the other party , it is at a distinct advantage .
Companies usually have a policy of ensuring staff do n’t talk to each other about their salary packages .
In some companies , including places where I ’ve worked , disclosing details of your remuneration with other staff is regarded as a serious offence .
Of course employers have access too their company pay data so they can compare your package with other employees – they often also have access to pay information from other companies in their sector .
Sometimes this is informal , though there are organizations that collect and sell salary data on an industry - by - industry basis .
You wo n’t get far finding this kind of information from job advertisements .
Recruiters are often coy about salary levels .
They do n’t want to alert existing employees to how much extra they would be prepared to pay newcomers .
You do n’t often get to know what the salary for a job is until you are at a late stage of the recruitment process .
Negotiate armed with information
If you are a prospective employee , you need to get as much salary information as possible before entering negotiations .
Indeed , you need to know if it is even worth bothering to negotiate .
Likewise , if you want a pay rise from your existing employer , you need to know what other people doing the same job elsewhere earn .
This benchmark gives you useful ammunition .
It also lets you know whether you should stay or move to a new position should your negotiation fail .
As far as I ’m aware , there ’s no equivalent of salary.com in Australia and New Zealand ( if you know of one then email me ) .
Salary.com is a US site .
It shows data about what other people with your skill set earn in any city or region .
The nearest thing I ’ve found is when private research is published in a public forum .
New Corporation ’s Careerone often publishes this kind of data .
Here ’s an example of salary information for Australian jobs .
Hays Recruitment offers some New Zealand salary information here along with more Australian data .
If you hunt carefully you can find other sources .
I ’ll share any such similar sources that Knowledge Worker readers send to me .

BEIJING -- Crystl Bustos and Laura Berg were supposed to leave their cleats on the field .
It was going to be a symbolic gesture , their goodbye as the fog set in and a sport drifted away .
They 'd collect their gold medals shortly after 9 p.m. , just before the critics said one last time that this is the reason softball is ending at the Olympics , because the rest of the world can't compete .
Bustos ' cleats never surfaced late Thursday night and neither did the national anthem .
She walked out in sunglasses , in the dark , then her United States softball team took an unusual turn to the left .
In what will be considered possibly the biggest upset of the 2008 Summer Games , Japan beat the Americans 3 - 1 , snapping their 22 - game winning streak to win gold .
Thunder sticks from a pro-Japan crowd greeted the most unlikely Olympic heroes at Fengtai Softball Field .
The Japanese do not have modelesque looks or gaudy home run records .
They chatter incessantly , huddle like linemen between innings , and , by all appearances , are completely unaware of what they accomplished .
But some say they might 've saved softball , or at least made its re-appearance in the 2016 Games more realistic .
Before Thursday night , the Americans had n't lost since Sept. 21 , 2000 , in Sydney .
Before Yukiko Ueno's noodle arm stymied the United States ' powerful bats , the Americans had beaten their competition by a margin of 108 - 3 in the past two Olympics .
" Maybe people will get off our backs and realize that there is some parity in this game , " U.S. coach Mike Candrea said .
" I 've always felt that the rest of the world is getting better .
" It 's nice to see a full room of reporters here .
We have n't had you around most of the time .
Who knows what will happen ?
I do n't worry about that .
I just know I 've been around the game long enough to respect everyone we play .
Sometimes the game looks easy .
And it really is n't . "
The night was dubbed the " Grand Final . "
Softball was voted out of the Olympics in 2005 by a vote of 52 - 52 ( it needed one more vote to stay ) .
For three years , America 's golden girls have been anticipating the end , planning their final goodbyes in Beijing .
They hammered the Japanese 7 - 0 in preliminary play , and beat them again , 4 - 1 , Wednesday night round - robin semifinal action .
Ueno pitched 21 innings Wednesday to get her team to the title game .
The gathering at Fengtai was not the most astute in softball .
They cheered foul balls , and when Bustos hit a home run in the bottom of the fourth to cut the lead to one , the P.A. announcer yelled , " Congratulations !
She started playing softball at the age of 5 ! "
Fans wore yellow rain ponchos during sprinkles that turned into a quick downpour .
Bustos barely cracked a smile as she rounded third base after her solo shot .
It appeared as if the Americans had a rally brewing , and they were relatively expressionless in the bottom of the sixth inning , when they stranded the bases loaded after Stacey Nuveman popped out to second .
The night was about to get worse for the Americans .
They gave up two uncharacteristic errors in the top of the seventh , and Japan had a 3 - 1 cushion .
But nearly everybody -- including the man in the crowd with the inflatable cowboy hat on his head and a beer in his hand -- thought the U.S. would rally .
Pinch - hitter Victoria Galindo led off the bottom of the seventh with a single to left center , bringing Tairia Flowers to the plate as the potential tying run .
She popped out in foul territory , then Natasha Watley lined out to third .
Caitlin Lowe grounded out to third , and the Americans stood in stunned silence as " We are the Champions " played and Ueno was hoisted on her teammates ' shoulders .
She extended a No. 1 signal to the crowd , and Bustos and her teammates waited in a line along third base to shake hands .
" I have n't really thought about the big picture , " pitcher Cat Osterman said .
" It hurts too much to look at the future . "
They held hands as they stepped up to the medals podium , then lingered to wave goodbye .
Some smiled ; others dabbed their eyes .
As he stood in a dark parking lot near the team bus more than an hour after the loss , Candrea said he'd remind the team about perspective .
They'd won three gold medals since softball started in the 1996 Olympics .
They will have worlds and the Pan Am Games to compete in .
Candrea plans to spend his summers playing golf now and re-connecting with this family .
Four years ago , before Athens , he lost his wife to a brain aneurysm as the pre-Olympics tour was winding down .
" I 'm just proud of them , " he said .
" I do n't want them to hang their heads too long .
" We had a hell of a run . "

Dr. Biden grew up in Willow Grove , Pa. , a Philadelphia suburb , the oldest of four daughters .
Their father was a bank teller who became president of a savings and loan ; their mother stayed home to raise them .
She started working at 15 , telling an interviewer last year , “ I wanted my own money , my own identity , my own career . ”
When Mr. Biden first called her that night in 1975 , she told him that she had voted for him in 1972 .
She also knew the tragic story of his wife , Neilia , who was killed with their baby daughter in 1972 when a truck broadsided their car as they were Christmas shopping .
Their two sons , Beau and Hunter , were injured but recovered .
“ Funny thing was , by the time Joe called , she ’d almost resolved to quit dating , ” Richard Ben Cramer wrote in his political biography , “ What It Takes , ” in which he delved into the lives of the candidates running for president in 1988 .
“ She ’d married young , it did n’t last , and after that , when she went back to college , well ... she was a senior , but 24 years old . ”
Mr. Cramer said she was impressed that Mr. Biden had showed up in a suit and shook her hand good night .
She called her mother that night to say she had finally met a gentleman .
Their lives quickly became intertwined , and eventually , his young sons asked him when “ we ” were going to get married .
He had to ask her five times before she overcame her hesitation at becoming a full - time mother and meeting the public demands of a political spouse .
Of Mr. Biden , she said that she came to realize that “ anybody who can love that deeply once can do it again . ”
" Why are the " two dudes back there " not treated with as much respect as the people that leave after all the free shit is gone ? "
The order was obvious to me : first id 's games and fun , then esports and champions .
I did n't expect to see the best esports event in history .
I expected a LAN party aimed to entertain the casual gamer rather than the most hardcore of hardcore with a pinch of esports .
What I did not expect was that QuakeLive , the game I thought should be promoted - of all events - at QuakeCon , would be treated like it was by id Software .
When John " ZeRo4 " Hill and Alexei " Cypher " Yanushevsky showed up in the ballroom for the final , they were told that there was not enough time to play a full final .
They were given the option to either play the final in a one - map system ( where ZeRo4 needed two maps to win ) or play best of threes with a time limit of 10 .
The players agreed to neither so a possibility of finishing the grand final back at the BYOC area was considered should it take too long .
But while watching the closing ceremony of QuakeCon ran by id CEO Todd Hollenshead and QuakeLive producer Marty Stratton you would never have guessed that time was an issue .
Feast your eyes : The ET : QuakeWars and the QuakeLive CTF finals opened the closing show of QuakeCon 2008 .
CTF was done at 21:20 .
Then we sat through over an hour of Guitar Hero 3 , a Quake tattoo show , a quick draw match , a Bawls drinking contest , about an hour or more of t- shirt throwing and contests for the first people to bring a bra / a pokemon item / whatever else to Marty Stratton for a Corvette lottery ticket .
The list is longer but I would rather forget than remember the items on it .
The finalists sat tired and hungry , and jetlagged in the case of Cypher , as this dragged on for three hours while Hollenshead and Stratton took their sweet time entertaining the public .
The time for the final came after the Corvette was given away and the largest door of the ballroom was opened so people could leave .
When they tried to announce the match , Hollenshead and Stratton had a difficult time figuring out the names of the players .
It was 12:20 am .
That is how unimportant the final was .
Why are the " two dudes back there " not treated with as much respect as the people that leave after all the free shit is gone ?
Why is Guitar Hero more important than QUAKE at QUAKECon ?
It was interesting to see this .
Especially after Marty Stratton said in an interview that one of the goals with QuakeLive is to teach the public to appreciate the skill in Quake .
All that in order to make it as mainstream as possible .
If the best QuakeLive match you could ever see is not mainstream enough in the eyes of id Software , then who will see it that way ?
Where , if not at QuakeCon , should QuakeLive be considered mainstream ?-----*
Big thanks to the volunteers that make QuakeCon possible - overall a really nice event . *
Big thanks to the people in id Software that actually do care about this unimportant esports thing . *
Quote of the year in esports : " When I played LeXeR in the WCG 2001 final , you were 10 years old . " - ZeRo4 to Cypher before the QuakeCon 2008 final .

Generally butterflies are only able to fly at a body temperature of 30 °c or above .
Once they are flying , they can keep up their body temperature .
Painted Ladies are the most widely distributed butterflies in the world and can be found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica .
Occasionally the butterflies make mass migrations in search of a new habitat .
And perhaps sometimes a swarm can be seen at a sunlit meadow warming up ...

Lonely Sphere

The " hills " and the " tubes " that follows the smooth " grooves " in it are made with 2 isosurfaces .
The basis function for the " terrain " in this image is a " sombrero " function that has been displaced vertically by a noise function .
The grooves are made by subtracting the function for the " tubes " from the function for the " hills " with the help of a " blobbing " function ; the hyperbolic tangent function .
The tanh ( ) function has a S - shape that is similar to the shape of the Sigmoid function .

He knew that sound .
Automated Patrol Droids ?
At least two of them .
Billy had been avoiding them for days .
Through his headache the noise was like a quarter million bees , all gunning for his blood .
The sounds continued the increase in volume .
He tightened his grip on the wrench , and shifted his body slightly .
And knocked over a quarter - filled bottle of booze .
It tingled loudly , but not loudly enough to be heard over the droning of the APUs .
Mentally cursing his luck , and loss of lubricant , Billy curled into a ball and hoped they would n't find him .

Non-Cubic Space Division
by Tor Olav Kristensen
M.C. Escher 's " Cubic space division " ( " Kubische ruimteverdeling " ) lithograph from 1952 inspired me to make this image .
The shape of the cross sections of the " bars " in this image is formed by the function for a superellipse .
And the cube - like shapes at the intersections of the girders are formed with the function for a superellipsoid .
I " disturbed " the 3 - dimensional grid by using a function that rotates the shape according to 3 noise functions ; one for each of the x- , y- , and z- axes .
I wanted all the shapes to be joined smoothly , so I added the functions for the " bars " and the " cubes " with the help of a " blobbing " function ; the Sigmoid function .
The Sigmoid function has a S - shape that is similar to the shape of the tanh ( ) function .

Toroidal Noise
by Tor Olav Kristensen
This image is a result from my early experiments with isosurfaces .
It shows a single isosurface shape .
The chaotic " forest " in this image is formed by giving 4 different noise functions as arguments to a torus function .
The fourth function , which is given as the minor radius to the torus function , also controls the colour of the pigment .
( The major radius is set to a constant value . )

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Paris Hilton ’s mother -- a John McCain donor -- on Sunday dismissed as a “ waste of money ” a television ad that used her daughter and Britney Spears to portray Democrat Barack Obama as more celebrity icon than chief executive .
Kathy Hilton , the mother of the blond socialite - actress , lambasted the Republican presidential candidate ’s advertisement in a blog posted on the political Web site Huffington Post ( www.huffingtonpost.com).
“ It is a complete waste of the money John McCain ’s contributors have donated to his campaign , ” Hilton wrote .
“ It is a complete waste of the country ’s time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs .
And it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next President of the United States , ” she wrote .
The McCain ad , titled “ Celeb , ” asks viewers : “ Is he ( Obama ) ready to lead ? ”
Hilton and her husband , a scion of the Hilton hotel chain , donated $ 4,600 to McCain ’s November White House bid .
McCain has portrayed himself as an independent - minded politician with a history of bucking authority and said last week that his rival has shown little more than strong speaking skills .
Leon Kass ’ fine essay “ L’Chaim and Its Limits ” is something I genuinely enjoy reading over and over .
But I think it is problematic , as is transhumanism , inasmuch as it obsesses over death .
To wit :
I wish to make the case for the virtues of mortality … .
I do hope I can convince readers of the gravity – I would say , the unique gravity – of this question [ of conquering death or not ] .
We are not talking about some minor new innovation with ethical wrinkles about which we may chatter or regulate as usual .
Conquering death is not something that we can try for a while and then decide whether the results are better or worse - according to , God only knows , what standard .
On the contrary , this is a question in which our very humanity is at stake , not only in the consequences but also in the very meaning of the choice .
For to argue that human life would be better without death is , I submit , to argue that human life would be better being something other than human .
To be immortal would not be just to continue life as we mortals now know it , only forever .
The new immortals , in the decisive sense , would not be like us at all .
If this is true , a human choice for bodily immortality would suffer from the deep confusion of choosing to have some great good only on the condition of turning into someone else .
Moreover , such an immortal someone else , in my view , will be less well off than we mortals are now , thanks indeed to our mortality .
Kass gets a lot right , and there are times he ’ll make a more excessive argument purposely to draw our attention to an issue – I can’t quite account for his subtlety on all occasions .
I merely think that there could be a problem with arguing about the question of whether we should die or not too directly : the question itself is far too immature and unserious to dive into .
Hence , I do n’t even want to bother with transhumanist arguments .
I look at the technology that will drive us to transhumanism as a force , nothing more – it is a force which drives everything , including this writer , and need not be argued for .
The starting issues are whether , as Kass claims , Homer and the Bible present us a world where virtue and morality both depend on the possibility of death .
If we ’re immortal , why ca n’t we do anything we like ?
Why ca n’t we think anything we like ?
Can wisdom survive in a world beyond death ?
But those questions are just the beginning – they are trumped by the fact that we actually try to be immortal in one way or another .
With the possibility of man as a whole actually being immortal coming closer , the big issue is the authority of all literature and philosophy that to this moment has discussed man as the creature who is mortal , and centered all concerns on that fact .
Do those works really appeal to us as mortal to make their argument ?
On the surface , yes .
Achilles argues to Odysseus that because he will die , why should n’t he live life however he wishes and not be ruled by someone like Agamemnon ?
In the Bible , Man only accidentally rejects immortality for power , in attempting to be wholly equal or superior to God .
It looks like the question of virtue or morals depends on whether we die or not .
But that ca n’t be quite correct if the books themselves are right about what they presume .
If wisdom is about seeing key issues involving morality and virtue , and having a sensitivity to claims of justice and happiness , then inasmuch as the old books themselves are wise they are elevating virtue and morality beyond the question of death .
How best to live is something that , if understood , makes life happy for one and all in perpetuity .
I ’m not sure who said that heaven and hell are probably the same place , that our mindset alone creates the difference between the two , but it makes a heck of a lot of sense .
The problem is that Kass is being unknowlingly reductionist : in trying to take on the transhumanists too fast , he misses that the starting point of Homer and the Bible is the question of death because the audiences of both works are consumed with that question .
But let ’s say we could be immortal – our question is still how best to live ( we ’re going to be doing it a long time ) , and since the answers can come from any age or place and make sense to us , wisdom will still be above us , and we may still be human .
The real threats from transhumanist argumentation are practical – none of that argumentation should be taken seriously at a theoretical level .
Firstly , we ’re more than willing to slaughter as many babies as it takes to try and find cures for problems real or imagined .
That ’s not even a slippery slope – we ’re already at the level where we have a contempt for life generally as we embrace our selfishness .
Secondly , our equation of happiness with modern advances means that we are only materialists .
Our appreciation of the arts is incidental in many cases : do we really care about what other people are going through ?
But none of those complaints mean that the foundation of virtue , wisdom , is in a position to be wiped away .
It can only be submerged , or recede temporarily .
After all , the true death of man will never have anything to do with actual death – it will always be related to whether one has acted in such a way one can live with himself , or whether anyone can recognize another as human in his behavior .
One further note : I do n’t think any of this contradicts the discussion had regarding Dickinson ’s “ Success is Counted Sweetest . ”
The issue is that Death itself is metaphorical in that poem .

For decades , the idea that drinking cranberry juice could prevent or treat urinary tract infections was greeted with doubt and sometimes even sarcasm by doctors who considered this an " old wives ' tale " .
But in recent years , studies have shown that cranberry juice does exactly what countless grandmas and herbalists said it does .
It wards off infections .
But how ?
Now comes word that researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) have the answer .
Cranberry juice creates what the scientists call an " energy barrier " that has the amazing power to prevent disease - causing microorganisms from starting an infection .
This barrier changes the thermodynamic properties of infection - causing germs in the urinary tract .
Simply put , the bacteria are then unable to hook onto cells and cause illness .
The study looked at two varieties of E. coli bacteria -- one with projections known as fimbriae which are believed to be used by bacteria to latch into cells and one without the hair - like appendages .
The bacteria with fimbriae are found on many virulent bacteria , including those that cause painful urinary tract infections .
Both varieties were exposed to different concentrations of cranberry juice .
The research team , headed by Terri Camesano , associate professor of chemical engineering at WPI , and a team of graduate students , including PhD candidate Yatao Liu , found that even at low concentrations the fruit juice made it difficult for the illness - causing bacteria to attach to cells .
The scientists ' conclusions , recently published in the science journal , strongly indicate that cranberry juice repels bacteria with fimbriae .
The juice had had little if any effect on E. coli bacteria without the hair - like projections , suggesting that something in the juice interacts directly only on the " bad bacteria " that has tentacle - like fimbriae .
" Our results show that , at least for urinary tract infections , cranberry juice targets the right bacteria -- those that cause disease -- but has no effect on non-pathogenic organisms , suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut , " Camesano said in a statement for the press .
" We have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract .
" She also said that to take advantage of the antibacterial benefits of cranberry , it 's a good idea to consume cranberry juice regularly - even daily .
In fact , drinking cranberry juice might do more than help prevent painful urinary tract infections .
The Mayo Clinic is currently enrolling research subjects in a study to see if the fruit juice can help prevent cardiovascular disease .
Previous studies have shown that cranberries can lower " bad " cholesterol levels , and help reduce the risk of gum disease , stomach ulcers and cancer .

In an article this morning from the St Petersburgh ( FL ) Times the reporters report that Diebold / Premier voting systems failed to work properly in Hillsborough County .
They report :
By far the largest problem cropped up in Hillsborough , which Browning had criticized when Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Buddy Johnson took longer than any other supervisor to buy optical scan technology .
Through bidding , Hillsborough picked a company called Premier Voting Solutions .
Its voting systems are used in 34 states , and about 30 of Florida 's 67 counties .
However , after major computer problems cropped up during Ohio's March elections , the manufacturer acknowledged last week that its software contains a critical programming error .
Because of the error , votes can be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards .
As a result , the company sent out a nationwide customer alert with recommended actions to deal with the problem .
An hour after the polls closed in Hillsborough , Johnson told reporters that his vote counting system had developed a computer problem that was preventing it from posting the tallies electronically — and he blamed Premier Voting Solutions .
" I have n't been able to get a straight answer from Premier , but I will by the end of the night , " he said .
" I expect them to fix this issue .
We 've paid a lot of money .
My staff has done a great job . ''
Johnson said other counties were having similar problems , but [ Secretary of State Kurt ]
Browning 's staff said no other counties statewide had reported a similar glitch .
Still , Johnson insisted the problem did n't lie with his office .
However , Florida Today reports that Brevard County had problems with their Diebold voting machines and this problem is recurring ...
A glitch with touch - screen voting machines in about 50 precincts has slowed election returns tonight , leaving the county with only about 58 percent of precincts for more than hour .
The results are now almost all in after a lengthy delay .
The problem --- that the touch - screen machines failed to transmit data by modem to the elections office --- is one that the supervisor of elections office has been aware of for some time .
It has cropped up in past elections .
With the data unable to be transmitted back by those machines , the " votes " had to be trucked back to the elections office in Viera .
Elections officials said the last of the trucks arrived around 10:30 p.m. and results were being finalized just before 11 p.m .
What is important about this inability to modem results from the polling places ( this same problem was reported from around the state ) is that some Florida election officials tried to minimize the affect of the Diebold admission that their GEMS tabulation system may lose votes by pointing to the fact that they modem results from the polls so they do n't have to read directly from memory cards into GEMS .
It appears that another known problem exists on the Diebold system in Florida and nothing is done about it except to ignore it and make excuses when it affects tabulation and reporting .
Beer guys should n’t date girls .
The party was out of my league .
For the champagne girl , it was likely beneath her .
Even though I knew this , I still approached her and struck up a conversation .
In retrospect , I should have seen the car wreck coming 100 miles away , but there is something about beer guys like me not being able to resist champagne girls .
I left with her phone number and a date for the next week .
The problem with dating a champagne girl is that I always feel that I have to move up to her level , but since that level is usually way out of my financial league , I pretend by moving up a few levels closer than where I really am .
This just makes the disaster all the more complete because I assume that since I ’ve made an effort , the champagne girl will also make the effort and meet me half way and lower her level .
It never happens .
Champagne girls do n’t compromise like that .
I should have just taken her to the local Chilis .
She would have hated it , but she would have hated it for a whole lot less money .
Instead , I picked a nice restaurant several levels above where I would normally go to .
It was obvious that she was n’t impressed with my restaurant choice from the start .
I saw the signs , and I should have just called it off right then and there .
Instead , we ordered .
She picked the most expensive appetizer to be followed by the most expensive entree on the menu .
She crinkled her face when I ordered a wine that did n’t come to three figures even though it was worth enough cases of beer to last me several months .
When the appetizer arrived , she did n’t touch it .
She continued with smalltalk and I noticed that she had n’t touched her wine as well .
When the waiter arrived with the main dish to see the appetizer had n’t been touched , you could see the look of concern on his face :
“ Is everything all right ? ” he questioned .
“ Yes , perfect , ” she smiled .
“ I ’m finished , thank you , ” and handed him the untouched plate to take back and throw away .
The main meal progressed the same way .
She chatted lightly but the food never left the plate .
The waiter raised his eyebrow again at the untouched plate .
“ Is there something wrong with the meal ? ” he questioned again .
“ No , everything was wonderful .
I ’m finished , thank you , ” she said indicating he could take her plate away .
That ’s when I could n’t hold it back any longer and said , “ could you please wrap the meal so we can take it home . ”
You would have thought I was clubbing baby seals right in front of her from the look she shot at me .
“ No , there is no need for that , ” she said back to the waiter .
“ Yes , there is a need for that , ” I said .
“ We ’d like it to go . ”
Her look indicated that I was not only clubbing baby seals , but also chopping off the feet of baby bunny rabbits to make good luck charms .
“ No , that really wo n’t be necessary , ” she said in a firm voice .
“ Oh , yes it will be , ” I replied .
“ If she does n’t want it , then I will eat it .
Thank you . ”
As the waiter left , champagne girl was not at all happy with me .
“ That was my meal .
If you insist on taking that meal out of this restaurant , then this date is over , ” she stated as if this was even an issue at this point .
“ I think that has already been well established , ” I said .
When the waiter returned with the meal , champagne girl said she wanted to be taken home right away .
“ You can leave anytime you want .
I ’m sure the front desk can get you a taxi . ”
Champagne girl stuttered .
“ But I do n’t have any money on me . ”
I pushed her wrapped meal in front of her .
“ Well , then you may want to eat this so you have enough energy to walk home ” I said and left .
I later learned that I failed the champagne girl money test .
Apparently , one way that champagne girls determine whether you have enough money to date them is to order the most expensive meal on the menu and not touch it .
If the guy makes any mention about it , then he does n’t have enough money to date them .
Lesson learned .
Over the years , I ’ve learned that I ’m a beer guy and realizing that has saved me a ton of money .
I ’d love to be suave and have a ton of money so that I could sweep champagne girls off their feet , but I know that even if I do become wealthy in the future , I ’ll still be a beer guy .
It took a long time , but I ’ve realized trying to be something I ’m not is a great way for me to spend a lot of money achieving nothing .
I can accept who I am even if it is n’t the perfect TV image I ’d like and this has allowed me to conquer one of the most expensive habits that I ever had — trying to make myself appear better in other people ’s eyes than I really am .
Now if you know a champagne girl that enjoys BBQ wings and beer , let me know so I can get her my number .
Beer Guy is finally getting his finances in order after spending far too much money chasing champagne girls over the last few years .

Ludwig von Mises ’s Socialism is the most important critical examination of socialism ever written .
Socialism is most famous for Mises ’s penetrating economic calculation argument .
The book contains much more however .
Mises not only shows the impossibility of socialism : he defends capitalism against the main arguments socialists and other critics have raised against it .
A centrally planned system cannot substitute some other form of economic calculation for market prices , because no such alternative exists .
Capitalism is true economic democracy .
Socialism addresses the contemporary issues of economic inequality and argues that wealth can exist for long periods only to the extent that wealthy producers succeed in satisfying the consumers .
Mises shows that there is no tendency to monopoly in a free market system .
Mises analyzes reform measures , such as social security and labor legislation , which in fact serve to impede the efforts of the capitalist system to serve the masses .
Socialism is a veritable encyclopedia of vital topics in the social sciences , all analyzed with Mises ’s unique combination of historical erudition and penetrating insight .
Democracy 's self - destruct mechanism has been activated !
And the computer voice - which sounds like the drone of a thousand cable news anchors - is counting down to the end of our precious system of government .
As the information age and the hypermedia explosion turn democracy into a crazy spin game , it 's increasingly likely we 'll need to look at other models of allocating our dwindling resources .
So it 's a good thing science fiction offers us a number of alternative models for future government .
Advertisement
Science fiction is n't particularly positive when it comes to democracy .
Democratic governments are too quick to rush into stupid wars and give power to despots , like Senator Jar Jar in the Star Wars prequels .
Doctor
Who shows some mob uprisings in a happy light on occasion , but also lampoons democracy as a system that forces politicians to pander to the people , or else get electrocuted , in " Vengeance On Varos . "
Winston Churchill famously said democracy is the worst system of government - apart from all the others that 've been tried .
But Winnie
The Chill never tried living under a council of artificial intelligences , or a merged mega - consciousness .
Here are some ideas for a post - democratic form of government from science fiction :
Advertisement
Let the artificial intelligences call some of the shots .
Considering that our voting machines may already be choosing our candidates for us , it may just make sense to let truly independent AIs run the show instead .
We 'll see how long farm subsidies , corporate welfare and earmarks last when you have a system of AI control in place .
Maybe the most famous example of government - by - AI is Iain M. Banks ' " Culture " novels , in which the artificial " Minds " govern without corruption or undue favor .
They 're not entirely impartial , because they appear to have whims and idiosyncrasies in some of his books .
But the main criticism people have leveled at them is that they 're " too good . "
In place of laws , people in the Culture are governed by reputation and good manners , and even the Minds can gain or lose reputation according to their behavior .
Only the best Minds get to be Hub Minds , controlling whole biospheres themselves .
The novels of Isaac Asimov also often depict a " robocracy " ruled by machines or computers .
Give the keys to the White House to a merged consciousness .
In Peter F. Hamilton 's Night 's Dawn trilogy , the Edenists live in peace on space stations orbiting gas giants .
Their secret of harmonious living : " Affinity , " a form of telepathy where everybody is linked .
All Edenists join together to create a government in a process known as " Consensus , " where they link all their minds together .
When an Edenist gets old , he / she can back up his / her consciousness and live on for hundreds more years inside the habitat , before gradually becoming submerged into the habitat 's shared consciousness .
Try techno - democracy , with a system of distributed government .
In Tobias Buckell 's new novel Sly Mongoose , we discover that the inhabitants of the planet Chilo use brain implants to allow a large cross-section of their populations to control their representatives directly .
" There are three hundred thousand people from a variety of Aeolian cities voting on my every word because I 'm their avatar , emissary , diplomat , or whatever you would like to call me , " says Katerina .
She signed up for this duty when she became a citizen , and was randomly selected .
She has all of their voices " sitting behind her skull , " and if she does n't do a good job , she could be fined , exiled , or lose her citizenship .
Just imagine if you could vote on every word that comes out of George W. Bush 's mouth !
Give the techno - hippie / green / feminist socialist utopia a chance .
In novels like A Door Into Ocean by Joan Slonczewski and Woman At The Edge Of Time by Marge Piercy , everybody lives in harmony and everything is decided by the collective .
In Ocean , the underwater happy lesbians are actually called the Sharers of Shora , and they share everything together .
They live on rafts , or in the water , and use the verb " share " as much as possible .
In the utopian future of Edge Of Time , everything is communal and people live in small towns that are " own - fed " ( self - sustaining ) and peaceful .
Men breast - feed and everybody lives according to rituals and customs .
And then there 's the happy future of Star Trek and especially The Next Generation .
Want and deprivation have been eliminated , nobody owns anything , and everything is peaceful and mellow unless Deforest Kelley is yelling in your ear .
Thanks to inventions like the replicator ( and an apparently inexhaustible supply of energy ) the citizens of the Federation can make anything they want .
And though we only get hints here and there about the government of the Federation , it 's clearly not a democracy - there 's never any mention of voting , and we see the Federation Council and President making decisions in a somewhat unilateral fashion .
Or try anarchism .
There are a few examples of functioning anarchist societies in science fiction .
In Ursula K. LeGuin's
The Dispossessed , for example , the anarchist followers of Odo split off from the mainstream society and form their own quasi-anarchist society .
In theory , there are no laws on Anarres , and you can do whatever you want with your time .
The main constraint is that you need to be able to work with others and gain their support in order to have access to the scarce resources on the planet .
There 's no property , so everything is shared , but our hero
Shevek discovers over the course of the novel that there are still structures of authority , and you still have to kiss the ass of the man .
And then there 's The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein , his main venture into anarchism .
The lunar citizens have no written laws , and no way of enforcing contracts except based on someone 's reputation .
As one of Heinlein 's mouthpieces says :
We do n't have laws .
Never been allowed to .
Have customs , but are n't written and are n't enforced — or could say they are self - enforcing because [ they ] are simply way things have to be , conditions being what they are .
Could say our customs are natural laws because the way people have to behave to stay alive .

Virtual reality ( VR ) user interfaces are currently more difficult for users to manipulate than a traditional GUI , partly because of more degrees of freedom and partly because VR is still new , so people have less experience using it .
Advice for how to employ usability studies to alleviate this problem .
A scientist with a brain scanner could figure out your sexual orientation based on the symmetry of your brain , new research from the Stockholm Brain Institute hints .
The findings support the notion that biological factors help determine sexual orientation and leave a specific neuroanatomical signature .
Using MRI scans of gay and straight men and women , the researchers found that people who liked women – heterosexual men and homosexual women – had larger right brain hemispheres , while people who liked men – heterosexual women and homosexual men – had symmetrical brains .
As seen in the image , MRI and PET scans showed a similar pattern in two specific regions of the brain , the right and left amygdalas , which are thought to control fight - or - flight reactions .
" The results can not be primarily ascribed to learned effects , and they suggest a linkage to neurobiological entities , " the researchers , led by Ivanka Savic , write in a paper that will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences tomorrow .
Scientists have long tried to determine if sexual orientation is biologically determined , and if so , how .
This research has been contentious in and outside the gay community .
At stake is whether homosexuality is a choice or biologically inevitable .
The groundbreaking work in the field of biological difference came from Simon LeVay , a self - identified gay neuroscientist , who found similarities in the brains of straight women and gay men in the early 90s .
LeVay has his detractors , but recent studies seem to back his early research .
Pink News , billed as Europe 's largest gay news service , cut straight to the chase about the implications of recent studies that have found measurable differences in the biology of men and women with different sexual orientations .
" These studies imply that the brains of the gay men have functional similarities to those of a straight woman , and that homosexuality is not of a moral choice , but one of biological substrate , " wrote Jane Rochstad Lim .
While the research is suggestive , it does not address how such brain differences come to be , although the researchers noted that there could be genetic , environmental and / or sex hormonal factors .

The steeply declining number of whales in the world 's oceans is causing the remaining creatures to suffer loneliness and ' lose the will the live ' , a leading expert has claimed .
The psychological impact of over - hunting on the highly intelligent and sociable animals has been identified as the latest threat to the survival of the species .
The whale population has already fallen dramatically over the past few centuries because to culling by Japan , Norway and Iceland , and the poisoning of oceans which kills off their food .
Whales could be extinct within decades
But now a French scientist has said the majestic mammals - which can reach 80ft in length and weigh the same as a passenger jet - could also suffer from heartbreak .
Paris naturalist Yves Paccalet said : ' It may be that these intelligent animals are so exhausted from their combat with humankind that they have simply have given up the fight .
' And the psychological consequences of our aggression have compromised their will to live . '
Paccalet , who worked with French marine explorer Jacques - Yves Cousteau , added : ' To reproduce , whales need a large number of individuals to ensure that they meet , frolic and excite each other .
' Otherwise , the species may give in to a kind of sexual melancholy and simply stop breeding .'
Despite an international moratorium on whale hunting in 1986 , Japan , Norway and Iceland continue to cull more than 2,000 a year for their meat and oil .
Some species like the North Pacific and North Atlantic whales have been reduced to just a few hundred survivors , and could be extinct within decades .
Over hunting is causing social problems which mean whales could stop breeding
Even species counted in the thousands and expanding each year by up to ten per cent would need many years of uninterrupted breeding to regain their original numbers , scientists say .
Blue whales have recovered from a low of 400 in the 1970s to around 2,200 today , but that is believed to be only one per cent of their numbers 500 years ago .
A 2007 study by the Iceland Marine Research Institute revealed a ' significant decrease ' in the population of minke whales since 2001 .
Japan and Norway killed more than 1,600 minke in 2007 .
Regina Asmutis - Silvia , senior biologist at the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society , said commercial hunting was not the only threat to their survival .
' It is a mistake to factor out the single issue of hunting .
You need to look at the cumulative impact of vessel strikes , entanglements in fishing nets , pollution , destruction of habitat and acoustic disturbances .
' Climate change is also looming as a danger , and acidification of the oceans driven by global warming could also sharply reduce the number of krill , which are the mainstay of the whale diet .
' Their situation is very critical .
It could go either way , " she said .
Respresentatives from pro-whaling and pro-conservation groups will come face to face at the International Whaling Commission 's annual meeting this week to discuss how to save the species from extinction .

Spain 's northeastern city of Barcelona , set between verdant mountains and the Mediterranean Sea , basks in a well - earned reputation as one of Europe 's most popular tourist destinations .
With a dramatic rocky coastline cradling little fishing ports to the north and almost endless sandy beaches stretching to the south , the capital of the Catalan region has acted as a powerful tourist magnet since the late 1950s .
Around 59.2 million foreign visitors last year made Spain the world 's second most visited holiday destination , a position - behind France and ahead of the United States - it has held consistently for decades .
Thanks to its setting and the beauty of Catalonia , its coasts and offshore islands , millions of tourists explore Barcelona annually .
Once there , it is easy to understand why .
Rising majestically behind the city is the Tibidabo , an imposing pine tree - coated hill that frames the metropolis , its urban sprawl and vast port beside a glittering sea .
" Tibi dabo " is Latin for " I give thee , " which according to the Gospels of Luke and Matthew is what the devil said , offering Christ the glories of the world were he but to kneel and worship him .
The inference is that Barcelona , nestled beneath the Tibidabo , encompasses all known earthly delights .
With so many visitors competing to enjoy the cornucopia of pleasures on offer , it is understandably difficult to do so on a tight budget .
However , some tricks can help you get the most out of your cash .
Step one is to learn how to get around cheaply .
The city is compact and exceptionally pedestrian - friendly , turning walks anywhere other than to its outer limits into a pleasure , packed with visual and cultural stimulus .
To venture farther out it is important to buy a 10 - trip card from any metro railway station .
This entitles you to take city buses as well as underground trains ; it works out to about a dollar per trip .
In Barcelona you do not need to travel to the outskirts to find inexpensive accommodations and food .
Hostels in the Ciutat Vella , the old quarter deep in the heart of the city , are reasonably priced .
( Look for Ciutat Vella locations for hostels listed at links.sfgate.com/ZEUO. )
By contrast , distant campsites dotted around the suburbs can be more expensive than downtown " pensiones " and modest hotels .
It is prudent to follow Spanish food customs to get the best gastronomic deals .
Bars and coffee houses offer set breakfasts ( desayuno del dia ) , which include coffee and toast or an equivalent at a fixed price that 's lower than ordering each item separately .
The best breakfasts are to be found in Barcelona 's 46 markets , of which La Boqueria , just west of La Rambla , near the port , is the best example - www.boqueria.info.
One market stall there has some of the best fruit juices available anywhere in Spain , and prices are reasonable .
The most important meal of the day in Spain is lunch .
The best deals are listed at midday as the menu del dia or special menu of the day .
This will usually be a three - course meal including dessert and a drink at a bargain price .
When walking around the city , make sure you go in search of the works of local architect Antoni Gaudí .
His Pedrera and Casa Batllo - www.casabatllo.es- are works of art in a category called Modernisme , which is like a mix between Art Nouveau and Art Deco .
Gaudí's work is showcased in this year 's Woody Allen movie " Vicky Cristina Barcelona . "
The Barcelona Movie Web site - www.barcelonamovie.com(click on " English " ) - offers themed walking itineraries related to other films shot in the city , including work by Pedro Almodovar .
The site correctly calls itself " a space created for anyone interested in Barcelona , film and cultural tourism . "
Take in the Mirador de l'Alcalde and walk around Montjuic Castle to catch sight of the port working below , and make sure you see the Montjuic cemetery in evening light .
When your feet get tired , take a tram ride from the zoo to the Forum area .
This offers excellent views of the Agbar Tower and Gaudí 's Sagrada Familia church .
At sunset there is no better place to be than along Barcelona 's waterfront , which boasts two marinas full of private sailing boats and luxury yachts as well as clean sandy beaches .
The first Sunday of every month is a no-pay day at city museums , and Barcelona also has one of the most ambitious public art projects in Europe with sculptures by artists such as Javier Mariscal or Roy Lichtenstein dotted around town .
People - watching along La Rambla is more entertaining than many of the things you have to pay for , and catching a glimpse of locals dancing sardana on Sunday morning in front of the cathedral in the medieval heart of the city is unforgettable .

With that said , let ’s get down to business .
Over the past year , we 've had a funny sort of relationship , you and I .
When I first moved into the place , it was rather peaceful .
It was an exciting time in my life , as it was the first time I would be living by myself .
Then came the day that I first heard it .
What did I hear you ask ?
It was sound of your hooves galloping across the hardwood floors of your living room .
At the time I thought , “ No big deal , surely it ca n’t always be like this . ”
Oh was I wrong .
It turned out that every time I was at home , you would be up there , stomping around , like the wild lady - beast that you are .
After a few weeks , I determined through a process of elimination , that you are in fact , a Minotaur .
It only makes sense .
FACT .
Minotaurs have hooves , and that ’s sure as hell what it sounds like is hitting the floor when you gallop around .
FACT .
A Minotaur posses great strength , the kind of strength that can be felt by a guy laying on his couch , trying to get into a good book .
The kind of strength that shakes the dishes in his cupboards .
The kind of strength that can wake a guy out of a dead sleep , EVERY FRICKIN MORNING .
I did n’t even need to set an alarm clock to wake up in the morning .
Instead I wake up to THUMP THUMP THUMP .
THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP .
THUMP THUMP THUMP .
I ’m not a light sleeper by any means ; I sleep right through the viscously loud police , fire truck , and ambulance sirens every night .
I was lying there one morning , frustrated , counting the trips you took between your bedroom and your bathroom .
17 . 17 god forsaken trips between the bedroom and the bathroom .
Really ?
Are you kidding me ?
What could you possibly be doing ?
FACT .
Minotaurs are half bull .
Bulls are aggressive when taunted .
Apparently , the time I went upstairs , politely introduced myself , and asked you rather nicely to please quit stomping around , was a taunt .
That ’s when you got aggressive .
You called the landlord and told him that I was complaining about your noise .
When he told me about this , he said his response to your complaint was , “ Quit making so much noise then . ”
Brilliant .
Go Mr. Landlord !
I tried keeping him out of this , but you felt it important to drag him into it .
After a few more weeks of you recklessly stomping around , I made another attempt at a civil confrontation .
It failed .
It failed because you stomped your way to the door , and you did n’t open it when you saw who was standing there .
I know this because I heard your hooves clippity - clop their way to the door .
Way to avoid confrontation .
To my surprise , the stomping ceased the next day , and I awoke to peace .
“ Amazing , ” I thought , “ It must be a midsummer miracle ! ! ”
A few days passed , and I ran into my landlord in the entry way .
He mentioned that he received another angry phone call from you .
Said that you felt threatened by my confrontations , said I scared you .
Strange , since not once did I ever raise my voice or try to be anything but civil .
He then mentioned that he told you to buy some slippers to wear around your apartment .
Genius !
It freakin worked !!
Hell yea , Mr Landlord !
High five !
Fast forward 11 months .
The stomping has returned .
No doubt in my mind the hooves have worn through the delicate fabrics of the slippers and are now , once again , banging against your hardwood floors .
Please , for the love of sweet baby jesus , run down to the local Target and purchase yourself another pair of hoof mufflers .
I know you can run with those strong legs of yours , probably real fast like !
Target downtown is all of 10 blocks away .
Go Minotaur , go !
Overcome the odds , society is watching !

The Electoral Vote site has an excellent analysis on whether governmental experience is any predictor of how good a president will be .
For example , James Buchannan was the most experienced person ever elected president , but he is considered to be one of the worst ( only slightly edged out by Warren G. Harding for that “ honor ” ) .
Or take Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who had little experience but who are considered to have been very good presidents .
Their conclusion —
“ There does not appear to be any relation between experience and greatness ” .
Reissued after a quarter of a century , M.L. Ryder 's Sheep and Man remains the only comprehensive treatment of its topic : it contains material not found elsewhere , but also brings together information that is otherwise segregated in regional or specialised studies .
Sheep have been and continue to be key components of economies , ecologies , and societies — and no other in depth global perspective on this exists .
Part one begins with some biology .
Ryder does n't delve into anatomy or veterinary science here , but focuses on key features relevant to the interaction of sheep with humans , and on their domestication and spread .
He continues with a survey of sheep in the " ancient civilisations " and in early medieval Europe and Islam .
Taking up over half the volume , part two is a geographically organised survey of sheep - rearing from medieval times to the present .
To give an idea of its reach , it includes three pages on Iceland , three and a half on Mongolia , and five on New Zealand — and fifteen pages on Scotland and nearly thirty on Australia .
" The sheep is the most important livestock species in Iran ; yet numbers decreased from 40 to 20 million in the twenty years before the Second World War , largely as a result of ill - advised attempts to settle nomadic tribes .
Although the sheep population halved again during the war , it had reached 35 million in 1975 , 95 per cent of which are of fat - tailed type .
The use of dung as fuel has been detrimental to the cultivation of crops .
Sheep and goats provide all the wool for the carpet industry , 65 per cent of the meat , and 40 per cent of the milk products , milk being the most important product to the sheep owner .
The animals grow slowly , and great prestige is attached to large numbers , so they are killed at a relatively great age . "
Part three covers the mechanics of the association between sheep and man , with chapters on sheep husbandry , sheep products , and the distribution and likely future of sheep breeds .
" The term sheepfold covers a variety of enclosures for different purposes .
The most ancient type was an enclosure in which the flock was kept at night .
In sedentary flocks the fold could be a permanent stone structure , and on archaeological sites of all periods throughout the world unexplained stone enclosures are frequently described as animal pens particularly when circular or oval .
Evidence for such a use is rarely conclusive and further confusion is caused by the fact that human hut circles may have been used for livestock at a later date .
Such enclosures are also used as lambing pens . "
There are plenty of connections to broader history and economics and society , and much of the detail is fascinating .
But the mass of detail can also be overwhelming .
" The nomadic Toposa tribe of south - east Sudan keep a fat - rumped sheep that is similar to the Somali , except for the lack of a black head , and the presence of horns in the ram .
The hair coat is white with black or brown spots , and some animals are roan owing to a mixture of brown fibres .
The tail varies in size and shape from fat - rumped to fat - tailed type , indeed McLeroy ( 1961 ) regarded the Toposa as a modified fat - tail in which the tail is S - shaped . "
Ryder is reliant on secondary sources for much of his information , and his inclusiveness here sometimes leads him astray .
Occasional assertions are just confused — " the Mongolians were the originators of shamanism " — while others are relayed without any kind of evaluation — " Krist ( 1939 ) refers to felt blankets , and confirms that scorpions never walk on felt " .
Sheep and Man obviously does n't cover the events of the last quarter - century .
Apart from that , the biggest change has come with far more extensive use of molecular sequence analysis .
Most of this , however , has involved elaboration of the relationships between local sheep breeds , and the overall picture Ryder presents has not been radically updated .
Sheep and Man is extensively illustrated with halftones .
These cover artifacts , art , landscapes and architecture as well as different breeds of sheep , and draw on reproductions of older illustrations as well as photographs .
Some maps and diagrams are included .
An essential reference for anyone studying the history of sheep , Sheep and Man is also worthwhile browsing for general readers with a broad interest in human history .

Researchers from Harvard Medical School and Brandeis University have successfully completed a full - genome RNAi screen in neurons , showing what types of genes are necessary for brain development .
Recent advances in genomics , such as the sequencing of entire genomes and the discovery of RNA - interference as a means of testing the effects of gene loss , have opened up the possibility to systematically analyze the function of all known and predicted genes in an organism .
Until now , this type of functional genomics approach has not been applied to the study of very complex cells , such as the brain 's neurons , on a full - genome scale .
Dr. Katharine Sepp and her fellow researchers took fresh neuronal cells extracted from embryos of the fruit fly genus Drosophila and screened them using RNA interference techniques .
The team tested all genes , one by one in a rapid manner , for their potential role in neuronal development .
The team then validated the method in mice .
A combination of live - cell imaging and quantitative analysis allowed Sepp et al to characterize neurons ' morphological phenotypes in response to RNAi - mediated gene knockdown .
The researchers focused on 104 evolutionary conserved genes that , when downregulated by RNAi , have morphological defects .
The team developed algorithms to help streamline the analysis of the thousands of images created in the process .
The analysis revealed unexpected , essential roles in neurite outgrowth for genes representing a wide range of functional categories including signaling molecules , enzymes , channels , receptors , and cytoskeletal proteins .
Results also determined that genes known to be involved in protein and vesicle trafficking show similar RNAi phenotypes .
The researchers believe that this study provides an effective method for future studies of a large variety of genes , including those with important functions in the nervous system .
In a TV game show , pretty contestants were not better or more cooperative players , but other contestants seemed to act as if they were :
It ’s an uncomfortable truth that beautiful people make more money .
…
Now a study of a TV game show supports the prejudice hypothesis .
… V. Bhaskar … analysed 69 episodes of Shafted …
At the end of a round , the highest - scoring player picks a contestant to eliminate .
Although the least attractive players scored no worse in the show than others , they were twice as likely to be eliminated in the first round .
The contestants did not seem to base their decision on other factors such as age or sex . …
Contestants also confused attractiveness with cooperativeness .
In the final round of Shafted , the last two players vie for an accumulated pot of money .
Each player must opt to share the prize or attempt to grab it all for themselves .
If one player opts to grab while one opts to share , the grabber takes the lot .
If both try to grab , they both leave empty - handed , so game theory dictates that the leading contestant should pick a fellow finalist who is likely to cooperate .
Even though attractiveness was found to have no bearing on cooperativeness , the leader often elected to play the final round with the most attractive of their remaining rivals .
In 13 shows , these looks - based decisions even overrode a simple imperative to choose their highest - scoring rival , which would have led to an increases in the ultimate prize fund .
In these cases , the prize was E350 lower than it could have been , on average .

Denouement ( n ) —
The unraveling of a plot ; a catastrophe … .
From Webster ’s Unabridged Dictionary ( 1913 )
Hail comrades well met :
In this famous 1911 editorial cartoon , Karl Marx is rapturously greeted on Wall Street and taken to the bosom of Carnegie and Rockefeller .
This tidily sums up the relationship between Wall Street corporate socialists and the non-housebroken Marxist revolutionaries who are their distant kin .
There is something supernally appropriate to the fact that , in order to find the most suitable definition for just right word to describe the ongoing crisis of the financial system , we have to refer to a dictionary published in 1913 .
We are now into the second year of the unraveling of the world financial system .
It could be described as the Great Denouement ( or final act ) of a plot that began in 1913 , when Congress created the Federal Reserve System , aka the Focus of Evil in the Modern World .
So far the effects of the unraveling have had minimal impact on the larger economy .
This is about to change .
Last Friday , there were five globe - bestriding Wall Street investment banks .
Today there are three .
Lehman Brothers , a 158 - year - old financial colossus , is headed for bankruptcy and oblivion .
Merrill Lynch , which was following the same trajectory , was bought by Bank of America .
Tellingly , the markets greeted that acquisition by selling off Bank of America shares , despite CEO Ken Lewis ’s happy prattle about the " synergies " supposedly catalyzed by this buy - out .
Likwise , the bank ’s credit rating took a hit following the transaction .
This is exactly the opposite of what we would expect to see when one business demonstrates its vitality by purchasing another .
In this case , however , it is well understood that BofA was n’t gaining assets , but rather taking on an infection .
Over the same cluttered weekend , American International Group , which insures ( among other things ) corporate bonds , played the mendicant at the Fed ’s discount window , pleading for $ 40 billion in tide - us - over money while it tries to liquidate assets in order to raise cash .
[ For more about AIG , see the update below . ]
While we ’re accustomed to weekly bank failures and periodic federal bailouts , the converging meltdowns of three pillars of Wall Street in a single weekend indicates that the crisis is accelerating and deepening in ways that our financial overlords had n’t anticipated .
The fact that Lehman was permitted to fail demonstrates that the overlords are now beginning to conduct triage among themselves — a spectacle that might offer the some brief amusement for the hoi polloi until the survivors within the Power Elite turn their undivided attention on the rest of us .
It ’s likely that some distant day , when the history of the Greater Depression is written , the collapse of Lehman Brothers will be seen as a climacteric for the Fed-centric financial system — indeed , for Washington ’s entire apparatus of imperial power , in which that investment house played a conspicuous role .
Mapping the catastrophe ( click to enlarge ) .
During the mid-1800s , Lehman provided much of the initial financing for the railroad combine , one of the first serious ventures in American corporatism .
That combine , a public - private partnership — a prototype for what Mussolini later called Fascism — thrust Abraham the Abhorrent into the White House , where he presided over a war of national consolidation and pioneered the concept of a dictatorial war presidency .
Following the destruction of the pre-1861 Union of free states and creating a unitary Corporate State , the combine engaged the services of the United States military to drive the Plains Indians from lands pledged to them by treaty , but also coveted by the combine to build its federally subsidized transcontinental railroad .
This relationship was a distant but recognizable ancestor of the modern military - industrial complex .
Lehman was part of the cartel that pushed for creation of the Fed .
Its roster of corporate leaders bristles with insider credentials ; senior management officials held prestigious posts on the Federal Reserve Board , in the World Economic Forum , and in the Council on Foreign Relations .
And yet the firm is now bound for bankruptcy , a casualty of the Fed ’s housing / mortgage / refinancing bubble .
Pulling the plug on Lehman Brothers may be equivalent to the sharp tug on a dangling thread that causes the entire tapestry to unwind .
Unlike the bailout of Bear Stearns earlier this year , no takers could be found when Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke tried to find a buyer for Lehman Brothers .
Would - be buyers were repelled by the aroma of Lehman ’s assets , which was quite similar to that emitted by an artificial butte constructed out of not - so - gently - used disposable diapers .
When it became clear that no rescue could be arranged for Lehman , the bankster mafia did the next best thing :
It opened the markets — just a crack — to let a handful of favored investors minimize their losses .
The manipulation was as undisguised as the contempt the banksters feel for the torpid and indifferent public that is being plundered on behalf of the financial elite .
Lehman CEO Richard Fuld , known as " The Gorrilla " because of his penchant for alpha male - style posturing , was able to keep the firm intact during the last big scare , the Asian debt crisis of a decade ago .
Learning exactly the wrong lessons as a result of that corporate near - death - through - debt experience , Fuld threw his company into issuing and securitizing mortgage loans .
During the last two years , long after rational people had sought protection from the bursting of the housing / mortgage bubble , Lehman was the nation ’s largest underwriter of mortgage bonds .
Last March , by which time Fuld must have been fully aware of his bank ’s afflictions , he accepted a $ 22 million performance bonus , based on a supposed net profit of 5 percent in 2007 .
Surely there are people just as qualified as Fuld to lead a company to immediate ruin who would have done so for less than one percent of what Lehman paid Fuld .
The bank ’s Chapter 11 filing lists $ 613 billion in debts .
This is not only the largest private bankruptcy in history , it must also rank as the largest act of non-governmental accounting fraud on record .
A few weeks later — April 15 , to be exact —
Fuld inscribed his name indelibly in the Big Book of Hubristic Quotations when he told shareholders that " the worst is behind us . "
As recently as August , Fuld could have taken advantage of buy - out or buy - in offers that would have rescued his firm .
But the CEO , looking at his company ’s worth through the distorting lens of bubble - vision , insisted that the offers " did n’t reflect the value he saw in the bank , " according to the New York Times .
So he dithered and dissimulated until it was much too late , perhaps in the misplaced confidence that his comrades in the financial elite would seal a deal with a taxpayer guarantee .
Rather than giving him that cushion , however , his fellow elitists pulled the chair out from beneath him .
Given the Fed ’s new role as " lender of last resort , " why did it permit Lehman to fail ?
It may be simply a matter of bad timing : Had Lehman ’s terminal crisis occurred two months ago , the Fed and Treasury might have been willing to arrange another taxpayer - insured bailout .
But right now the overlords have their hands full managing the nationalization of Fannie and Freddie , which may require trillions of dollars yet to be created .
Even Helicopter
Ben must appreciate the point that the foreign creditors who continue to fund this racket are eventually going to stop taking dollar - shaped IOUs .
That ’s when the real fun will begin .
The Bailout Resumes ….
AIG , valued at $ 1 trillion at the beginning of the trading day , " lost 70 % of its value in just three hours , " reports the New York Daily News .
Its stock recovered about half its losses by mid-afternoon .
Meanwhile , the Governor of New York announced that he was altering state regulations — apparently by executive decree — to permit AIG " to borrow against its subsidiary assets . "
Ten of the largest American banks have announced a plan to pool $ 70 billion " in a collaborative effort to prevent any of them [ from ] running out of funds in an emergency . "
Each has thrown in $ 7 billion , and any can borrow up to $ 23 billion .
That ’s not a " pool " ; it hardly qualifies as a puddle .
And it will be gone before the end of the week .
So , in all probably , will Washington Mutual , which was dangling from a cliff , clinging to an exposed tree root at the end of last week .
Lehman ’s demise will almost certainly send WaMu careening into the abyss .
And there are at least 1,000 more banks headed over the edge , as well ….

There are actually two Mies gas stations in the US , but although he would have been the ideal architect to design a gas station , in both cases they were an afterthought , ancillary to a main project .
We are including the IIT one rather than Nuns island , which although arguably better , was merely signed off by Mies , having been designed largely by someone else in the office ( not that this is unusual in architects offices ) .

Raining on the OpenClip Parade
The OpenClip project , which debuted this week , describes itself as “ a non-profit , open - source , community - effort project , which promotes a framework for the iPhone that allows users to copy / paste between participating applications . ”
The obvious shortcoming , compared to a hypothetical system - wide clipboard from Apple , is that apps which do n’t explicitly support the OpenClip scheme do n’t work with it — including all of Apple ’s apps , like Mail and Safari .
That ’s to be expected .
But it ’s worse than that .
The OpenClip framework , by Zac White , is a very clever implementation of a fundamentally unwise idea .
White ’s description of the project on his own weblog is fairly open regarding its inherent problems .
The OpenClip.org web site , however , is hosted and written not by White but by Proximi , the developers behind MagicPad .
Their developer FAQ states :
How does it work ?
OpenClip utilizes a shared space on the iPhone .
Applications that use the OpenClip framework can access this common area to write to and read from , allowing copy / paste between participating apps .
That struck me as curious , as I was n’t aware of any inter-application “ shared space ” on the iPhone .
White ’s own description of how it works and the OpenClip source code itself show that such a description is disingenuous .
The “ How does it work ? ” section of their regular ( i.e. non-developer ) FAQ is more technically accurate :
OpenClip utilizes an application ’s ability to read into other application ’s Documents directory .
Applications that use the OpenClip framework can access this read only area to read pastes from other applications and then OpenClip can offer the newest data to the current application .
The fundamental problem the OpenClip project faces is that of data interchange .
If you copy something in app A , and wish to paste it in app B , the clipboard data needs to exist somewhere where app A can write ( when you copy ) , and where B can read ( when you paste ) .
On Mac OS X , the system provides this to Cocoa apps via the NSPasteboard class and associated APIs .
Individual applications do n’t have to worry about the details of how and where clipboard data is stored ; it ’s an implementation detail completely managed by the system .
But even ignoring Mac OS X ’s standard system - wide clipboard , apps on the Mac face no challenges when it comes to exchanging data with other apps via the file system .
On the Mac , all apps can read and write wherever they want within your entire home folder .
So if Mac apps A and B wish to share data with each other via a custom file format , they can both agree to do so via a shared file , in , say , the user ’s Documents folder .
i Phone apps ca n’t do that .
Or , more specifically , third - party iPhone apps written with the official iPhone SDK can’t do that ;
Apple ’s own iPhone apps can do whatever they want .
i Phone Sandboxing
The idea with sandboxing is that each app executes in its own space , with limited resources and with no ability to alter or modify anything outside its own sandbox .
The downside is that some of the things Mac apps can do but which iPhone apps cannot are potentially very useful ( and / or very cool ) .
The upside is that those same things are potentially dangerous ( both in terms of security and in terms of stability ) .
It ’s a trade - off .
Here ’s how sandboxing works in iPhone OS 2.0 .
Given its shared roots with Mac OS X , the iPhone OS unsurprisingly has a very familiar file system layout .
The system ’s standard apps reside in a top - level folder named / Applications / , just like on Mac OS X .
Apps that you install via the App Store do n’t go there , however .
Instead , there is a separate Applications folder for these applications .
In iPhone OS 2.0 , that folder is at / private / var / mobile / Applications / , but it does n’t really matter exactly where it is .
( / private / var / mobile / is more or less the iPhone equivalent of your home folder . )
Every time you install an application , a new sandbox is created within that Applications folder .
The sandbox is a folder named with a UUID , for example , “ 68813987-A628-493F-90E2-A6ABCD922A89 ” .
The application itself is installed inside the sandbox folder , along with its own directories for writing data .
So , if you install two iPhone apps from the App Store , named , say , “ Foo ” and “ Bar ” , they ’ll be installed in two separate sandboxes that look something like this at the file system level :
/ private/var/mobile/Applications/04A74595-4DE8-4026-8459-63B2D153D13C/ Documents / Foo.app/ Library / tmp/ / private/var/mobile/Applications/77C9A482-F5F8-4284-9E16-C629763B9162/
Bar.app/ Documents / Library / tmp/
Each app gets its own Documents folder , its own Library folder , and even its own temporary scratch space ( “ tmp ” ) .
Each application can only write to the file system within its own sandbox directory .
This is n’t just a guideline from Apple — it is enforced by the OS .
Any attempt by an app to write to the file system outside its sandbox will fail .
1
However , in iPhone OS 2.0 , an app can read from anywhere in the file system .
This serves as the basis for how OpenClip works .
How OpenClip Works
As an API , White ’s OCPasteboard class is a clone of Cocoa ’s NSPasteboard .
For every NSwhatever call in the standard Cocoa NSPasteboard class hiearchy , OpenClip offers a corresponding OCwhatever .
The advantage to this design is twofold : first , it ’s exactly what Cocoa developers are accustomed to on the Mac ; second , if Apple eventually ports NSPasteboard to the iPhone OS , it ’s likely to have a very similar API .
When an app using OpenClip copies data , 2 it writes the data into two files within its own Documents folder :
Documents / OpenClip / OCGeneralPboard.data OCGeneralPboard.metadata Foo.app/ Library / tmp/
When an app using OpenClip pastes , the OpenClip framework peeks into the Documents folder of every other app sandbox in the file system , looking for the most recently - modified OpenClip data files .
So if you have three apps , A , B , and C , and you copy something in A , then copy something else in B , then do a paste in C , C will paste the data copied from app B , because it was created more recently .
The Problems
On his weblog , White writes :
How it works is relatively simple and does n’t break the SDK agreement .
OpenClip works by looking into the Documents folder of other applications to get their pastes .
Applications are allowed to write all they want to their own Documents directory ( for copy ) , so no foul there .
Applications are also allowed to read outside their sandbox into the Documents directories for other apps ( for paste ) , so no foul there .
This is not accurate .
It ’s more like “ slipping through a temporary loophole ” than “ no foul ” .
In the Security section of chapter 4 of Apple ’s iPhone OS Programming Guide , the sandbox is described by Apple as follows ( boldface emphasis added ) :
For security reasons , iPhone OS restricts an application and its preferences and data to a unique location in the file system .
This location is part of the security feature known as the application ’s “ sandbox . ”
The sandbox is a set of fine - grained controls limiting access to files , preferences , network resources , hardware , and so on .
In iPhone OS , an application and its data reside in a secure location that no other application can access .
Not simply that no other application can write to , but which no other application can access .
That this restriction is not yet enforced at a technical level ( such as is the case with an app attempting to write outside its own sandbox ) does not mean it ’s permitted .
And , indeed , in the 2.1b4 release of the iPhone OS , it is enforced .
The OpenClip demo apps , which work as advertised on iPhone OS 2.0.2 , do not work in the current 2.1 beta , because apps are no longer able to read or even see other apps ’ sandboxes .
3
To be clear , this change is clearly not in response to OpenClip ; Apple began seeding the 2.1 betas with these tightened sandbox restrictions before OpenClip debuted , and the iPhone OS Programming Guide has stated all along that apps can’t “ access ” the contents of other sandboxes .
There is no “ shared space ” for iPhone apps to exchange data .
( One workaround I ’ve seen bandied about is to use the system - wide Address Book database as a storage location for shared clipboard data .
Needless to say , such an implementation would not qualify as an intended use of the AddressBook framework . )
Wishing it were otherwise does n’t make it so .
The intent of OpenClip is fine .
That there ’s been so much coverage regarding OpenClip in the past 24 hours shows just how much demand there is for inter-application copy - and - paste .
But developers would be foolish to adopt a framework that only works today because of a loophole in iPhone OS 2.0 that is already closed in iPhone OS 2.1 .

Global Cooling Can Carbon Dioxide Be Turned to Concrete ?
Engineers are constantly coming up with new ways to dispose of greenhouse gases .
The latest idea is to hide carbon dioxide exhaust in cement .
The method could revolutionize one of the most carbon - intensive industries in the world .
Some researchers at Northwestern University and University of Illinois have managed to build an eye - like camera that 's actually shaped like an eye .
Sure , that sounds a tad unimpressive , but the real contribution of this project is the idea of electronics on a curved , flexible surface .
The researchers have developed a mesh - like material that carries the photodetectors and electronic components necessary , and they say the resulting camera has a better field of vision than a traditional camera , in addition to conveniently resembling a human eye .
Of course , they 're a long ways away from communicating with the brain well enough to make an actual fully bionic eyeball , but the curved electronics could have other medical -- and regular form factor - busting , we hope -- applications as well .
Not five minute into my 11 - year - old ’s first Xbox Live Halo 3 match with a headset he got called " bitch " .
Then " punk " and then worse .
But he got stuck with it , got better , and now he seems to have managed the rare art of being a confident leader in his matches without demeaning others .
It ’s called sportsmanship .

But that ’s just me justifying my decision to let him play online with a headset .
And the truth is , I do n’t know exactly what he ’s been exposed to , and all the names he ’s been called and words he ’s heard .
I ca n’t listen in ( not because it ’s not technically possible , but because he does n’t want me to and he ’s too old to be babysat while he plays games ) .
And he probably is n’t telling me everything that ’s gone on in his headset , even when I debrief with him after the game .
So I have very mixed feelings about letting an 11 - year - old play with teenagers and adults , most of them strangers , online .
( It ’s usually too hard to coordinate games with just his friends . )
We ’ve trained him on what not to say ( any personally identifying details ) and what to watch out for .
But it ’s really the school of hard knocks in online gameplay , and I wonder whether this is a good lesson in real - world survival skills , or a scarring one .
[ Note that you can easily play Xbox Live without the headset and avoid most of the really personal stuff .
But it ’s not the full experience . ]
What do you think ?
Should an 11 - year - old be allowed to play Xbox Live with a headset ?
[ Note for Digg readers , who are quick to conclude that I ’m a game n00 b and a monster for letting an 11 - year - old play a M - rated game : I ’ve not only played the game ( start to finish ) with him , but I ’m IN the game ( I ’ve got a voice acting cameo ) .
Also , a rating is a guideline to help parents use their own judgment based on what ’s appropriate for their own kid , not a law . ]
Murdering , womanising , tyrannical warmongering - even Britain 's most successful monarchs have had their off days .
But some of Britain 's Kings and Queens never balanced the occasional infamous act with popular adoration or military success .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
A debate being held by English Heritage seeks to answer the question of which British monarch should be considered the biggest failure .
A panel of experts has narrowed the long list to a controversial worst three .
EDWARD II After being forced to abdicate , Edward was imprisoned and brutally murdered Edward ruled from 1307 - 1327 .
In that time he not only lost the war with Scotland that his father started but was also imprisoned by his estranged wife and forced to abdicate on grounds of incompetence .
Historian Alison Weir nominated Edward II .
The charges are as follows : A poor soldier during the war with Scotland .
Saw English defeat by Robert the Bruce in 1314 , therefore failing to realize his fathers dream of a united Britain .
Irritated the nobility by lavishing money and rewards on his male favourites .
Forced to abdicate on grounds of incompetence following imprisonment by his own wife 's army .
MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS
Mary was next in line to the English throne at the time of her execution Scotland 's queen from 1542 to 1567 managed to be implicated in murder and treason , forced into exile , imprisoned for 19 years and executed .
Historian Sarah Gristwood nominated Mary , Queen of Scots .
The charges are : Suspected involvement in the murder of husband ( and second cousin ) Henry Stuart at Kirk o' Field in 1565 .
Marriage only three months after the murder to the Earl of Bothwell , also a suspect in the murder .
This caused Scotland 's Protestant Lords to rise against her .
Decision to flee to England , where she thought Elizabeth I would protect her , but where she was imprisoned for 19 years .
Suspected involvement in numerous plots to assassinate the English queen , eventually leading to a trial for treason - and execution .
GEORGE IV George became obese from eating one too many lavish royal banquets
The Playboy prince ruled Britain as Prince Regent during his father George III 's madness and as King from 1820 - 1830 , following his father 's death .
Despite seeing Britain 's victory in the Napoleonic Wars , George 's reign was notable mainly for his lavish lifestyle and womanising tendencies .
Historian Martyn Downer nominated George IV .
These are the charges : Serial womaniser .
Scandals with his mistresses and extravagant spending while Britain suffered the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars .
Married his cousin Caroline of Brunswick to please his father and clear his debts .
Barred his ( by then estranged ) wife from his coronation .
Should Ethelred be included for his lack of readiness ?
Was Henry VIII too prone to lose his head ?
Here 's who you think has been the worst British monarch .
Victora - for overseeing the ethnic cleansing of nearly 3 million of her Irish subjects in the mid 1800s .
One million starved to death and another two million left for America .
The Famine Queen
Maurice , London
I`d say the whole lot of them as they all seem corrupt in some ways .
In more recent times I`d nominate King Edward VII as other than giving his name to a pack of cigars what did he do ?
Had a bundle of mistresses .
Must have led his long suffering wife a merry dance .
A real cad and a bounder .
A waste of space .
Roger McDermaid , Edinburgh Pound for pound it is without question Mary I as she failed in every single aspect of the job and will only be remembered for loosing our foreign lands and burning half the nation .
Votes should also go to George IV and Edward II
Daniel Cure , Kingswinford Vortigern ?
Legindarily to blame for the Anglo - Saxon invasion in the 5th century .
May as well start at the beginning .
But it might be a more difficult exercise to thing of one who could n't be nominated , at least before 1914 .
Chris , Sheffield George I .
He did n't want to come here and could n't speak a word of English .
For sheer cold - blooded cruelty his treatment of his wife and later his daughter - in - law takes some beating .
No wonder the Jacobites did their best to get rid of him .
Emily , Carlisle Aethelraed II - popularly known as Ethelred the Unready .
( 978-1016 )
Murdered his half - brother to get the throne ; married a Norman , ultimately leading to William 's invasion , and failed to stop the Viking attacks - in fact encouraged them by paying them off !
Alan Marson , Aberdeen , Scotland How about James VII & II .
Ruled for only 4 years to 1689 and as a result of changing his religion ended up being forced to abdicate the throne leading to the Jacobean wars which would blight Protestant - Catholic relations almost to this day !!!
Craig Barr , Lytham Henry IV part II .
For being only half the man his father was !
Paul Morley , Solihull , England How about Henry VIII : murderer , iconoclast , war - monger , syphilitic , destroyer of centuries of cultural and artistic heritage and left England virtually bankrupt to boot !
Sean D. Lynch , Haywards Heath , England Richard I gets my vote .
He spoke no or Little English , and during his 10 year reign spent less than 6 months in the country .
Paul Barber , Chertsey , Surrey Probably James II for me .
He had it all , including adoration ( New York was named after him , sympathy from his father 's execution but as with all bigots ( or as in his case bullies that then gain power ) he wanted too much too fast and was unable to take his subjects with him .
Even his own brother , charles II predicted that James would lose the crown in 3 years Came to thrown 1685 ....
Lost crown 1688
Gary Woolton , Dudley
It has to be Stephen I - a violent and arrogant usurper who plunged England into an unnecessary and brutal civil war , and then once he had the throne could n't be bothered to ensure the succession and handed it to the son of his enemy !
Although Mary I is certainly a contender - losing France for the sake of a good - looking Spaniard .
Kathy Toms , Ivybridge , Devon Charles
I for his vainglorious mismanagement of almost everything - in a close run contest with his son James II .
The Stuarts are by far the worst dynasty .
Peter Lewiston , London , England I think it was either King John ( something to do with Robin Hood ) , or Richard III ( Something to do with Laurence Olivier ) .
Or it might have been King Canute - was he the same one as the one who lost his crown in the Wash ?
... it was something to do with the sea , anyway .
Charles Nightingale , Felixstowe , England Lady Jane
Grey has got to be up there : not for being bad but for being so DIM .
People with entire armies got worked over by the Tudors , so why she thought she was in with a chance is a mystery .
Add to that the fact she picked a fight with Mary , possibly the most vindictive of them all , and the case for a serious lack of nous is complete .
SImon Jones , London , UK I am quite shocked Charles I has not been nominated , he managed to make the general public he rules over unite and despise him .
Chris Malin , Stourbridge , UK Edward VIII must be in the reckoning , if only as a quitter .
Alistair Adams , Giffnock , Scotland How about William II who according to the Anglo Saxon Chronicles was " hated by almost all his people " and who 's accidental death was seen as an act of god !
I hope that I am remembered more kindly .

What are these ?
Yesterday , we ( Amnesia ) took delivery of Australia ’s first two Microsoft Surface tables .
We believe they were the first units to ship outside the US .
Not often you get your hands on something no one else has seen , so we thought we ’d share the grand opening of the boxes …
These crates are heavy .
Around 125 kg each .
“ That ’s a Big Ass Box ” quipped one of the designers .
Raiders of the Lost Ark eat your heart out …
No time to waste we borrowed a crowbar and a hammer from the courier to get inside .
The tables we packed very securely and nothing was even slightly scuffed from transit .
Something to hang on the wall to inspire everyone … a big finger 🙂
The entire package is very polished .
The entire table is packed in what is essentially a GIANT ziplock bag .
When unpacked , the table has the calibration mat and some other printed materials covering the screen .
Up and running in just a few minutes .
We actually had our first app ( with our own content ) up and running within 20 minutes which is great news .
Meantime , staff ca n’t stop walking up to the table and playing with the demos that were included – A big ass table yes … but so much fun .

His new ad has some teeth :
To which the McCain campaign responds :
William Ayers , William Ayers , William Ayers .
When Obama goes negative he usually goes after state issues ; like this new ad playing in Nevada about nuclear waste or this ad about DHL job losses in Ohio .
McCain , on the other hand , mostly deploys blanket negative statements : Obama is a celebrity , Obama is n't ready to lead , Obama does n't care about the troops .
One seems to be aiming for the national polls , the other for the electoral college .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The big news yesterday was the death of 10 French soldiers in Afghanistan .
They called it the worst Taliban attack on NATO forces in three years .
But hold the presses …
AFP and al - Jazeera are reporting that the French army refuses to comment on a report in Le Monde that the 10 French soldiers actually were killed by a NATO airstrike responding to the initial attack by militants .
The soldiers told the newspaper they waited for four hours for back - up after being ambushed .
But when NATO planes finally arrived they hit French troops after missing their target , the newspaper quoted the soldiers as saying .
The report added that Afghan soldiers sent in as backup also mistakenly targeted the French soldiers .
A NATO official said on Wednesday : “ I have nothing substantive to confirm or deny this particular suggestion .
“ We are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it . ”
The official said the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) “ would probably defer in the first instance to the French authorities , ” in the investigation .
Junior Defense Minister Jean - Marie Bockel , asked to comment on Le Monde ‘s report , said : “ this is not the time for polemics , this is a day of compassion , of national unity around our soldiers . ”
Andrew Adonis , the Schools Minister , did not even try to hide his irritation .
Writing in The Times on August 21 , the day the GCSE results were released , he lashed out at those who would claim that the exams were being dumbed down instead of celebrating the increasing numbers of students getting A and A* grades .
“ It is the class - based elitism that instinctively wants to ration success and cap the aspirations of the less advantaged , ” he wrote .
“ The underlying premise is that there is a fixed pool of talent in society . ”
And then came this breathtaking assertion : “ There is no genetic or moral reason why the whole of society should not succeed to the degree that the children of the professional classes do today , virtually all getting five or more good GCSEs and staying on in education beyond 16 . ”
Why breathtaking ?
Is n’t that pretty much what both Labour and Tory politicians say ?
It is part of the received wisdom among politicians whenever they talk about education : except for a few children with severe handicaps , they assert , all children can succeed on the academic track if the schools do their job .
Politicians argue only about which policies will achieve this obviously attainable result .
Adonis ’s statement was breathtaking nonetheless because , scientifically , it is not true .
His belief that nearly all children can be proficient at academic skills is educational romanticism .
Many children are just not gifted enough to learn to read and write at more than a rudimentary level , far short of the level required by a GCSE , and the schools can only tweak their performance at the margins .
An educational system that serves all the children must begin by recognising that truth .
The phrase “ many children are just not gifted enough ?.?.?. ” would be completely uncontroversial if it described any ability but intellectual .
A quarter of a century ago , Howard Gardner , the American educational scholar , famously sought to topple the word intelligence from its pedestal by arguing that there are seven different intelligences : kinesthetic ( roughly , athletic ) , musical , visual - spatial , interpersonal , intra-personal , linguistic and logical - mathematical .
Let ’s accept his classification and apply the concept of “ just not gifted enough ” to the first five of them .
Imagine that each sentence begins with “ No matter how much training I get ?.?.?. ”
“ I am just not gifted enough to do a somersault with a half twist off the pommel horse ” ( kinesthetic ) .
“ I am just not gifted enough to understand why someone would choose to compose a piece in B major rather than C major ” ( musical ) .
“ I am just not gifted enough to see a chessboard in my mind and move pieces on it ” ( visual - spatial ) .
“ I am just not gifted enough to be a first - rate teacher ” ( inter- personal ) .
“ I am just not gifted enough to stick with a no - sweets diet ” ( intra- personal ) .
None of these tasks is especially difficult for someone who is well above average in the ability in question .
All of them are extremely difficult for people who are around the average .
All of them are impossible for people who are well below average – not just difficult , but impossible .
To be below average in any ability is to be quite limited in the things one can do .
And when children show up at the school room door , 50 per cent of them are below average in every single one of those abilities .
Now apply the same test to the last two of Gardner ’s seven intelligences :
“ I am just not gifted enough to understand text with big words and complicated syntax ” ( linguistic ) .
“ I am just not gifted enough to factor an equation ” ( logical - mathematical ) .
Fifty per cent of children are below average in linguistic and logical - mathematical ability .
Being below average means that they are limited in the things they can do in reading and maths .
It is no more remarkable than being limited in the things one can do in sport or music .
And yet to say such things in public is to invite shock and ridicule .
The educational romantics will pummel you with four objections :
1 ) When children are below average , we can raise their ability ; 2 ) the schools are so bad that children at all levels of ability can learn much more than they are learning now ; 3 ) the rising test scores of the past decade prove that major improvements are possible ; and 4 ) there ’s no reason why the high educational achievement of children of the professional classes of ability cannot be achieved by all classes .
First , a bit of housekeeping .
When talking about ability to succeed in the academic track , two of Gardner ’s abilities , linguistic and logical - mathematical – the two abilities that dominate IQ scores – are crucial .
Rather than referring to them separately , from now on I will refer to the combination of the two as academic ability .
This is not to say that those two are the only abilities relevant to success in school .
Intra-personal ability in the form of self - discipline and perseverance is also important .
But all the self - discipline and perseverance in the world wo n’t help if enough underlying academic ability is n’t there .
Think of the relationship of academic ability to academic success as you think of the relationship of height to success as a centre in a professional basketball team .
Height is n’t the most important factor – for people who are at least 6ft 10in ( just over 2 metres ) to begin with .
Now to the first issue : do we know how to raise academic ability through interventions ?
Since the most intensive experimental efforts to raise academic ability have been undertaken in the United States , and by now we have accumulated 40 years of evaluations of their success , I will use American data for the answer : the best we can do is nudge academic ability by a small increment , and even that much is difficult and uncertain .
The attempts to raise academic ability have focused on the pre-school years , on the plausible assumption that this is the period when the brain and personality are most malleable .
During the height of the optimism about the potential effects of social programmes during the second half of the 1960s and throughout the 1970s , many intensive experimental pre-school programmes were mounted .
Most of the programmes were haphazardly or tendentiously evaluated , but enough good studies came out of this period to enable an academic group called the Consortium for Longitudinal Studies to conduct a comparative analysis of 11 of the best pre-school interventions .
The consortium found that they produced an average short - term gain of about 17 percentile points relative to a control group ( for example , an increase from the 20th percentile of all students to the 37th percentile of all students ) .
However , this gain fell off to about 7 percentile points after three years , leaving a trivial net change .
The consortium ’s bottom line was that “ the effect of early education on intelligence test scores was not permanent ” .
Since then there have been other attempts using intensive pre-school enrichment , notably the Abecedarian Project and the Infant Health & Development Programme .
They shared a common fate – large gains in the first follow - up , leading to widespread publicity and claims of success , then fadeout to insignificance as the children reached adolescence .
The bottom line : at best , we can move children from far below average intellectually to somewhat less below average .
No one claims that any project anywhere has proved anything more than that .
Never mind , say the educational romantics .
The schools are so bad that even low - ability students can learn a lot more than they do now .
Judging from newspaper accounts , there is some truth to that position .
British stories about political correctness gone mad , classrooms where the teachers have given up trying to keep the children under control and schools where nothing is taught and nothing is learned resemble the stories about the worst - of - the - worst inner-city schools of the United States .
Insofar as such schools exist in England , of course the schools can do much better .
But in the United States those schools enrol a few per cent of all students .
Ordinary government schools in the US have decent facilities , orderly and nurturing classrooms and teachers who range from bad to excellent , with most clustered in the category of competent .
Reading and maths are taught energetically and with substance .
The main problem with ordinary schools in the US is that history , science and the arts have been stripped of their content in much the same way that reports say they have been stripped in England .
I will assume that most English schools outside the worst neighbourhoods are roughly comparable to my description of an ordinary American school .
How much can an ordinary English school do to raise the academic performance of its students ?
If the question is framed in terms of teaching them bodies of factual material about history , politics and citizenship , science and the arts , the increases in learning across the board could be dramatic .
But if the question is reading and maths , the answer is that the quality of the school makes surprisingly little difference .
This counterintuitive result was first exposed in the United States in 1966 with the publication of the Coleman Report .
Named after the sociologist who led it , the magnitude of its effort remains unmatched by anything done since .
The sample for the study included 645,000 students nationwide .
Before Coleman ’s team began its work , everyone ( including Coleman ) thought that the study would document a relationship between the quality of schools and the academic achievement of the students in those schools .
Any other result seemed impossible .
To everyone ’s shock , the Coleman Report instead found that the quality of schools explained almost nothing about differences in academic achievement .
Measures such as the credentials of the teachers , the extensiveness and newness of physical facilities , money spent per student – none of the things that people assumed to be important in explaining educational achievement were important in fact .
Family background was far and away the most important factor in determining student achievement .
The Coleman Report came under intense fire , but reanalyses of the Coleman data and the collection of new data over many years continue to support the core finding that the quality of schools just does n’t make much difference in mean student test scores .
Move away from the awful inner-city schools to the schools that are ordinary or better , and much of the slack has been taken out of the room for improvement in academic achievement for the average student .
The educational romantics have an answer for that one too : such results merely show how terrible all the schools are by comparison with what they could be .
To fix the problem , the Left advocates innovative teaching techniques and curricula .
The Right ( in America at any rate ) advocates greater use of vouchers and other methods of privatising the schools .
Once again , the United States has the most voluminous data for assessing the success of both strategies .
For decades , the US government has given grants for what are now called Comprehensive School Reform ( CSR ) demonstration programmes .
Using the grant , the recipient school implements one of a wide range of teaching and curriculum models .
In 2003 , a comprehensive meta-analysis of the 29 most widely implemented models was published .
The average effect size – the difference between performance of students in the experimental group and students in the control group , weighted by the standard deviation – was +0.15 .
It is an effect even smaller than the one observed in the studies of pre-school interventions cited earlier .
An effect size of +0.15 means , for example , that a child at the 25th percentile goes to the 30th percentile .
To put it another way , no model of school reform that has been tried in the United States has demonstrated , with evidence that withstands scientific scrutiny , the kind of dramatic impact on academic performance that the educational romantics say is possible .
I have been unable to find rigorous examinations of experimental learning models in England .
I hope this article will unearth empirical evidence of dramatic success that I might have missed – which I look forward to examining with a fine ?
tooth comb .
American advocates of school privatisation ( I am one ) fare no better than the advocates of government - sponsored reforms .
Vouchers and tax credit experiments have been successful in many ways – providing safer and more nurturing school environments , freeing able students from peer pressure not to perform and installing more substantial curricula .
But the reading and maths scores of students in these schools compare favourably with students in government schools only when the comparison is with the worst inner-city schools .
When the comparison is with ordinary government schools , the differences have been trivial .
Does the English experience of the past decade refute me ?
When it came to power in 1997 , the Labour Government set out to achieve ambitious increases in test scores , and it succeeded .
English Key Stage 2 , Key Stage 3 and GCSE scores all bear witness to this achievement .
I have n’t the space to present the technical evidence that teaching to the test and dumbing down of test content explain these increases .
I refer you to the websites of the Curriculum , Evaluation and Management Centre ( CEM ) at Durham University and the think tank Civitas for an impressive array of such evidence .
Put those two issues aside and consider just the results whenever English students have been tested by people who are not connected with the government .
In reading , the CEM has conducted independent studies using its Performance Indicators in Primary Schools ( PIPS ) examination and found a meaningless one - point increase in reading scores between 1997 and 2002 , the same five years when the Government ’s Key Stage 2 showed a large increase in the percentage of primary school students reaching Level 4 or above .
The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study ( Pirls ) , a sophisticated and rigorous testing survey covering large samples from 40 countries , showed a statistically significant decline in reading scores among English nine - year - olds ( Year 4 ) from 2001 to 2006 , years when the Key Stage 2 continued to show improvement .
In maths , the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) , conducted by the same organisation that administers Pirls , tested English 13 - year - olds ( Year 8 ) in 1995 , 1999 and 2000 .
During that period the Government ’s Key Stage 3 test shows the percentage of students scoring at Level 5 or above as rising impressively from 58 to 71 per cent .
The TIMSS results ?
The scores for 1995 and 2003 were identical ( 498 , on a test with a mean of 500 ) .
In 1999 , the score had dipped trivially to 496 .
To sum up , I have been unable to find an independent assessment of the achievement of students leaving secondary school that shows the increases in test scores since 1997 that the government figures show .
Once again , I hope this article will unearth evidence to the contrary that we can all examine carefully .
There is some good news in the TIMSS maths scores : English nine - year - olds showed a large and statistically significant increase .
And therein lies a story that has also bedevilled attempts to raise maths scores in the United States .
Maths in the early years is based on simple concepts ( how many sides to a triangle ) and on arithmetic – rudimentary skills that almost all children should be able to learn .
When the schools begin to put more emphasis on drill in arithmetic , and make sure that the curriculum does indeed teach children about the shape of triangles , test scores can show large improvements .
But when mathematics moves beyond the simplest concepts and arithmetic to the abstractions of algebra and the logic of geometry , large numbers of children fall by the wayside – they are just not clever enough in logical - mathematical intelligence to keep up .
That ’s the reason why a test at the age of nine ( Year 4 ) can show improvement while a test at 13 ( Year 8 ) does not .
It is a gradient that , given fine - grained tests , will be found to apply from Year 1 to university .
In Year 1 , it is indeed true that almost all children can learn everything that Year 1 teaches .
Some will learn it faster than others , but almost everyone can learn to read and do maths at Year 1 level .
But every year the number who cannot keep up increases .
By the time children reach their teens , some large proportion – a third at least , arguably more – should not be on a continuing academic track .
By the end of secondary school , that proportion is around 80 per cent or 90 per cent .
The last refuge of the educational romantics is the extremely high proportion of children of the professional classes who do well in school .
Surely that must be explained by affluence and access to the best schools .
Or as Adonis put it : “ There is no genetic or moral reason why the whole of society should not succeed to the degree that the children of the professional classes do today . ”
Actually , there are both genetic and moral reasons , along with environmental ones .
The genetic reason arises from two politically unfashionable but empirically irrefutable truths .
The first is that IQ , which is nearly coincident with academic ability as I defined it , is somewhere around 40 per cent to 60 per cent heritable .
The evidence for the substantial heritability of IQ has become so overwhelming that it is no longer a subject of serious debate , except over the exact figure .
The second is that people in the professional classes are , on average , far above the rest of the population in IQ .
Presenting evidence for the high IQ of professionals is superfluous for successful physicians , engineers , barristers , scientists or university lecturers .
Possession of an IQ in at least the top 10 per cent is virtually guaranteed by the nature of the academic filters required to finish the professional training .
But such evidence is plentiful even when we move to occupations such as business executive .
There are many thick people working in business , but studies of the relationship of tested IQ to career success indicates that the overwhelming majority of successful executives are somewhere in the top 10 per cent of IQ .
And so it comes to pass that when a man and woman in the professional classes set out to have a baby , it is extremely likely that at least one gene contributor has a high IQ .
In today ’s society , it is ever more likely that both contributors will be in that category .
Think of all the couples you know who consist of two professionals , or ones in which perhaps only one works outside the home but the other has an advanced academic degree .
Given this kind of genetic background and a heritability of 40 to 60 per cent for IQ , the children of the professional classes have a meaningful academic advantage at the moment of birth ( as a group – individual exceptions abound ) .
When we turn to the 40 to 60 per cent of IQ that is environmental , children of the professional classes also have an advantage , but little of it has to do with money .
Talking to infants and reading bedtime stories to toddlers every night do not cost money – but such behaviour goes from “ almost universal ” to “ rare ” as social class goes from top to bottom .
To refrain from smoking , alcohol and drugs during pregnancy costs no money .
But such restraint is once again correlated with social class , and children of the professional class are the beneficiaries .
How are school reforms to compensate for these environmental advantages of the professional classes ?
Another environmental factor brings me to the moral reason that stands in the way of equalising the educational success of those in the professional classes and those towards the bottom – moral , at least , for those of us who think that whether a baby has a father as well as a mother is a moral issue .
One more empirical finding that is no longer in dispute in the United States among scholars of child development is that children do best when they are raised by married biological parents .
Children raised by a divorced mother do next best ( whether she remarries does n’t make much difference ) .
Children raised by an unmarried mother do worst of all .
Let me emphasise that these results are found after controlling for a host of socio-economic background variables .
Poor and rich children alike benefit from growing up with both biological parents and suffer from being born to a lone mother .
In the United States , even the scholars who used to believe otherwise have changed their minds on this one .
The advantages of growing up with married biological parents do not include higher academic ability .
But they do include all sorts of other advantages that affect success in school .
Children raised by both biological parents are more likely to grow up psychologically healthy , accustomed to a regular routine and self - disciplined than children who grow up with unmarried mothers ( again , even after controlling for socio- economic variables ) .
They are more likely to have someone watching over their homework and noticing if there are problems at school .
If the incidence of marriage and lone parenthood were evenly distributed throughout the social classes , the advantages of marriage would not benefit the children of the professional classes .
But lone parenthood is concentrated in the lowest socio-economic levels of English society .
Consider the examples of Wokingham and Southwark , local authorities that epitomise the socio-economic top and bottom .
As of the 2001 census , 13 per cent of Wokingham households with dependent children had a lone parent .
In Southwark that figure was 45 per cent .
The example of Wokingham and Southwark applies generally , and has done for many years .
I once used the 1991 census data to compile the percentage of extramarital births from all of England ’s local authorities .
Just knowing the percentage of people in the lowest social class in the local authority area statistically explained about half of all variation in extramarital births .
When that kind of disparity exists between marriage in the top and the bottom social classes , all sorts of disparities in outcomes for their children are guaranteed .
No one wants to be the person who says “ Bah , humbug ” to attempts to improve the education of children who have got the short end of the stick through no fault of their own .
The impulse to romanticism is overwhelming .
But it has led us to treat children who are not suited for the academic track in ways that are not in their best interests .
It is time to recognise that even the best schools under the best conditions cannot overcome the limits on achievement set by limits on academic ability .
This is not a counsel of despair .
The implication is not to stop trying to help but to remove the ideological blinkers and stop pretending that all children can or should pursue the academic track .
There is a healthier and attainable goal of education : to bring children to adulthood having discovered things they enjoy doing and having learned how to do them well .
The goal applies equally to every child , across the entire range of every ability .
The schools can achieve that goal , if they pay more attention to their students ’ diverse talents and give them diverse opportunities to develop those talents .
The way is open for dramatic improvement in education in both our countries – once we get a grip on reality .
The problem with posting a " found cash " notice on craigslist is that a note like this might churn up some liars , and it did !
Three people contacted me , Jesa , Alisha and Clyde .
Cash in the Parking lot of Save Mart I found some cash in the parking lot at Save Mart .
Let me know if you lost cash and can identify it .
Thanks .
$ 60 is a lot of money to lose , especially for those who are n't multi- thousandaires .
I left a note with the store manager , and , acknowledging the hopelessness of the quest , posted a note on Craigslist .
For most of my life I 've been pretty lucky at finding money on the ground .
I 've found $ 20 , $ 40 twice , and $ 60 , cash , lying on the sidewalk , in a 7 - 11 or in the street .
I 've never had any luck returning it , because cash is almost untraceable .
Rob - Nope .
There actually WAS a check cashing receipt nearby , but it was from May .
It did n't look related .
Alisha -
Ya it is sad .
Usually if they carry it in a envelope or something they may have used the check cashing place near there , it might have a logo or something .
Rob -
Yeah , kind of a lot .
My wife was not happy when I brought it home .
She was sad for the person who lost it .
Also , the poorest people probably are n't online , checking craigslist , so this is kind of hopeless .
( 3:01 pm )
Rob - Sorry Alisha .
I found money at the Folsom Blvd. one .
Alisha -
It is okay … was it a lot ?
I hope the owner claims it , it always makes me sad to think that it might be all they have .
She had the wrong location , and in crafting my response , I wondered how much info I should volunteer ...
Alisha - I lost a small amount of money ( $ 50 ) 2 $ 20 bills and a $ 10 at the save mart at Auburn and Garfield .
Please let me know if you found it .
Jesa -
Thanks for not being like the person who stole my bike today , or the person who stole my other bike two weeks ago .
nice to see there are still some honest people out there ...
The next day , I found some more money , in cities all across the country .
What a day I had !
I found money in Minneapolis , Seattle , Las Vegas and Dallas .
Maybe I am an extraordinarily skeptical person , but the timing of the second email was suspicious .
I also found it strange that Clyde offered up precise information only about the things I had told Alisha , but had left out other helpful information .
Clyde -
Thanks anyway .
It 's people like you that make me believe people would do the right thing .
Clyde - I lost it - August 3rd , that is the day i get my money from welfare , and I lost it in the parking lot .
I sure hope it is , we are hurting without it .
Thanks ,
Clyde
Rob - Hi Clyde .
That is the store where I found the money .
What day and time did you lose it ?
Clyde - lost my grocery money at the Folsom Blvd. location .
I lost over $ 300.00 there .
I was running around with my kids , and must of dropped it when i took my wallet out , it was tucked behind my wallet .
Larger bills , mostly 20.00 bills .
Please let me know , I am desperate to find it .
- Clyde ( 3:42 pm )
Dallas -------
Found : Cash at Mervyns Store Found some cash in Mervyns yesterday .
Would like to return it to the rightful owner ( because if you are shopping at Mervyns , you probably can't afford to lose this money ) .
Las Vegas ----
My boyfriend and I came across a pack of cash in the parking lot of Chevy 's Fresh Mex Restaurant ...... will return to owner ...... want to do the right thing .... reward will be appreciated .
Good News :
There ’s a - reason - they elected the Terminator as governor .

Syria was a close ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War
Moscow has announced it is ready to sell new weapons to Syria , triggering alarm from Israel .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said any arms sales of " a defensive character " would not change the strategic balance in the Middle East .
But Israel 's foreign minister said such sales could destabilise the region .
The comments came as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Syrian President Bashar al - Assad met at Russia 's Black Sea resort of Sochi .
Moscow and Damascus are reportedly preparing deals on anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems , as well as surface - to - surface Iskander missiles .
Israel 's foreign minister accused Syria of links with terrorists
Tzipi Livni , Israeli foreign minister , told a news conference in Jerusalem : " Russia has its own interests in the region and nobody wants to destabilise the region .
" And I think according to this assessment it is of mutual interest of Russia , Israel and pragmatic leaders of states in the region not to send this kind of long - range missiles to Syria . "
She also said Syria was linked to Iran , Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Palestinian militants Hamas .
Before the talks in Sochi , Syria 's president had spoken of the need to speed up military and technical co-operation with Russia .
Syria was a close ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War .
Relations between Moscow and Damascus have been getting closer recently - this visit is Mr Assad 's third to Russia in three years .
Mr Assad said on Thursday Russia 's military campaign in Georgia was a justified response to provocation from Tbilisi .
Russia has been strongly criticised by the West for its military operations in Georgia launched earlier this month .
Can you forgive her ?
In March , Lenore Skenazy , a New York City mother , gave her 9 - year - old son , Izzy , a MetroCard , a subway map , a $ 20 bill and some quarters for pay phones .
Then she let him make his own way home from Bloomingdale ’s department store -- by subway and bus .
Izzy survived unscathed .
He was n’t abducted by a perverted stranger or pushed under an oncoming train by a homicidal maniac .
He did n’t even get lost .
According to Skenazy , who wrote about it in a New York Sun column , he arrived home “ ecstatic with independence . ”
His mother was n’t so lucky .
Her column generated as much outrage as if she ’d suggested that mothers make extra cash by hiring their kids out as child prostitutes .

But it also reinvigorated an important debate about children , safety and independence .
Reader , if you ’re much over 30 , you probably remember what it used to be like for the typical American kid .
Remember how there used to be this thing called “ going out to play ” ?
For younger readers , I ’ll explain this archaic concept .
It worked like this :
The child or children in the house -- as long as they were over age 4 or so -- went to the door , opened it , and ... went outside .
They braved the neighborhood pedophile just waiting to pounce , the rusty nails just waiting to be stepped on , the trees just waiting to be fallen out of , and they “ played . ”
“ Play , ” incidentally , is a mysterious activity children engage in when not compelled to spend every hour under adult supervision , taking soccer or piano lessons or practicing vocabulary words with computerized flashcards .
Advertisement
All in all , “ going out to play ” worked out well for kids .
As the American Academy of Pediatrics ’ Dr. Kenneth Ginsburg testified to Congress in 2006 , “ Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master , conquering their fears while practicing adult roles .
Thirty years ago , the “ going out to play ” culture coexisted with other culturally sanctioned forms of independence for even very young children : Kids as young as 6 used to walk to school on their own , for instance , or take public buses or -- gulp -- subways .
And if they lived on a school bus route , their mommies did not consider it necessary to escort them to the bus stop every morning and wait there with them .
But today , for most middle - class American children , “ going out to play ” has gone the way of the dodo , the typewriter and the eight - track tape .
From 1981 to 1997 , for instance , University of Michigan time - use studies show that 3 - to 5 - year - olds lost an average of 501 minutes of unstructured playtime each week ; 6 - to 8 - year - olds lost an average of 228 minutes .
( On the other hand , kids now do more organized activities and have more homework , the lucky devils ! )
And forget about walking to school alone .
Today ’s kids do n’t walk much at all ( adding to the childhood obesity problem ) .
Increasingly , American children are in a lose - lose situation .
They ’re forced , prematurely , to do all the un-fun kinds of things adults do ( Be over - scheduled !
Have no downtime !
Study !
Work ! ) .
But they do n’t get any of the privileges of adult life : autonomy , the ability to make their own choices , use their own judgment , maybe even get interestingly lost now and then .
Advertisement
Somehow , we ’ve managed to turn childhood into a long , hard slog .
Is it any wonder our kids take their pleasures where they can find them , by escaping to “ Grand Theft Auto IV ” or the alluring , parent - free world of MySpace ?
But , but , but , you say , all the same , Skenazy should never have let her 9 - year - old son take the subway !
In New York , for God ’s sake !
A cesspit of crack addicts , muggers and pedophiles !
Well , no .
We parents have sold ourselves a bill of goods when it comes to child safety .
Forget the television fear - mongering :
Your child stands about the same chance of being struck by lightning as of being the victim of what the Department of Justice calls a “ stereotypical kidnapping . ”
And unless you live in Baghdad , your child stands a much , much greater chance of being killed in a car accident than of being seriously harmed while wandering unsupervised around your neighborhood .
Skenazy responded to the firestorm generated by her column by starting a new website -- freerangekids.wordpress.com -- dedicated to giving “ our kids the freedom we had . ”
She explains : “ We believe in safe kids .
...
We do NOT believe that every time school - age children go outside , they need a security detail . ”

Next time I take my kids to New York , I ’m asking Skenazy to baby - sit .

Peter Pan , Snow White arrested at Disneyland
( AP ) Cinderella , Snow White , Tinkerbell and other fictional fixtures of modern - day childhood were handcuffed , frisked and loaded into police vans Thursday at the culmination of a labor protest that brought a touch of reality to the Happiest Place on Earth .
The arrest of the 32 protesters , many of whom wore costumes representing famous Disney characters , came at the end of an hour - long march to Disneyland 's gates from one of three Disney - owned hotels at the center of a labor dispute .
Those who were arrested sat in a circle on a busy intersection outside the park holding hands until they were placed in plastic handcuffs and led to two police vans while hundreds of hotel workers cheered and chanted .
The protesters were arrested on a misdemeanor count of failure to obey a police officer and two traffic infractions , said Sgt. Rick Martinez of the Anaheim police .
They were cited and released , Sgt. Chris Schneider said .

' Horrendous ' mold attacking Galveston Mold has gotten a head start
COMMENTARY
Mold coats the shelves of Maya 's Grocery in Galveston on Saturday as the Ochoa family cleans up from the storm .
Mold coats the shelves of Maya 's Grocery in Galveston on Saturday as the Ochoa family cleans up from the storm .

GALVESTON —
It 's black , white , green , blue , even calico .
It feasts , floats and climbs .
It can show itself , or not .
It 's toxic , or not .
It can resemble a rash , pocket lint , a puff of smoke .
It can make your throat cough , eyes itch , head pound , or leave you alone .
The menace is mold , and it 's ravaging water - damaged homes and buildings all over Galveston in the island 's latest battle wrought by Hurricane Ike .
Residents and business owners who were finally allowed last week to inspect their properties may have been relieved to find that the structures survived floodwaters and high winds .
But many discovered the damage done by various species of mold left to breed wildly in the nurturing environs of damp , hot buildings whose doors and windows were sealed for nearly two weeks .
At Maya 's Grocery and Food Products on Avenue L , the grown children of 80 - year - old Enrique Ochoa and his wife , 78 - year - old Alicia , donned respirator masks , rubber boots and gloves and plastic jumpsuits several days last week to combat the mold , mildew , flies and fumes that have overtaken the flooded Mexican food store their parents had operated for half a century .
" None of us have training what to do with mold , " said daughter Elizabeth Ochoa , a 52 - year - old San Antonio nurse .
" We just know it 's nasty and you need masks . "
The battle has become personal with her sister , Oralia Guererro , a 46 - year - old speech pathologist in Austin .
She 's confounded by one particular species resembling a hairball that continues to grow on a pillar despite attempts to kill it with Clorox .
" See those balls ? " Guererro asked , pointing .
" I do n't know what it is , but it comes back . "
The water likely reached 4 feet at Maya's , a neighborhood institution known for its homemade tortillas and tamales .
A blue lace of mold grows on the wall under a yellow piñata .
Enrique Ochoa , a pioneer on the island in Mexican food and spice imports , believes he lost more than $ 80,000 in machinery alone .
A health hazard
In the 12 days the store sat shuttered after Ike , expensive meat and other food spoiled in freezers , and a colorful carpet of mold smothered everything not damaged by water .
The smell was so bad that on the first day , as the family removed spoiled meat from the building , a Galveston police officer followed the scent , thinking it was a dead body .
At this point , the whole building is a health hazard , the family said , including the second story , where the owners lived above the store .
Black mold marches alongside the staircase to the couple 's apartment .
The elder Ochoa — he and his wife are simply known to locals as " Mr. and Mrs. Maya " — said he hopes to be able to clean the buildings well enough to sell them .
Maya 's likely will be no more .
" I think we 're going to leave the island after 65 years , " said the native of Coahuila , Mexico , a white respirator mask covering all but his sad eyes .
" I do n't think we can take another one of these . "
Elizabeth Ochoa said she 's frustrated that it took so long for Galveston officials to let the family on the island to assess damage and begin cleaning up .
" They should have let us in sooner , especially the business owners , " she said .
" I think we could have saved more . "
Her frustrations were compounded , she said , when the police officer mentioned that they probably could have returned sooner because business owners were being allowed .
City officials , of course , had to balance the risk of greater property loss with public safety .
But one wonders if a more organized , phased , look - and - leave policy could have allowed residents to begin fighting mold earlier .
The tedious process involves getting out the water and porous wet items that can't be saved , such as rugs , Sheetrock and furniture .
The structure must then be dried before a bleach solution is applied to kill the mold , including the stuff lurking inside walls
' This is horrendous '
It 's a process that Doug Heiner , a 26 - year - old , third - year medical student , was only just beginning on Friday .
The father of two small children and one on the way had just returned to his 1960s single - story home on Tuna Street , in the Fishing Village neighborhood .
" You do n't know how far the mold goes , " Heiner said .
His front lawn was strewn with nearly all his family 's possessions : from plastic toys , to a leather desk chair , to wooden shelves covered with Technicolor mold .
" I thought , with some of the furniture , you 'd be able to wipe it off . "
But he quickly learned better .
He would have been in quite " a fix , " he said , without the help of a troop of yellow - T - shirted Mormon volunteers who were helping remove furniture and patches of sopping carpet that , nearly two weeks after Ike , still squirted water when walked on .
" These houses are almost destroyed before you can get back into town , " said Elder Curtis Brown , 62 , a retired school administrator from Benson , Ariz .
" Nothing against the city , but it was a disadvantage we could n't get on the island . "
" I 've been around mold , but nothing like this .
This is horrendous , " said Brown , as he stood in Heiner 's hallway , his face covered with a mask to protect him from the odor .
" We 're fighting against time right now . "

Discovery ’s crew members will be showing up with a last - minute addition to their cargo : replacement parts for a broken toilet aboard the station .
The toilet has separate systems for dealing with solid and liquid waste .
The unit that stopped working last week was supposed to direct urine flow and separate the liquid from air for storage .
Two replacement units that were on board the station have also failed .
Julie Payette , a Canadian astronaut , said that despite the many toilet jokes that had been made in the news media over the past week , “ We actually take this extremely seriously .
In our book , the hygiene cabinet  the toilet  is perhaps one of the most important systems on any spacecraft . ”
It should go without saying , Ms. Payette said , that “ we ’re humans . ”
“ We generate waste , ” she continued .
“ We need a way to dispose of it . ”
But she expressed confidence the Russians would be able to repair the system , because Russian engineering tends to be robust and repairable .
“ They have really good engineers , ” she said .
The mission includes three spacewalks to help install Kibo , perform station maintenance and to test techniques for cleaning a malfunctioning rotary joint that is a critical part of the station ’s power supply .
That joint , 10 feet in diameter , rotates one of the station ’s enormous solar arrays so that it faces the Sun during each orbit .
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration idled the joint last year , when it was found to have been damaged by metal shavings that fouled its inner workings and were being ground in by the operation of the joint .
Mr. Gerstenmaier said at the news conference that the station would probably be able to operate into next year before the problems limited the use of the growing station and the joint would have to be repaired .
At the news conference , Michael D. Griffin , NASA ’s administrator , beamed as he talked about a week in which NASA not only launched a shuttle crew but also landed a robotic craft , Phoenix , on Mars .
He joked , “ It ’s so great that not even having to do a press conference  two press conferences in a week  can ruin it . ”
But , he added : “ It is not easy .
We could talk until 6 a.m. tomorrow and I would n’t touch all the details that would demonstrate how hard it is .
And yet these teams make it look easy . ”

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German biologists have discovered a new species of ant they believe is the oldest on the planet , dating back around 120 million years .
Researchers from Karlsruhe ’s Natural History Museum found the 3 - millimeter - long ( 0.118 inch ) insect in the Amazon rainforest in 2007 , and hope it will shed light on the early evolution of ants .
“ It ’s by far the most spectacular find of my 26 - year career , ” said museum biologist Manfred Verhaagh on Tuesday .
Scientists from Karlsruhe originally found an unidentified species of ant of a similar type in the Brazilian rainforest in 2003 .
However , due to an accident in the laboratory , the insect dried up , making further research impossible , Verhaagh said .
Last year a separate team from the museum ’s research body was in the forest investigating fungus when they stumbled upon the tiny insect , and named it “ Martialis heureka ” .
Resembling a miniature wasp , the insect is like no other ant , and probably dates back 120 million years , making it the oldest still inhabiting the earth , Verhaagh said .
The scientists used DNA samples from its front leg to establish its likely age .
The last discovery of a new ant species was in 1923 , he added .
There remains very little news about the development of Fallout 5 .
At this stage , Bethesda could go in a completely different direction and launch an entirely new game .
Then again , the developers behind it have been known to take their sweet time when coming up with the next addition to this post - apocalyptic role - playing game series .
It ’s never a dull wait though as gaming forums are rife with talk about how Fallout 5 should be .
One particularly interesting topic of discussion is the location for the new game .
From Reddit to the actual community thread , people are eagerly putting forward suggestions for the next locale the Sole Survivor ( or whatever the main character will be ) to visit .
I ’ve made a list of the emerging favorites .
New Orleans
Nestled in the American South , New Orleans is a prime choice for many gamers because of its rich history .
The Louisiana swampland post - apocalypse could be a fantastic place to explore .
It ’s worth mentioning that a trademark application for ‘ Fallout New Orleans ’ was filed to the EU Intellectual Property Office in 2016 .
Then again , the franchise has visited swampy environments previous games so it ’s still very much ‘ wait and see ’ .
Chicago
The largest city in the state of Illinois is another fan favorite .
Its checkered past , highlighted by gangs , gambling , and the mafia could make for an interesting storyline .
Players of the spinoff game Fallout : Tactics get to pay a brief visit to the home of deep dish pizza .
In New Vegas , ED - E hints at Enclave outposts in Chicago .
Heading to Europe
We could also be looking across the pond for the next Fallout location .
In the run-up to E3 2018 , Bethesda tweeted an image of Big Ben , alongside what appears to be a teaser for Rage 2 and Starfield .
Could this refer to a London setting for Fallout 5 ?
While browsing Hacker News , I came across this post by Jonathan Rockway : I found it was interesting - not so much for the points he makes about Perl ( although those were interesting too ) , but for what he says about libraries . [
BTW , Jonathan is one of the Catalyst Core Team members .
Catalyst is a web application development framework for Perl , which is similar to Ruby on Rails in some ways .
He 's also the author of this book about Catalyst .
] One such point of his : .
I have to fork a gpg process , setup file descriptors just right , write input to a pipe , wait for input on another pipe , and then parse the result -- all for what amounts to a few XOR operations and bit shifts .
How could anyone think this is a good idea ?
( There is libgpgme , but this just hides the fork inside a library .
There is still tons of totally unnecessary work going on . )
" I strongly agree with that .
I really think most programs ( even if ultimately meant to run standalone ) , should be written , not as monolithic apps , but as one or more libraries in the first place .
And one should then just write a main function or main class , that calls those libraries , to do the bulk of the work for one 's app .
This idea applies even more for open source apps .
If the developer of gpg had written a libgpg as Jonathan says above ( and had then used libgpg to write gpg ) , Jonathan ( and anyone else in the world ) could use libgpg in their own work without reinventing the wheel .
They would thereby improve their productivity a lot - for that particular piece of code that needed the libgpg ( or other ) functionality .
Multiply this by tens of thousands of such cases and you can see how much time could be saved , overall .
Not to mention that ( if the libraries in question were of high - quality ) , a lot more time would be saved by not having to fix errors that often get added during cut - and - paste , as any programmer knows : " Oops , I copied that function , but forgot to copy its declaration into the header file " ( for C or C++ - substitute any other language and type of error here ) , etc .
The point is not so much the errors themselves ( which are often easy to fix , though not always ) , but the fact that , since they have been introduced , YOU NOW HAVE THE NEED TO FIX THEM , when you may not have needed to at all ( because they might not exist ) if you just had to call a library function or three and pass some arguments .
Basically , more code leads to more errors , and less code to less errors ( in general ) and cut - and - paste leads to more errors ( in particular ) .
Even in proprietary software shops , this point still makes sense - because the developers on the same team or other teams in the same shop , can reuse that code much more easily later if it's a well designed , modularized and refactored library , rather than having to cut - and - paste the necessary parts from out of one huge ( monolithic ) app , or blog :-) - as Jonathan says in the case of Rails programmers ( * ) .
And I 've seen this advice being followed in the breach ( i.e. not being followed ) even in some big companies .(*)
Jonathan is off the mark , though , when he claims that MOST Rails programmers cut - and - paste code from blogs .
That has to be a generalization without enough data to back it up .
I 'd say that , across the board , good programmers try to find or write libraries .
This concept is actually similar to this rule in The Art of UNIX Programming by Eric Raymond , theI disagree about this , though : " If you are like me , I 'd say it depends , on a case - by - case basis .
On August 26th , a group of LHC critics filed a suit against CERN in the European Court of Human Rights , in Strasbourg .
The authors of the suit are physicists , professors and students largely from Germany and Austria , who feel that the operation of the $ 10 billion Large Hadron Collider near Geneva , poses grave risks for the safety and well - being of the 27 member states of the European Union and their citizens .
The Rule of Law , the suit states , is also threatened .
The legal arguments that define the legitimacy of the suit have been crafted in German by a Professor of International Law , Adrian Hollaender .
The arguments for risks that might develop into wholesale disaster are based on papers from various physicists and a risk assessment analyst , whose conclusions will be examined by the court along with counter - arguments by CERN .
It 's a question of theories versus theories .
The outcome is anyone 's guess , but a cogent risk analysis could be the deciding factor .
The suit highlights the possible production of Micro Black Holes , which could be a pollution hazard or combine and destroy the LHC .
In the worst case , they contend , mBH could start consuming the planet , producing dangerous radiation .
MBH are admitted as theoretically possible by CERN but lately has refuted the possibility and denied that they could be produced at the LHC , unless there were extra dimensions in String theory .
In that case CERN says mBH would be harmlesss , evaporating quicky due to a theoretical Hawking radiation .
Bosenovas are a new risk theory in the suit , besides the better known Strangelets and Lowered Vacuum State theories .
Unlike the others there is some experimental evidence for a Bosenova , but this phenomenon of implosion / explosion has only been produced in small groups of atoms of Rubidium - 85 in an ultracold state , a Bose - Einstein Condensate .
I theorize that what might occur at the LHC is a new type of Bosenova from what amounts to a BEC used there as a coolant , an ultracold Superfluid Helium II , of about 60 metric tonnes in the LHC ring , and a further 60 tonnes of somewhat warmer Superfluid Helium I in refrigeration plants on the surface connected to the subterranean main ring .
The Bosenova risk was first raised by me in an article called " Superfluids , BECs and Bosenovas : The Ultimate Experiment " ( Struck because this was a shocking level of physics nonsense in an otherwise perhaps sane article - moderator ) .
The first full proton beam injection into the LHC is due September 10th .
As further studies and experiments required to assess risks are a long way off , and even a decision on risks as presented by the plaintiffs could take the European Court some time to evaluate , the authors of the suit are asking the court for a speedy granting of Interim Measures - namely that the LHC should be shut down pending the Court 's ruling .
The argument that the LHC be limited to no more than 2 TeV energy overall , similar to Fermilab 's Tevatron collider design energies , they exclude from the Court 's consideration .

View patterns : lightweight views for Haskell
View patterns were introduced in GHC 6.10 .
This page has been revised to reflect what we 've implemented .
For the previous discussion , see ViewPatternsArchive .
For an assessment of view patterns in practice , see Neil Mitchell 's blog entry
For some discussion of implicit view patterns see GHC feature request 3583
For a discussion of pattern bindings and view patterns see # 4061 ( closed )
For an alternative syntax for view patterns : ViewPatternsAlternative .
Basic view patterns
View patterns are a convenient way of pattern - matching against values of abstract types .
For example , in a programming language implementation , we might represent the syntax of the types of the language as follows :
type Typ data TypView = Unit | Arrow Typ Typ view :: Typ ->
TypView -- additional operations for constructing Typ's ...
The representation of Typ is held abstract , permitting implementations to use a fancy representation ( e.g. , hash - consing to manage sharing ) .
In current Haskell , using this signature is a little inconvenient :
size :: Typ ->
Integer size t = case view t of Unit -> 1 Arrow t1 t2 -> size t1 + size t2
It is necessary to iterate the case , rather than using an equational function definition .
And the situation is even worse when the matching against t is buried deep inside another pattern .
In response , programmers sometimes eschew type abstraction in favor of revealing a concrete datatype that is easy to pattern - match against .
View patterns permit calling the view function inside the pattern and matching against the result :
size ( view -> Unit ) = 1 size ( view -> Arrow t1 t2 ) = size t1 + size t2
That is , we add a new form of pattern , written
expression -> pattern
that means " apply the expression to whatever we 're trying to match against , and then match the result of that application against the pattern " .
The expression can be any Haskell expression of function type , and view patterns can be used wherever patterns are currently used .
The key feature of this proposal is its modesty , rather than its ambition :
There is no new form of declaration ( e.g. ' view ' or ' pattern synonym ' ) .
The functions used in view patterns are ordinary Haskell functions , and can be called from ordinary Haskell code .
No changes are needed to import or export mechanisms .
Both static and dynamic semantics are extremely simple .
It is essentially some simple syntactic sugar for patterns .
However , sometimes modest syntactic sugar can have profound consequences .
In this case , it 's possible that people would start routinely hiding the data representation and exporting view functions instead , which would be an excellent thing .
Semantics
Scoping for * expr -> * pat :
The variables bound by the view pattern are the variables bound by pat .
Any variables in expr are bound occurrences .
Variables bound by patterns to the left of a view pattern expression are in scope .
For example :
In function definitions , variables bound by matching earlier curried arguments may be used in view pattern expressions in later arguments .
example :: ( String -> Integer ) ->
String ->
Bool example f ( f -> 4 ) =
True Variables can be bound to the left in tuples and data constructors : example :: (( String ->
Integer , Integer ) , String ) ->
Bool example ( ( f , _ ) , f -> 4 ) = True
Typing
If expr has type t1 -> t2 and pat matches a t2 , then the whole view pattern has type t1 .
Evaluation
To match a value v against a pattern ( expr -> pat ) , evaluate ( expr v ) and match the result against pat .
Examples
We discuss some examples of pattern - matching abstract types and of other uses of view patterns here .
Join lists
The requisite join - list example :
data JList a = Empty | Single a | Join ( JList a ) ( JList a ) data JListView a = Nil | Cons a ( JList a )
Here we 've chosen that the view type only exposes the cons / nil structure one level at a time : the second argument to Cons is a join - list , not a view of it --- but that 's of course up to the programmer .
The implementation of the view :
view :: JList a -> JListView a view Empty = Nil view ( Single a ) = Cons a Empty view ( Join ( view ->
Cons xh xt ) y ) =
Cons xh $ Join xt y view ( Join ( view -> Nil ) y ) = view y
Note the recursive uses of the view function in view patterns within its own definition .
An example of using it :
length :: JList a ->
Integer length ( view -> Nil ) = 0 length ( view ->
Cons x xs ) = 1 + length xs
For more general sequences , Data .
Sequence already defines the views from the left and from the right
data ViewL a = EmptyL | ( :< ) a ( Seq a ) viewl :: Seq a ->
ViewL a data ViewR a = EmptyR | ( :> ) ( Seq a ) a viewr :: Seq a ->
ViewR a
that now may be used in view patterns .
Partial views
Here 's an alternate style of view definition : rather than mapping the abstract type to a single sum type , you provide outjections optionally inverting each constructor :
type Typ outUnit : Typ -> Maybe ( ) outArrow : Typ ->
Maybe ( Typ , Typ ) -- additional operations for constructing Typ's ...
This view is used as follows :
size ( outUnit -> Just _ ) = 1 size ( outArrow -> Just ( t1 , t2 ) ) = size t1 + size t2
This style should be discouraged when the view is in fact a total operation , as it moves the documentation of this fact out of the type system , making it harder for both people and the compiler to check exhaustiveness .
However , it may be a useful idiom for defining a partial matching function with several constructors ( e.g. , in XML processing ) .
Sets
Here is a small module that allows to decompose sets with respect to a given element , deleting it hereby .
module Set ( Set , empty , insert , delete , has ) where newtype Set a = S [ a ] has :: Eq a => a ->
Set a ->
Maybe ( Set a ) has x ( S xs ) | x ` elem ` xs = Just ( xs \\ x ) | otherwise =
Nothing delete :: a -> Set a ->
Set a delete x ( has x ->
Just s ) = s delete x s = s insert :: a -> Set a ->
Set a insert x s @ ( has x ->
Just _ ) = s insert x ( S xs ) = S ( x : xs )
Note the use of the previous argument x in later view patterns .
Erlang - style parsing
Sagonas et al describe an extension to Erlang that supports pattern - matching on bit-strings ( " Application , implementation and performance evaluation of bit - stream programming in Erlang " , PADL'07 ) .
Suppose we had a parsing function thus :
bits :: Int -> ByteString -> Maybe ( Word , ByteString ) -- ( bits n bs ) parses n bits from the front of bs , returning -- the n-bit Word , and the remainder of bs
Then we could write patterns like this :
parsePacket :: ByteString -> ... parsePacket ( bits 3 -> Just ( n , ( bits n ->
Just ( val , bs ) ) ) ) = ...
This parses 3 bits to get the value of n , and then parses n bits to get the value of val .
Note that this example uses the left - to - right scoping in the inner tuple : the first component is used in the view expression in the second .
N+k patterns
( n+k ) patterns use the following view function :
np :: Num a => a -> a ->
Maybe a np k n | k <= n = Just ( n - k ) | otherwise = Nothing
They are used as follows :
fib :: Num a => a -> a fib 0 = 1 fib 1 = 1 fib ( np 2 -> Just n ) = fib ( n + 1 ) + fib n
Note the integration with type classes : the view function can be overloaded , and its use in a view pattern gives rise to a type - class constraint ( in this case , that in turn makes fib overloaded ) .
n+k patterns are another a good opportunity for passing view data at run-time , as in :
example k ( np k -> Just n ) = ...
Named constants
View patterns can be used to pattern match against named constants :
errorVal :: Int ->
Bool errorVal = ( == 4 ) f ( errorVal -> True ) = ...
Both patterns
A " both pattern " pat1 & pat2 matches a value against both pat1 and pat2 and succeeds only when they both succeed .
A special case is as - patterns , x@p , where the first pattern is a variable .
Both patterns can be programmed using view patterns :
both : a -> ( a , a ) both x = ( x , x )
And used as follows :
f ( both -> ( xs , h : t ) ) = h : ( xs ++ t )
( However , this might cause a loss of sharing . )
Iterator Style
View patterns permit programming in an iterator style , where you name the result of a recursive call but not the term the call was made on .
E.g. :
length [ ] = 0 length ( _ : length -> n ) = 1 + n map f [ ] = [ ] map f ( x : map f -> xs ) = f x : xs foldr f z [ ] = z foldr f z ( x : foldr f z -> xs ) = x ` f ` xs unfoldr :: ( b -> Maybe ( a , b ) ) -> b -> [ a ] unfoldr f ( f ->
Just ( a , unfoldr f -> b ) ) = a : b unfoldr f other = [ ]
Further Syntactic Extensions
Next , we describe two further syntactic extensions that we will implement .
Implicit Maybe
Above , we saw several examples of view functions that return a Maybe , including :
np :: Num a => a -> a ->
Maybe a np k n | k <= n = Just ( n - k ) | otherwise = Nothing
which were used as follows :
fib ( np 2 -> Just n ) = fib ( n + 1 ) + fib n
We may implement a special syntax that makes the Just implicit , using expr => pat for expr ->
Just pat .
An example use :
fib ( np 2 => n ) = fib ( n + 1 ) + fib n
This syntax works very nicely with partial views :
size ( outUnit => _ ) = 1 size ( outArrow => ( t1 , t2 ) ) = size t1 + size t2
Implicit Tupling
A further syntactic extension would be to have implicit Maybes with implicit tupling : multiple patterns after the => are implicitly tupled .
Then you could write :
size ( outArrow => t1 t2 ) = size t1 + size t2
Implicit View Functions
Total views have one syntactic disadvantage relative to the iterated - case style definition that we started with : you have to repeat the name of the view function in each clause !
We now describe a method for eliding the name of the view function .
The idea is that we distinguish a particular type class as a hook into the pattern compiler .
The class has the following interface :
class View a b where view :: a -> b
Then , you can leave off the expresion in a view pattern , writing ( -> pat ) , to mean view -> pat .
For example :
size ( ->
Unit ) = 1 size ( -> Arrow t1 t2 ) = size t1 + size t2
means
size ( view -> Unit ) = 1 size ( view -> Arrow t1 t2 ) = size t1 + size t2
for the overloaded view .
To use this mechanism , you add instances to view , as in :
instance View Typ TypView where view = ( the view function from above )
This way , you do n't have to write the name of the view function in each case .
However , there is a still a syntactic marker saying that the case is n't an ordinary pattern match , which may be useful in understanding the performance of the code .
Of course , you can only use one view function for each hidden - type / view - type pair this way , since you can only have one instance of the class .
Functional dependencies
The above implementation of size is given the following type :
size :: View a TypView => a ->
Int
which may or may not be what you want .
( For example , with nested view patterns , you can get into situations where the middle type connecting two view patterns is not determined . )
Thus , it may be better to make one parameter of the type class determine the other ( using associated type synonyms ) :
class View a where type View a view :: a ->
View a
or
class View b where type Hidden b view :: Hidden b -> a
Of course , a programmer can always use all three type classes explicitly ; it 's just a question of which one should be the default .
We plan to try them out before deciding .
The downside of these versions is that you can only have one view for a type ( when a determines View a ) or you can only use a type as a view of one type ( when b determines Hidden b ) with the implicit syntax .
Compilation
Efficiency View patterns can do arbitrary computation , perhaps expensive .
It 's reasonable to expect the compiler to avoid repeated computation when pattern line up in a column , as in size at the top of the page .
In pattern - guard form , common sub -expression should achieve the same effect , but it 's quite a bit less obvious .
We should be able to give clear rules for when the avoidance of repeat computation is guaranteed .
Due to type classes , checking for the " same " view pattern must be type - aware ; the same source syntax cannot necessarily be commoned up :
class View a b where view :: a -> b instance View Int
Int where view x = x instance View Int String where view _ = " hi " -- should not be commoned , even though they 're syntactically the same , -- because they are different uses of the overloaded function f ( view -> 1 ) = 1 f ( view -> " hi " ) = 2
Exhaustiveness / Redundancy .
It is hard to check for completeness of pattern matching ; and likewise for overlap .
But guards already make both of these hard ; and GADTs make completeness tricky too .
So matters are not much worse than before .
Features views can have
In comparing the different views proposals below , it will be useful to have terminology for some features of views .
Value input feature
Our proposal has the value input feature : the view function can be passed parameters ; and those those parameters can mention variables bound by patterns to the left .
For example , this permits a view function itself to be passed as an argument , so patterns , in a sense , become first class .
Implicit Maybe feature
Our proposal has the implicit Maybe feature : the syntax expr => pat permits the programmer to elide the Just , for example when using partial views .
Transparent ordinary Patterns
Our proposal does not have the transparent ordinary patterns feature : view patterns are written differently than ordinary patterns .
There are pros and cons both ways :
The advantage of having transparent ordinary patterns is that you can replace a concrete datatype with an abstract type and a view without changing client code .
A disadvantage is that view patterns can do arbitrary computation , perhaps expensive , so it 's good to have a syntactic marker that some computation beyond ordinary pattern matching may be going on .
Another disadvantage is that transparent ordinary patterns require a larger language extension than just a new form of pattern , so that certain names may be declared to be view constructors for a type .
We consider our proposal 's implicit - view - function syntax ( -> pat ) to be a nice compromise between the two alternatives .
Nesting
Our proposal has the nesting feature : view patterns nest inside other patterns , and other patterns nest inside them .
Nesting is perhaps the biggest practical difference between view patterns and pattern guards .
Integration with type classes
Our proposal integrates with type classes : an single view function can decompose multiple different data types , and the type class constraints are propagated to the user of the view .
Related work
Wadler 's paper was the first concrete proposal .
It proposed a top - level view declaration , together with functions in both directions between the view type and the original type , which are required to be mutually inverse .
This allows view constructors to be used in expressions as well as patterns , which seems cool .
Unfortunately this dual role proved problematic for equational reasoning , and every subsequent proposal restricted view constructors to appear in patterns only .
This proposal is substantially more complicated than the one above ; in particular it requires new form of top - level declaration for a view type .
For example :
view Backwards a of [ a ] = [ a ] ` Snoc ` a | Nil where backwards [ ] =
Nil backwards ( x : [ ] ) = [ ]
` Snoc ` x backwards ( x1 : ( xs ` Snoc ` xn ) ) = ( x1 : xs ) ` Snoc ` xn
Furthermore , it is in some ways less expressive than the proposal here ; the ( n+k ) pattern , Erlang bits pattern , and regexp examples are not definable , because all rely on the value input feature .
I think this proposal is substantially the same as " Pattern matching and abstract data types " , Burton and Cameron , JFP 3 ( 2 ) , Apr 1993 .
Okasaki 's design is very similar to Burton et al's , apart from differences due to the different host language .
Again , the value input feature is not supported .
Erwig 's proposal for active patterns renders the Set example like this :
data Set a = Empty | Add a ( Set a ) pat Add ' x _ =
Add y s => if x == y then Add y s else let Add ' x t = s in Add x ( Add y t ) delete x ( Add ' x s ) = s delete x s = s
This requires a new top - leven declaration form pat ; and I do n't think it 's nearly as easy to understand as the current proposal .
Notably , in the first equation for delete it's hard to see that the second x is a bound occurrence ; this somehow follows from the pat declaration .
Still the proposal does support the value input feature .
Active Destructors ( ADs ) are defined by a new form of top - level declaration .
Where we'd write
sing :: [ a ] -> a option sing [ x ] = x
The equivalent active destructor would be
Sing x match [ x ]
Here match is the keyword , and Sing is the AD .
ADs are quite like view patterns : the can do computation , and can fail to match .
But they are definitely not normal Haskell functions , and need their own form of top - level declaration .
They even have a special form of type to describe them .
The value - input feature is supported , but only via a sort of mode declaration ( indicated by a down - arrow ) on the new form of type .
They also introduce a combining form for ADs , to make a kind of and - pattern .
For example , suppose we had
Head x match ( x : _ )
Tail x match ( _ : xs ) f :: [ a ] -> [ a ] f (( Head x ) @ ( Tail ys ) ) = x : x : ys
Here ( Head x ) @( Tail ys ) is a pattern that matches both ( Head x ) and ( Tail ys ) against the argument , binding x and ys respectively .
We can model that with view patterns :
headV ( x : xs ) = Just x headV [ ] = Nothing tailV ( x : xs ) = Just xs tailV [ ] = Nothing f ( both -> ( headV => x , tailV => ys ) ) = x : x : ys
An alternative to duplicating the value is to compose the functions :
( @ ) :: ( a -> Maybe b ) -> ( a -> Maybe c ) -> a ->
Maybe ( b , c ) ( f @ g ) x = do { b <- f x ; c <- g x ; return ( b , c ) } f :: [ a ] -> [ a ] f ( headV @ tailV -> ( x , ys ) ) = x : x : ys
This is a little clumsier : the " @ " combines functions , with a kind of positional binding ; the pattern ( x , ys ) is separated from the combiner so that it 's less clear that headV binds x and tailV binds y .
This paper describes pattern guards , but it also introduces transformational patterns .
( Although it is joint - authored , the transformational - pattern idea is Martin's . )
Transformational patterns are very close to what we propose here .
In particular , view functions are ordinary Haskell functions , so that the only changes are to patterns themselves .
There are two main differences ( apart from syntax ) .
First , transformational patterns did n't have the value input feature , althought it'd be easy to add ( indeed that 's what we 've done ) .
Second , transformational patterns as described by Erwig do no stripping of the Maybe ( see " Possible extension 2 " above ) .
Simon started this design discussion after talking to Don Syme about F#'s active patterns , which serve a very similar purpose .
These combine both “ total ” discrimination ( views ) and “ partial ” discrimination ( implicit maybe ) into one mechanism .
It does this by embedding the names of discriminators in the names of matching functions , via “ values with structured names ” .
Sample uses include matching on .NET objects and XML .
Here is a full paper describing the design , by Don Syme , Gregory Neverov , and James Margetson ( April 2007 ) .
The feature is implemented in F# 1.9 .
Some code snippets are below .
let ( | Rect | ) ( x : complex ) = ( x .
RealPart , x . ImaginaryPart ) let ( | Polar | ) ( x : complex ) = ( x .
Magnitude , x .
Phase ) let mulViaRect c1 c2 = match c1 , c2 with | Rect ( ar , ai ) , Rect ( br , bi ) ->
Complex .
mkRect ( ar * br - ai * bi , ai * br + bi * ar ) let mulViaPolar c1 c2 = match c1 , c2 with | Polar ( r1 , th1 ) , Polar ( r2 , th2 ) ->
Complex .
mkPolar ( r1 * r2 , th1 + th2 ) let mulViaRect2 ( Rect ( ar , ai ) ) ( Rect ( br , bi ) ) = Complex .
mkRect ( ar * br - ai * bi , ai * br + bi * ar ) let mulViaPolar2 ( Polar ( r1 , th1 ) ) ( Polar ( r2 , th2 ) ) = Complex .
mkPolar ( r1 * r2 , th1 + th2 )
And for views :
open System let ( | Named | Array | Ptr | Param |) ( typ : System .
Type ) = if typ .
IsGenericType then Named ( typ . GetGenericTypeDefinition ( ) , typ .
GetGenericArguments ( ) ) elif not typ .
HasElementType then Named ( typ , [ | | ] ) elif typ .
IsArray then Array ( typ . GetElementType ( ) , typ .
GetArrayRank ( ) ) elif typ .
Is ByRef then Ptr ( true , typ . GetElementType ( ) ) elif typ .
Is Pointer then Ptr ( false , typ . GetElementType ( ) ) elif typ .
IsGenericParameter then Param ( typ .
GenericParameterPosition , typ . GetGenericParameterConstraints ( ) ) else failwith " MSDN says this can't happen " let rec freeVarsAcc typ acc = match typ with | Named ( con , args ) ->
Array .
fold_right freeVarsAcc args acc | Array ( arg , rank ) -> freeVarsAcc arg acc | Ptr ( _ , arg ) -> freeVarsAcc arg acc | Param ( pos , cxs ) ->
Array .
fold_right freeVarsAcc cxs ( typ :: acc )
Scala is an OO language with lots of functional features .
It has algebraic data types and pattern matching .
It also has a form of view called extractors , which are pretty similar to view patterns , albeit in OO clothing .
Notably , by packaging a constructor and an extractor in a class , they can use the same class name in both expressions and terms , implicitly meaning " use the constructor in expressions , and use the extractor in patterns " .
The paper does a comparative evaluation of various OO paradigms for matching , and concludes that case expressions and extractors work pretty well .
Pattern synonyms
Pattern synonyms are a requested Haskell Prime feature .
John Reppy had the same idea years ago for Standard ML ; see Abstract value constructors , Reppy & Aiken , TR 92-1290 , Cornell , June 1992 .
The one way in which pattern synonyms are better than view patterns is thatn they define by - construction bi-directional maps .
Example
data Term = Var String | Term String [ Term ] -- ' const ' introduces a pattern synonym const Plus a b = Term " + " [ a , b ] f :: Term ->
Term f ( Plus a b ) = Plus ( f a ) ( f b ) f ... = ...
With pattern views , we'd have to write two functions for the " plus " view :
plus :: Term -> Term ->
Term plus a b = Term " + " [ a , b ] isPlus :: Term -> Maybe2 Term Term is Plus ( Term " + " [ a , b ] ) = Just2 a b is Plus other = Nothing f :: Term ->
Term f ( is Plus -> a b ) = plus ( f a ) ( f b )
But perhaps that is not so bad .
Pattern synonyms also require a new form of top level declaration ; and are much more limited than view patterns ( by design they cannot do computation ) .
First Class Patterns is an approach that attempts to add the minimum of syntax to the language which --- in combination with pattern combinators written within the language --- can achieve everything and more that Haskell patterns can do .
They have the value - input feature .
The advantages are 1 ) They are simpler than Haskell 's patterns ; 2 ) Patterns are first class .
3 ) The binding mechanism ( the pattern binder ) is orthogonal to the the pattern combinators : the hope is that one can stop changing the syntax / semantics of patterns and concentrate on writing the combinators ( as Haskell functions ) .
The disadvantages are as follows : 1 ) An extra syntactic construct that binds variables , the pattern binder , is required .
2 ) Even with pattern binders , simple patterns look clunkier than Haskell 's patterns .
3 ) No attempt is made to check for exhaustiveness of patterns .
4 ) No attempt is made to integrate with Haskell 's patterns , the idea is a proposal for an alternative when one needs more than simple patterns .
The singleton example above would like this :
f = {%sing n} .-> n+1 | >> 0 g = {%sing True} .-> 0 .| {%sing False} .-> 1 |>> 2
First class abstractions
Several proposals suggest first class abstractions rather that first - class patterns .
By a " first class abstraction " I mean a value of type ( something -> something ) with a syntax something like ( \ pattern -> result ) .
The abstraction includes both the pattern and the result .
In contrast , view patterns tackle only the syntax of patterns ; the pattern of a first - class abstraction .
Here are the ones I know of
All these proposals are more or less orthogonal to this one .
For example , Reinke proposes a compositional syntax for lambda abstractions ( \p -> e ) where pattern matching failure on p can be caught and composed with a second abstraction .

None of these proposals say anything about the patterns themselves , which in turn is all this proposal deals with .
Hence orthgonal .
Barry Jay : First class patterns
A yet more ambitious scheme is to treat patterns themselves as first class , even though they have free ( binding ) variables .
This is the approach that Barry Jay has taken in his very interesting project on the pattern calculus .

The observations from Okasaki : Breadth - First Numbering - Lessons ... suggest that not having abstract pattern matching ( for sequences ) can indeed have great impact on the abstractions functional programmers can think of .
The abstractional power views offer can also be put to good use when designing data structures , as the following papers show

WASHINGTON — Attorney General Michael Mukasey confirmed plans Wednesday to loosen post - Watergate restrictions on the FBI ’s national security and criminal investigations , saying the changes were necessary to improve the bureau ’s ability to detect terrorists .
Mukasey said he expected criticism of the new rules because “ they expressly authorize the FBI to engage in intelligence collection inside the United States . ”
However , he said the criticism would be misplaced because the bureau has long had authority to do so .

( VOAvideo of US , Poland Sign Missile Defense Deal )
American plans for missile defense bases in bordering nations infuriate Russia , and the US has had to bend over backwards to push through the Polish and Czech sites over the objections of those nation 's populace - even going so far as to offer Poland US troops and air - defense missiles on their border with Russia .
But why is the Bush administration pushing so hard for a defense against a so - far entirely hypothetical threat from Iran and to have bases for missiles that do n't work ?
Phil Coyle , the Pentagon 's former top weapons tester ( .pdf ) , says it 's all for nothing .
" The system proposed for Poland and the Czech Republic does n't exist , has never been tested , and has no demonstrated effectiveness to defend Europe or the U.S. under realistic operational conditions , " Coyle contends in an exclusive conversation with DANGER ROOM .
He says that even our existing missile defenses , installed in Alaska , could n't stop more than one or two rudimentary missiles from , say , Iran .
" For these reasons the U.S. BMD system proposed for Europe is causing strife with Russia for nothing . "
Well , not exactly for nothing .
Even if the proposed European missile defense bases are massively expensive and inflammatory White Elephants , both the Bush administration and the neoconservative hawks who think - tanked their plans feel they can get some very useful things ( for them ) out of those multi-billion boondoggles .
For one thing , neocon elements close to the Bush administration are already advocating spurning international treaties against weapons in space and pushing for the return of Reagan 's " Brilliant Pebbles " program .
Such a program would inevitably be a threat to Russia 's deterrent force whether the ground - based systems are or not .
Significantly , the Russians are ahead of the Western public in noticing that little detail .
Take for example the influential neoconservative Heritage Foundation think - tank .
Any bold emphasis is mine .
This is no time for the U.S. to slow the pace of developing and deploying effective defenses against ballistic missiles .
Indeed , the Bush Administration and Congress need to accelerate the effort by focusing on developing and deploying the systems that offer the greatest capability .
A detailed proposal for proceeding with the most effective systems was issued by the Independent Working Group on missile defense in June 2006 .
[3 ]
The report specifically refers to space - based and sea - based defenses as the most effective components of the lay­ered missile defense system design advocated by the Bush Administration .
While the sea - based systems have continued to make progress in recent years , the effort to develop and deploy space - based interceptors has languished .
... on May 20 , 2003 , the White House released a description of a presidential directive signed earlier by President Bush that related to his policy for developing and deploying a layered mis­sile defense system as soon as possible to defend the people and territory of the United States , U.S. troops deployed abroad , and U.S. allies and friends .
[ 8 ]
When fielded , this layered defense will be able to intercept ballistic missiles in the boost ( ascent ) , midcourse , and terminal phases of flight .
The plans , in other words , require Aegis - equipped vessels or platform loaded with interceptors stationed just off America 's coast and " Brilliant Pebbles " constellations of space - based interceptors in clear violation of international treaties on weaponizing space .
The Heritage Foundation 's view is that the US populace should be deceived about this by doublespeak - a propoganda campaign to say that since ballistic missiles already cross into space , space is already weaponized and so hanging a whole bunch of new weaponry in orbit wo n't make a difference - while extra money is poured into space - based weaponry .
Now Russia is n't a guilt - free state by a long chalk , and it is n't my purpose today to apologize for its many failings - but as Putin pointed out when he asserted that the new US missile defense systems will turn Europe back into a confrontational frontline between two great powers , " Let 's not talk as if on one side we are dealing with pure , white and fluffy partners and on the other side with a monster that has just left the forest . "
Of course this planning is inflammatory , and of course it freaks the Russians out .
They 're watching the neocons plan quite openly to destabilize the balance of deterrence between two nations with over 12,000 nuclear warheads each , while all the time U.S. hawks push for NATO membership of nations they originally promised Russia would n't host NATO troops ever .
It 's clearly not in Russia 's national interests to accept this and when has any never ever not acted in its own perceived national interest ?
But even then , the Russians originally tried to negotiate with the Bush administration , to dissolve the confrontation with diplomacy .
They offered the U.S. the use of a radar base in Ajerbaijan which is actually better placed for early warning notification of launches from the Middle East and Asia than the Czech site .
They offered a multiple - partner co-operative venture , a sort of " NATO for missile defense " where any nation who wished could join and partake of a mutual umbrella of ABM coverage which might one day protect the whole world against nuclear conflicts .
The U.S. turned them down flat because they wished to be the only keyholder .
Like so much of neocon planning , it 's all about that will - o- the - wisp , " global hegemony " .
By encircling Russia with military allies , planning a massively layered ABM system which will fatally undermine Russia 's deterrence and by trying to exclude Russia from influence over it's own geopolitical backyard in a way America would never allow for its own , the neoconservatives plan is intended to prevent Russia ever reclaiming superpower status and to ensure Europe remains reliant on American military and economic might .
What they never seem to have contemplated is that Russia might make moves to stymie them or that some European states might object to being consigned to to America 's perpetual shadow .
The phrase " it 'll be a cakewalk " is n't just a slogan for these folks , it 's an entire way of wishful thinking .
John McCain is a keen supporter of that wishful thinking and " strongly supports " missile defenses " to hedge against potential threats from possible strategic competitors like Russia and China " .
He also strongly supports continued poking of the Russian bear with blunt sticks which can only annoy it .
Should he become President the blind - to - the - facts neoconservative push for hegemony will continue under his leadership and the world will become a more unsafe place .
About this series
This is the first in a series of occasional articles looking at how skyrocketing oil prices are transforming lives in Southern California and around the world .
--
The more expensive oil gets , the more Katherine Carver ’s life shrinks .
She ’s given up RV trips .
She stays home most weekends .
She ’s scrapped her twice - a- month volunteer stint at a Malibu wildlife refuge -- the trek from her home in Palmdale just got too expensive .
Advertisement
How much higher would fuel prices have to go before she quit her job ?
Already , the 170 - mile round - trip commute to her job with Los Angeles County Child Support Services in Commerce is costing her close to $ 1,000 a month -- a fifth of her salary .
It ’s got the 55 - year - old thinking about retirement .
“ It ’s definitely pushing me to that point , ” Carver said .
The point could be closer than anyone thinks .
Three months ago , when oil was around $ 108 a barrel , a few Wall Street analysts began predicting that it could rise to $ 200 .
Many observers scoffed at the forecasts as sensational , or motivated by a desire among energy companies and investors to drive prices higher .
Advertisement
But with oil closing above $ 140 a barrel Friday , more experts are taking those predictions seriously -- and shuddering at the inflation - fueled chaos that $ 200 - a - barrel crude could bring .
They foresee fundamental shifts in the way we work , where we live and how we spend our free time .
“ You ’d have massive changes going on throughout the economy , ” said Robert Wescott , president of Keybridge Research , a Washington economic analysis firm .
“ Some activities are just plain going to be shut down . ”
Besides the obvious effect $ 7 - a - gallon gasoline would have on commuters , automakers , airlines , truckers and shipping firms , $ 200 oil would drive up the price of a broad spectrum of products : Insecticides and hand lotions , cosmetics and food preservatives , shaving cream and rubber cement , plastic bottles and crayons -- all have ingredients derived from oil .
The pain would probably be particularly intense in Southern California , which is known for its long commutes and high cost of living .
Advertisement
“ Throughout our history , we have grown on the assumption that energy costs would be low , ” said Michael Woo , a former Los Angeles city councilman and a current member of the city Planning Commission .
“ Now that those assumptions are shifting , it changes assumptions about housing , cars and how cities grow . ”
Push prices up fast enough , he said , and “ it would be the urban - planning equivalent of an earthquake . ”
Consumers
With every penny hike in the price of gas costing American consumers about $ 1 billion a year , sharply higher pump prices would lead to “ significant bankruptcies and store closings , ” said Scott Hoyt , director of consumer economics at Moody ’s Economy.com .
Advertisement
Consumer spending has held up surprisingly well in the face of skyrocketing pump prices -- bolstered in part , perhaps , by federal tax rebates .
But the same day the government reported a 0.8 % rise in May consumer spending , a research firm said consumer confidence had plunged to its lowest level since 1980 -- hinting at the catastrophic effect another big gas price surge could have on retailers and customers .
“ The purchasing power of the American people would be kicked in the teeth so darned hard by $ 200 - a - barrel oil that they wo n’t have the ability to buy much of anything , ” said S. David Freeman , president of the L.A. Board of Harbor Commissioners and author of the 2007 book “ Winning Our Energy Independence . ”
BIGresearch of Worthington , Ohio , said more than half of Californians in a recent survey said they were driving less because of high gas prices .
Almost 42 % said they had reduced vacation travel and 40 % said they were dining out less .
If any retailers would benefit , it would be those on the Internet .
In a recent survey by Harris Interactive , one - third of adults said high gas prices had made them more likely to shop online to avoid driving .
Advertisement
Restaurant operators such as Brinker International , which owns the Chili’s and Romano ’s Macaroni Grill chains , are suffering and are likely to struggle even more as consumers look for ways to reduce spending .
Fast - food chains would n’t be immune , experts say , although they might fare better as families downscale their dining choices .
Vehicle sales , too , would probably continue to tank .
Sales of new cars , sport utility vehicles and light trucks fell more than 18 % in California in the first quarter compared with a year earlier .
Although some consumers have been shopping for smaller , more fuel - efficient vehicles , many dealers are demanding premiums for gas - sipping hybrids , wiping out much of the financial advantage of buying one .
Nationwide , $ 200 oil and $ 7 gasoline would force Americans to take 10 million vehicles off the roads over the next four years , Jeff Rubin , chief economist at CIBC World Markets , wrote in a recent report .
As for the state ’s beleaguered housing market , prices are falling faster in areas requiring long commutes -- such as Lancaster and Palmdale -- than in neighborhoods closer to job centers .
Advertisement
Sky - high gas prices “ would basically reorient society to where proximity would be more valuable , ” said Tom Gilligan , finance professor at USC .
Americans may also feel the effects of a rise in energy - related crime .
Ads for locking gas caps are becoming more prevalent .
Restaurant owners are complaining that thieves are helping themselves to used barrels of cooking oil , which can be home - brewed into biodiesel fuel .
Transportation
Workers stuck with long commutes and gas - guzzling cars would look increasingly to public transit , experts say .
Advertisement
Already Californians ’ mobility is being curbed .
Traffic on the state ’s freeways fell almost 4 % in April compared with a year earlier , and ridership on many subway and bus lines operated by the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has risen in recent months .
But a huge influx of riders would strain aspects of the system , MTA says , noting that many buses are overcrowded at rush hour now .
Quickly adding capacity to meet demand from new riders would n’t be easy , because new buses cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take up to two years to deliver .
Transit advocate Kymberleigh Richards said new riders on popular routes such as Wilshire Boulevard , Vermont Avenue or Sherman Way in the San Fernando Valley “ are going to have a bit of a culture shock .
It ’s a different world to be using public transit when you ’re used to being in your own vehicle by yourself . ”
Advertisement
Just how many drivers would become public - transit riders if oil surges to $ 200 a barrel is hard to predict , but there ’s a big pool of potential customers .
About 87 % of Southern Californians commute by car , according to 2005 data from transportation expert Alan Pisarski .
That compares with 63 % in New York and its environs .
Travelers can also expect much fuller airplanes and much more expensive flights -- when they ’re available at all .
Delta Air Lines Inc. , for example , recently said it was cutting about 13 % of its flights from Los Angeles International Airport to save fuel .
It also could mean shifting flights from outlying airports such as Ontario to LAX to cut overhead costs , said Jack Kyser , chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp .
Carriers probably would also trim flights in highly competitive air corridors such as L.A. to the San Francisco Bay Area .
Even the cost of getting away from it all on Santa Catalina Island would go up .
Greg Bombard , president of the Catalina Express ferry service , has trimmed schedules , raised fares and reduced hiring to make up for fuel costs that have risen sevenfold since 2002 .
Another big increase and he says he ’ll have to ask state regulators , who control his rates , to OK another fare hike .
Advertisement
Trade
The fee increases on the ferry would be nothing compared with the added cost of transoceanic shipping if oil goes to $ 200 .
Some experts say high energy costs are altering global trade and slowing the pace of globalization .
It takes about 7,000 tons of bunker - fuel to fill the tanks of a 5,000 - container cargo ship for a trip from Shanghai to Los Angeles .
Over the last year and half , the cost of that fuel has jumped 87 % to $ 552 a ton , according to the World Shipping Council , boosting the cost of a fill - up to more than $ 3.8 million .
“ To put things in perspective , today ’s extra shipping cost from East Asia is the equivalent of imposing a 9 % tariff on East Asian goods entering North America , ” said Rubin of CIBC World Markets .
“ At $ 200 per barrel , the tariff equivalent rate will rise to 15 % . ”
Advertisement
If oil continues to rise from current levels , officials at the Port of Los Angeles believe West Coast ports would gain business because they are 10 to 12 days ’ sailing time from Asia , versus the 18 - to - 20 - day route from Asia to the East Coast through the Panama Canal .
But local ports could lose business if shipping costs get so out of hand that companies begin shifting production back to North America from Asia -- something that ’s happening in the steel industry , Rubin said .
Local distribution patterns could change too .
Stephen Gaddis , chief executive of Pacific Cheese Co. , a Hayward , Calif. , cheese processing and packaging firm , thinks high fuel prices will push restaurants , retailers and food manufacturers to look for suppliers closer to their operations .
“ Local sourcing is ideal .
You wo n’t pay as much for freight , and when you use less fuel it ’s better for the environment , ” Gaddis said .
Advertisement
Soaring diesel prices will make companies rethink whether they should have large , centralized plants or build smaller ones around the country .
That ’s what Pacific Cheese is doing .
It ’s building a packaging plant in Texas to be closer to one of its larger suppliers and expects to serve its Southwestern clients from there .
In the near future , however , consumers can expect to pay for the higher cost of producing food and moving it around the country , say food executives , farmers and economists .
Even having a deep - dish pizza with extra cheese brought to your door costs more now that chains such as Pizza Hut are charging for delivery .
The workplace
Advertisement
Dramatically higher transportation costs would usher in an era of virtual mobility , or zero mobility , for many workers .
“ We ’re seeing companies go to four - day workweeks , place increased emphasis on working at home , show bigger interest in setting up satellite offices -- anything that gets commute times down and gets people off the road , ” said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group in San Jose .
Videoconferencing , touted as “ the next big thing ” for years , would finally have its day , thanks to improved technology and a desperation to cut corporate travel budgets .
Telecommuting , or working from home , is easier than ever because of the spread of high - speed Internet access , said Jonathan Spira , chief analyst at Basex Inc. , a business research firm in New York .
In particular , workers in “ knowledge ” jobs that can be performed with computers and phones would benefit .
Advertisement
But Gilligan of USC noted that lower - income workers tend to be in jobs that do n’t favor telecommuting , such as retail and food service .
“ These are the same people who are already being creamed by the mortgage crisis , ” he said .
“ The impacts of energy price increases are highly disparate . ”
Although white - collar workers may be able to telecommute , they could also take a serious financial hit because soaring energy prices tend to wreak havoc on the stock market .
The explosion of 401 ( k ) plans and similar retirement accounts in the last few decades -- and the decline of traditional pensions with guaranteed payouts -- have tied workers ’ financial futures more closely to stocks than they were during the 1970s oil shocks .
A prolonged Wall Street downturn could mean a no - frills retirement , or none at all .
Upsides
Advertisement
It would n’t all be bad , of course .
Some industries could boom , providing jobs and tax dollars .
California has seen a jump in drilling activity as oil companies try to extract more crude from the state ’s fields .
Regulators expect a record 4,000 wells to be drilled in the state this year .
“ Every rig and every crew that ’s available is working right now , ” said Hal Bopp , the state ’s oil and gas supervisor .
And as rising oil prices make alternative - fuel vehicles more cost - effective , California companies such as Tesla Motors Inc. , which recently began production of a $ 100,000 all - electric sports car , could become important leaders in an emerging industry .
Tourist attractions may also see an upswing in local business as families look for less - expensive vacation alternatives close to home .
A recent survey by travel insurer Access America found that 26 % of Americans would cut back on recreational travel as a first response to higher gas prices .
Advertisement
In Southern California , with its many natural wonders , theme parks and other attractions , the prospect of a “ staycation ” may be less disappointing than for a resident of , say , Nebraska .
And movies , a staple of the local economy , may prosper as Americans seek escapism and a ( relatively ) cheap night out .
And spending less time stuck in traffic on the 405 ?
Priceless .
“ More carpooling , fewer people on the freeways , more telecommuting -- in many ways , what would happen is what people have been trying to make happen for a long time , ” USC ’s Gilligan said .

Business , C1
Take your everyday metal moni motoglider , trick it out with a custom battery pack and you 've got the ElectraFlyer C , a small electric airplane that debuted at the AirVenture show in Oshkosh , Wisconsin , last week .
The plane , which received its airworthiness certificate in April , features a 5.6 kWh lithium battery with a projected life cycle ( the number of times it can be depleted and recharged ) of 1,000 cycles .
The battery has a max weight of 78 pounds and can be custom - built to fit the available space in an airplane .
It provides juice for a motor driving a 45 - inch superlight Power Fin propeller made of a foam core surrounded by an outer shell of carbon fiber and glass fabric .
Once in the air , the ElectraFlyer C cruises at 70 miles per hour .
Top speed is 90 mph and the stall speed is 45 .
The plane can fly for 90 to 120 minutes before the battery needs recharging .
When the battery winds down , just plug it into a 110V outlet – your house is full of them – and you 're good to go in just more than six hours .
Bump the voltage to 220 and you 're flying again in two hours .
The people at Electric Aircraft Corporation say the small plane carries some big benefits .
The motor is nearly silent , which means no earplugs for pilots , and brings the potential for flying into new sites .
And then there 's the a dramatic improvement in what the company calls " neighbor relations " – no droning engines to drive them nuts .
Electric motors do n't produce a lot of soot or pollution , and overhauls are a snap .
And by combining this motor with the ElectraFlyer 's slow turning propeller , you 've got a flight that is practically vibration free .
But the most compelling sell is an economic one :
The company estimates that " refueling " the plane with a full charge of the battery will cost , on average , a whopping sixty cents .

SAN FRANCISCO  " What are you doing ? "
That question is the rocket fuel for Twitter — a hot social - network service that lets you tell people what you are up to at any given moment of the day — via cellphone , instant messenger , or the Web .
Never heard of it , you say ?
" What are you doing ? " is the question Twitter asks " Twitterers " to answer in a simple text message as they connect with friends , co-workers or the wider world .
Twitterers " tweet " about everything from what they had for lunch to how much they enjoyed their latest Netflix DVD .
If that sounds silly and incredibly narrow at first , do n't worry , you 're not alone .
" When people hear about Twitter , their immediate reaction is that it's the simplest and stupidest idea in the world , " says co-founder Biz Stone .
" They do not want to know that their brother is eating a hot dog right now , " he says .
" But then they discover that their friends are on it .
And so are the L.A. Fire Department , NASA and JetBlue .
Then they get it . "
Boy , do they .
Twitter has become so popular , so fast , that keeping up with its fast - growing user base is a real issue .
So many people now use Twitter to update friends that the system often crashes .
That could be about to change .
Twitter executives are working feverishly to solve the problem through a new investment ( $ 15 million , according to several tech blogs ) from Spark Capital and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and putting off expansion plans ( i.e. , making money ) until the network issues are resolved .
" Twitter took off really quickly , and honestly , we were surprised and had to play a lot of catch - up , " says Stone .
" Now we 're focusing 100 % on reliability . "
Twitter no longer exists just for friends to tell friends that they 're on their way to the gym or out to eat .
It 's become a kind of hypergrapevine news resource — a way of instant messaging your circle of friends about your interests ( " Did you hear what Obama said today ? " ) or consumer rants and raves ( " The customer service at Zappos.com rocks ! " ) .
The service is even credited with breaking news about fires and other natural disasters .
Twitterers , as they call themselves , post their updates at Twitter.com or by using text - or instant - message tools .
A cottage industry of websites — including TweetScan , FriendFeed and Summize ( which Twitter recently acquired and renamed Twitter Search ) — have popped up to service the Twitterers and their tweets , by making it easier to search through the chatter for specific topics or people .
Tweets of gold Savvy businesses see gold in the information : Consumers are talking about them on Twitter , and they get to respond more quickly than ever .
" In the past , companies would hire a market research firm to understand their audience , " says Mike Hudack , CEO of Blip.tv , a New York - based video website .
" Now we use Twitter to get the fastest , most honest research any company ever heard — the good , bad and ugly — and it does n't cost a cent , " he says .
With Twitter , Hudack can monitor every mention of Blip.tv and see exactly what people are saying .
He can drop notes about things the company is thinking of doing and get instant feedback about whether they 're worth pursuing .
To get started on Twitter , you begin by searching to see who else is using the service and ask permission to " follow " their postings .
Twitter subscriber Joe Rogel — known as Granola Joe on Twitter — says the service is a great way to reach those who might otherwise be inaccessible .
Blip and other young companies such as shoe retailer Zappos.com are on Twitter .
So are food retailer Whole Foods and cable company Comcast , whose customer service issues — especially online — are legendary .
Frank Eliason , a customer service manager for Comcast , spends his day communicating with Twitterers about the company — hoping to resolve issues .
Comcast is n't on Twitter to turn around the firm 's customer service perception issues but simply to " build better relationships with our customers , " he says .
Whole Foods , which started using Twitter in June , just wants to hear what people are saying about the company .
" It 's amazing how many people say , ' I 'm off to Whole Foods for lunch , ' " says Slayton Carter , Whole Foods ' online community development coordinator .
Getting beyond the tech crowd Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh uses Twitter to make himself available to the public .
He says he receives up to 200 tweets daily .
" For people who follow us on Twitter , it gives them more depth into what we 're like , and my own personality , " he says .
Zappos tested a new site , zeta.zappos.com , recently on Twitter , " and we were able to make some improvements based on the comments , " says Hsieh .
When Twitter co-founders Stone , Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams began working on their new Web idea , Dorsey suggested a site that emulated the " status " feature of instant - messaging services , which lets people know whether you 're online .
Twitter also adopted the short character limit of text messages and IMs .
As Twitter users know , if you can't say it in 140 characters or less , your idea wo n't get out there .
And since Twitter combines use of the Web , IMs and text messaging , measuring the site 's popularity is tough .
The privately held company does not disclose numbers .
Traditional online measurement firms report only Web usage , which is only half of the equation because so much of Twitter usage is via mobile phones .
Still , Web measurement firm Compete says Twitter 's audience grew to 2 million users in May from 200,000 in May 2007 .
Not everyone loves Twitter .
Phil Leigh , an analyst for Inside Digital Media , says he goes on the site with an open mind and just does n't get it .
" That some guy saw Wall - E and thought it was a great movie is wonderful , but it 's just not that interesting to me .
If somebody has something important to say , they can say it in an e-mail . "
Allen Weiner , an analyst at Gartner , says that Twitter 's audience right now is limited to the " cognoscenti , " but that it 's a testament to Twitter 's growing popularity that so many third - party applications ( such as Summize and FriendFeed ) have sprung up to feed on its success .
Many news and media outlets ( from cable giant CNN to tech blogs such as Techcrunch ) have responded to the popularity of Twitter by offering instant news updates to share with friends .
This adds to Twitter 's growing stature , says Weiner .
Twitter 's problem is keeping its users happy .
So many people go on it that at times — often , in fact — the system crashes , and Twitter is unusable .
Stone and Dorsey say the problem is that Twitter became more popular than they ever envisioned and that the system they created was n't built for masses .
An influx of engineers is working to rebuild it , and they say the situation should be resolved within the year .
Bijan Sabet , a general partner at Spark Capital , says the cash infusion should help solve the problem .
But Weiner does n't think it will go far enough .
" I 'd be stunned if by the end of the year , somebody does n't buy Twitter , " says Weiner .
" They need the kind of global infrastructure a big company could provide that would make it 100 % reliable . "
A flock of chirps Stone says the secret of Twitter 's success is realizing that folks do n't want to use the Web for private conversations but public ones .
Nearly 90 % of Twitter users make their updates public , so everyone can read them .
" It encourages other people to see what they 're saying , " says Stone .
" People are n't doing one - to - one e-mail or instant messages anymore .
Just look at comments on MySpace and blogs .
They 're communicating with one another in an open way . "
Just like birds .
In choosing a name for the service , Stone suggested Twitter , and the co-founders jumped for it .
" It 's what birds do when they converge , " says Stone .
" The sound they make is technically defined as a trivial chirp .
How perfect … hear a trivial chirp on your phone , look down and it 's your friend .
During events , you can move as one with your friends , just like birds , because you all know what everyone is up to . "
And if the bird analogy does n't persuade you to use Twitter , we 'll leave the last word to Dorsey : " Is there anyone you care about ?
Twitter is about keeping in touch and making the world smaller . "
So … what are you doing right now ?

How can we ask Republican senators to resist pressure from their right wing and vote against flawed appointees like John Bolton , if we engage in similar rhetoric against Democrats who dissent from our own party line
if we make similar threats to those who buck our party orthodoxy ?
When we lash out at those who share our fundamental values because they have not met the criteria of every single item on our progressive " checklist , " then we are essentially preventing them from thinking in new ways about problems .
we are hamstringing our ability to build a majority .
We wo n't be able to transform the country with such a polarized electorate .
Let me be clear : I am not arguing that the Democrats should trim their sails and be more " centrist . "
try to create the sort of serious , adult , consensus around our problems that can admit Democrats , Republicans and Independents of good will .
speak with the utmost conviction about the great issues of the day without ever belittling those who opposed them , and without denying the limits of their own perspectives .
In that spirit , let me end by saying I do n't pretend to have all the answers to the challenges we face , and I look forward to periodic conversations with all of you in the months and years to come .
I trust that you will continue to let me and other Democrats know when you believe we are screwing up .
And I , in turn , will always try and show you the respect and candor one owes his friends and allies .

Thanks to decreased demand and a strengthening dollar , the price of gasoline has fallen for 30 consecutive days .
After facing rising gasoline prices for the first six and a half months of the year , this recent 9 % decline is coming as a relief to many Americans .
Even with prices down over the last month , we ’re still paying about 36 % more for gas than we were at the same point last year .
Since the first of the year , the price of gas is up over 24 % .
Since hitting an all - time high of $ 4.12 per gallon on July 16 , the national average price of gasoline has slowly declined , and now stands at $ 3.75 .
There are currently only five states reporting an average price above $ 4 per gallon , with Alaska reporting the highest price at $ 4.86 per gallon .
Missouri has the lowest statewide average price at $ 3.50 per gallon .
With the busy summer driving season winding down , the price of gas should continue to fall through autumn .
Based on the declines seen over the past three autumns , we should expect the price of gasoline to fall another 15 to 20 percent .
However , if the price of oil plummets – as many experts are predicting – we could see the price of gasoline fall even further .
Of course , if something were to happen to oil supplies or should geopolitical tensions continue to flair – especially between the United States and Iran – we could see the price of both oil and gas jump back through the roof .
Regardless of what you think might happen over the next several months , just enjoy the fact that you ’re paying less now than you were a month ago .
CRUDE OIL FUTURES CRUDE OIL FUTURES
Dollars per barrel , five trading days NEW YORK 
Crude oil futures made their first foray past $ 115 Wednesday , propelled to a record by concerns about how much gas will be available during the peak summer months .
Inventories of gas fell by 5.5 million barrels last week , according to the Energy Department 's Energy Information Administration , a much bigger decline than forecast by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires .
Light , sweet crude for May delivery responded by rising as high as $ 115.07 on the New York Mercantile Exchange , and later settled up $ 1.14 at a record $ 114.93 a barrel .
At the pump , meanwhile , gas and diesel prices rose to their own records .
The report said crude inventories fell by 2.3 million barrels last week , compared to the gain analysts expected .
Oil prices were also boosted by the falling dollar , which declined to a new low against the euro on Wednesday .
Many investors buy commodities such as oil as a hedge against inflation and a falling greenback .
A weaker dollar also makes oil cheaper to investors overseas .
But the market was torn and traded sharply lower at times due to data deeper in the report showing that the country 's appetite for increasingly expensive gas is declining .
" Demand for gasoline is terrible , " said Phil Flynn , an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago .
Gas demand has fallen an average of 1 % each of the last four weeks compared to the same period last year .
" Demand should be rising this time of year . "
The EIA report also said inventories of distillates , which include heating oil and diesel , unexpectedly rose last week by about 100,000 barrels .
Analysts had expected a sharp decline .
May heating oil futures rose 0.91 cent to settle at $ 3.283 a gallon .
Demand for gasoline has been falling for months as consumers reacted to a series of price records by driving less .
The national average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas rose 1.3 cents Wednesday to a record $ 3.399 a gallon , according to a survey of stations by AAA and the Oil Price Information Service .
That 's 53 cents higher than a year ago , and is expected to keep climbing along with futures prices and as the summer driving season draws near .
The average national price of a gallon of diesel , meanwhile , rose a cent to a record $ 4.129 a gallon , the survey showed .
High prices for diesel — used to fuel most trucks , trains and ships — is a large part of the reason food prices are rising .
Gas and diesel prices are following crude futures , which have risen from about $ 64 a barrel last spring , mostly because of the falling dollar .
Prices also have been supported in recent months by a view that demand for oil remains strong globally , although it may be falling in the United States .
But that could change , if U.S. demand continues to weaken , analysts say .
" We 're seeing a major slowdown in U.S. demand growth , " Flynn said .
Still , analysts expect gas prices to rise higher before they fall .
Many see retail prices peaking around $ 3.65 a gallon next month .
The Energy Department , in a recent forecast , said prices could average as high as $ 3.60 a gallon this summer on a monthly basis , but could spike to $ 4 on a national average basis at times .
In other Nymex trading , May natural gas futures rose 22.8 cents to settle at $ 10.433 per 1,000 cubic feet .

The detection of extra dimensions beyond the familiar four — the three dimensions of space and one of time — would be among the most earth - shattering discoveries in the history of physics .
Now scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Ill. , are designing a new experiment that would investigate tantalizing hints that extra dimensions may indeed exist .
Last year researchers involved in Fermilab ’s MiniBooNE study , which detects elusive subatomic particles called neutrinos , announced that they had found a surprising anomaly .
Neutrinos , which have no charge and very little mass , form out of nuclear reactions and particle decays .
They come in three types , called flavors — electron , muon and tau — and oscillate wildly from one flavor to another as they travel along .
While observing a beam of muon neutrinos generated by one of Fermilab ’s particle accelerators , the MiniBooNE researchers found that an unexpectedly high number of the particles in the low - energy range ( below 475 million electron volts ) had transformed into electron neutrinos .
After a year of analysis , the investigators have failed to come up with a conventional explanation for this so - called low - energy excess .
The mystery has focused attention on an intriguing and very unconventional hypothesis : a fourth kind of neutrino may be bouncing in and out of extra dimensions .
String theorists , who seek to unify the laws of gravity with those of quantum mechanics , have long predicted the existence of extra dimensions .
Some physicists have proposed that nearly all the particles in our universe may be confined to a four - dimensional “ brane ” embedded within a 10 - dimensional “ bulk . ”
But a putative particle called the sterile neutrino , which interacts with other particles only through gravity , would be able to travel in and out of the brane , taking shortcuts through the extra dimensions .
In 2005 Heinrich Päs , now at the University of Dortmund in Germany , Sandip Pakvasa of the University of Hawaii and Thomas J. Weiler of Vanderbilt University predicted that the extradimensional peregrinations of sterile neutrinos would increase the probability of flavor oscillations at low energies — exactly the result found at MiniBooNE two years later .
Energized by the prospect of discovering new laws of physics , the MiniBooNE team soon proposed a follow - up experiment called MicroBooNE that could test the sterile neutrino hypothesis .
The new detector , a cryogenic tank filled with 170 tons of liquid argon , would be able to detect low - energy particles with much greater precision than its predecessor could .
A particle emerging from a neutrino interaction would ionize the argon atoms in its path , inducing currents in arrays of wires at the perimeter of the tank .
Scientists could then pinpoint the trajectory of the particle , allowing them to better distinguish between electron neutrino interactions and other events and thus determine whether there really is an excess of oscillations at low energies .
Estimated to cost about $ 15 million , the MicroBooNE tank would be located near the MiniBooNE detector at Fermilab so that it could observe the same beam of neutrinos .
This past June the lab ’s physics advisory committee approved the design phase for the project ; if all goes well , the detector could begin operating as soon as 2011 .
Researchers hope that MicroBooNE will lead to the development of much larger detectors , containing hundreds of thousands of tons of liquid argon in tanks as big as sports arenas .
Such facilities could search for other hypothesized phenomena such as the extremely rare decay of protons .
“ It ’s a fantastic new technology , ” says Bonnie Fleming , a physicist at Yale University and spokesperson for MicroBooNE .
“ And it ’s crucial for taking the next step in physics . ”

New hire cannon fodder
I recently read Some French Guy ’s lamblast of YCombinator , the start - up - firm firm that doles out angel investing to young kids out of college hoping to be the next Google .
Unfortunately , I ca n’t say I ’m surprised at the state of the ‘ ideal ’ career in software , but I can again reiterate how appalled I am at this frat boy mentality that has infected our culture .
It probably began with Microsoft , but you can see its effect at Apple ( notably Steve Jobs ’ notorious temper ) and I ’m sure it ’s at Google too ( except it ’s far more sinister there . )
If you have recently graduated from college with a CS degree , congratulations , your stock options are just behind that Machine Gun nest .
Why these large firms , and now even places like YCombinator continually think the best way to move forward in software is to hire as many gullible young naive programmers as possible and work them to death is beyond me .
It ’s pretty well known that 80 hour work weeks and inexperience is a guarantee to continually make the same damn mistakes over and over again .
It ’s also an open question as to why new hires let these companies take advantage of them so badly .
Paul Graham had a start up , he begged for angel investing , and his life should show you – what does he do now ?
Well he learned from his experience that designing and building is for chumps , to make the big bucks and sit on your ass you become an angel investor .
Kids will work for pennies .
You can continue to fill their heads with dreams of having the next big idea , even though they are carrying all the risk for you .
Junior developers , whether entrepreneurs or otherwise , are being asked to give up their 20’s , probably the best , most energetic years of their lives , to have a chance at making a dent in someone else ’s bottom line .
( Make note , the one exception here I ’ve seen is 37 Signals 🙂 )
Is it our culture ?
A friend told me after visiting Japan that it was a workaholic culture .
It was considered rude to leave the office before your boss did , and the only way your boss got to be the boss is because he stayed the longest .
So they go in at six in the mornings , leave at twelve at night , get drunk at the bar ( because you ’re expected to go hang out with your friends after work to network ) and do it all over again the next day .
The culture sounded familiar .
Junior designers see lack of sleep as a ‘ badge of honor ’ , they see long hours as proof of their worth .
If another developer stays later than you , drinks those extra cans of redbull developing , well then , by God , he ’s the best coder alive .
Only that he is n’t .
But he is spreading a lifestyle , through adopting it himself , that is counteractive to real progress at the company and lets face it , quality of life .
If Steve works harder than you , then your PHB ( Pointy Haired Boss ) is going to expect his influence to make you work longer and longer hours .
This looks good on paper despite the psychologists all telling us that we get no more work done .
We nerds did n’t really grow up playing sports , but we should n’t be surprised to find out we ’re probably the most competitive people alive .
We ’ll constantly try and outdo each other in our quantity of hours put in in an effort to truly see who is the best hacker .
But have we never stopped to think who truly is benefiting from all these hours ?
Do we get paid more ?
No .
In fact , because many of us are salaried , we ’re effectively paid less .
Are we compensated with faster promotions ?
Possibly – but do n’t forget about that silicon ceiling .
The only person who knows how many hours you ’re putting in is probably just the guy above you – but he makes sure to show just how productive his department is ( via your hard work ) to everyone .
He will always get the spoils .
Who will end up really getting the spoils out of any of YCombinator ’s work ?
Paul Graham .
We ’re the infantry and this is World War I .
The officers , the generals , are actually less knowledgeable of modern warfare than we are because they have n’t seen it .
We see it every day .
We know that hours do n’t turn into value , and we know that faster means slower .
Yet , if we ’re lucky , they might afford us a moments rest before they order us to charge , bayonets mounted , towards that next machine gun nest .
Our wiser calls to bombard it with artillery , or charge it with tanks , go unheeded .
Those are untested technologies , after all , and anyone who does n’t charge a Machine gun nest is a coward and does n’t deserve to be called a hacker .
It ’s a class war between the people who know how to get something done and the people who are slowly realizing they play no more role in modern development .
And I really , honestly , want no part of it .
We mere coders are artists , dreamers , idealists .
But we must face facts – we are unnaturally naive , we believe that one day , somehow , our talent will be recognized and rewarded by some benevolent , all powerful manager .
We refuse to work together because we refuse to acknowledge just how bad it ’s got .
We refuse to ask for more because we refuse to acknowledge how little we ’re getting .
We refuse to stand up for ourselves because we refuse to acknowledge how screwed over we are .
We are the talent , the knowledge workers in today ’s economy , and many of us are fearful of our livelihoods being lost to some cheaper person over seas .
Some escape , some make it .
Make no mistake – a coder CAN change the world .
But I have yet to see a coder escape and not turn around and punish the next generation .
It seems that once a person realizes just how screwed over they ’ve been , they ca n’t wait to screw over the next guy .
Like hazing in college .
There ’s little I can do to convince you .
Little I can do to change the culture , really , because we are that competitive , and we are that arrogant to believe that we would never be screwed over like this .
We ’ll never admit that working long hours has sacrificed relationships , family , entertainment , career development , education .
It ’s just ‘ a part of the job ’ .
I can , however , make fun of you for it .
And I think you should do .
So if you take anything else from this , junior developer , it ’s that you do n’t have to put in that extra 10 % .
You do n’t have to stay the extra hours to get ahead .
But you can make a snide comment while walking past the cube of the guy who refuses to leave work .
Maybe one day he ’ll get it , but until then , he ’s machine gun fodder .

One morning in September , 1989 , a former sales representative in his mid-forties entered an examination room with Stanislas Dehaene , a young neuroscientist based in Paris .
Three years earlier , the man , whom researchers came to refer to as Mr. N , had sustained a brain hemorrhage that left him with an enormous lesion in the rear half of his left hemisphere .
He suffered from severe handicaps : his right arm was in a sling ; he could n’t read ; and his speech was painfully slow .
He had once been married , with two daughters , but was now incapable of leading an independent life and lived with his elderly parents .
Dehaene had been invited to see him because his impairments included severe acalculia , a general term for any one of several deficits in number processing .
When asked to add 2 and 2 , he answered “ three . ”
He could still count and recite a sequence like 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , but he was incapable of counting downward from 9 , differentiating odd and even numbers , or recognizing the numeral 5 when it was flashed in front of him .
According to Stanislas Dehaene , humans have an inbuilt “ number sense ” capable of some basic calculations and estimates .
The problems start when we learn mathematics and have to perform procedures that are anything but instinctive .
JOOST SWARTE
To Dehaene , these impairments were less interesting than the fragmentary capabilities Mr. N had managed to retain .
When he was shown the numeral 5 for a few seconds , he knew it was a numeral rather than a letter and , by counting up from 1 until he got to the right integer , he eventually identified it as a 5 .
He did the same thing when asked the age of his seven - year - old daughter .
In the 1997 book “ The Number Sense , ” Dehaene wrote , “ He appears to know right from the start what quantities he wishes to express , but reciting the number series seems to be his only means of retrieving the corresponding word . ”
Dehaene also noticed that although Mr. N could no longer read , he sometimes had an approximate sense of words that were flashed in front of him ; when he was shown the word “ ham , ” he said , “ It ’s some kind of meat . ”
Dehaene decided to see if Mr. N still had a similar sense of number .
He showed him the numerals 7 and 8 .
Mr. N was able to answer quickly that 8 was the larger number — far more quickly than if he had had to identify them by counting up to the right quantities .
He could also judge whether various numbers were bigger or smaller than 55 , slipping up only when they were very close to 55 .
Dehaene dubbed Mr. N “ the Approximate Man . ”
The Approximate Man lived in a world where a year comprised “ about 350 days ” and an hour “ about fifty minutes , ” where there were five seasons , and where a dozen eggs amounted to “ six or ten . ”
Dehaene asked him to add 2 and 2 several times and received answers ranging from three to five .
But , he noted , “ he never offers a result as absurd as 9 . ”
In cognitive science , incidents of brain damage are nature ’s experiments .
If a lesion knocks out one ability but leaves another intact , it is evidence that they are wired into different neural circuits .
In this instance , Dehaene theorized that our ability to learn sophisticated mathematical procedures resided in an entirely different part of the brain from a rougher quantitative sense .
Over the decades , evidence concerning cognitive deficits in brain - damaged patients has accumulated , and researchers have concluded that we have a sense of number that is independent of language , memory , and reasoning in general .
Within neuroscience , numerical cognition has emerged as a vibrant field , and Dehaene , now in his early forties , has become one of its foremost researchers .
His work is “ completely pioneering , ” Susan Carey , a psychology professor at Harvard who has studied numerical cognition , told me .
“ If you want to make sure the math that children are learning is meaningful , you have to know something about how the brain represents number at the kind of level that Stan is trying to understand . ”
Dehaene has spent most of his career plotting the contours of our number sense and puzzling over which aspects of our mathematical ability are innate and which are learned , and how the two systems overlap and affect each other .
He has approached the problem from every imaginable angle .
Working with colleagues both in France and in the United States , he has carried out experiments that probe the way numbers are coded in our minds .
He has studied the numerical abilities of animals , of Amazon tribespeople , of top French mathematics students .
He has used brain - scanning technology to investigate precisely where in the folds and crevices of the cerebral cortex our numerical faculties are nestled .
And he has weighed the extent to which some languages make numbers more difficult than others .
His work raises crucial issues about the way mathematics is taught .
In Dehaene ’s view , we are all born with an evolutionarily ancient mathematical instinct .
To become numerate , children must capitalize on this instinct , but they must also unlearn certain tendencies that were helpful to our primate ancestors but that clash with skills needed today .
And some societies are evidently better than others at getting kids to do this .
In both France and the United States , mathematics education is often felt to be in a state of crisis .
The math skills of American children fare poorly in comparison with those of their peers in countries like Singapore , South Korea , and Japan .
Fixing this state of affairs means grappling with the question that has taken up much of Dehaene ’s career :
What is it about the brain that makes numbers sometimes so easy and sometimes so hard ?
Dehaene ’s own gifts as a mathematician are considerable .
Born in 1965 , he grew up in Roubaix , a medium - sized industrial city near France ’s border with Belgium .
( His surname is Flemish . )
His father , a pediatrician , was among the first to study fetal alcohol syndrome .
As a teen - ager , Dehaene developed what he calls a “ passion ” for mathematics , and he attended the École Normale Supérieure in Paris , the training ground for France ’s scholarly élite .
Dehaene ’s own interests tended toward computer modelling and artificial intelligence .
He was drawn to brain science after reading , at the age of eighteen , the 1983 book “ Neuronal Man , ” by Jean - Pierre Changeux , France ’s most distinguished neurobiologist .
Changeux ’s approach to the brain held out the tantalizing possibility of reconciling psychology with neuroscience .
Dehaene met Changeux and began to work with him on abstract models of thinking and memory .
He also linked up with the cognitive scientist Jacques Mehler .
It was in Mehler ’s lab that he met his future wife , Ghislaine Lambertz , a researcher in infant cognitive psychology .
By “ pure luck , ” Dehaene recalls , Mehler happened to be doing research on how numbers are understood .
This led to Dehaene ’s first encounter with what he came to characterize as “ the number sense . ”
Dehaene ’s work centered on an apparently simple question :
How do we know whether numbers are bigger or smaller than one another ?
If you are asked to choose which of a pair of Arabic numerals — 4 and 7 , say — stands for the bigger number , you respond “ seven ” in a split second , and one might think that any two digits could be compared in the same very brief period of time .
Yet in Dehaene ’s experiments , while subjects answered quickly and accurately when the digits were far apart , like 2 and 9 , they slowed down when the digits were closer together , like 5 and 6 .
Performance also got worse as the digits grew larger : 2 and 3 were much easier to compare than 7 and 8 .
When Dehaene tested some of the best mathematics students at the École Normale , the students were amazed to find themselves slowing down and making errors when asked whether 8 or 9 was the larger number .
Dehaene conjectured that , when we see numerals or hear number words , our brains automatically map them onto a number line that grows increasingly fuzzy above 3 or 4 .
He found that no amount of training can change this .
“ It is a basic structural property of how our brains represent number , not just a lack of facility , ” he told me .
In 1987 , while Dehaene was still a student in Paris , the American cognitive psychologist Michael Posner and colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis published a pioneering paper in the journal Nature .
Using a scanning technique that can track the flow of blood in the brain , Posner ’s team had detailed how different areas became active in language processing .
Their research was a revelation for Dehaene .
“ I remember very well sitting and reading this paper , and then debating it with Jacques Mehler , my Ph.D. adviser , ” he told me .
Mehler , whose focus was on determining the abstract organization of cognitive functions , did n’t see the point of trying to locate precisely where in the brain things happened , but Dehaene wanted to “ bridge the gap , ” as he put it , between psychology and neurobiology , to find out exactly how the functions of the mind — thought , perception , feeling , will — are realized in the gelatinous three - pound lump of matter in our skulls .
Now , thanks to new technologies , it was finally possible to create pictures , however crude , of the brain in the act of thinking .
So , after receiving his doctorate , he spent two years studying brain scanning with Posner , who was by then at the University of Oregon , in Eugene .
“ It was very strange to find that some of the most exciting results of the budding cognitive - neuroscience field were coming out of this small place — the only place where I ever saw sixty - year - old hippies sitting around in tie - dyed shirts ! ” he said .
Dehaene is a compact , attractive , and genial man ; he dresses casually , wears fashionable glasses , and has a glabrous dome of a head , which he protects from the elements with a chapeau de cowboy .
When I visited him recently , he had just moved into a new laboratory , known as NeuroSpin , on the campus of a national center for nuclear - energy research , a dozen or so miles southwest of Paris .
The building , which was completed a year ago , is a modernist composition in glass and metal filled with the ambient hums and whirs and whooshes of brain - scanning equipment , much of which was still being assembled .
A series of arches ran along one wall in the form of a giant sine wave ; behind each was a concrete vault built to house a liquid - helium - cooled superconducting electromagnet .
( In brain imaging , the more powerful the magnetic field , the sharper the picture . )
The new brain scanners are expected to show the human cerebral anatomy at a level of detail never before seen , and may reveal subtle anomalies in the brains of people with dyslexia and with dyscalculia , a crippling deficiency in dealing with numbers which , researchers suspect , may be as widespread as dyslexia .
One of the scanners was already up and running .
“ You do n’t wear a pacemaker or anything , do you ? ”
Dehaene asked me as we entered a room where two researchers were fiddling with controls .
Although the scanner was built to accommodate humans , inside , I could see from the monitor , was a brown rat .
Researchers were looking at how its brain reacted to various odors , which were puffed in every so often .
Then Dehaene led me upstairs to a spacious gallery where the brain scientists working at NeuroSpin are expected to congregate and share ideas .
At the moment , it was empty .
“ We ’re hoping for a coffee machine , ” he said .
Dehaene has become a scanning virtuoso .
On returning to France after his time with Posner , he pressed on with the use of imaging technologies to study how the mind processes numbers .
The existence of an evolved number ability had long been hypothesized , based on research with animals and infants , and evidence from brain - damaged patients gave clues to where in the brain it might be found .
Dehaene set about localizing this facility more precisely and describing its architecture .
“ In one experiment I particularly liked , ” he recalled , “ we tried to map the whole parietal lobe in a half hour , by having the subject perform functions like moving the eyes and hands , pointing with fingers , grasping an object , engaging in various language tasks , and , of course , making small calculations , like thirteen minus four .
We found there was a beautiful geometrical organization to the areas that were activated .
The eye movements were at the back , the hand movements were in the middle , grasping was in the front , and so on .
And right in the middle , we were able to confirm , was an area that cared about number . ”
The number area lies deep within a fold in the parietal lobe called the intraparietal sulcus ( just behind the crown of the head ) .
But it is n’t easy to tell what the neurons there are actually doing .
Brain imaging , for all the sophistication of its technology , yields a fairly crude picture of what ’s going on inside the skull , and the same spot in the brain might light up for two tasks even though different neurons are involved .
“ Some people believe that psychology is just being replaced by brain imaging , but I do n’t think that ’s the case at all , ” Dehaene said .
“ We need psychology to refine our idea of what the imagery is going to show us .
That ’s why we do behavioral experiments , see patients .
It ’s the confrontation of all these different methods that creates knowledge . ”
Dehaene has been able to bring together the experimental and the theoretical sides of his quest , and , on at least one occasion , he has even theorized the existence of a neurological feature whose presence was later confirmed by other researchers .
In the early nineteen - nineties , working with Jean - Pierre Changeux , he set out to create a computer model to simulate the way humans and some animals estimate at a glance the number of objects in their environment .
In the case of very small numbers , this estimate can be made with almost perfect accuracy , an ability known as “ subitizing ” ( from the Latin word subitus , meaning “ sudden ” ) .
Some psychologists think that subitizing is merely rapid , unconscious counting , but others , Dehaene included , believe that our minds perceive up to three or four objects all at once , without having to mentally “ spotlight ” them one by one .
Getting the computer model to subitize the way humans and animals did was possible , he found , only if he built in “ number neurons ” tuned to fire with maximum intensity in response to a specific number of objects .
His model had , for example , a special four neuron that got particularly excited when the computer was presented with four objects .
The model ’s number neurons were pure theory , but almost a decade later two teams of researchers discovered what seemed to be the real item , in the brains of macaque monkeys that had been trained to do number tasks .
The number neurons fired precisely the way Dehaene ’s model predicted — a vindication of theoretical psychology .
“ Basically , we can derive the behavioral properties of these neurons from first principles , ” he told me .
“ Psychology has become a little more like physics . ”
But the brain is the product of evolution — a messy , random process — and though the number sense may be lodged in a particular bit of the cerebral cortex , its circuitry seems to be intermingled with the wiring for other mental functions .
A few years ago , while analyzing an experiment on number comparisons , Dehaene noticed that subjects performed better with large numbers if they held the response key in their right hand but did better with small numbers if they held the response key in their left hand .
Strangely , if the subjects were made to cross their hands , the effect was reversed .
The actual hand used to make the response was , it seemed , irrelevant ; it was space itself that the subjects unconsciously associated with larger or smaller numbers .
Dehaene hypothesizes that the neural circuitry for number and the circuitry for location overlap .
He even suspects that this may be why travellers get disoriented entering Terminal 2 of Paris ’s Charles de Gaulle Airport , where small - numbered gates are on the right and large - numbered gates are on the left .
“ It ’s become a whole industry now to see how we associate number to space and space to number , ” Dehaene said .
“ And we ’re finding the association goes very , very deep in the brain . ”
Last winter , I saw Dehaene in the ornate setting of the Institut de France , across the Seine from the Louvre .
There he accepted a prize of a quarter of a million euros from Liliane Bettencourt , whose father created the cosmetics group L’Oréal .
In a salon hung with tapestries , Dehaene described his research to a small audience that included a former Prime Minister of France .
New techniques of neuroimaging , he explained , promise to reveal how a thought process like calculation unfolds in the brain .
This is n’t just a matter of pure knowledge , he added .
Since the brain ’s architecture determines the sort of abilities that come naturally to us , a detailed understanding of that architecture should lead to better ways of teaching children mathematics and may help close the educational gap that separates children in the West from those in several Asian countries .
The fundamental problem with learning mathematics is that while the number sense may be genetic , exact calculation requires cultural tools — symbols and algorithms — that have been around for only a few thousand years and must therefore be absorbed by areas of the brain that evolved for other purposes .
The process is made easier when what we are learning harmonizes with built - in circuitry .
If we ca n’t change the architecture of our brains , we can at least adapt our teaching methods to the constraints it imposes .
For nearly two decades , American educators have pushed “ reform math , ” in which children are encouraged to explore their own ways of solving problems .
Before reform math , there was the “ new math , ” now widely thought to have been an educational disaster .
( In France , it was called les maths modernes , and is similarly despised . )
The new math was grounded in the theories of the influential Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget , who believed that children are born without any sense of number and only gradually build up the concept in a series of developmental stages .
Piaget thought that children , until the age of four or five , cannot grasp the simple principle that moving objects around does not affect how many of them there are , and that there was therefore no point in trying to teach them arithmetic before the age of six or seven .
Piaget ’s view had become standard by the nineteen - fifties , but psychologists have since come to believe that he underrated the arithmetic competence of small children .
Six - month - old babies , exposed simultaneously to images of common objects and sequences of drumbeats , consistently gaze longer at the collection of objects that matches the number of drumbeats .
By now , it is generally agreed that infants come equipped with a rudimentary ability to perceive and represent number .
( The same appears to be true for many kinds of animals , including salamanders , pigeons , raccoons , dolphins , parrots , and monkeys . )
And if evolution has equipped us with one way of representing number , embodied in the primitive number sense , culture furnishes two more : numerals and number words .
These three modes of thinking about number , Dehaene believes , correspond to distinct areas of the brain .
The number sense is lodged in the parietal lobe , the part of the brain that relates to space and location ; numerals are dealt with by the visual areas ; and number words are processed by the language areas .
Nowhere in all this elaborate brain circuitry , alas , is there the equivalent of the chip found in a five - dollar calculator .
This deficiency can make learning that terrible quartet — “ Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision , ” as Lewis Carroll burlesqued them — a chore .
It ’s not so bad at first .
Our number sense endows us with a crude feel for addition , so that , even before schooling , children can find simple recipes for adding numbers .
If asked to compute 2 + 4 , for example , a child might start with the first number and then count upward by the second number : “ two , three is one , four is two , five is three , six is four , six . ”
But multiplication is another matter .
It is an “ unnatural practice , ” Dehaene is fond of saying , and the reason is that our brains are wired the wrong way .
Neither intuition nor counting is of much use , and multiplication facts must be stored in the brain verbally , as strings of words .
The list of arithmetical facts to be memorized may be short , but it is fiendishly tricky : the same numbers occur over and over , in different orders , with partial overlaps and irrelevant rhymes .
( Bilinguals , it has been found , revert to the language they used in school when doing multiplication . )
The human memory , unlike that of a computer , has evolved to be associative , which makes it ill - suited to arithmetic , where bits of knowledge must be kept from interfering with one another : if you ’re trying to retrieve the result of multiplying 7 X 6 , the reflex activation of 7 + 6 and 7 X 5 can be disastrous .
So multiplication is a double terror : not only is it remote from our intuitive sense of number ; it has to be internalized in a form that clashes with the evolved organization of our memory .
The result is that when adults multiply single - digit numbers they make mistakes ten to fifteen per cent of the time .
For the hardest problems , like 7 X 8 , the error rate can exceed twenty - five per cent .
Our inbuilt ineptness when it comes to more complex mathematical processes has led Dehaene to question why we insist on drilling procedures like long division into our children at all .
There is , after all , an alternative : the electronic calculator .
“ Give a calculator to a five - year - old , and you will teach him how to make friends with numbers instead of despising them , ” he has written .
By removing the need to spend hundreds of hours memorizing boring procedures , he says , calculators can free children to concentrate on the meaning of these procedures , which is neglected under the educational status quo .
This attitude might make Dehaene sound like a natural ally of educators who advocate reform math , and a natural foe of parents who want their children ’s math teachers to go “ back to basics . ”
But when I asked him about reform math he was n’t especially sympathetic .
“ The idea that all children are different , and that they need to discover things their own way — I do n’t buy it at all , ” he said .
“ I believe there is one brain organization .
We see it in babies , we see it in adults .
Basically , with a few variations , we ’re all travelling on the same road . ”
He admires the mathematics curricula of Asian countries like China and Japan , which provide children with a highly structured experience , anticipating the kind of responses they make at each stage and presenting them with challenges designed to minimize the number of errors .
“ That ’s what we ’re trying to get back to in France , ” he said .
Working with his colleague Anna Wilson , Dehaene has developed a computer game called “ The Number Race ” to help dyscalculic children .
The software is adaptive , detecting the number tasks where the child is shaky and adjusting the level of difficulty to maintain an encouraging success rate of seventy - five per cent .

I found another frugal Seattleite 's blog today !
She talks about trouble thinking of frugal date ideas .
So here , as promised , is my set of ideas : 1 .
Sometimes you can stop by and pick up a pass ( they go fast ) 2 .
Sometimes you have to mail in a form .
But that 's still under $ 1.3 .
The day of the movie , show up plenty early so you can be sure to get in .1 .
If it 's open air ( Seattle has concerts at the pier each summer ) you have a picnic .
2 . Buy tickets off someone .** Someone may have friends who flaked out .** If it 's not sold out , the tickets may be reasonable .** It 's not scalping so long as you pay box office prices ( or less ) 3 .
In case of open seats , box offices sometimes release tix at a discount 1/2 hour before .
1 .
You have a better chance of finding good deals .
2 . Entertainment books are great for this ( full of 2 - for - 1 coupons ) 3 .
Lots of residents never get around to stock attractions ( for me it was the Space Needle ) 4 .
It 's fun to rediscover your town .1 . Many bars have an early and a late one2 .
You can afford to order more food and there 's often a special drink of the day3 .
Some have standing specials , so you can plan around them1 .
Pay attention to call - ins on the radio .
2 .
If you like the symphony , listen to the classical music channel ** Fewer people listen and / or call in ** My mom won a night of classical music and an after - concert gala with champagne1 .
Free meals ** From fast food to casual sit down to full - on upscale dining ** Two of the shops were so expensive , I was sent a $ 100 gift card2 .
Free night of fun ** I 've shopped arcade - like stores before and had the meal & night reimbursed ** There are even bar shops , though as least one person needs to limit drinks3 .
Free hotel stays ** These take a little more work to get but are fabulous ** Free night in a hotel , meal or drinks plus room service1 .
There is work involved , so it 's not a completely worry - free night2 .
It can take up to two months to get reimbursed6 .
Cheesy date stuff1 .
Pay - one - price bracelet for rides2 .
Eat beforehand so you can spend on the good stuffI 'm sure I 've left some things out .
Help me out folks !

This week there ’s been more news about various chemicals in products we all use everyday with our families .
Of course , a thrust of this blog is how to limit this exposure as much as possible .
But it is moving target , one with daily discoveries and an ever changing landscape of news and new research .
Over at Non-Toxic Kids
I posted about Triclosan , a chemical in all those antibacterial products you see everywhere , ranging from toothpaste , to soap , keyboards , cosmetics , bedding , you name it .
The Environmental Working Group just released an extensive report about Triclosan , and it the many health and environmental problems associated with it .
The New York Times shared a story about sunscreens , actually calling into question the work of the Environmental Working Group in the area of sunscreen safety .
The chemical in question is oxybenzone , which is in most sunscreens , and it has been linked to endocrine disruption .
Of course , there are many scientists saying this is not definitive , and more research has to be done .
The EWG recommends using sunscreens that contain titanium and zinc oxide instead , but many folks are put off by the white residue it leaves .
My philosophy is simply to follow the precautionary principle , and if there is the chance of harm , a little white residue is something I can handle .
When I imagine the amount of waste tossed at hospitals daily it is easy for me to get cynical about the environment .
And I also think about all the plastic that is used to give blood , medicine , and to protect people from infection .
Most of this plastic contains many chemicals that are increasingly concerning , such as PVC ( vinyl ) , phthalates , and BPA .
According to the Washington Post , hospitals are starting to green up their act .
Many are being renovated with green and environmental health goals in mind , such as reducing waste and exposure to toxins .
This is great news for the environment and for patients , let ’s hope the trend spreads far and wide .
Can you envision hospitals composting , having extensive recycling and conservations procedures , and green construction ?
There ’s some environmental health news for you to ponder today .

Clinton advisor Maggie Williams and senior Obama advisor David Axelrod put out a joint statement this morning to refute a Politico story that there is still tension between the two camps .
The basic gist of the story is that Clinton supporters are angry at the topic President Clinton was given for his Wednesday night speech .
Clinton wanted to talk about the economy , but he instead was given the topic of national security , while the Obama supporters are upset because they feel like they are bending over backwards for the Clintons .
Williams and Axelrod said in their statement , “ We understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity .
The fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so .
Senator and President Clinton fully support the Obama / Biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this Fall .
Anyone saying anything else does n’t know what they ’re talking about .
Period . ”

Williams and Axelrod are right the Politico story is nothing but rumor .
If you read the story closely , it cites its sources as a Clinton backer , a high placed Obama supporter , a long time advisor , or people close to .
There is nobody from either campaign quoted in this story .
These sources could be anybody , including you and me .
Politico does a ton of good work , but this entire story is a rehash of what was proven months ago .
The problem is n’t with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
They work together well .
I would even suggest that President Clinton will be a team player .
The problem is between is the supporters of Clinton and Obama .
After such a bitter , hard fought primary , each side ’s most ardent supporters are having a difficult time accepting each other .
I would n’t exactly call this breaking news or a surprise , but I think that supporters on both sides need to let it go and put it in the past .
Supporters on each side want the same basic goal , a Democratic president .
If they are going to accomplish this , they need to stop focusing on the primary , and start looking towards November .
Magritte for Seaside allows one to automatically build Seaside components from descriptive objects .
There are several possibilities to customize this 3 step process :
a renderer defines the markup surrounding the form elements , a view component defines the visual appearance of every form element , and decorations surround the generated form to add additional functionality .
The Renderer
MATableRenderer ( default ) and MACssRenderer are complementary .
These classes define how the different Magritte components are laid out in the generated XHTML .
You can choose a different renderer by overriding the container description of your domain object :
descriptionContainer
^ super descriptionContainer
componentRenderer : MACssRenderer ;
yourself
To customize the way CSS classes are assigned to the individual items of the form , add the class names to the respective descriptions .
descriptionFirstName
^ MAStringDescription new
accesssor : # firstName ;
cssClass : ' firstname ' ;
yourself
If a completely different markup is needed , a custom subclass of MAComponentRenderer should be created .
Below a short description of the two renderer that come with Magritte .
The table renderer
MATableRenderer puts the form elements into a table , this is what traditional web applications mostly do .
This looks good without applying any style - sheet .
< table > < tr class = " group " > < th colspan = " 2 " >< i> Group Label</i></th > </tr > < tr> < th>< i> Description Label</i></th > < td>< i> Description Component</i></th > </tr> ... </ table >
The CSS renderer
The other renderer , MACssRenderer , uses semantically meaningful XHML markup and requires some CSS tweaking to look fine :
< dl > < dt class = " group " >< i> Group Label</i></dt > < dt>< i> Description Label</i></dt > < dd>< i> Description Component</i></dd > ... </dl >
The components
The components ( subclasses of MADescriptionComponent ) provide the view of the description .
Every description has a default component , and some have addition views .
In the example below , the boolean value can either be displayed using a checkbox ( default ) , a drop - down box , or a group of radio buttons .
descriptionVegetarian
^ MABooleanDescription new
accessor : # vegetarian ;
componentClass : MACheckboxComponent ;
;
yourself
The list of views that are known to work with a particular description can be found in the class - side method called defaultComponentClasses of the respective description .
For MABooleanDescription this method looks like :
defaultComponentClasses
^ Array
with : MACheckboxComponent
with : MASelectListComponent
with : MARadioGroupComponent
To build your own view , simply customize one of the existing views or implement your own Seaside component as a subclass of MADescriptionComponent .
The decorations
The decorations ( subclasses of MAComponentDecoration ) enable one to customize the form around the components build by Magritte .
This is not done automatically from the renderer , because one might want to manually compose multiple components to one big screen .
The following decorations are available :
Decoration Class Add Selector Description MAFormDecoration addForm and addForm : Surrounds the component with a < form > tag and adds save and cancel buttons .
Other button actions and labels can be specified with the decoration .
MASwitchDecoration add Switch
Turns the component read - only , but adds an edit button that allows one to switch between view and edit - mode .
MAValidationDecoration addValidation Normally invisible , but in case of validation errors show a list of problems .
Celebrating 60 years of existence this year , North Korea holds out as the last Stalinist state in the world .
In such a restrictive society , it is difficult - if not impossible - for residents to get news of the outside world , and for the outside world to see in .
What photography comes out of North Korea is either state - produced , state - approved , or at the very least state - managed ( visitors are restricted in their movement ) .
Still , if you look over the following images with those restrictions in mind , one can still get some idea of life in North Korea in 2008 .
These photos were all taken within the past six months - some taken from the borders , peering in , others provided by North Korea itself , and several generously shared by freelance photographer Eric Lafforgue , who recently spent some time inside the country .

First the Iraqi government gave Senator Barack Obama a boost by seeming to embrace his proposal for a 16 - month timetable for withdrawing American troops from Iraq .
Now could Senator John McCain , who built his candidacy in large part on his opposition to such a schedule , possibly be following suit ?
“ I think it ’s a pretty good timetable , ” Mr. McCain said Friday in an interview on “ The Situation Room ” on CNN , before adding that it should be based “ on the conditions on the ground . ”
For months Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , has strongly opposed setting a timetable for withdrawal and has criticized Mr. Obama , his Democratic rival , for suggesting one .
But the debate has shifted in recent days as Iraqi officials , including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , moved closer to Mr. Obama ’s position .
In the CNN interview , Mr. McCain first seemed to play down any possibility that Mr. Maliki would actually ask the United States to withdraw in the next 16 months to two years .
“ He won ’t , ” Mr. McCain said , explaining that he knew Mr. Maliki well .
Methane is a paradox .
It increases global warming at the same time that it promises abundant alternative energy .
The gas is all around the planet , from the atmosphere to deep below seabeds .
Here are 10 trends and discoveries that may determine methane 's ultimate role in the health of the environment : 1 Curing Cows ’ Methane Problem with Kangaroo Bacteria Kangaroos do n’t emit any methane .
Transfering bacteria from kangaroo guts to cows might help cut down on the ruminants ' methane footprint ( hoofprint ? ) .
2 Cow - Powered Train
This locomotive runs on methane produced by decomposing cow patties and dead cattle .
Its efficiency is more than two miles per head of cattle .
3 Earth ’s Frozen Methane Stash Global warming seems to be accelerating the release of methane trapped in permafrost and below Arctic ice .
The stores total more than some trillion tons of this greenhouse gas .
If it all thaws out , we may see the highest levels of atmospheric methane in 10,000 years .
4 Global Warming Makes the Arctic Hot Property Countries from Russia to Canada are eyeing Arctic territory that are expected to thaw in the future , freeing up its methane riches , which could be used as an alternative energy source .
5 Plants Make Greenhouse Gas Plants fart , too .
We like to think of green , carbon - absorbing vegetation as our ally in the fight against global warming .
But it turns out that leaves and grasses produce methane .
They also make more methane at higher temperatures , which does n’t bode well given Earth ’s toasty future .
6 Death by The Ultimate Gas Leak
An explosion of deep sea methane may have caused the Permian extinction , which destroyed most of Earth ’s inhabitants about 250 million years ago .
The blast could have roiled the seas enough to asphyxiate fish and may have even set the planet on fire .
7 Will the Methane Bubble Burst ?
Methane - producing microbes under the seafloor may have set the stage for catastrophe , yet again .
They have built up so much methane that its release could cause massive global warming or the planet ’s next big extinction .
8 Methane Takes A Break Beginning in the 1980s , atmospheric methane started increasing at a slower rate than earlier in the century .
Researchers suggest reasons for the fortunate decline , which range from the repair of leaky natural gas pipelines to steady acreage of rice paddies , where methane - producing bacteria thrive .
( Update : In 2008 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that methane is on the rise again after nearly a decade of near stagnation . )
9 Methane May Hinder Ozone Layer Recovery
Methane not only is a greenhouse gas , it may be attacking the ozone layer , too .
Rising methane levels are slowing the ozone layer ’s convalescence from chlorofluorocarbons .
10 Ancient Pollution
Whena forest is on fire , trees release gaseousmethane .
According to methane records , humans have a long history offouling the air .
Two thousand years ago , our ancestors were burning vegetation clear land for farming and to scare game into theopen .
In light of today 's FCC ruling against Comcast , Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has released a software tool dubbed , " Switzerland , " for internet users to check ISP interference of their connections .
Fred von Lohmann , EFF Senior Intellectual Property Attorney says : " The sad truth is that the FCC is ill - equipped to detect ISPs interfering with your Internet connection .
It 's up to concerned Internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations , and EFF 's Switzerland software is designed to help with that effort .
Comcast is n't the first , and certainly wo n't be the last , ISP to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers '
Internet communications for its own benefit . "

US never had democracy : Commentary - Gore Vidal
" ... the United States has never had democracy and the word never was used in the US constitution , Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence .
...
America has fallen into the hands of a small group of people that only care about global dominance and making money from US tax payers by waging wars . "

August 29 , 2008
American essayist Gore Vidal says that despite the US claim that it is making the world safer by perpetuating democracy , the country never had any democracy .
In an exclusive interview with Press Tv correspondent , Vidal said that the United States has never had democracy and the word never was used in the US constitution , Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence .
Vidal also said that America has fallen into the hands of a small group of people that only care about global dominance and making money from US tax payers by waging wars .
The renowned essayist made the analogy that the democratic national convention in Denver is symbolic of a falling empire and observed that the hyper expensive entertainment - based campaigns and the current state of the US as being overextended in multiple wars and no budget surplus to finance them , all bode ill for that nation ’s future .
Vidal noted that despite Obama ’s promise to deliver universal heath care , the heath industry would oppose his plan and insure he will not be able to deliver on his stated goal .
When asked about US policy toward Iran by the rival candidates , Vidal responded that McCain is a warmonger that will likely wage war on Iran .

In recent years the acai berry diet has quickly become the most popular diet in the world , while the acai berry itself has become the most popular antioxidant diet supplement in world .
Combined with a colon cleanser , a sensible diet , and a moderate exercise routine , the acai berry can help you lose fat faster than you ever thought possible , and its antioxidant health properties will keep you feeling youthful and energized every day .
With just Acai Pills you can lose up to 15 pounds in just 30 days .
Combine Acai with a Colon Cleanser to lose an additional 5 - 10 pounds .
Combine Acai with the diet and fitness routines I ’ve outlined below and the fat will simply melt off you .
What are Acai Berries ?
Acai berries – acai is pronounced ‘ a - sigh - ee ’ – are small , black , and round , and they resemble small grapes .
There is not much acai fruit on each individual berry .
Rather , each acai berry has a large seed that is surrounded by a small amount of pulp .
Harvesting .
When harvesting the acai berries , harvesters must remove the pulp from the outside of the berry , and process it immediately into an acai product or flash freeze it for shipping to a manufacturing facility .
The acai fruit will spoil if left unprocessed for several days .
Acai Products .
The fruit from the acai berry is often used in a variety of dietary supplements , healthy foods , ice cream , sorbet , juices , and other common grocery store items .
Best of all , the acai berry is the most important food used with the acai berry diet .
With the highest antioxidant concentration of any known food , the acai berry is now known as the most important superfood for a maintaining proper health .
Bad Products .
Some common commerical acai products , like Monavie and Amazon Thunder are just juices , which really do n’t have a place in the acai berry diet .
Juice is , after all , full of sugars and other un - diet - like ingredients .
Some of the products like Leanspa Acai , Acai Burn , and Acai Plus are now known as scams .
They get you to buy into a 6 month supply , send you an initial shipment , then take the rest of your money and run .
Good Products .
One of the best products I ’ve had a chance to use is Acai Berry Select , which contains is 100 % pure concentrated acai – a complete antioxidant , weight loss powerhouse – plus high effective energy boosters and other great thermogenic ingredients .
Another awesome product is Pure Raspberry Ketone .
This has a highly potent combination of 5 popular superfoods :
Acai Berry
Pomegranate
Green Tea
African Mango
Raspberry Ketone
African Mango and Raspberry Ketone are both fairly new to the super - food world .
African Mango extract is really high in antioxidants , while Raspberry Ketone is an effective FDA approved fat loss supplement .
Sambazon acai juice is the best juice product I ’ve tried , but it does contain extra calories so is not the best product for an acai berry diet .
The Health Benefits of Antioxidants
I am psyched because I am always talking about the benefits of antioxidants , and in particular how acai is currently the food with the highest antioxidant concentration in the world .
The ORAC rating for acai beats out even that of pomegranate and blueberries !
The antioxidant benefits of the acai berry rival several other superfoods , including :
blueberries
goji berries
mangosteen
Amazon mango
pomegranate
strawberries
and pretty much any vegetable you can think of
The super healthy vitamin , mineral , and macronutrient concentrations in acai berries blend together in your diet and in your body , to exert a powerful effect on your mind , body , health and overall well - being .
For those of us looking for protection from cancer , weight loss , help with diabetes , better cardiovascular health , or just to look and feel healthy , should consider giving the acai berry a try .
Learn more about the history of the acai berry itself on WikiPedia .

Oxygen Radical Absorbence Capacity ( ORAC )
Oxygen Radical Absorbence Capacity , or ORAC , is the measurement of the antioxidant concentration of individual foods .
The foods that have a higher ORAC value have a higher concentration of antioxidants , which means they are more effective at fighting the cellular damage caused by free - radicals .
We want to load our diet up on fruits and vegetables if we wants to fight skin wrinkles , cancer , and various other diseases associated with toxins and aging .
As you can see by the chart below , the acai berry ’s powerful 18,400 ORAC rating is the highest of any known fruit or vegetable .
As a side note , I should let you know that the Maqui berry has taken over the ORAC crown , but acai berries are still better for weight loss .
When used in amounts up to 1000 mg a day , acai berry supplements will help to decrease the cell oxidization damage caused by free radicals pretty significantly , even when used for just 14 days .
Of course , long term use is recommended since the antioxoidant benefits will cease a couple days after you stop using acai .
Even WebMD agrees that the acai berry diet is the healthiest nutrition plan to follow for life .

Step 1 : Speed Up Weight Loss With Acai
I wrote earlier that acai berry supplements are a great weight loss aid , but I did n’t get into all the details .
Well , here are the specific details about why the acai berry is so helpful when you are trying to lose fat .
The acai ’s natural concentration of fiber , fatty acids ( including essential fatty acids – EFAs ) , raw amino acids , and phytosterols work in unison to assist your body with burning fat more efficiently .
All of these nutrients will help your digestive system to process food faster and more efficiently , which will help your body to burn its stored fat quicker than diet and exercise alone .
Dietary Fiber
85 % of the carbohydrate content of acai is dietary fiber .
As we all know , fiber helps your body to move food through the digestive tract .
Excess food and calories are therefore eliminated quickly , rather than being absorbed into the bloodstream and stored away as excess adipose tissue ( fat mass ) .
A high fiber diet is also known to reduce hunger , curb the appetite , and eliminate cravings .
Make sure your regular diet is full of healthy fruits , vegetables , and whole grains ; then supplement with acai berry every morning and you ’ll be virtually guaranteed to lose weight and maintain regular bowel movements .
Fatty Acid Content
56.2 % of the fat content of acai is oleic acid , which in simple terms , is olive oil .
Know how nutritionists are always telling us to use olive oil in our recipes because it ’s so healthy ?
Well there you go !
Supplementing with acai berry is like supplementing with olive oil .
But that ’s not the best part …
Additionally , your body is unable to produce Omega 3 or Omega 6 essential fatty acids ( EFAs ) naturally , which means you ’ll have to make it a point to supplement with fish oil or eat foods with high concentrations of those EFAs .
Conveniently , these EFAs are plentiful in acai berries , making up the additional 43.8 % of fat .
That means you can say supplementing with acai berry is like supplementing with fish oil !
Just some of the benefits of supplementing with EFAs include :
improvements in the cardiovascular and circulatory systems
reduction in the chance of developing blood clots
decreased inflammation and relief from arthritis
healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levels
healthy heart , brain , and memory functions
decreased insulin resistance , better control over diabetes
optimal development of a child ’s brain , nerves and eyes while breast feeding and during pregnancy
Amino Acids
Acai berries are chalk - full of amino acids , widely known as the building blocks of protein .
In order for your muscles to recover from workouts or even just to function properly , you need an adequate intake of amino acids .
I recommend .8 grams of protein in your diet per pound of goal body weight , so that ’s a lot of amino acids .
Furthermore , when dieting , a lack of amino acids leads to muscle catabolism ( muscle loss ) , which in turn leads to a slower metabolism , less stamina , fatigue , and loss of strength .
Supplementing with acai berry gives you those extra amino acids that your body needs to function at optimal levels , especially when following a regular exercise routine .
Phytosterols
Phytosterols such as ß-sitosterol , which is prevalent in acai , decreases cholesterol levels by inhibiting cholesterol absorption in the intestines .
When phytosterols are absorbed in the intestines , they are transported into the cell membrane where they bind to micelles in place of dietary cholesterol .
This means that when your diet contains cholesterol , it is more likely to be transported from the body , rather than absorbed into the bloodstream .

Step 2 : Accelerate Fat Loss With Colon Cleansing
Disgusting , harmful toxins infiltrate your body at work , at home , in the car , when you eat , when you sleep , and even when you breathe .
They are on the vegetables and fruits you buy , they are in your meat , in your dairy products , on your clothes , in your deodorant and perfume , and even in the air .
Furthermore , in westernized culture , we eat more sugary , processed , and fried food than ever .
We poison our bodies with a variety of sedatives , stimulants , pain relievers , and a million other medications .
A high percentage of these medicine and food toxins build up in our liver , kidneys , and colon .
They pollute our body and stress out our digestive systems .
To combat these toxins , we sometimes resort to enemas , detox diets , cleansing drinks , and colon cleansers .
Our main goals is to cleanse the colon walls of stagnant toxic waste build up , which we can do cheaply and comfortably by using a colon cleansing dietary supplement .
By using a colon cleanser you will increase your vitality , improve your digestion , and lose weight .
When combined with an acai berry diet , using a colon cleanser regularly will help to keep your intestines clean and your body free of toxins .
It is recommended to use a colon cleansing supplement for 14 - 30 days , 4 - 6 times a year .
While not mandatory for the acai berry diet , using a colon cleanser will make the detox process much easier and faster , and it will help your efforts to lose weight .
I ’d choose a colon cleanser before I ’d choose an enima , that ’s for sure .

Step 3 : Fat Loss Workout Routine to Use With the Acai Berry Diet
To maximize your weight loss on the acai diet , you should be working out at least three times a week for at least 30 minutes per session .
Exercise is not mandatory on the acai berry diet , but it will help you lose fat even faster .
The best fat loss workout routines on Project Swole are :
These routines prescribe 6 days of exercise per week , and consist of 3 intense full body weight training workouts and 3 cardiovascular routines .
Use these workouts to kick your fat loss into overdrive !
[ top ]
Step 4 : Intermittent Fasting to Accelerate Fat Loss Even More
An intermittent fast is the best approach to losing fat quickly on the acai berry diet .
Intermittent fasting calls for a 6 - 8 hour feeding window , where you eat all of your calories for the day in 2 or 3 meals .
Do n’t eat after 8 pm or before noon .
Drink only water , tea , or coffee in between .
Like colon cleansing and the fat loss workout routines , fasting is not mandatory for the acai berry diet .
However , intermittent fasting is a great lifestyle eating plan if you can get accustomed to it .
Whole - day fasts are not typically recommended for those of us looking to build or maintain muscle mass , but intermittent fasting is a great solution .

Frequently Asked Questions
Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about acai .
You can read the whole list here : Acai Berry FAQ
Q : How much acai berry should I take each day ?
A : It is recommended to take between 500 mg and 1000 mg ( 1 g ) each day .
This can be taken all at once or divided into several doses .
See the previous question for more information on timing your acai intake .
Q : How much weight will I lose by taking acai ?
A : You can lose between 1 - 2 pounds a week on a healthy diet and exercise plan .
When taking acai you may lose at least twice that many pounds .
You could definitely lose up to 12 or even 15 pounds a month by using acai , as long as you continue eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly .
Q : Will I gain the weight back after I stop using acai ?
A : As long as you maintain a healthy diet and keep exercising , you will not gain fat just because you stop using acai .
You might experience decreased weight loss or a plateau in your fat loss progress , but you will not suddenly start gaining it back .
Q : Can my pre-teen or teenage , son or daughter use acai ?
A : Acai berries are fruit just like blueberries , oranges , and apples .
It makes sense that if you are old enough to eat other fruit , then you are old enough to eat acai .
The one caveat is that the supplement must be 100 % pure acai .
If your acai pill or juice contains other ingredients like Hoodia , caffeine or another thermogenic compound , I ca n’t promise it will be good for your kid .
Q : What are the side effects of acai berry supplements ?
For 100 % pure acai supplements , there are no side effects , just as there would be no side effects to taking a highly concentrated blueberry supplements .
Sometimes acai berry pills have added ingredients such as caffeine , green tea , or hoodia , which could cause some acai berry side effects like increased energy and heart rate .
This does n’t make them dangerous by any means , but it should be noted that some acai berry supplements do have added ingredients .
Q : When should I take my acai berry supplement ?
A : If you have an acai supplement with added ingredients like caffeine and hoodia , then you should only take your acai berry supplement in the morning .
If you have a 100 % pure acai supplement , then it is OK to take it in the morning and before bed , however I recommend you consistently take your acai supplement once per day , in the morning with breakfast .
Q : How many calories are in the acai berry supplements ?
A : There are a ton of calories in the acai juices .
Upwards of 200-500 calories per serving , depending on the product .
I do n’t recommend the juices for a weight loss diet , although they can fit nicely into a regular breakfast or as a pre-workout drink .
The acai berry pills have negligible calories in comparison , and even then the calories are attributed to fiber , healthy fatty acids , and amino acids , as I mentioned above .
Q : Is the acai berry a scam ?
A : No !
This question frustrates me , because the acai berry diet is now receiving unnecessary negative publicity thanks to a few shady businesses .
The acai berry received a bad rap in recent years because some companies took huge orders over the course of several months , shut down their customer service departments , and ran for the hills .
When you consider the health benefits of the acai berry itself , the proof is in the pudding … the acai berry pudding .
Antioxidants are very real , and the acai berry is very high in antioxidants .
If you ever wanted to take a supplement that could help you lose weight , stay healthy , and feel young , then the acai berry is for you .

" Bring back National Service ! " used to be the sitcom writer ’s stock shorthand for an old , most likely bigoted person , who was scared of any youthful hairstyle or kind of music that he or she did n’t understand .
But something ’s changed .
With our prisons fit to burst , and the papers full of unending gang violence , the concept of sending teenagers off to square - bash and do assault courses for a year or two , to reset their moral compasses and keep them so busy they have n’t got the time or the energy to commit crime , has been floated quite seriously around the media and there seems more than usual willingness to consider it .
On reflection , this could benefit more than just potential young offenders .
Someone like me might well have got something from it .
I look back on my college days and cringe a bit .
Although I had already spent my year off in Paris , where I learned to speak French but was mostly either crying or drunk the rest of the time , I rushed off to university with two ambitions - getting away from home , and meeting as many people as possible , the latter involving as much alcohol as I could get down me .
Like many in my position , I had a lot of growing up to do and got into a lot of emotional scrapes .
Sure , I got a good degree , but I do n’t remember much about it .
I know that I would have benefited from getting away from home before that , but without parental involvement , and with a chance to try things out without constantly being told I was n’t good enough .
And I came from a middle class background where there was food on the table and a secure home , however miserable .
For kids from homes where the parents , if even present , expect their kids to be raised by a combination of television and the police , a year or more away from that would show that there ’s another world out there .
It would get young people away from unhappy homes , allow everyone involved to meet people from other backgrounds , and remind those who were lucky enough to have happy ones , to value them .
It would n’t just have to be about army training either , as there ’s the obvious danger that it would just end up mimicking the horrors of school sports .
It could be about learning life skills , money management , and , for all too many boys , how to be a man .
Girls too might learn the self - respect that so many so desperately need after teen years spent on the sexual battlefield .
But perhaps I ’m getting into fantasy - land .
I can remember a time before the internet and mobile phones , and when cotton and linen cost a lot more than synthetics , and you could n’t just buy a house because you felt like it , and broadsheet newspapers did n’t publish reviews of spas .
While this world was a paradise to the post - war populations that came before me , it is positively austere to those coming after , and successive generations have developed an increasing sense of entitlement to just about everything , whether wear - it - once - and - chuck - it - away clothing , or the right to bear arms at a bus stop .
For a start , ' national service ’ can also stand for ‘ peacetime conscription ’ .
Lawyers would have a field day with that if any government tried to bring it in .
In our twisted universe , ‘ prevented from starting a mortgage , ’ would come only a close second to ‘ possibility of being killed in the next war ’ as possible human rights abuses .
And that ’s just the start .
If such a scheme actually got past the lawyers , there would a bidding war to run it , which would be won by Capita , and the whole thing would fall apart within months .
Even if it did n’t , those employed to oversee it would soon be flogging booze to the teens , and rich parents would rapidly find ways to get their kids past the draft .
Assuming it still managed to clunk on after that , there would be so many anti-bullying tribunals that the place would eventually grind to a halt under the sheer weight of legalese , on top of the medical bills for all the abortions and STI treatments .
Shame , really .
Terrorism expert downplays shock bracelets for airline passengers

It was recently reported that the Department of Homeland Security has expressed interest in " safety bracelets " for air travelers that would include personal information and would not only track the wearer but also be capable of remotely delivering a taser - like shock .
Fox 's News ' Megyn Kelly talked with terrorism expert Neil Livingstone , who downplayed the reports .
" This is kind of an exaggerated story , " he stated .
" I do n't think there 's going to be a shock element on it .
That 's going too far . "
However , Livingstone , who has a history of making extreme claims about the threats posed by terrorists , saw nothing wrong with the radio - tracking aspect .
" Flying is not a right , it is a privilege , " he stated .
Livingstone also suggested that there might be a growing market for such devices , saying , " We may see , actually , these kinds of devices put on felons in order to get parole "

Was anyone else concerned when Rupert Murdock ( owner of Fox News ) bought the Wall Street Journal ?
Well , no need to worry .
This morning ’s front page story of the WSJ online finally exposes the real reason why Obama is not “ fit ” to be president — he ’s not fat .
Here ’s proof ( from the article ) :
“ I wo n’t vote for any beanpole guy , ” another Clinton supporter wrote last week on a Yahoo politics message board .
Nevermind all those silly people who claim that at a point when we are involved in two wars , on the verge of a recession , with oil prices rising insanely , a failing healthcare system , and a global food crisis , home foreclosures , etc. that the venerated Wall Street Journal could find a more appropriate topic .
Hah !
My beef is how they got the above quote !
While the WSJ blames some anonymous
Yahoo message board , diligent readers have discovered that the author of the WSJ piece started the topic herself by posting the following :
Is Obama too skinny to be president ?
15 - Jul -08 06:04 pm
Does anyone out there think Barack Obama is too thin to be president ?
Anyone having a hard time relating to him and his “ no excess body fat ” ?
Please let me know .
Thanks !

15 - Jul -08 10:21 pm
Yes I think He is to skinny to be President .
Hillary has a potbelly and chuckybutt I ’d of Voted for Her .
I wo n’t vote for any beanpole guy .
The other two posts to the thread ( which is saved on Google cache , since the WSJ reporter deleted her post ) are dismissing the question as stupid and irrelevant .
But never let it be said that the mainstream media is n’t concerned about the news .
They are so concerned that they create news themselves !
After all , waiting for it to happen and reporting on it is so last century .
The same article shows that if a reporter does n’t want to go to all the trouble to create news , they can just borrow it — another part of the WSJ “ article ” is a slight restatement of a McCain campaign memo .

Sorting revisited .
I previously posted an algorithm that allows one to sort with less than all the facts ( specifically , if computing the transitivity of " < " is not trivial . )
But here I 'd like to revisit just straight sorting .
Conventional wisdom is as follows :
quicksort is the fastest sorting algorithm in practice but has a number of pathological cases that can make it perform as badly as O( n 2 ) .
. heapsort is guaranteed to run in O ( n * ln ( n ) ) and requires only finite additional storage .
But there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average .
and requires only finite additional storage .
But there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average .
Because of the above two facts , a relatively new hybrid sorting algorithm called " introspective sort " looks very promising .
Introspective sort basically applies quicksort recursively until it realizes something has gone wrong then switches to heapsort .
In this way it has a worst case performance of O ( n * ln ( n ) ) and an average performance basically equal to quicksort .
and an average performance basically equal to quicksort .
mergesort is guaranteed to run in O ( n * ln ( n ) ) but requires n units of additional temporary storage .
Now when thinking about all of this , what struck me is that I could not see really why heapsort is slower than quicksort .
And I 've not heard or read a credible explanation for this either .
Update : David MacKay explains it here .
QuickSort
For large enough n , some subparitions of will contain small pathological cases .
Furthermore , the partitioning breakdown will be arbitrary and thus necessarily not be even and therefore will perform more like n*( lg ( n ) +eps ) comparisons / swaps .
Work arounds like " median of 3 " are not convincing , and just shifts the pathological cases .
Balancing this out is the fact that quick sort is just a context insensitive recursive algorithm -- so its limited mostly by the speed at which it sorts the very smallest sub-lists ( for each partition of size m processed there are two other partitions of smaller size that are processed . )
By putting in a trivial check for small lists and performing them with explicit hand coded optimal sorts will boost quick sort 's overall performance .
HeapSort
Heap sort is based around the idea of arranging the elements into a " heap " which allows an O ( 1 ) algorithm for finding the maximum element and an O ( ln ( n ) ) for deleting it out of the array .
By expressing the heap in clever way , this can all be mapped in - place with the original array .
One common error made in implementing heap sort is by breaking the operations down all the way to paired element swaps .
The operation of re-establishing the heap property of a heap after its maximum element is deleted ( called sifting ) is essentially a rotation of a sequence of sub - heap maximums .
As I showed in my article about in - place array rotation , rotations require only one extra temporary and one read and write for each position of the cycle to be rotated .
This leads to nearly a 2 x improvement on the number of required reads / writes to the array .
I was not able to find anyone else 's reference implementation which took this into account .
But otherwise , heapsort does n't have any substantial number of interesting degenerate cases ( other than the infrequent short rotation ) to leverage its overall performance .
MergeSort
Mergesort kind of combines the good features of quicksort and heapsort .
It is also context insentively recursive , so small cases are a major leverage point for overall performance as well .
However , it also is recursive in a static way , so that it cannot vary or be caught in bad cases where it might perform uncharacteristically badly .
The problem with Mergesort is that every element will move lg( n ) steps ( or perhaps a few less because of the exploitability of direct sorting of small sub- lists ) regardless .
So the average , worst and best case running time is identical no matter what .
Measurements
Now given all this information its a bit hard to see which of these should really be fastest in real life .
That leaves us with one final possibility -- actually try it out in practice .
Below are the results from just such a test :
Athlon XP 1.620 Ghz Power4 1 Ghz Intel C/C++
/ O2 /G6 / Qaxi / Qxi / Qip WATCOM C/C ++
/ otexan /6r GCC
- O3 -march=athlon-xp MSVC
/ O2 /Ot / Og /G6 CC
- O3 Heapsort 2.09 4.06 4.16 4.12 16.91 Quicksort 2.58 3.24 3.42 2.80 14.99 Mergesort 3.51 4.28 4.83 4.01 16.90 Data is time in seconds taken to sort 10000 lists of varying size of about 3000 integers each .
Download test here
I suspected that heapsort should do better than its poor reputation and I think these results bear that out .
Only MSVC really shows it to be more than 20 % slower than quicksort and the always awesome Intel compiler turns in the best overall score with heapsort ( by a large margin . )
It turns out that much of the reason for Intel 's large margin of victory are the / Qaxi / Qxi flags used to build the test .
The inner loop for heapsort has an opportunity to perform conditional computation rather than an unpredictable conditional branch ( a big no no on modern microprocessors ) and these flags allow the Intel compiler to exploit this situation while the other compilers were unable to do this .
The quicksort algorithm inner loop cannot be predicated , and the Intel compiler did not do it with mergesort ( even though it is possible to do it . )
The academics commonly cite comparison and swap counts .
Of course , with my implementation of heapsort there are no swaps per se .
So its more comparable to count the number of reads and writes .
So lets count them up :
Comparisons Reads / Writes Heapsort 61045.4 40878.2 Quicksort 22037.8 16322.5 Mergesort 31755.0 31225.0
Data is average number of operations taken to sort 1000 lists of varying size of about 3000 integers each .
Ok , this is appears to be the source of the conventional wisdom .
Indeed , quicksort will perform almost 3 times better than heapsort and almost 2 times better than mergsort .
( It should be noticed that my results show heapsort to be far better here than results obtained by others who count swaps which show relative differences closer to 10 times . )
So whenever the performance is dominated by comparison or memory bandwidth costs quicksort really is the best choice .
This will be the case when using generic callback mechanisms like qsort ( ) does , or when dealing with generic objects like STL does .
In the face of these counts , how is it possible for heapsort to do as well as it does in my previous measurements ?
Its not explained just by compiler efficiency .
For this we have to really dive in under the hood of these algorithms and understand how this relates to modern microprocessor performance .
The key considerations are parallelism and branching penalties .
Heapsort at a low level
Between each extraction of maximum elements in heap sort , a sift down operation occurrs that takes lg( i ) steps where i varies from 1 to n .
This sift down operation is basically a loop which traverses the binary tree structure of the heap always chosing the node with the higher value and shuffling these nodes upward .
The direction down the tree that this operation goes each time is basically unpredictable , but at its lowest level manifests as adding either 0 or 1 to the current node index .
For a modern compiler and underlying microprocessor this allows it to convert the comparison to this computation without a branch -- so the reduces the branch penalties to just one at the loop exit .
For older compilers / microprocessors , there are lg( i ) unpredictable branches .
So in total there are about lg( 1 ) + lg ( 2 ) +...+ lg( n ) ( which is less than n*lg ( n ) ) unpredicatable branches for older compilers and basically just n unpredictable branches for newer compilers / CPUs .
The operations in each instance of the sift down loop are all pipelinably parallel with respect to each other without a lot of intervening branch control .
What this means is that for super - scalar , out of order , post modern microprocessors as instructions from one pass through the loop executing instructions from subsequent instances can actually start executing in parallel .
So while copying the previous node upwards , the CPU can determine which of the next two nodes is the correct path to follow in parallel .
Quicksort at a low level
For each scanned element there is an unpredictable branch .
So there are roughly n*lg ( n ) mispredicted branches .
However , there is no simple way to translate these to conditional computations .
This is mitigated somewhat by leveraging optimal sorting for the smallest sub-lists .
Each operation inside the paritioning step is essentially directly dependent on the results of the previous one .
Because of this , there is almost no real parallelism available .
Mergesort at a low level
Mergesort actually requires somewhere between 1 and 3 predictable branches per read / write operation .
It starts out mostly requiring 1 , but will degenerate to closer to 3 as each half gets smaller .
So the result is between n*lg ( n ) and 3 *n* lg ( n ) unpredictable branches .
Although it is possible for a modern CPU to use conditional computation instructions in mergesort as well , the Intel C/ C++ did not do it .
Some experimentation by hand with it myself indicates that trying to force such a thing creates an additional indirection ( aka " store to load forwarding " ) problem which makes the loop even slower .
So conditional computation instructions do n't help in this case .
As to parallelism , the conditional is dependent on the results from the store and variable increment , so there is no opportunity for mergesort either .
Conclusion and future work to be considered
Where modern processor and compiler considerations dominates , heapsort will actually outperform quicksort both theoretically and in practice .
Only when the cost of comparisons and / or the operation of moving the entry itself starts to dominate will quicksort retake the lead .
This is something to consider when designing an abstract data type .
If one has a list of pointers , or which can otherwise be satisfactorily sorted by indirect index , and it is essentially being sorted by a scalar ( something desirable to for sort performance , regardless ) then heapsort can be the most attractive option .
This leads us with one open question about a common sorting scenario .
What if we want to sort text strings ?
Here the comparison performance is variable , and likely to have higher average cost than scalar comparison , but the read / write penalties will not necessarily change .
While we expect quicksort to benefit from this , if the strings are totally random ( which will lead to the roughly minimum cost for the string comparisons ) would it be enough to tip the balance back in favor or quicksort when using the Intel compiler ?
This is unanswered .
Intel 's compiler has quite an excellent reputation for delivering performance ( established by many objective tests ) and this has motivated competitors to try to improve their compilers .
In this sense it is hoped that more compilers will deliver the same capabilities as Intel 's does in the future .
But as a consequence , heapsort will return as a serious candidate for raw sorting .
Update : Feedback
I have been contacted by various people who have challenged my results .
Specifically , they claim that my quicksort implementation is unfairly sub-optimal .
The complaints are roughly as follows :
Instead of using the more typical " swap " operation , the inner loop of my quicksort contains gotos and appears more complicated , and thus must be slower .
This is pure nonsense .
I started with a more typical " swap " loop and actually modified the loop in stages , measuring the results , and examining the compiler disassembly ( from more than one compiler ) every step of the way .
I highly doubt that any prior effort has had comparable analysis .
The result is my loop has roughly half as many reads / writes as the swap version .
But the gotos also minimizes all control logic totally .
This reduces the overhead for partitioning which changes other analysis .
Once the partition size drops below a certain number ( higher than 3 ) the algorithm should switch to Insert Sort ( or some other O ( n2 ) sort ) .
I tried to do this , and in fact automatically searched for the optimal value for such a cutoff .
The results were different for different compilers ( which reflects the importance of the overhead of the pivot part of the loop ) but no result showed a relevant improvement over the version shown .
It should be noted that sort3 and sort2 are optimal ( for our random data situation ) sort algorithms .
That means , the disadvantage for using more partitioning ( versus an earlier cutoff to InsertSort style solution ) is offset by the advantage of using these optimal sorts .
sort3 and sort2 are many many times faster than InsertSort on 3 or 2 elements .
But , InsertSort is an O ( n2 ) algorithm , so its performance on 6 elements is 4 times slower than its performance on 3 elements etc .
So for an InsertSort cut over to be a better solution it needs to outperform the partition speed ( since it cannot hold a candle to the sort3 / sort2 functions . )
For large n it has no chance of doing this , and considering the improved partition loop as described above , it will have a hard time beating the partition code as well .
So this result should not come as a surprise at all .
The number of elements of each array is too small .
Yes this is true -- I picked something that would be sure to fit into the on -chip CPU cache of any modern CPU .
The reason for this is that the Comparisons and Reads / Writes table that is shown above already tells us what 's going to happen .
As we add cost to read / writes , Quicksort will clearly be a better solution .
Furthermore , heapsort has very poor data locality , while Quicksort has excellent locality , which means the read / write penalties will be worse for heapsort than Quicksort .
Under these circumstances its clear that heapsort will lose if the data does n't all fit into the on-chip cache of the CPU .
But this leads us to an " Introsort " style of hybrid algorithm .
Introsort is just a quicksort that calls itself recursively as normal until its stack depth exceeds a certain threshold and just switches to heapsort for such bad partitions .
Well in addition , the quicksort could also switch to heap sort once the partition 's size falls below that of the L1 - cache ( and if we are using the Intel compiler ) which would make the algorithm 's constant factor over O ( n * lg ( n ) ) really be limited by heapsort efficiency , not quicksort efficiency .
Besides missing the above things , others who have written to me have tried to compare this to sorting floating point ( increasing the comparison cost ) , sticking with SWAP ( ) as the lowest level data movement primitive ( just plain dumb ) , and using slower languages ( such as Basic ) that are inappropriate for performance analysis .
Update : Feedback ( 2 )
I have received some insightful feedback from James Barbetti , who has clearly studied this problem far beyond what you get from most academic study or from typical text books .
He suggests 1 ) multiprocessor environments would behave differently ( that should not surprise anyone ) , 2 ) there are ways of improving heapsort by running it the opposite direction ( I have not confirmed this ) , 3 ) Quicksort can be guaranteed to use O ( 1+log ( n ) ) of stack by not recursing the larger partition but rather by looping back to the top after adjusting the input parameters to match the larger partition .
I have updated the Quicksort loop with non-recursion on the larger partition , and added a 4 entry sort4 ( ) optimal sort .
This improves the quicksort results marginally for most of the compilers , and significantly for the Intel compiler .
I 've updated the performance results in the table above and the test source code .

AFL - CIO ad criticizes McCain on war , veterans
The AFL - CIO plans to begin airing an ad in six presidential battleground states on Thursday that features a Vietnam combat veteran criticizing John McCain 's stance on the war in Iraq and on veterans issues .
The ad is part of a new union political effort to reach the 2.1 million military veterans or active - duty personnel who are members of the AFL - CIO .
" Every vet respects John McCain 's war record , " Navy veteran Jim Wasser says in the ad .
" It 's his record in the Senate that I have a problem with . "
Wasser , an electrician from Illinois , served with John Kerry aboard Navy Swift Boats in Vietnam and helped the Massachusetts senator rebut attacks on his war record during the 2004 presidential campaign .
In the ad , Wasser says McCain " wants us to keep spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq .
Just like Bush . "
" That 's money we could use to build schools and roads and create needed jobs here at home , " Wasser says .
" He even took sides with Bush against increasing health care benefits for veterans .
People should let John McCain know .
His agenda is not what we need .
Not now . "
While McCain has supported increases in spending for veteran 's health , the union 's criticism is based on McCain 's opposition over the past four years to Democratic amendments that would have added more money to veteran 's health programs .
The ad will air in Michigan , Minnesota , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Wisconsin for three weeks .
Union officials would not disclose the amount spent on the ad , but they described it as a " significant targeted buy " in " places where the current economic slowdown is particularly acute . "
The ad represents the entry of yet another outside group seeking to influence the presidential election .
On Wednesday , a group of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans that has been critical of Obama began airing an ad that asserts that the troop escalation in Iraq that McCain supported has reduced casualties and " decimated " al - Qaida in Iraq , and that the Iraqi Army " controls most of the country . "
The ad , a $ 1.5 million buy airing on national cable and in Colorado , Michigan , New Mexico , Ohio and Virginia , does not mention the presidential candidates , but its views certainly coincide with McCain's .
" The surge worked , " one of the veterans in the ad says .
In a swipe at Obama 's campaign slogan , another veteran ads , " That 's change we can believe in . "
The ad concludes , " We need to finish the job no matter who is president . "
The Associated Press
The Interior Department on Wednesday made 2.6 million acres of potentially oil - rich territory in northern Alaska available for energy exploration .
At the same time , it deferred for a decade any decision to open 600,000 acres of land north of Teshekpuk Lake that is the summer home of thousands of migrating caribou and millions of waterfowl .
The decision will open up for drilling much of the northeast section of the Northeast National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska , holding an estimated 3.7 billion barrels of oil , Tom Lonnie , Alaska state director for the Bureau of Land Management , said in a conference call with reporters .
The northeast and northwest portions of the reserve could yield eight billion barrels of oil , he said .
Mr. Lonnie said he expected the first oil production to begin in the easternmost part of the reserve , west of the Colville River , from 2010 to 2012 .
A fully developed oil complex exists on state lands on the eastern banks of the river .

The South Pacific country of Vanuatu has been voted the happiest place in the world so what makes its inhabitants such a happy lot ?
Not having to worry about money - the secret of Jean Pierre 's happiness ( photo : James Mair ) Jean Pierre John is living the dream .
That popular fantasy of owning one 's own island , complete with swaying coconut palms , coral sea and tropical forest , is his for real .
On the island called Metoma , in the far north of Vanuatu , Jean Pierre can look around and truly say that he is master of all he surveys .
This single fact would put Jean Pierre in an exclusive club , you would think , one made up of billionaire businessmen , royalty and rock stars .
But Jean Pierre is none of these things .
In fact , he could not be more different .
On Metoma , Jean Pierre and his family live in thatched huts .
They have no electricity or running water , no radio or television , and their only mode of transport is a rowing boat , which pretty much limits them to trips to the neighbouring island .
On top of that , they have little money and few opportunities to make any .
No money ?!
Suddenly their island life does not sound all that glamorous .
But here 's the thing , the Johns really are happy .
This may sound surprising but living on their island they want for nothing .
Local produce
All the family 's food comes from on or around Metoma .
Coconuts , yam , and manioc - their staple diet - are all grown on the island and then , of course , there is a sea full of fish to harvest .
And if fish protein gets boring , there is always the occasional fruit bat , from a colony that roosts on the island .
Indeed , food is so easy to gather that the family appears to have a lot of relaxation time .
When the Johns do have money - perhaps when they sell one of the few cows they own - they will buy soap powder and kerosene for their lamps .
But if not , they are just as happy to make do with island solutions - sticks which can be crushed to make soap and coconut oil in place of kerosene .
Some useful items are even washed up onto their island - buoys from boats are cut in half to make bowls and old fishing nets are recycled as hammocks .
It may sound like a Robinson Crusoe existence , and in many ways it is , but the Johns are not castaways .
They live on Metoma out of choice .
It is not as if they have not experienced some of the trappings of a more modern world .
The Johns are the real McCoy : one happy family ( photo : James Mair ) Jean Pierre grew up on one of Vanuatu 's larger islands and still makes the occasional visit .
His eldest son , Joe , even went to school in the nation 's capital .
In fact Joe , a very easy - going 28 - year - old , had recently returned to Metoma to live full time and he told me that the only thing he missed was hip hop music , but that it was a small price to pay for living on the island .
No money worries Jean Pierre had not heard that Vanuatu had been voted happiest country in the world but , when I told him , he nodded in a knowingly happy sort of way .
So what is his secret of happiness ?
" Not having to worry about money , " he immediately replies , while picking his nose in an uninhibited way .
If you asked the same question in the UK , you would probably get the same response .
The only difference is that , in Jean Pierre 's case , it means not needing any money , rather than having bundles of it .
We can all repeat the mantra " money ca n't buy you happiness " until we are blue in the face , but deep down , how many of us in the West really believe it to be true ?
But I can see that Jean Pierre 's happiness is more than just a question of money .
It also comes from having his family around him , and there is undoubtedly an enormous respect between them .
Absence of materialism
His children - and this includes those of adult age - do anything their father asks , not out of coercion but because they genuinely want to please .
Forget the Waltons , the Johns are the real McCoy : one happy family .
While talking to Jean Pierre , I find myself wondering whether he is the most contented person I have ever met .
But he is keen to know whether I am having a good time on his island too .
Every day he asks me if I am happy .
When I tell him things are great , his eyes light up and he replies in pidgin , " Oh , tenkyu tumas . "
Whether happiness can truly be measured is a debatable point , but there is no doubt that Metoma - or indeed Vanuatu as a whole - has the ingredients to encourage a greater sense of happiness .
The twin pillars of a classically happy life - strong family ties and a general absence of materialism - are common throughout this island nation .
The simple things in life , it seems , really do make you happy .

What are these ?
I discontinued use of the alarm clock I was using because the time would change on its own .
I then replaced it with a clock radio with a projector built in .
I do n't know why they decided to design it with the projector having it's own timekeeping device independently set from the main .
Nevertheless , last night , I woke to the alarm when the projector said 4:20 a.m .
The main said 6:27 or something .
I set the wake time for 6:25 .
Needless to say the main time had skipped ; acting just like the clock I just replaced .
I have a girlfriend who tells me that when we are intimate she feels electric pulses from my body .
I have been around the world and had many women .
They all have told me that .
Lately the phone rang , I answered , there was nobody on the other end .
I looked at the caller I.D.
It said " Shawn " ( not the real name , changed to conceal identity . )
We called back one Shawn we knew , he said he did not call .
Next thing , the other Shawn called .
We asked him if he called , he swore up and down he did n't .
I saw his name .
This computer here is acting funny as if it has a virus or something .
I just finished a scan .
It came up clean .
I saw this man 's name on the caller I.D. before he called , and then he did .
I am not making this up , this scares me .
I work fast food and some of the timers have been resetting themselves when I operate them .
Funny thing is : a 420 is police code for a marijuana offense , and just lately I have cleaned up from smoking .
Funny the time set itself ahead to where the projector 's time said 4:20 a.m. , is n't it ?
I am beginning to believe that the weed was squelching some sort of psychic electrotelekinesis or some shit .
What will happen next ?
Please someone give me some insight .
I do n't want to go mad .
This all started when I stopped smoking pot for the first time in seven years .

I burn out lightbulbs when I am angry or just when I am charged with energy .
Anything with batteries stops working when i touch it .
I have even been accused of draining a car battery .
and sometimes stero's and tv's malfunction around me like turn on by themselves or make strange ( voltage like ) noises when i walk past them even when they are off .
I have also had coffee cups shatter in my hands .
What the heck is going on with me .?
someone help please !!!!

I am constantly getting shocked when i touch things .
Plastic , steal , people , and even water .
I cant wear a watch because i kill the battery .
It doesnt matter if its cold , hot , rainy , clear , anytime at all .
It does n"t matter what i wear or if i am barefoot .
Any where , at home , in the car , stores , on tile floors , or any where you can imagine .
I cant get it to stop .

I have many weird things about me that no one else knows i want to tell someone , but they sound like i am crazy
I have shut down our entire schools electricity by accident while in a meditative state , also i have found that i can meditate in such a way that i stop breathing , thinking , and possiblyother functions of my body .
I used to spoon bend as stupid as that sounds but when i taught someone else i found that i couldnt do it any more but they could .
i enjoy electricity and i feel little pain , and my mom has been shocked by high voltage man times , once by lightning , once by commercial outlet , once by house wiring / basement flood , once by lightbulb , the list gos on and on
unless me and my mom drink water intently , and without distraction it always sprays out of the cup and gets water in our eyes for no reason .
sometimes i see weird things like people climbing up things and flying off of them , but those are probably halluycinations , if i ever put a peice of paper in front of me and i wright onit whatever i wright unconsiously is genius and wonderful , but if i try to wright i suck , i and many of my friends see weird red hands or other things that others cant see i can see auras .
and isaw beautiful creatures dancing around me and playin beautiful msic ithink they were angels .

For years I have disrupted and broken many electric and battery - operated objects .
One , in particular , is my keyless entry car alarm .
From the first day , it has never worked correctly for ME .
I 've taken it to the dealer twice and other people have used it .
Everyone seems to make me look like a liar because it works for them .
I 've broken cell phones , cordless phones , radios .
When I am in the bedroom the remote will not work correctly .
I have to leave the room for my husband to use it .
I was at my neighbor 's home one day when her husband came in from outside and blamed her for messing with stereo , which was hooked up inside / outside .
It was my presence in their home which sent it haywire .
I resorted to a solar watch .
It works great .

Hello
Well I would like to share with you some of the things that often happens to me ,
I can't stop blowing the lamp and house light bulbs , and that ? s not the worse or it , I actually destroy the whole thing ,
I also noted when I drive and pass a street light , or stop at the red signal , the nearest light will go off , and later relit ,
When I am in inside a pool , swimming , then I can still attract the plastic little bags , and the dry leaves , fall from a close tree ,
not all the time , but for periods
When I touch people , i shock them , and metals of course , this also happen when is raining and I am wet , is worse when I am stress
for a week in a hotel with magnetic cards to open the door , i need to get the card recharge few times , because the get useless , as well as credit cards , even the plane ticket with magnetic bands , all electronic devices will show failure soon or later ,
some airports can not take my passport into the reading machine ,
I have try everything but nothing works , i have no explanation for these things happening to me , and sometimes the pain in my arm is so terrible , i cant use my arm properly for a few days .
is there anyone that can help me up ??
thanks ,

I found this site while trying to figure out what my problem is .
When I was around 4 years old , I discovered a little metal panel in the floor of my old house in New Jersey .
I opened this , and stuck my hand inside .
I received a powerful vibrating shock from some AC wires carrying current inside .
I was not at all harmed and actually enjoyed the sensation .
When I was in elementary school , I used to sit down at my chair every day , only to have my hand shocked from lightly touching the metal legs .
At age 10 , I spontaneously developed an extreme passion for circuits , magnets , and all things electrical .
But recently , one of my good friends showed a portable device used to test outlets and household wiring for live AC current .
I messing around with it and I held it in my hand .
Suddenly , I heard the rapid beeping and saw the flashing red light of an LED , signaling contact with an AC current .
Curious , I found that if I pinched the prong meant to be stuck in an electrical outlet between my fingers , the wild beeping resumed .
I tested the device on DC current , and got no response whatsoever .
I then tested the batteries of the AC detector and found that they had more volts than they should .
I asked my friend to try to get a signal from his own fingers , and nothing happened .
I read the label on the device and saw that it only worked in a range of 50 - 1000 volts , AC only .

Hi ,
Something very strang has happen to me about an hour ago when I was in my mum 's garden , surrounded by my family .
My dad has a fox terrier that I really love playing with .
Just as I was sitting on the chair the dog came near me asusual but just as I touched its nose I got a small electric shock .
But the strange thing is that the dog backed away ( like jolted on all four legs ) and ran away from me terrorised .
He just acted so strange .
Everybody saw what happened and when I told them I had a small shock they just laughed .
They just told me that I must have accidently stepped on its foot and the dog reacted .
At this time the dog remained terrified of me and like shaking .
After a while my dad went to bring the dog near and told me to touch it again to see how I had been mistaken .
But believe it or not ( I still can't believe it myself ) it happen again .
This time the dog ran and went to hide in an old cupboard in the garden shed .
A thing dad 's dog never done .
He remained there shaking .
Mum tried to tempt him with icecream , as he goes mad for ice - cream , but still he would not come out .
I did not dare touch the poor dog again today .
I just do n't know what happened can someone please explain to me what happen as this has never happened to me before .

I have always had a problem with static electricty , constantly receiving shocks off anything metal , and know even plastic !
But the worst incident has to be when I was working in the lighting department of a department store .
I was removing a light from the wall and so turned the electricity off in the panel I was working on .
However as soon as I held the connector block ready to unscrew the wires I received a massive shock and the light exploded .
There was a huge shower of sparks , part of the screwdriver melted , and the power went out in half the department .
When the electrician was called down he could not work out what had happened , especially as none of the fuses had blown .
As the power was turned off there should have been no way in which this could have happened .
It was eventually decided that the shock I received was the only way it could have happened .
The electrician had to pull up half the floor to finally put the power back on .

Ok i think it starts from when i was about four i was messing with our washing machine and it gave me a huge shock hitting me against the wall .
Ever since then anything electrical would short out or completely turn off .
When i was in school if i got nervous or was completely happy the lights would flicker only if i was around , and one time when i was angry cuz a teacher was gona fail me the lights in the room shorted out and the lights in the hallway flickered on and off .
Also for some weird reason i can actually see the lights flicker and i'll ask my friends did ya see that and they look at me like i'm crazy and say no
I would like to know why this happens pls email me if you have answers

I know what all you people are talking about with the extra static .
While i have never perminately broken watches they seem to go through batteries really fast and never keep the right time within a few days they will be off by a few minutes so in a couple of months they will be off by an hour or two .
They stay like that after i get rid of them too or will slow down too much after i give them away .
it does n't seem to matter if they a digital or analogue .
My cell phone does n't always work right in my pocket people are always saying that the called me but i never recieve it .
once i called someone on my way to see them and got their answering machine 10 min later i was talking to them in person their phone rung and it had my name on the caller id .
my phone was in my pocket so we checked but i wasnt calling according to my phone .
weird .
T.V.s with antennas come in clearer when i get close to them and if i touch the antenna it gets crystal clear .
I once had to hold a tv antenna for a 30 min show cause it was the only way it would come in .
If i touch a car antenna at home i could get D.C. radio stations that was almost 150 miles away .
Should have been out of signal for a good 45 miles .
the problem is when i let go it goes back to where it was .
People often had me hold radio antennas cause when adjusting the radio im touching the knob so it comes in clear but as i walk away it gets fuzzy or vice versa there will be static as i walk to it and it clears as i walk away .
I have never put out lightbulbs or anything but when i was a kid i would get hot at night and could light up the whole room if i took my pjs off just from the static .
my hair never wants to stay down unless i use a lot of conditioner or rub dryer sheets on it .
lol
It also retains smells for long periods of time especially inscence .
I have to use lots of dryer sheets in the laundry like 4 or 5 at a minimum cause static from clothes makes it a lot worse .
you will see sparks from my fingers most certainly if i forget my dryer sheets .
Odd thigs zap me like waterfountains , water itself , walls , wooden things , plastic handles , a brush while trying to brush my hair , zippers , when i was a kid my friends were at a museum and they were playing with that ball that has the eltricity in it they wanted me to touch it so i did normally it would only make someones hair stick up but i swear it came out of the ball and jolted me a good one .
I dont think that is normal .
my car door always gets me even if its raining , it does n't seem to matter what im wearing .
i shock people , pets , strangely enough door knobs do n't normally do it but the door itself will no matter what its made of wood , metal , glass , etc .
To avoid the pain i usually touch things with my leg or my elbow first it hurts there less than a knuckle .
people do make weird faces when i touch my knee to the water fountain before taking a sip and they ask what are you doing i reply not getting zapped then they think im crazy .
i showed one once but a shock to the lips from water hurts a lot but if i dont touch it first it will make a little bolt like zap at least 2 to three inches long before the water gets to my mouth .
ouch .
cellophane from wrappers sticks to me , cling wrap sticks to me , some other plastic wrappers stick to me , sometimes my hair will get stuck to my face , ive had someone elses hair stick to me lol , i have seen street lights go out as most people have said but i dont think it has anything to do with me personally i thought they were supposed to do that .
note to everyone dryer sheets are your friend .
I dont have as bad a problem as i had as a kid but i think the excessive use of dryer sheets may be holding it back .
lol

Good to read other peoples storys , I find it very strange whats happening , and why these shocks start .
MY shocks started 3 weeks ago , very sim to the rest of the other peoples stories .
My computer crashes all the time , i get shocks from everything i touch around my home , and other people .
i get shocks all day from almost everything i touch , the worst zap for me is from electrical sockets , even turning the kettle socket on , and getting my dry washing out of the dryer .
Its a nightmare !!!
Also strange in the 3weeks i have experienced this 3 light bulbs in my home have blown when ive gone to turn them on .
Havnt had the experienc of the street lights blowing , but then again i havnt bin out at night .
If any one is experiencing the same as me .
I cant really get my head why this is happening

I also turned out street lights , but I also happened to have a paper clip stick to my side .
My body becomes magnetic .
I think it has to do with chakras .
Do you all believe in God or are spiritual .

This is so funny .
I am glad I found this website , because so many weird things have happened to me ever since I can remember , but whenever I try to tell somebody , noone ever believes me .
Whenever I am in a bad mood , or my mind is n't thinking very fast because I am in a really angry mood , and I am on the computer , it runs realllly slow .
Whenever I think really fast , like I know what I am trying to do , it actually goes fast .
Also , when I think that I have figured something out , and I know what 's going on , everything I touch , esp. the screws on the light switches shock me !!
I can like see the blue flash coming from it .
I am so used to it , that it sometimes makes me laugh .
I do n't understand why it only does it when i am in certain moods .
When I am around everybody , it happens very very rarely .
I have like even tried to put my hand up to the cmoputer when I feel like I have some kind of electrical charge in my body , to see if it will have that kind of effect that t.v. screens have when you put a battery or magnet up to it .
But it has n't worked .
I just want to know what goes on when I am in certain moods , why it does it , but whenever I am in a different mood , it does n't ?
I can also change my moods very often , and very well .
Maybe that has something , or everything to do with it ?
Oh and also , I used to hang out with somebody who claimed that he was the devil 's luck , or something like that , because every time we would go on the highway in my vehicle , the streetlights would go out .
I never believed him , but I want to know if it is possible !

I am so relieved to see many other " electric " people out there !
I once brought a whole PILE of watches to a watchmaker , thinking they were all out of batteries .
It seems a watch lasts only a few wears for me .
After being told that it was NOT the batteries for each and every one , I gave up on wearing watches .
I once threw a blue arc over 7 inches long from my fingertip to a metal door handle as I reached for it .
I can not pet my parents dog , as I shock the dog and myself as I stoke its fur , at a rate of about one shock per second .
I can shock myself repeatedly as I walk through a grocery store if my hands are on a metal shopping cart .
Just sitting and not moving , I collect enough to create a spark on any metal surface I touch .
I have recently noticed a relationship between strong emotion , and the severity of the shocks .
Interesting !
I am afraid to plug in anything to a wall socket , as I usually get shocked .
I have been electrocuted many times by appliances made of metal or chrome , just touching their surface .
I enjoyed reading about others with this problem , now I do n't feel so alone !

I just decided today to look this sort of thing up because earlier today I got got a huge shock when closing the car door .
Let me just tell you , I get shocked 100 % of the time touching anything metal and because of this I resort to touching the GLASS of the car ... does it work ?
NOPE .
Now also let me say this does n't happen to anyone else , just me !
There could be five people in the car , I get the shock !
I do n't like to hug people or touch people because I always get shocked and 60 % of the time I am the one who feels the pain !
I HATE doing laundry , just being close to the dryer before I open it makes me feel strange , then when I open it and pull stuff out , my hands hurt , like a dull pain deep in my hands and all my hairs stand on end , then I get a headache !
I get shocked touching everything really , but not as certainly as metal .
When I was younger I was scared of lightning storms , just like any kid , but now I am still scared , and I know it 's because of this .
I was outside one day just a cloudy day , looked like rain , I just stepped outside and I felt that same feeling as the dryer headache and all , I knew I should n't be outside , then my friend screamed " oh sh * * ! " followed by the loudest sound I have ever heard , my feet could not get me back inside fast enough that I seriously ran out of my flip flops !!
haha I saw the flash of lightning and felt it too , like I can't explain , but it was right behind me just a few feet ... out of all the places to land !
I never plug things in because of the sparks that form , realy scare me , and if my everyday shocks hurt , I can't imagine those !
And finally , like my hands are verry sensitive and I am very touchy feely .
I am actually a massage therapist , and all my life people have realy enjoyed my touch , even as a child ..
I realy think this ties in because your nerves are electric your brain is electric .

I am a 30 - year - old female .
I get shocked when I touch things such as ( but not limited to ) : water coming out of the tap , produce , flowers , and , of course , metal objects ( i.e. , my car door -- EVERY time I open it from the inside [ when I touch the metal frame , after I 've pulled the handle ) and electronics ( i.e. , I have twice shorted out a Sony Vaio desktop display ) .
When I pick up my open laptop up ( hands on either side of the keyboard ) & carry it across the room , this often results in painful electric shocks to both hands .
Plus , I 'm ALWAYS shocking other people .
It does seem to get worse in the winter .
I 'm thinking about taking electricitycentraldot com's advice & wearing a metal thimble all the time .

First off would like to say I am thrilled I found this site .
I have found my class of people .
That is the electric people .
I am 26 and for the majority of my life I get constantly frustrated when it comes to electronics .
I would consider my self ext technology advanced as well so there as see is a huge dilema .
My exp good quality well rated laptops in the past have shut down for no reason costing me lots of money .
Sometimes it scrambles wildly , gets stuck , screeches , forwards and backwards and enters here and there causing me to lose alot of unsaved written work and emails .
I dont know what to do .
Its frustration and i lose my temper and throw things .
Ive seen my cell phone dial contacts by itself a couple of times , static there too of course , ive had instances dead battery less alarm clocks act as if it were a tape recorder repeating lines of things i would say .. hm what else ..
Im extremely electric .
I can hear it .
When I awake i feel it in my body very high .
So recently i learned something about Hands on Healing .
Those of you who are exp what I am should check it out .
Can turn the frustrations and energy imbalance into gifts / good use .
As for other paranoma events , I would consider myself somewhat pyschic .
Ive seen images , feel presences , sometimes hear it , done astral projection ( all my life ) naturally .
Its very easy for me , but more powerful when i was a child .
There is another topic
Id like to add to this forum .
I m wondering if anyone has similar experiences or can perhaps explain to me something anything ...... Since a child , I always am prone to getting hit with balls .
Esp. in gym class , its more than often a ball or two would come flying my way .. sometimes with exp hard impact .
When I am out at parks , frisbees , little balls , big balls , all would come flying my way .
When i go to parks , I always make sure i scan the field and watch my back .
Cause
Ive been smacked pretty hard in the past ..
Once even sprained my thumb severely .
I am wondering if any way this correlates to the electric part of me .
Plese feel free to email me or share ur similar story .
Anythign helps . =)

This is a true story .
I had never told it to anyone before but I moved here and told a good friend of mine .
She was freaked out by everything and believed me because lights always flicker around me .
It tends to be when I am most emotional , whether happy or sad , just very emotional .
So she went online and searched and found this website , I decided to add my story also .
Electrical problems tend to happen when I am near .
One day there was a bad storm outside of my high school but all the electricity was fine .
That day I had to get up to answer some sort of question and the second I got up and got all nervous and started speaking , a fuse blew up and the school lost most its electricity .
My classroom being the first .
When I went outside all the cars lights were going out of control , so I stepped back inside and they stopped .
The second I went outside again , the cars lost it again .
I always get shocks .
Things always flicker around me .
I also found that now , if I try , I can make storms go away .
Small things like someones earphone zapping them right when I was thinking how much the loud music bugged me or an entire losing all its electricity until I calm down and other things as well .
I guess I cannot say it all and some of the things are just hard to describe .
But my mom also has something .
She can move things .
One time I was on the road with her and she started moving the wheel with her hands .
Without touching the wheel .
She can pick small things up like bracelets and ear - rings and pencils with just putting her hand inches from the object and moving somewhere else .

My niece walks by a cordless telephone and it sometimes rings on its own .
She was diagnosed with PDD years ago and since then my brother and his wife have tried different treatments to no sucess .
I had her do a hair analysis and the results were that she had 5 heavy metals that were outside the referance range .
They were Antimony , Bismuth , Gadolinium , Tin and Uranium .
I was wondering could these heavy metals have anything to do with static electricity and making the phone ring ?
She is now doing chelation therapy to remove the heavy metals .
we 'll see what happens .

I am so excited to have found this website , as I had only met one other person up until now with my problem .
Any watch that I wear lasts only for a few days - initially speeding up time , before slowing down rapidly and stopping .
I have tried old fashioned wind up watches , but they also stop working after a while , and can not be restarted once they die .
When I have my cell phone in my pocket it dies within an hour ; and even if I keep it in a leather holder in my pocket , it will not hold its charge for more than 8 hours , so have to keep it in my purse , so I miss a lot of calls .
I have never had problems with lights or lightening that I know of ; but have had quite a few psychic events .
Maybe I 'll get a land line phone and set up a psychic network !

I do n't honestly know if I cause light bulbs to blow .
I know I change a lot of them .
And contrary to most , my watch batteries last forever !
But I have other electrical weirdness .
After moving into our house , the TV and computer both died within days of each other .
The electric company said the lines were fine .
I have gone outside to walk the dog , and come back in to find a lamp on that I never turn on .
I have used the TV remote to change the channel , and had the stereo turn on .
And today I was listening to a CD in the car when I heard a strange beep in the middle of a song .
I looked at the display , and a radio traffic alert appeared .
On the CD player !
The song continued to play as though nothing had happened .
So I figure someone or something wants me to know they 're here .
Really strange .
If I did n't know better , I 'd think I was losing it !

Electic Person
I just left a report about myself in the Ball Lightning category .
I too find that I may be an " electric person " .
I have the same affinity for electronics .
Ever since childhood I have seemed to be able to talk " to machines to know what is wrong .
Even without really doing anything .
I used to fix my parrents VCRs , TVs , Phones anything at a very young age .
They explained it off as me loving Legos LOL not sure where that came from .
But this has carried into my adult life .
I spent 9 years as a US Marine in Sat Comm / CPU repair .
I excelled at the troubleshooting and would mystify my colleagues as I rarely used schematics unless to show others my work .
I would just " know " where a problem was and fix it .
I work in Telecommunications now as a Video Conferencing Engineer and A/V specialist .
I am one of those people now that when I walk in a room everything works but the second I leave things seem to stop at times .
This is especially frustrating because i get called to " stay " in the rooms for good luck while big meetings are going on .
I am wondering if this is related to my dreams and paralysis and waking up with ball lightning seeming to hover over me .

for a while I could make any electronic stuff go haywire .
It was mainly stuff that operated on radio waves , then I began to notice that it only happened when I was yelling and singing .
I think it might be something to do with my voice , possibly my vocal freqency .
By the way I met someone on another site like this who said he could see in the dark .
I thought he had really good night vision but when I met him he demonstrated that he had thermal vision .
This stuff we can do is amazing and a gift , never think otherwise .
P.S
We have tested each other and always have conclusive results and we have a list of other people like us .
we try to help some of them if we can , since although we are young we have developed some control and have some interesting ideas about the origin of all our abilities .
If you want more info or just want to share your own we would be more than happy to receive your emails .

ELECTRIC PEOPLE
I thought I was the only person in the world with this problem .
Firstly I have been struck by lightning 3 times , twice while driving , my car was hit and once when switching off the TV lightning struck my TV aerial and melted all the internal workings of the set .
Computers hate me .
I dare not use anyone ?s computer other than my own , or it will not work correctly again .
I get static shocks off my car and my cats .
If I stand near an electronic till it invariably gives error messages .
I went to the bank and while I was being served the whole computer system went down this has also happened in the job centre the building society and a huge warehouse that had about 15 till all running when I went to pay for one item .
and all the tills went off line .
I went to the local shop to get a lottery ticket and the machine went down while printing my ticket .
The following day it was on national news that the machines for the whole of Stoke on Trent went offline at the same time .
While talking to a friend on the phone in America ( I?m in the UK ) he was on the computer at a large organization , He suddenly said ?
Ooh ?
I asked what was up and he explained that all the computers in the room had gone off line with a system error .
My local computer shop won?t allow me to approach their counter .
I once went on a school visit at my children ?s school and was invited to use one of the computers in the computer room , I declined saying ?
You really don?t want me to do that ?
I went to a job agency and when I typed my name in it crashed , so I was put on another computer , I typed my name in and that crashed too .
I ended up filling in a paper application .
Several years later my son went to the same agency on my recommendation and when he typed in his name the computer crashed the guy asked if he was any relation to me and was amazed when he said ?
That ?s my dad ?
My council tax had to be worked out on paper for years because the computer threw a system error when ever they tried to process my account , and at one point they had me as living at the same address twice and tried to charge me double rent because their computer could n?t cope with the data .
Digital watches won?t work on me .
They will just jump several hours or stop altogether but it someone else puts them on they work fine .
My wife ended up with my ?200 seiko ( kinetic ) watch because it just would not go while on my wrist .
My own computers over the years , have always been a little strange and amaze the guys at the computer shop by doing things they are not supposed to be capable of .
These are just the incidents that come immediately to mind .
At one time it was amusing but now I don?t find it in the least funny .
It happen 5 times out of 10 when I ?m near any electronic device

I seem to have problems with DVD players , VCR?s , TV?s , street lamps ( severely at a time ) , computers , light bulbs , I get shocked by static electrety all the time , it hurts really bad , I think more then it should , and I shock other people .
I also have seen spirits of the dead and a lot of times I know what is going to happen before it happens ( including the death a person ) .
I remember when I was a teenage and I was having an argument with my mom and then fuse blow in the room we were in , at the moment that I became very angry with her .
This happens all the time when I am emotionally charged , angry , hyper , or any other strong feeling .
Most of the time I feel has if I am tingly with energy all threw my body and around myself .
If I am sick or depressed I do n't feel it has much .
I think that some people just function on a higher frequency then others .
I think this can also go into psychic vampirism ; if you are not sure what this is here is a little brief .
Individuals have the ability to draw some kind of psychic energy from others .
This means that you can take energy from others and others can take from you .
As neat has this my sound it can actually be very harmful to both parties .
I think we all have encounter both sides of this exchange , if you talk to someone and you become energized or drained there is an energy exchange happening .
I have friends who I feel are vampires and they will even have the nerve to say things such as : " Oh I had a great day I guess I took your positive energy for awhile " .
Or they will say something like : " I need an Amber fix " .
I have been working at disconnect my energy from these people with great luck so far .
To bring this full circle I think people who are on a higher frequency tend to blow lights or mess up electrical items because of a simple energy exchange .
These people also tend to be psychic ?s in some form , if they open up to it .
I also think this people are more open to being a victim of vampirism .

My name is Alicia and I am 23 yrs old .
I have been getting shocked sense I could remember but it has gotten worse in the past 2 yrs or so .
My work and grocery stores are the worst for me .
I work at a TV Station so you could only imagine how bad it could get cause I work around all metal equipment , computers and so on .
Everything I touch I get shocked by it , sometimes it's a good thing and sometimes a very bad thing .
I have shut down our systems a few times and I threw us off air .
Sometimes even when something is not working I go to touch it and it comes back on or starts working again .
The people that I work with think i'm very weird they always crack jokes on me about it .
The weird thing is that it 's not only metal objects anymore it 's EVERYTHING , like I could be walking close to a wall and get shocked .
Some other objects that I have been getting shocked by lately , pop cans , doors , TV's , office chairs , light switches , and the weirdest off all is water .
I go to turn on the water and like everyone else I feel the water to see how cold or hot it is , well I stick my hand under the water and I get shocked it 's always at work though maybe we have to much lead or something in our water .
Sometimes the shocks will hurt really bad and sometimes I get like a little burn dots on my fingers or hand .
The up side of it all is that I can chase my kids around constantly shocking them LOL they think it is funny .
My husband on the other hand hates it though cause I go to give him a kiss and I shock him on the lips .
The only other bad thing is we can never have enough light bulbs in our house I just blew out 2 last night when I was trying to cook supper for my kids .
Is it weird or just me ?
I never really thought about it as being weird at all I just thought it was natural , until everyone kept bringing to my attention when I would do something weird as they would call it .
My coworkers just say that I have an electric personality LOL .
I believe the coolest part about it is lights going out , like when i'm driving at night and the street lights go out I kinda feel like i'm in the twilight zone or something or maybe
It 's cause I daze off .
Here is a question for all of you .
When your driving or what ever your doing , do you ever daze off so bad that you know exactly what your doing but you do n't .
You go from point A to point B and do n't remember driving or walking there or how you got there ?
But you know whats going on when your doing it like your there but your not ?
Kinda hard to explain .
Maybe that 's when the most happens to me when i'm in a sort of zone .
Could that be ?

Almost everyone on this site has posted very dramatic reports .
My case is not really dramatic : I am definitely a watch - stopper , but I do n't blow lightbulbs or computers .
And it takes awhile -- about a month or so -- for a watch to quit working .
I DO have an electric shock experience -- when I was 8 , I got shocked by an old hair dryer I was using -- I 'm not sure what happened , but I remember feeling shocked and I jumped into my Daddy 's arms and was shaking all over .
( I also remember my parents suggested I was overreacting , so I 've never been sure about what really went down ) .
As for street lights , they go out only very rarely , which is apparently very normal according to internet research on this topic .
It has n't happened enough times to make me think " it 's me . "
I do not seem to blow lightbulbs with any real frequency .
However , having said that , I do remember an incident with a light in my friend 's house that started getting weird when I was standing directly under it and it stopped when I walked away .
But things like this do n't happen with any real regularity , so I question if I 'm the cause .
Same thing with car alarms : I have noticed that I can sometimes stop a car alarm if I touch the car , but it does n't always work .
To the lady with the husband who stops watches -- is he a " sometime SlIder " like me ?
Anybody else have mild cases or only the watch - stopping thing in common ?

Over the years , I just thought I had a problem with static electricity .
I zap myself whenever I walk through the grocery store .
In cold weather , the problem seems worse .
I thought everyone had this problem .
Unfortunately , it does n't stop there I zap myself while walking on tile , carpet , even concrete .
I have even sent a 2 - 3 inch blue spark at times .
When petting my poor cats , I send little silver sparks .
They no longer let me pet their ears .
While vacationing at Epcot in Florida , I touched the computer screen at a display and brought down the server .
It took about 20 minutes for them to bring it back up .
I also disrupt credit card machines where you have to sign your name with an electronic pen .
The machine goes haywire and makes all kinds of squiggles and stray marks where the person is supposed to be signing .
My mother makes me stand about 5 feet away from her when we are shopping and she wants to pay by credit card .
Watch batteries do n't last .
Clocks on the wall near the door do n't last .
I have found a solution to the watch problem .
I only wear vintage mechanical watches or mechanical watches from the Chaika watch company in Russia .
I have worn out the horn in my car and the lighting system .
My dome light in my car wo n't turn off when I close the door .
I have to completely turn it off all the time .
I have noticed the lights in my bedroom flicker when I walk by .
The T.V. in my bedroom sometimes turns back on even after I 've turned it off .
This is annoying , but it 's mild compared to other problems .
When I start to get angry , I can feel my fingers start to tingle .
I have also noticed that I give myself fevers when under emotional stress .
My normal body temperature is 97.3 F , so by a fever , I mean anything more than one full degree above my normal temperature .
Try explaining to a doctor that even though your temperature is reading 98.6 , you 're burning up .
They do n't believe me and say my temp is normal , so it 's no big deal .
The hardest part is not the sparks , or things breaking .
It 's having people think I 'm some sort of psycho flake for saying I have this problem .
Unless it has happened to them or someone they know , they tend to dismiss me as a kook .
I have learned to keep quiet about things .
Only a handfujl of my very closest friends and my family know about me .
There are more things that have happened , but I do n't care to discuss them even anonymously .
I would then have to admit they 're real .
I have had many things happen that are too frequent for me to entirely believe they 're coincidence .
I dismiss them as coincidence , but my family is convinced I 'm causing them .
I try not to fall into the trap of believing I can heal or curse people .
I joke around about it , but try to dismiss it as coincidence .

I also have dealt with this " problem " or " gift " for many years .
It has always been bothersome to me and even embarrassing at times .
But , now as an adult , I would like to learn more about it .
How to control it , and maybe even become more powerful .
I have had computers catch fire in front of me .
Overhead projector bulbs blow just walking by them , my car acted like something out of an " attach from the aliens " movie .
And light bulbs ?
Please , I should take stock in them .
I hate the dark , but yet I can't seem to keep up with the bulbs going out .
There are so many stories .
It is nice to know that I am not alone any more .

I 've always had problems with shocking things I touched .
usually doors , shopping carts and it progressed to pretty much everything but food .
I now see the sparks as lightning the actually spiders out in a bright blue light .
It happens most often as I put my keys in any door .
When I get out of cars I use my elbows because the shock is becoming painful .
The sounding , pop , could be adding to it .
I also shock other people quite often and poor unsuspecting pets that get good ones right on the tip of their noses .
I always pick up my feet when I walk , and now I cautiously touch anything out of the fear from the jolting shock .
Aside from the shock it is turning out to be quite a beautiful light show at night .
I am curious now as to what could cause this to happen so often !

I dont know if is as much as a phenomena as it is just weird .
Every house my husband and I have every lived in blows out light bulbs like crazy .
It has nothing to do with our electrical .
We even went out and bought those knew 60 year gar .
energy saving 20 $ bulbs blow out in 3 days .
This house were in now we have been here from about 10 years .
Its getting pretty expensive our celling fans have 4 light bulbs we keep 1 in each fan .
What is up ?

I have recently been occupied by a static charge .
I have never had this sort of thing happen , never been able to shock anyone , but now I can touch my husband over and over again and shock him .
I wear ear - bud headphones hooked into my PDA to listen to music and everytime I move , I get a shock in my ear .
It i uncomfortable , but not painful .

And once again I find myself both amused and completely horror - struck by the evangelical cult that resides within the GOP .
They ’re consistently bested by their faith , and to the point of absurdity .
This is especially true with regards to the climate crisis .
And quite frankly , I blame Jesus .
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann ’s comments about House Speaker Pelosi brought the issue to the front of the line .
In her current bout of political tourettes , she had this to say :
“ [ Pelosi ] is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that she ’s just trying to save the planet , ” Bachmann told news site OneNewsNow .
“ We all know that someone did that over 2,000 years ago , they saved the planet — we did n’t need Nancy Pelosi to do that . ”
[ social_buttons ]
Yes , folks … stop recycling , throwout your reusable bags and just let your cars run all day long .
For Jesus , yes the one and only Jesus , has already fixed that whole global warming thingamabob .
Mind you , this lady is notorious for her hair - brained explanations .
For example , did you know that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is now 100 % wildlife free ?
Yep , same great taste but less filling .
And this is why the Democrats favor high gas prices :
“ They want Americans to take transit and move to the inner cities .
They want Americans to move to the urban core , live in tenements , [ and ] take light rail to their government jobs .
That ’s their vision for America . ”
Yes , Al Gore , dressed a la Dr. Evil , is trying to scare us all in to using light rail .
Oh the horror of it all !
It ’s just too convenient .
I mean all of it , if the planet is all saved thanks to Super Jesus then why do I keep getting copies of the Watchtower ?
Just let the guy do his job , already – no one likes to be micromanaged .
But that ’s the rub .
We ’re not saved .
He did not save us .
None of it is okay .
We must stop denying it like that mom in the jaw - dropping Jesus Camp movie ?
We cannot lend ourselves to distractions like the plight of the incandescent bulb .
There is no time .
Accountability is our only salvation , not Jesus .
So I pray .
I pray for Congresswoman Bachmann .
I also pray for that crazy mom in the movie .
I pray that for whatever bulb they choose , they themselves wo n’t remain perpetually dim .

When it comes to the natural highs , Gracienne Myers says sex just does n't cut it .
Shoes , on the other hand , get her heart racing .
Ramani Durvasula preparing to climb Half Dome in Yosemite National Park in September 2007 .
The 34 - year - old Brazilian native who now calls State College , Pennsylvania , home says there 's just something about heels , sandals , platforms and wedges that give her a rush .
" They 're thrilling , " says the entrepreneur , who recently started designing her own line of shoes and selling them online and through a handful of retail locations .
She still remembers the rush she got when she found a pair of strappy gold heel sandals at a boutique in Brazil .
" I 'll never forget it , " she recalls , " that feeling of being powerful and sexy in those shoes . "
For natural highs -- from stilettos to skydiving -- experts say to look beyond the bedroom .
Some activities can actually mimic your brain 's response to sex , says Ronald Frederick , a licensed psychologist and the author of the forthcoming book " Living Like You Mean It : Use the Wisdom and Power of Your Emotions to Get the Life You Really Want . "
" Some of the same chemicals are involved , " he says .
" A ' natural high , ' that pleasant feeling one experiences during and after a certain activity like running or strenuous exercise , has to do with the release of endorphins , as well as other mood - regulating hormones such as adrenaline , serotonin , cortisol and melatonin .
Orgasm also produces a flood of endorphins , which is what makes us feel calm and relaxed after sex . "

For some people , the natural high is just that : high up .
" Hiking and climbing mountains is better than sex , " says Ramani Durvasula , a professor at California State University Los Angeles who discovered the sport last year after reaching a big weight loss goal .
" When you pull yourself up onto a summit -- and climax , so to speak , particularly as a woman -- the sheer physicality , beauty and endurance are like no other feeling on earth , " she explains .
Durvasula , 42 , has climbed summits throughout California .
" My favorite ' lover ' was Half Dome , " she says , " the iconic rock formation in Yosemite . "
When she reached the top , " I fell to my knees .
It was one of the best moments of my life . "
The science of natural highs
Scientists have long known that some decidedly nonsexual things can get our brains going .
For instance , researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston found that a baby 's smile activates a region in the mother 's brain known to produce feelings of euphoria .
The same can be said for money and praise ; Japanese researchers have linked both to the brain 's pleasure centers .
In other words , whether you get a raise at work or a big compliment from the person you 're dating , your striatum -- the brain 's reward system -- is likely to be turned on .
Anecdotal research maintains that shopping does it , too .
According to a small study released earlier this year by the British research and consulting firm MindLab International and sponsored by retailer T.J. Maxx , successful shopping produces a euphoric experience equal to kissing and other romantic activities .
The informal study , which followed 12 women for a day of shopping , found that heart rates increased to 192 beats per minute while shopping and , in particular , when they discovered an exciting find -- more than triple the normal resting heart rate of 60 .
The thrill of the crowd
Sometimes the best natural highs come from facing a crowd , a challenge that can be terrifying for some .
Terry Wisner , 58 , of Grand Blanc , Michigan , says it 's public speaking that turns him on .
Not surprisingly , he 's a professional speaker and leadership coach .
It 's not that he likes to hear himself talk -- " it 's all about the audience 's reaction , " says Wisner .
He particularly remembers the time he took the stage in front of a crowd of 8,000 in Las Vegas at an automotive convention .
" The connection to that audience was amazing , " he says .
" Not just for me , but for them as well .
This event took place over 5 years ago , and I still hear from audience members every now and then .
It still rocks my world just to think about it . "
Sausalito , California , resident Andy Kurtzig , 35 , finds his pleasure on a plate .
The CEO of JustAnswer.com regularly travels to the celebrated Napa Valley restaurant French Laundry .
" Each course is like foreplay , " he explains .
" Not too much , not too little -- just enough to make you want more .
Each course gets you progressively closer to tantalizing your taste buds even more .
The entire three - hour buildup is incredible ! "
Addicted to that feel - good feeling ?
Love something a little too much ?
You might want to start worrying , says Frederick , if it 's helping you mask or avoid underlying feelings , issues , anxiety or discomfort -- " for example , " he says , " being overly active , or addicted to working out , as a means to regulate one 's anxiety . "
The good news , he says , is that unlike drugs and alcohol , which produce dopamine in the brain , natural highs are less likely to be physically addictive .
" Research has shown that addictive substances like alcohol , nicotine and heroin activate a single pleasure circuit in the deepest and oldest part of the brain , " says Frederick .
" People become addicted to these substances because their systems become used to higher levels of dopamine and , when they do n't get it , feel deprived .
A drug floods the brain with dramatic levels of dopamine that are not the same as what is produced during a natural high . "
In short , he says , behaviors that cause natural highs may be a ton of fun , " but they do n't have the same propensity to become addictive . "

The Large Hadron Collider is scheduled to become active in less than a month , and yet most people in the world still do n't understand what this important device will do .
There have been a lot of misconceptions and false information presented by the mainstream media , so Something Awful 's famous team of respected science educators have put together this short guide to help you understand what the collider is and how it will affect your life .
HOW IT WORKS :
As the name implies , the machine works by colliding very very small particles called protons in an effort to create the submicroscopic equivalent of the World 's Craziest Car Crashes video series .
The general consensus in the world 's scientific community is that these collisions will shed new light as to how awesome explosions can be even when they are really small .
Another good reason scientists give for colliding protons is that it will help us develop our understanding of what happens in nature when a giant machine smashes two protons together .
The collisions are performed on a large , ring - shaped track that straddles the border between Switzerland and France .
On this track are two specially designed go - karts upon which protons can be loaded through the use of a patient Swedish man named Sven who has unusually steady hands and a tiny pair of tweezers .
Once the go -karts are successfully protoned , they are pushed very quickly around the track by two guys who let go when they are about ten feet from each other , cover their faces and BAM , proton collision successful .
It is possible that the collision might create temperatures higher than those of our sun , but this will happen for only a brief fraction of a second so the guys pushing the karts should be fine .
At the worst , some light maiming might occur .
After the protons have collided , the real work begins .
Using cutting edge " bullet - time " technology borrowed from Hollywood , scientists will watch the explosions in super slow motion and then rate them on a scale from 1 to 10 asses being kicked .
Then they will pour another round of drinks and load up the go - carts again .
THE FOUR EXPERIMENTS :
The collisions caused by the Large Hadron Collider will actually be used in four separate experiments .
These experiments are as follows :
ATLAS : This experiment involves analyzing the particle collisions in hopes of finding traces of the theoretical Higgs boson particle , which would complete the standard model of particle physics and also conclusively prove that Harry Potter is a playfully complex work of literature that can be as rewarding for adults as it is for children .

CMS : This experiment is very similar to ATLAS , and the differences involve a lot of complex math .
For instance , it is two times cooler than ATLAS , with half as many dorks working on it .

LHCb :
This experiment involves men in white coats writing things down on clipboards .
We wanted to ask what they were studying , but they all seemed so serious and focused that we did n't want to bother them .

ALICE : This is the daughter of the guy who provided most of the funding for the construction of the collider .
She has a science fair coming up and needs to win so she can show up that dumb Bridget girl in Mrs.
Park 's class .
Imagine Bridget 's fat face when she sees Alice walking in with a subatomic collision detector the size of a football field .
Now kissing James Blackhill ( who totally actually has a crush on Alice but does n't want to hurt stupid Bridget 's stupid feelings ) does n't seem so cool , does it ?
FUN ACTIVITY :
Color in the Large Hadron Collider !
MYTHS AND FACTS :
Myth : The Large Hadron Collider is very unlikely to destroy the world .
Fact :
The moment they turn on the collider , or " Apocalypse - Creating Death Machine " as the technicians working there affectionately refer to it , the world will instantly be destroyed by dangerous shockwaves of scientific energy spreading all over the globe .
The scientists know this will happen , but plan to turn on the machine anyway because all scientists are evil .
Myth : The Large Hadron Collider is an important tool for furthering our understand of the universe .
Fact :
Who cares ?
It 's just studying stuff that 's even smaller than an atom , so the practical applications of the technology are basically non-existent .
At best , we might get a better version of the microwave out of this .
Or an improvement on velcro .
I think science created velcro , right ?
Myth :
It is funny and original to call it the " Large Hard - On Collider " .
Fact :
This one is absolutely true .
Some other good names along the same lines are the " Big Boner Machine " and the " Huge - Dick - Smasher - o - matic "
I hope you understand exactly how the collider works now .
See you and everyone else in the world on the other side !

World affairs correspondent , BBC News
Most of the Western media are based in Georgia The Bush administration appears to be trying to turn a failed military operation by Georgia into a successful diplomatic operation against Russia .
It is doing so by presenting the Russian actions as aggression and playing down the Georgian attack into South Ossetia on 7 August , which triggered the Russian operation .
Yet the evidence from South Ossetia about that attack indicates that it was extensive and damaging .
Blame game
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford has reported : " Many Ossetians I met both in Tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in Russia are furious about what has happened to their city .
" They are very clear who they blame : Georgia 's President Mikhail Saakashvili , who sent troops to re-take control of this breakaway region . "
Has Moscow learned yet how to play the media game ?
Human Rights
Watch concluded after an on - the - ground inspection : " Witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to Georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described [ in Tskhinvali ] . "
One problem for the Russians is that they have not yet learned how to play the media game .
Their authoritarian government might never do so .
Most of the Western media are based in Georgia .
The Russians were slow to give access from their side and this has helped them lose the propaganda war .
Georgia , meanwhile , was comparing this to Prague in 1968 and Budapest in 1956 .
Even the massacre at Srebrenica was recalled .
Mud sticks
The comparisons did not fit the facts , but some of the mud has stuck and Russia has been on the international defensive .
The visit by the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Georgia is a signal of support for Mr Saakashvili .
Significantly , she is not paying a matching visit to Moscow but will return directly to the United States where she will brief President George W Bush in Texas .
Washington has accused Russia of widening the conflict
She has refused to condemn Georgia and barely acknowledged Russia 's point that it had to protect its peacekeeping forces ( a battalion - sized unit allowed in South Ossetia along with Georgian and North Ossetian and South Ossetian forces under a 1992 agreement ) .
Instead she blamed Russia for widening the conflict by bombing beyond what the 1992 deal called the " zone of conflict " in South Ossetia .
She said : " This is something that , had it been about South Ossetia , could have been resolved within certain limits .
" Russian peacekeepers were in the area ; that is true .
And Russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people .
" But what Russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers . "
HAVE YOUR SAY Russia 's relations with the US may recover .
Its relations with the " near abroad " are shattered forever Stephen Thake , Valletta , Malta The Americans have sent in planes full of humanitarian aid , again a symbol of support .
But they have sent no military supplies .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates has said : " I do n't see any prospect for the use of military force by the United States in this situation .
Is that clear enough ? "
US diplomacy is also concentrating on the issue of sovereignty and territorial integrity - which means that South Ossetia and the other restless region , Abkhazia , must remain within Georgian borders .
Russian has questioned this .
Moscow 's anger
This widens the whole question into one of Russian behaviour generally , which is much surer ground for the Bush administration .
The US will continue to press for eventual Georgian and Ukrainian membership of Nato .
The Republican presidential hopeful Senator John McCain also sees in this conflict an opportunity to put Russia in the dock , declaring : " We are all Georgians now . "
Germany , at least , has been notably reluctant to find fault with Russia
All this is likely to anger Moscow , which will feel that it has a case and that it is being ignored .
Right from the start it said that the operation was not an invasion .
The adverse effect on US - Russia relations , about which Mr Gates warned , is going to be a two - way process .
There are signs , though , that there is some sympathy for Russia within the European Union - although not among the Eastern European states who still fear Russia and not in the British government , which has matched the US line about Russian " aggression " .
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeing Russian leaders and while she too will urge them not to challenge borders , the German government has been notably reluctant to blame Russia .

What are these ?
Admiral Michael Mullen made a surprise visit to Pakistan yesterday .
and according to the US Embassy he “ reiterated the US commitment to respect Pakistan ’s sovereignty “ .
Just hours later , US drones fired four missiles into South Waziristan , killing at least seven and injuring three others .
At the same time , speaking at the Air Force Association ’s annual conference , CIA Director Michael Hayden suggested that his agency is trying to “ tickle ” militant groups with missile strikes in an attempt to provoke a reaction .
He said there was much his agency could learn from the way in which the groups respond .
The CIA is responsible for many of the US air strikes launched in the Pakistani tribal areas , which have been increasing in recent days .
Two US strikes last week hit the neighboring Pakistani Agency of North Waziristan , killing 14 people and 23 people , respectively .
Pakistani Prime Minister Raza Gilani has reportedly condemned the latest air strike .
Both Gilani and President Asif Ali Zardari have pressed for an end to US cross - border raids and air strikes , insisting that they are harming the credibility of Pakistan ’s tenuous coalition government .
It is unclear what if any reaction all this “ tickling ” has provoked from militant groups , but there are plenty of other more visible reactions to examine .
Besides the negative comments from the ruling coalition , Pakistan ’s military has demanded an end to the US attacks , and reportedly opened fire on US helicopters attempting to cross the border earlier this week .
Major opposition figures have called for Pakistan to pull out of America ’s war on terror entirely , and supply lines through Pakistan for NATO troops stationed in Afghanistan were briefly severed .
Civilians living in the tribal area have reacted to the attacks as well with an increasing number of anti-US protests , and an important tribal faction in South Waziristan has threatened to abandon its long - standing peace deal with the Pakistani government if the government does not do something to halt US attacks .
What the CIA Director hopes to learn from terrorist reactions is unclear .
What the United States can learn from the rest of Pakistan ’s reaction to the attacks is not nearly so elusive however .
Neither Pakistan ’s populace nor its polity is responding to the CIA ’s “ tickles ” with much patience , and with US strikes continuing seemingly unabated over these objections , it appears to be only a question of which breaks first : President Zardari ’s promise to “ stand with the United States , ” or his government ’s hold on power .
Bailout Bill Is Losing in the House ; Dow Down 500 points .
The Bailout Bill is being voted down , but the voting is being held open in the hope of changes .
The Dow was down about 250 points before the vote , then dropped to 680 points down , but has rebounded to down about 500 points .
UPDATE ( 2 pm ET ) : The NASDAQ is down a staggering 129 points .

BEIJING --
Twenty years after Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of his 100 - meter Olympic gold medal because of steroid use , and dozens of doping scandals since , Olympics officials are acknowledging the Games may never be completely clean again .
Leading up to competition in Beijing , dozens of athletes tested positive for banned substances or suspiciously violated testing protocols , including several ... ( Full article : 1367 words )

The dismembered body of a 20 - year - old English girl was found in Brazil after her boyfriend killed her and filmed the entire incident with his cell phone .
Britain was shocked to learn of the brutal killing of Cara Marie Burke ( 17 ) , by her own boyfriend Mohammed Santos ( 20 ) .
Having met Mohammed in London , Cara followed him to Brazil after his visa expired and he was forced to leave the UK .
The 20 - year - old man reportedly killed the girl in his apartment .
On his mobile phone , investigators discovered footage of Mohammed stabbing Cara and then decapitating her .
A policeman told Brazilian television : " The telephone was full of photos and videos .
He grinned as he chopped off her limbs .
The photos also include ones like those of the Taliban , in which the decapitated head is replaced atop the body . "
Police discovered Cara 's remains in a bloody suitcase on the edge of a beach .
Her torso was found in a river 60 kilometres away .
A London friend of the girl 's recognised the tattoos on a Brazilian television program that aired in England .
Santos was arrested in a hiding place near his apartment .
He at first admitted to killing Cara , although he later retracted his confession .
" I did not kill her .
When I was arrested , I lied , " Santos told British newspaper ' The Sun ' via telephone .
The police are certain Santos committed and planned the murder , however .
" Shortly before the murder , he turned the music up so that neighbours would not hear Cara 's screams , " said one agent .
" He confessed the crime and seemed proud of the photos and videos .
It 's shocking .
He did not show any remorse . "
A motive for the crime remains unclear .
Investigators believe that Santos wanted to marry the girl in order to obtain a British passport , but that she refused .
Another theory is that Cara may have threatened to turn her boyfriend in for drug dealing .
Drugs were found in the apartment .
Cara 's mother flew to Brazil to bring her daughter 's remains home to Britain .
Thus have I heard .
At one time the Blessed One was living among the Kurus , at Kammasadamma , a market town of the Kuru people .
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu thus : " Monks , " and they replied to him , " Venerable Sir . "
The Blessed One spoke as follows :
This is the only way , monks , for the purification of beings , for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation , for the destruction of suffering and grief , for reaching the right path , for the attainment of Nibbana , namely , the four foundations of mindfulness .
What are the four ?
Herein ( in this teaching ) a monk lives contemplating the body in the body , [ 1 ] ardent , clearly comprehending and mindful , having overcome , in this world , covetousness and grief ; he lives contemplating feelings in feelings , ardent , clearly comprehending and mindful , having overcome , in this world , covetousness and grief ; he lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness , [ 2 ] ardent , clearly comprehending and mindful , having overcome , in this world , covetousness and grief ; he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects , ardent , clearly comprehending and mindful , having overcome , in this world , covetousness and grief .
I. The Contemplation of the Body
1. Mindfulness of Breathing
And how does a monk live contemplating the body in the body ?
Herein , monks , a monk , having gone to the forest , to the foot of a tree or to an empty place , sits down with his legs crossed , keeps his body erect and his mindfulness alert . [ 3 ]
Ever mindful he breathes in , mindful he breathes out .
Breathing in a long breath , he knows , " I am breathing in a long breath " ; breathing out a long breath , he knows , " I am breathing out a long breath " ; breathing in a short breath , he knows , " I am breathing in a short breath " ; breathing out a short breath , he knows , " I am breathing out a short breath . "
" Experiencing the whole ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe in , " thus he trains himself .
" Experiencing the whole ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
" Calming the activity of the ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe in , " thus he trains himself .
" Calming the activity of the ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
Just as a skillful turner or turner 's apprentice , making a long turn , knows , " I am making a long turn , " or making a short turn , knows , " I am making a short turn , " just so the monk , breathing in a long breath , knows , " I am breathing in a long breath " ; breathing out a long breath , he knows , " I am breathing out a long breath " ; breathing in a short breath , he knows , " I am breathing in a short breath " ; breathing out a short breath , he knows , " I am breathing out a short breath . "
" Experiencing the whole ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe in , " thus he trains himself .
" Experiencing the whole ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
" Calming the activity of the ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe in , " thus he trains himself .
" Calming the activity of the ( breath - ) body , I shall breathe out , " thus he trains himself .
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally . [ 4 ]
He lives contemplating origination factors [ 5 ] in the body , or he lives contemplating dissolution factors [ 6 ] in the body , or he lives contemplating origination - and - dissolution factors [ 7 ] in the body .
Or his mindfulness is established with the thought : " The body exists , " [ 8 ] to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness , and he lives detached , [ 9 ] and clings to nothing in the world .
Thus also , monks , a monk lives contemplating the body in the body .
2. The Postures of the Body
And further , monks , a monk knows , when he is going , " I am going " ; he knows , when he is standing , " I am standing " ; he knows , when he is sitting , " I am sitting " ; he knows , when he is lying down , " I am lying down " ; or just as his body is disposed so he knows it .
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally .
He lives contemplating origination factors in the body , or he lives contemplating dissolution factors in the body , or he lives contemplating origination - and - dissolution factors in the body . [ 10 ]
Or his mindfulness is established with the thought : " The body exists , " to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness , and he lives detached , and clings to nothing in the world .
Thus also , monks , a monk lives contemplating the body in the body .
3. Mindfulness with Clear Comprehension
And further , monks , a monk , in going forward and back , applies clear comprehension ; in looking straight on and looking away , he applies clear comprehension ; in bending and in stretching , he applies clear comprehension ; in wearing robes and carrying the bowl , he applies clear comprehension ; in eating , drinking , chewing and savoring , he applies clear comprehension ; in walking , in standing , in sitting , in falling asleep , in waking , in speaking and in keeping silence , he applies clear comprehension .
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body ...
4. The Reflection on the Repulsiveness of the Body
And further , monks , a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity , from the soles up , and from the top of the head - hairs down , thinking thus : " There are in this body hair of the head , hair of the body , nails , teeth , skin , flesh , sinews , bones , marrow , kidney , heart , liver , midriff , spleen , lungs , intestines , mesentery , gorge , feces , bile , phlegm , pus , blood , sweat , fat , tears , grease , saliva , nasal mucus , synovial fluid , urine . "
Just as if there were a double - mouthed provision bag full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy , paddy , green gram , cow - peas , sesamum , and husked rice , and a man with sound eyes , having opened that bag , were to take stock of the contents thus : " This is hill paddy , this is paddy , this is green gram , this is cow - pea , this is sesamum , this is husked rice . "
Just so , monks , a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity , from the soles up , and from the top of the head - hairs down , thinking thus : " There are in this body hair of the head , hair of the body , nails , teeth , skin , flesh , sinews , bones , marrow , kidney , heart , liver , midriff , spleen , lungs , intestines , mesentery , gorge , feces , bile , phlegm , pus , blood , sweat , fat , tears , grease , saliva , nasal mucus , synovial fluid , urine . "
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body ...
5 . The Reflection on the Material Elements
And further , monks , a monk reflects on this very body , however it be placed or disposed , by way of the material elements : " There are in this body the element of earth , the element of water , the element of fire , the element of wind . " [ 11 ]
Just as if , monks , a clever cow - butcher or his apprentice , having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions , should be sitting at the junction of four high roads , in the same way , a monk reflects on this very body , as it is placed or disposed , by way of the material elements : " There are in this body the elements of earth , water , fire , and wind . "
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body ...
6. The Nine Cemetery Contemplations
(1) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body dead one , two , or three days ; swollen , blue and festering , thrown in the charnel ground , he then applies this perception to his own body thus : " Verily , also my own body is of the same nature ; such it will become and will not escape it . "
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally .
He lives contemplating origination - factors in the body , or he lives contemplating dissolution factors in the body , or he lives contemplating origination - and - dissolution - factors in the body .
Or his mindfulness is established with the thought : " The body exists , " to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness , and he lives detached , and clings to nothing in the world .
Thus also , monks , a monk lives contemplating the body in the body .
(2) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground , being eaten by crows , hawks , vultures , dogs , jackals or by different kinds of worms , he then applies this perception to his own body thus : " Verily , also my own body is of the same nature ; such it will become and will not escape it . "
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body ...
(3) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton with some flesh and blood attached to it , held together by the tendons ...
(4) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton blood - besmeared and without flesh , held together by the tendons ...
(5) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton without flesh and blood , held together by the tendons ...
(6) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to disconnected bones , scattered in all directions_here a bone of the hand , there a bone of the foot , a shin bone , a thigh bone , the pelvis , spine and skull ...
(7) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground , reduced to bleached bones of conchlike color ...
(8) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground reduced to bones , more than a year - old , lying in a heap ...
(9) And further , monks , as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground , reduced to bones gone rotten and become dust , he then applies this perception to his own body thus : " Verily , also my own body is of the same nature ; such it will become and will not escape it . "
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally , or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally .
He lives contemplating origination factors in the body , or he lives contemplating dissolution factors in the body , or he lives contemplating origination - and - dissolution factors in the body .
Or his mindfulness is established with the thought : " The body exists , " to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness , and he lives detached , and clings to nothing in the world .
Thus also , monks , a monk lives contemplating the body in the body .
II .
The Contemplation of Feeling
And how , monks , does a monk live contemplating feelings in feelings ?
Herein , monks , a monk when experiencing a pleasant feeling knows , " I experience a pleasant feeling " ; when experiencing a painful feeling , he knows , " I experience a painful feeling " ; when experiencing a neither - pleasant - nor - painful feeling , " he knows , " I experience a neither - pleasant - nor - painful feeling . "
When experiencing a pleasant worldly feeling , he knows , " I experience a pleasant worldly feeling " ; when experiencing a pleasant spiritual feeling , he knows , " I experience a pleasant spiritual feeling " ; when experiencing a painful worldly feeling , he knows , " I experience a painful worldly feeling " ; when experiencing a painful spiritual feeling , he knows , " I experience a painful spiritual feeling " ; when experiencing a neither - pleasant - nor - painful worldly feeling , he knows , " I experience a neither - pleasant - nor - painful worldly feeling " ; when experiencing a neither - pleasant - nor - painful spiritual feeling , he knows , " I experience a neither - pleasant - nor - painful spiritual feeling . "
Thus he lives contemplating feelings in feelings internally , or he lives contemplating feelings in feelings externally , or he lives contemplating feelings in feelings internally and externally .
He lives contemplating origination factors in feelings , or he lives contemplating dissolution factors in feelings , or he lives contemplating origination - and - dissolution factors in feelings . [ 12 ]
Or his mindfulness is established with the thought , " Feeling exists , " to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness , and he lives detached , and clings to nothing in the world .
Thus , monks , a monk lives contemplating feelings in feelings .
III .
The Contemplation of Consciousness
And how , monks , does a monk live contemplating consciousness in consciousness ?
Herein , monks , a monk knows the consciousness with lust , as with lust ; the consciousness without lust , as without lust ; the consciousness with hate , as with hate ; the consciousness without hate , as without hate ; the consciousness with ignorance , as with ignorance ; the consciousness without ignorance , as without ignorance ; the shrunken state of consciousness , as the shrunken state ; [ 13 ] the distracted state of consciousness , as the distracted state ; [ 14 ] the developed state of consciousness as the developed state ; [ 15 ] the undeveloped state of consciousness as the undeveloped state ; [ 16 ] the state of consciousness with some other mental state superior to it , as the state with something mentally higher ; [ 17 ] the state of consciousness with no other mental state superior to it , as the state with nothing mentally higher ; [ 18 ] the concentrated state of consciousness , as the concentrated state ; the unconcentrated state of consciousness , as the unconcentrated state ; the freed state of consciousness , as the freed state ; [ 19 ] and the unfreed state of consciousness as the unfreed state .

Quarantine
Take the thrill , excitement and plot of Crazy Taxi and place Duke Nukem in the driverseat .
This is how I would describe Quarantine .
It ’s fast , action - packed and extremely exhilarating .
Picture a place in the future called Kemo City where the skylight is grey , the buildings are falling down around you …
You ’re unemployed and have no way of making your ends meet .
Life is spitting you in the face every single day .
And just when you think it ca n’t get any worse than this , all hell breaks loose around you .
Cars are suddenly accelerating up the street …
Jumping out of the way just before the first car could smear you over the pavement , you quickly scramble to your feet and run for cover in the nearest building you can find .
Then life throws you a punch …
The cars are armed !
Bullets are flying through the air , and some of them have found their way into the building you are hiding in .
Several other people are screaming out as they are torn apart by the continuous spray of metal , painting the walls red with their blood and intestines .
Throwing yourself down on the floor , you can feel a bullet whizzing through the hair on your neck .
Too close !
Apparently this is not such a good place to stay .
You discover you have a dilemma .
The building is not safe , but where can you go ?
The streets are even more deadly .
Nevertheless … you ca n’t stay here , that ’s for sure !
While the bullets are still raging on all sides , you crawl for the nearest exit … trying to avoid looking at the corpses lying all over the floor and furniture .
Bloody and in shock you reach your destination and arrive in a small back alley .
The alley is protected by large brick - walls …
Finally safe !
No way in hell those bullets can penetrate these walls !
Time to relax and to come up with a plan .
Carefully looking around the corner you can see numerous cars driving around in the streets shooting on everything that moves .
Other pedestrians are killed instantly by cars impaling them on their bumper or shooting them from a distance .
Soon the corpses have build a small river of blood that is slowly making it ’s way into the city sewers .
Gushes of blood are thrown high in the air as vehicles are speeding though the forming puddles on the pavement .
Then suddenly it strikes you …
The cars are not aiming for the people on the streets .
They are trying to shoot each other !
Well … maybe the guy in the yellow cab is trying to kill pedestrians , but the rest are trying to blow up the other cars !
It amazes you why the cars can take all this punishment and still be able to drive on , until one of them slams into a building … ripping off the paint - job on his right side .
ARMOUR !
The cars are armoured !
You realise you would probably be safer as a passenger in one of the vehicles , than being out on the streets .
Hell …
If just one of these guys would drive you home you would gladly give him or her all your money .
And you just bought yourself a new rifle ; maybe it ’s time to take it out from underneath the bed …
It ’s worth a try .
You ’re dead if you just stay here .
Might as well try to hitchhike with one of them …
Quarantine has it all !
Great mindless fun combined with a mindless hack - and - slash plot !
You drive around in the big city , picking up passengers and trying to eliminate the competition .
Usually at the same time .
For the money you get from your passenger you can buy upgrades for your vehicle , be it weapons or armour .
But the game also has a story attached to it :
2022 Kemo City is the jewel of the West and the hovercar capital of the world .
A prosperous city on the East Coast of the United States .
Like any metropolis , Kemo City has a growing crime problem .
In Kemo , however , crime has become so widespread , that law enforcement would be both futile and extremely expensive .
Talks begin about possible solutions .
2026 Kemo City 's crime problem reaches epidemic proportions .
The economy slows to a near halt , while crime and black market trading become the only sources of income for Kemo 's impoverished inhabitants .
2029 Enter Omnicorp .
This Mega Corporation has big plans for Kemo , claiming they can clean up the city and it 's crime problem .
The project is code named Q .
2030 Construction of a 5 meter thick , 10 - meter high wall composed of plasticized concrete and steel begins .
Inhabitants are told that the wall is merely a " defensive measure , " and that passage in and out of Kemo will be freely granted .
2031 The wall around Kemo nears completion .
A few of the lucky inhabitants manage to escape as panic begins to engulf Kemo City .
2032 June 3 , the wall is completed and the only exit has sealed shut .
Project " Quarantine " is now fully functional and Kemo has become a prison city .
Along with isolating the current violent population , Kemo will also serve as a prison for any other violent criminals .
2043 Omnicorp decides to test " Hydergine 344 " , on the current population , a neurodrug reported to eliminate " criminal thoughts " in patients .
Hydergine 344 is introduced into Quarantine 's water supply .
2045 Unknown to the designers of Hydergine 344 , Kemo's water supply has an abnormal high bacterial and viral content which reacts with Hydergine 344 forming a psychoreactive virus .
The virus causes synaptic breakdown , the main symptoms being violent psychopathic tendencies .
About half of the prisoners have become crazed violent killer lunatics intent on killing anyone who is not a crazed violent killer lunatic .
2047 The virus is spreading .
Now enter you , the player , and all the pieces are in place .
Time to make some serious mayhem on the streets of Kemo !
If the game has one flaw it is this :
The controls are different to what we are used to in today ’s racing games , so getting used to the movement in Quarantine can take some time .
But remembering back to when I had the game installed on my 486 , I can promise you that the controls CAN be mastered !
If you are in trouble at any time in the game , you should check the manual , which is included in the archive .
It tells you everything you need .
Good luck !

O'Klondike !
Stand by for a new gold rush as a glittering lode worth £ 450 m is found under a tiny Irish village
It could be enough to trigger a Klondike - style gold rush .
Prospectors claim to have discovered the biggest gold reserve ever found in the British Isles - deep beneath an Irish village .
They said nearly half - a- billion pounds of the precious metal could lie in the rolling County Monaghan countryside and predicted that a mine could open in three years ' time .
Clontibret , Co Monaghan , close to the Irish border , has more than one million ounces of gold
Ireland experienced its first gold rush in 1795 , and ever since there have been efforts to find commercially - viable reserves .
Now soaring world commodity prices have convinced a tiny Dublin - based operation that it can succeed where others have failed .
The claims for the reserve have been made by Conroy Diamonds and Gold , the brainchild of former Irish senator and physiology lecturer Professor Richard Conroy .
A veteran explorer after decades spent searching for oil , gems and
precious metals , he has long been convinced that beneath the village of Clontibret , close to the Northern Irish border , lies a massive amount of gold .
Deposits in the village could be worth as much as £ 450 million
Yesterday his firm unveiled a study by independent mining consultants estimating the total amount at just over a million ounces .
With the price of gold at around £ 450 an ounce - having more than trebled over six years - that would make the reserve worth up to £ 450 million .
But amateur prospectors thinking of recreating the sort of frenzied scenes experienced around Canada 's Klondike river in the 1890s - when 100,000 fortune - seekers descended to pan for gold - can think again .
The most promising sites lie hundreds of feet underground , and Irish law means any flakes found would be property of the government there anyway .
And experts point out that the company 's claims are broad estimates based on drilling and that most of the gold is of low - grade standard .
Gold - digger : A Klondike prospector in the late 1890s
Even Professor Conroy admits that extracting the gold would cost around two - thirds of its total value , but he is optimistic that commercial mining will happen .
' A lot more work needs to be done , but I think we will go ahead , and if we do then it will be on a far bigger scale than any previous gold mine in Ireland or the UK , ' he said .
His company 's claims for the amount of gold beneath Clontibret are based on geological surveys , trench - digging and drilling .
Further exploration is required to see if the professor can attract the multi-million pound funding needed to start mining , however .
In the Klondike , while a few prospered , most prospectors faced hardship , starvation and extreme cold , and thousands died .
The declaration is expected to attract interest from major international players in the gold mining industry and raise hopes in the historically deprived border region
And the lessons from Ireland 's own 18th century gold rush are not hopeful - after reports of finds in streams in County Wicklow in September 1795 , hundreds converged to try their luck .
But while one 22 oz nugget was found , the frenzy quickly petered out .
In north Wales thousands worked in gold mines in Victorian times , and Welsh gold was used to produce - wedding rings for royal brides for decades , but that has dwindled to next - to - nothing .
But there are other signs of a revival - Scotland 's Cononish gold mine could restart extraction as a result of the rise in commodity prices .
And Ireland already has one working gold mine , near Omagh , 30 miles from the spot targeted by Professor Conroy , where millions of pounds are being invested with the aim of producing 30,000 ounces a year .
Geologists mapping the island have said they would be ' very disappointed ' if significant finds of gold were not made .

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
Americans ’ revolving debt , the bulk of which is credit card balances , hit $ 1.0645 trillion1 in April 2019 , according to the Federal Reserve .
Revolving debt clocked in at over $ 1 trillion for the first time since the Great Recession in September 2017 .
What is the average credit card debt ?
Average credit card debt depends on how you measure it .
The average credit card debt is :
$ 1,154 per card that does n’t carry a balance
per card that does n’t carry a balance $ 1,760 per account , U.S. adults with a credit report and Social Security number 3
per account , U.S. adults with a credit report and Social Security number $ 1,901 average balance on store credit cards .
2
average balance on store credit cards .
$ 4,192 per person , U.S. resident adults 4
per person , U.S. resident adults $ 5,554 per cardholder , excluding unused cards and store cards 5
per cardholder , excluding unused cards and store cards $ 5,673 per U.S. adult with a credit card 4
per U.S. adult with a credit card $ 6,506 average balance on credit cards at the end of 2018 , according to Experian .
That is up 2.4 percent , from $ 6,354 at the end of 2017.2
The amount of average credit card debt has been steadily increasing , after dipping in the wake of the Great Recession .
Balances have been creeping up since then at a national level , though some states have seen decreases .
The average credit card debt per borrower also has been rising in recent years to $ 5,554 in the first quarter of 2019 , according to TransUnion statistics .
Transactors versus revolvers
Card issuers divide the world into two groups : “ transactors ” who use their cards for purchases and pay off the balances each month ; and “ revolvers ” who carry balances on their cards , paying interest charges month to month .
To pure transactors , the balances on their cards are n’t really debts at all , since any purchases will be paid off before interest charges are applied .
The percentage of U.S. households revolving credit card debt from month to month has been level at about 37 percent in 2019 , from 38 percent in 2018 , after steadily falling from 41 percent since 2010 , according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling .
Credit card delinquency rates trending up again
Credit card delinquency rates track the percentage of Americans who are late in paying their bills , and as such , often are a harbinger or rising credit card debt .
Recently , credit card delinquencies of 30 days or more , as tracked by the Federal Reserve , have been increasing after falling for years .
Delinquencies ballooned in the wake of the Great Recession , which started at the end of 2017 , then began tapering off .
Credit card delinquency rates , like average card debt , vary .
Some sources consider a credit card account to be delinquent if it is past due by 30 , 60 or 90 days .
How to get out of credit card debt
If you are late paying your credit card bills and struggling in a quicksand of debt , there are ways to erase all of that red ink .
One option : Balance transfer credit cards , with a 0 percent interest introductory period usually for a year or more , can give you breathing room to whittle away at your credit card debt until it ’s gone before the higher interest rate kicks in .
For other ways out of your credit card debt , please see : 8 things you must know about credit card debt .

Make every day count !
2. Think About What You Want to Achieve
You can start by asking yourself one simple question : what is the objective of your event ?
You might want to raise funds or bring awareness to a cause for example .
Or maybe you ’re looking to honor someone .
Whatever the case , every event needs a clear objective to be successful so make sure you know what you want out of your upcoming bash .
3. Leave Breathing Room in Your Budget
Aside from time management , financial strategizing is the biggest skillset you ’ll need .
As you create your budget , go over every detail , no matter how small , and estimate the cost .
Then , refine your budget again and again until it ’s feasible .
Most importantly , you should leave some extra space in your budget for emergencies .
4. Have a Plan B… And a Plan C
Speaking of emergencies , the world of event planning follows Murphy ’s Law , which eloquently states that whatever can go wrong often will .
From poor weather to difficult venues , you ’re sure to face your share of challenges .
But do n’t start stressing out yet .

That way , you ’ll know how much you can spend on a venue and you ’ll have more than enough for the venue ’s mandatory deposit .
Plus , booking today might save you a pretty penny .

A portmanteau of " Troll " and " Character " known to frequent Reddit , other social networking sites and message boards .

As with all human endeavors , there exist hilarious trollacters , and subpar trollacters .
Mr Stevens was already facing a tough re-election battle in November Alaska Senator Ted Stevens has been charged with making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure form .
The Republican lawmaker has been under investigation for his involvement with Veco , an oil company whose executives have confessed to bribing officials .
In Mr Stevens 's indictment , officials alleged that he failed to disclose $ 250,000 worth of work done on his house free of charge by Veco employees .
Mr Stevens , 84 , is the longest - serving Republican in the US Senate .
He has not immediately responded to the indictment .
Federal contract Veco CEO
Bill Allen , who pleaded guilty to bribery charges in May 2007 , has testified that he arranged for employees of his company to assist Mr Stevens with renovations to his house in Girdwood , Alaska .
Stevens knowingly and intentionally sought to conceal and cover up his receipt of things of value
Text of indictment Officials said Mr Stevens also received new vehicles in exchange for older ones worth far less from the energy company , as well as other household goods .
Around the time that the house renovations were taking place , Veco won a $ 170 m ( £ 85 m ) federal contract to provide the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) with polar and Arctic research support , despite having no previous experience in the field , the Anchorage Daily News has reported .
Mr Stevens , as a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee , would have had oversight of the NSF .
" Stevens knew the requirements of the financial disclosure forms and knowingly and intentionally sought to conceal and cover up his receipt of things of value by filing financial disclosure forms that contained false statements and omissions concerning Stevens ' receipt of these things of value , " the indictment said .
Law enforcement officials have also been looking into whether Mr Stevens improperly pushed for changes to fishing rules that would have benefited his son , an Alaska lobbyist .
Mr Stevens 's Senate seat is up for grabs this November , and polls suggested that he was facing a tough re-election battle , even before the indictments were brought against him .

Truly revolutionizing the field really would n’t be so complicated , though .
All someone would have to do is stick a big sensor into a small camera , and then let the euphoria begin .
See , the camera companies would like you to believe that the megapixel count is the most important measure of a camera , but that ’s just not true .
Lens quality , circuitry speed , in - camera processing  lots of things are more important .
The best overall predictor of image quality , though , is the size of the sensor inside .
Big sensors absorb more light , so you get better color and sharper low - light images .
Small sensors pack too many light - absorbing pixels into too little space , so heat builds up , creating digital “ noise ” ( random speckles ) in your photos .
Tenders for building in East Jerusalem had increased 38 - fold , the report said Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank has nearly doubled since last year , the Israeli campaign group Peace Now has said .
In the first five months of 2008 , 433 new homes were started , compared to 240 in the same period last year , it said .
The group said tenders for West Bank construction had increased fivefold .
Settlements are a crucial issue for Palestinians , who fear they will create " facts on the ground " rendering a viable Palestinian state impossible .
Under the US - sponsored peace process initiated in Annapolis last November - and the " roadmap " initiative it is based on - Israel agreed to freeze settlement activity .
Freeze agreed Basing its findings on aerial photographs , site visits and data from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics , Peace Now said 1,000 new buildings , containing some 2,600 homes , were currently under construction in the settlements .
I do n't think settlement activity is helpful ... anything that undermines confidence between the two parties ought to be avoided
Condoleezza Rice
US Secretary of State Israeli settlements on the Palestinian side of the Green Line , which marks the edge of the West Bank , are considered illegal under international law , although Israel disputes this .
The Peace Now report said that , in recent years , the trend had " accelerated " to " eliminate the Green Line " through intensive construction aimed at creating a " territorial connection " reaching into " the heart of the West Bank " .
The group also said the number of tenders for construction projects in East Jerusalem had increased 38 - fold to 1,761 in the period since Annapolis , compared with just 46 in the first 11 months of 2007 .
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state , and are concerned that the growth of Israeli settlements around it is increasingly cutting it off from the West Bank .
The Israeli authorities - like many ordinary Israeli citizens - consider Israeli areas in East Jerusalem to be " neighbourhoods " of Jerusalem , rather than settlements , and therefore not subject to a freeze .
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and subsequently annexed it , though the move has not been recognised by most of the international community , including the US .
Building ' reduced ' US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , speaking during a visit to the region to push forward peace negotiations , said settlement activity was not " helpful " , and said " anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided " .
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who is a favourite to replace scandal - hit Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , said settlement building had been reduced " in a most dramatic way " - although she did not specify the timeframe she was referring to - and was limited to " small activities " .
" Israeli government policy is not to expand settlements , it 's not to build new settlements , it 's not to confiscate land from Palestinians , " she said .
She urged the Palestinians not to use the issue as " an excuse " to avoid talks , but also said she understood their " frustration " .
Mr Olmert faces several corruption investigations and has said he will step down after internal elections in his Kadima party in September .

What are these ?
“ Styx made sticks out of our pines ! ” was the cry that echoed beneath the Hollywood sign once the noisy chain saws and wood chippers were turned off .
A row of stately Aleppo pines planted four decades ago in a historic Mulholland Highway center divider were missing their tops and most of their branches .
Nearby residents quickly determined that the pruning had been ordered by Styx guitarist Tommy Shaw and his wife , Jeanne , to improve the view from their hillside home above the trees .
Anger over the botched trim job increased months later when more than half of the 14 hacked - up trees appeared to be dying .
A flurry of finger - pointing and name - calling erupted on a local Internet blog as neighbors debated who was to blame , whether the cutting was legal and what should happen next .
Now the city has stepped in to referee the dispute .
And in a showdown meeting on the street beneath the withering trees , it was agreed that the Shaws will replace the dying pines with native California sycamores .
Advertisement
Or will they ?
City officials say yes , but the Shaws say that maybe something better will be planted when the pine stumps are dug up -- something that does n’t grow too tall .
“ We ’re looking for a good replacement , ” Jeanne Shaw said .
“ The one thing we care about is when it is finished it looks good .
People from the whole world come up here to look at the Hollywood sign . ”
Shaw said she and her husband were shocked when they saw the results of the pruning .
She said the trees had been topped off several times in the past when they began to obscure the couple ’s panoramic view of the Los Angeles Basin .
The pair figured they were allowed to prune because of a 1973 city tree - trimming permit that they said came with the property they bought a dozen years ago .
Advertisement
But Jeanne
Shaw ’s former tree trimmer retired and she hired a new one for the latest pruning .
“ It was a big disaster .
Our view of it was the worst :
We looked right down at it , ” she said .
Later , a neighbor hired another trimmer for a median - strip pine that the Shaws ’ work crew had overlooked .
“ That tree was stripped .
It was horrifying -- looked like a totem pole .
People thought we did it , but we did n’t , ” she said .
Cara Rule , president of the Hollywoodland Homeowners Assn. , said the woman who ordered the cutting of the last tree will be responsible for replacing it .
Actually , that woman and the Shaws will be required by the city to replace the pines on a two - for - one basis .
The extra trees will be planted on city parkland , Rule said .
Among those meeting on the street was nearby resident Jean Clyde Mason .
She was one of the people who helped plant the pines about 40 years ago to beautify the median , Rule said .

The median divider , built by Italian artisans when the old Hollywoodland subdivision was planned in the 1920s , separates Mulholland ’s elevated westbound traffic from the lower eastbound lane .
The stonework has been designated a Los Angeles cultural landmark .
Rule said the sycamore was the slight winner when the neighborhood was polled to learn residents ’ preference for replacement trees .
“ We ’re going back and forth on whether it should be the native sycamore or a bottle tree , ” which is Australian but is approved as a street tree by the city , she said .
Whatever is planted should be low - maintenance and have roots that will not damage the stone wall and street pavement , Rule said .
Nearby residents will be asked to water the new trees for at least two years .
Neighbor Lee Dembart , who lives a few houses away from the chain - sawed pines , said he favors an evergreen tree .
Sycamores “ look fine in the summer , but they are barren in the winter , which does n’t look good , ” he said .
Advertisement
Dembart also questioned the city ’s agreement to the planting of 36 - inch box trees .
“ The Shaws should be required to replace the trees they destroyed with trees of roughly the same size as the ones that were there . ”
City officials said sycamores grow large but are manageable .
The city currently prunes its street trees every nine years .
Any other trimming is up to residents .
But any future pruning of trees in the Mulholland median divider will require a current permit that is valid for just 30 days , said the city ’s Assistant Chief Forester Ronald Lorenzen , who took part in the meeting with homeowners .
And a complaint over an obscured view wo n’t cut it with L.A. 's Urban Forestry Division .

“ The city does not have a view ordinance , ” Lorenzen said .
“ You can not prune in order to preserve your view . ”

The Pirate Bay is messing with Hollywood again , as they 've put up a new logo which links to pirated copies of the blockbuster movie " The Dark Knight " .
Although Warner did all it can to protect the film from leaking , a Cam version leaked onto BitTorrent sites soon after it premiered .
The Dark Knight has been a huge success in theaters .
In its first weekend , the film grossed a record breaking $ 158.4 million , and it ’s currently on top of IMDB ’s top 250 movies of all time with an average rating of 9.3 .
The Pirate Bay now joins the hype , as the renamed their site into “ The Pirate Bat “ , and put up a new logo that links to a search for “ The Dark Knight ” .
A week ago the police arrested a man who tried to record the movie with a camcorder .
However , they could n’t stop all cammers , and it did n’t take long before a leak got onto various BitTorrent sites .
Rlslog reported last week that a copy of “ The Dark Knight ” , was published by a release group called “ TradingStandards ” .
As usual , reports say that the quality of the leak is pretty poor .
There has since been a Telesync of the movie released , which means if nothing else , the sound will be better .
This is not the first time that The Pirate Bay has rebranded its site to piss off content owners .
When Apple ’s OSX x86 leaked .
in July 2005 , they renamed the site to the Pear Bay , and linked to the leaked torrent .
Back in July 2005
The Pirate Bay put up a logo inspired on Grand Theft Auto for the release of their new website , the Grand Theft Bay .
Apart from being creative with their logo ’s TPB is known for their hilarious responses to copyright owners who request takedowns .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - A combination of aerobic exercise and muscle relaxation may help ease migraine pain , a small study suggests .
Austrian researchers found that when 15 migraine sufferers added an exercise - and - relaxation routine to their usual care , the patients reported an improvement in migraine pain intensity over six weeks .
The findings , reported in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine , add to evidence that exercise may offer some relief from migraine pain .
A recent research review , for instance , concluded that while it seems unlikely that exercise prevents migraine attacks , it may make them less intense when they do arise .
For the current study , Dr. Martin Kopp and colleagues at Innsbrook Medical University randomly assigned 30 female migraine patients to one of two groups .
Half stayed with their usual treatment only , while the other half added a twice - weekly exercise routine -- 45 minutes of aerobic exercise and 15 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation .
After six weeks , women in the exercise group reported a greater improvement in migraine pain intensity than their counterparts in the comparison group .
The exercisers also reported fewer depression symptoms at the end of the study , though overall , their psychological well - being was no different from that of women in the comparison group .
The results leave several important questions , according to Kopp ’s team .
One is whether the exercise , relaxation or both were responsible for the pain improvements .
Another question is why women in exercise / relaxation group reported lesser pain intensity .
It ’s possible , Kopp and his colleagues note , that physical activity , relaxation and other non-drug migraine treatments all foster feelings of self - efficacy , which can help people cope with pain .
More studies with larger groups of patients are needed to understand how non-medication migraine therapies work , and which ones are most effective , they conclude .

Indiana Jones is back - and on form
By Mark Savage
Entertainment reporter , BBC News in Cannes
Indiana Jones , Harrison
Ford 's dashing hero , was infamously named after George Lucas 's pet dog .
And there were rumours that the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - the fourth movie of the film franchise - was the runt of the litter .
Special effects have been largely jettisoned for the film
What the critics thought
So it came as a surprise to many people in Cannes that the film was so entertaining .
Swashes were buckled , rips were roared and sticks were slapped .
The film suffers slightly from the mumbo- jumbo plot device of that titular Crystal Skull , but it was always thus .
Every Indiana Jones movie has what creator and co-writer George Lucas calls a " MacGuffin " - a mystical artefact that the intrepid archaeologist has to track down - be it the holy grail or a sankara stone .
This time , Jones is on the trail of a skull that must be returned to a lost city in the Amazon which is guarded by the undead .
It is a load of old nonsense , of course , but the journey is worth the price of admission .
Visceral quality Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Director Steven Spielberg has largely jettisoned computer generated effects ( much to the chagrin of tech freak Lucas ) with the result that the film 's action sequences have a visceral , physical quality you rarely find in modern - day blockbusters .
An extended sequence with Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett careering through the rainforest , swordfighting astride two army vehicles is a pure adrenalin rush .
Cate Blanchett plays a Russian baddie
As ever , Spielberg brings both humour and visual flair to sequences where other films are happy to provide mere spectacle .
The film kicks off at the height of the Cold War , with Dr Henry Jones Junior captured by Russians .
Like Ford , the character is older , if no wiser .
David Koepp 's script wisely gets his star 's advancing years out of the way early in the movie .
" What are you ?
Like , 80 ? " asks Shia LaBeouf , a Marlon Brando - inspired tearaway motorcycle freak who gets wrapped up in the adventure .
B movie inspirations Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Better realised are the little tips of the fedora to previous Jones adventures , and the B movies that inspired them .
LaBeouf even apes Tarzan at one point - maybe indicating another film franchise Spielberg would like to resurrect ?
For the hardcore Jones fans , this film was never going to live up to expectations .
One cinemagoer leaving the first press screening in Cannes said : " George Lucas , you gotta stop hurting us " .
But this is no Phantom Menace or Godfather III .
The quality control has been maintained , despite the 19 - year wait .
And as Indy himself says , " I dunno kid , it 's just a story . "

The team at Diseño Earle was kind enough to pass along some info and images of their stunning design of The Eco Home — a knockout that ’s aiming to be the first ‘ zero carbon ’ footprint home in Andalucia , or even Southern Spain for that matter !
D Earle designed the home with two objectives in mind : ( 1 ) zero carbon footprint , and ( 2 ) reduce operating costs to almost a self - sufficiency level .
The 6995 sf home , which is absolutely enormous , will be built with 75 % less waste than a traditional design and operate 80 % more efficiently than a similar sized home .
And although the home design was constrained by the narrow , non - flat site , you can tell there was no restraint in creating the ultimate , luxury , green pad .
The Wing - Like Rooftop :
A key environmental aspect of the home is the wing - like roof .
Not only does the roof bury and embed the solar panels out of sight , but it ’s at the right angle to capture and convert the sun ’s rays into energy .
In addition , the design calls for space between the roof and home so that less direct heat is absorbed by the home and air can pass over it , cooling the structure in the process .
The Eco Home has all the green features you would expect in a luxurious green abode , including : rainwater reclamation system , grey water recycling , radiant heating system powered by the solar panels , geothermal energy for back - up cooling and heating , low VOC paints , LED lights , environmentally - sensitive smart glass and abundant natural lighting , and energy and water efficient appliances .
D Earle anticipates that the home will be available for purchase in 2009 .

On Sundays , Nehru Place is closed , with the shops shuttered and the plaza empty except for what appears to be two groups of beggars involved in a turf battle .
While you see a few women slapping each other at the periphery of the plaza , your attention is drawn to the center , where two stick - thin men in rags writhe and flail and pin each other to the ground , oblivious to the police officer in his khaki uniform who , with the patience and deliberation of a man who has beat beggars a hundred times before and will beat them a hundred times after , pulls a nice long stick off a nearby tree and saunters up to the two men and whacks them and whacks them and you decide that maybe it ’s better if you come back to Nehru Place some other day .
On every other day , Nehru Place is Delhi ’s main computer market .
From the flyover , Nehru Place is a collection of concrete eighties skyscrapers clustered around a few central plazas .
In the buildings themselves , a number of very legitimate businesses ( including Microsoft ) have very nice offices where they conduct very legitimate business .
But on the ground level is India ’s IT boom in action : an explosion of brand names , a cacophony of vendors , waves of young men in fashionable shirts , and ancient diesel generators that roar to life every time the power goes down .
The Indian retail economy is structured around clusters , with the best bargains and widest variety to be found in hubs where everyone is selling the same thing .
There ’s a spice market , an auto parts market , and a wedding invitation market , all of which house vendors resigned to papadum - thin margins in a competitive environment defined by shoppers who know that if one guy does n’t offer his absolute lowest price , the guy in the next stall selling the exact same thing will .
Nehru Place is Delhi ’s retail cluster for computers .
Laptop repair specialists next to laptop repair specialists , hardware shops next to hardware shops , and printer cartridge vendors as far as the eye can see .
Everything at Nehru Place seems slightly illegitimate , probably because of the brazenness with which definitively illegitimate business is conducted .
The grinning guy in the yellow shirt waves a printed catalog of pirated software at me , promising Microsoft products for the price of a Big Mac .
I find him indistinguishable from the other vendors , which makes me suspect everything : are the boxes of printer paper from the back of some truck ?
Are the ten - dollar computer speakers built using five - dollar parts ?
Are the HP ink cartridges filled with genuine HP ink , or indeed any ink at all ?
All levels of retail sophistication have a presence at Nehru Place , from mom-and - pop - run closets stuffed with 1990 ’s VGA monitors to gleaming showrooms featuring shiny new brands .
I got my Apple power adapter repaired in a shadowy twelve - by - twelve explosion of wires and motherboards and empty cases ; the guy who actually did the work was perched in a wooden loft , surrounded by tools , his head mere inches from the ceiling .
His effort set me back three dollars , and extended the life of my power adapter exactly one week before it failed for good .
You ca n’t imagine that this place once did n’t exist .
The ancient old man screwdriving logic boards must have learned the trade from his father ; the overstuffed cubicles must contain computers dating back to the Raj .
Nehru Place is the new subsumed by the old : the greatest advances of humankind brought into a market that feels centuries unchanged .
Once upon a time , the lords of the Olympic Games believed that the only true champion was an amateur , a gentleman hobbyist untainted by commerce .
Today they enforce a different ideal .
The winners of the gold medals are supposed to be natural athletes , untainted by technology .
After enough “ scandals , ” the amateur myth eventually died of its own absurdity .
The natural myth is still alive in Beijing , but it ’s becoming so far - fetched  and potentially dangerous  that some scientists and ethicists would like to abandon it , too .
What if we let athletes do whatever they wanted to excel ?
Before you dismiss this notion , consider what we ’re stuck with today .
The system is ostensibly designed to create a level playing field , protect athletes ’ health and set an example for children , but it fails on all counts .
The journal Nature , in an editorial in the current issue , complains that “ antidoping authorities have fostered a sporting culture of suspicion , secrecy and fear ” by relying on unscientifically calibrated tests , like the unreliable test for synthetic testosterone that cost Floyd Landis his 2006 Tour de France victory .
Even if the authorities manage to correct their tests , they can’t possibly keep up with the accelerating advances in biology .
Some athletes are already considering new drugs like Aicar and GW1516 , which made news recently when researchers at the Salk Institute used them to quickly turn couch - potato mice into treadmill champions with new , strong muscles .
“ There ’s a possibility that athletes in this Olympics will be using these drugs , ” said Ronald Evans , the leader of the team at Salk , who has been fending off inquiries from athletes about these drugs .
He has advised the antidoping authorities on how to detect these drugs , but whether they ’ll be able do it competently this Olympics is far from clear .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The allure of rotting mortgage bonds has grown so strong that Wall Street ’s vultures have begun picking over their carcasses -- a signal the credit crisis has entered a crucial stage in its vicious cycle .
In the past two months , these intrepid investors have begun betting billions of dollars on a hunch that mortgage security prices have fallen enough .
It is a risk few have taken for a year or more as the credit crisis rooted in this very market wreaked havoc in financial markets around the world .
In early February , bid lists for bonds backed by middle - quality mortgages found no takers , even at what were then considered fire - sale prices , between 75 cents and 80 cents on the dollar .
But the following month , though , Jeffrey Gundlach , chief investment officer at bond manager Trust Company of the West , began snapping up these same securities at 65 cents on the dollar during what he calls the “ darkest moments for the markets .
“ You had a massive , massive supply - demand imbalance that had developed into a death spiral , ” Gundlach said of the systemic liquidity squeeze in early March .
“ Those securities were really cheap against the fundamentals , so we went in big and started buying . ”
WATCH THE VULTURES
The behavior of Gundlach and those like him is important because this brand of investor -- patient , value scavengers willing to stomach some initial loss in exchange for huge windfalls when a market turns -- frequently signals that a market is forming a bottom when they are active .
In early March , banks and hedge funds stripped of access to credit had to sell mortgage securities to raise cash for margin calls .
That helped send already panicky U.S. markets into a full - fledged credit freeze .
But the Federal Reserve stepped in and announced that it would lend up to $ 200 billion of U.S.
Treasury securities to banks for 28 - day periods in return for debt , including a range of mortgage - backed securities .
That broke a month - long sell - off , sending the mortgage securities rallying strongly .
That set in motion a number of major buyers into the mortgage market .
In recent months , a number of big players have bought battered mortgage securities , including Marathon Asset Management , an $ 11.5 billion hedge fund manager specializing in distressed assets ; Trust Company of the West , with $ 160 billion with assets under management , and Metropolitan West Asset Management , with $ 27 billion in assets , as well as U.K. - based investment boutique , Thames River .
PRIME TIME FOR SUBPRIME BONDS
“ We ’re not finding any problems finding opportunity , ” said Tad Rivelle , chief investment officer at Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los Angeles .
The Alt - A mortgage securities , as well as the ones purchased by Gundlach , which are loans whose quality rests in the vast space between subprime and prime , and subprime mortgage - backed securities “ are as rich an opportunity set as the corporate market was back in 2002 when the bubble burst in telecom , ” Rivelle added .
Bruce Richards , chief executive officer of Marathon Asset Management in New York , told Reuters recently that his firm has purchased more than $ 1 billion par value in residential real estate loans .
Richards also said that he expects Marathon to buy another $ 1 billion or more this year .
Thames River Capital fund manager Ken Kinsey - Quick has moved long into some battered subprime assets after shorting the sector last year .
Kinsey - Quick , who runs around $ 2.3 billion in funds of hedge funds , said he had invested in the securities at the start of April because he thinks they are cheap .
For his part , Rivelle of MetWest will be looking at the Alt - A market , but for now he ’s been a purchaser of the safest part of a subprime bond that typically gets paid off in full , even in foreclosure .
“ Even if there was a substantial and rapid rise in foreclosures and delinquencies in these deals , the rub is the servicer sells the property and generates some amount of cash in the process , ” Rivelle said .
This cash flow gets directed to these ‘ AAA ’ securities , causing them to be repaid at an accelerated rate , he added .
As for those bonds that Gundlach bought at 65 cents on the dollar : “ They looked great at 65 and at 80 , they look kind of fully priced against the fundamentals . ”
WAITING FOR THE FORCED SELLING
Truth be told , risks to investing now rather than later persist .
Downgrades of bonds backed by subprime loans by Moody ’s Investors Service , Standard & Poor ’s and Fitch Ratings continue apace as expectations of falling home prices have led rating companies to boost expectations on delinquencies .
Subprime loan default rates have more than doubled to 25 percent this year , and will climb above 30 percent by December as a worsening job market adds stress to homeowners already faced with unaffordable mortgages , according to Friedman Billings Ramsey Inc. research .
Credit Suisse on Tuesday boosted its forecast of subprime foreclosures over the next two years to 1.39 million from its October estimate of 730,000 .
“ We ’re certainly looking ( at distressed assets ) , though we think that a lot more downgrades are coming that will result in substantial supply from forced sellers , ” said Julian Mann , a manager of mortgage - and other asset - backed bonds at First Pacific Advisors in Los Angeles , California .
Gundlach does n’t doubt that , saying , “ The fundamentals in housing are still terrible .
You better believe there will be downgrades coming . ”
At that point , he ’ll be looking to buy again , he said .

There are two reasons for the “ half ” in the release name :
The first is that I made the requirements of M3 release ( contacts section ) before making the parts applet more powerful
And the second is that the parts applet is now a very neat thingie , but not completed yet .
The new contacts section contains unread mail list , and the list of Kopete contacts you have seen before .
The old code for Kopete integration was lost , so it had to be rewritten .
Since Kopete ’s D - Bus interface still leaves much to be desired , the list in Lancelot is not real time , but is based on polling at certain intervals of time .
Also , there is no way to retrieve whether the contact is online , away or something .
( fortunately there is a way to tell if it is offline )
KMail is much better because it notifies Lancelot when new mail arrives .
It still has some polling , but it works much better than Kopete contacts .
Parts applet
Although you still can not add the search box and application browser to the desktop , Parts applet has been revamped .
Now , you can place it in the panel - it then behaves like the Device Notification applet .
Also , now is possible to add multiple lists to one applet which you can see in the screenshot :
It somewhat resembles the currently developed ( a Summer of Code project ) concept of Plasma ’s Extenders ( the most requested plasma feature TM ) , but , obviously , works only on Lancelot ’s items .
With the release of Extender - enabled Plasma ( KDE 4.2 probably ) , you ’ll see more Lancelot Parts improvements .
Bug squashing
The last , but not the least important part is that a couple of bugs were fixed .
A few crashes related to KRunner integration ( reported by Sergey Sedlovsky ) and a couple of wishlist / behaviour glitches are gone .
I have to thank Josh Rickmar for posting a couple of very pedantic bug reports at BKO .
p.s. If the trunk version looks like it is broken , it is only because of the theme - I ’ll port the theme from 4.1 branch when it is finished .

HBOS is the biggest mortgage lender in the UK Lloyds TSB is to take over HBOS in a £ 12bn deal which will create a banking giant holding close to one - third of the UK 's savings and mortgage market .
The firms ' boards agreed on Wednesday to a deal , to be formally announced later , valuing HBOS at 232 p per share .
The move should calm uncertainty about the strength of Halifax Bank of Scotland after a run on its shares .
HBOS is currently the country 's largest mortgage lender with 20 % of the market .
Lloyds ranks fourth with an 8 % share .
Market fluctuations
Details emerged late on Wednesday after a day during which HBOS shares had fluctuated wildly on the London market , climbing as high as 220 p and falling as low as 88 p .
Shares in the lender eventually closed 19 % lower at 147.10 p , while Lloyds shares ended unchanged at 279.75 p .
How big are these finance firms ?
The development comes as the credit crunch has wreaked havoc on some of the world 's biggest financial institutions in recent days :
The global financial crisis
In pictures
Barclays
Bank is to buy some Lehman Brothers assets after the fourth - largest US investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection , dealing a blow to the fragile global financial system .
The US Treasury stepped in with an $ 85 bn ( £ 48 bn ) rescue package to bail out insurance giant AIG amid fears the group , once the world 's largest insurer , could face collapse .
Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch in a $ 50bn deal - making it the third top US investment bank to fall prey to the sub - prime crisis within six months .

He said this transaction , which will create a giant firm with 22 million customers , was truly exceptional in its scale and would not usually be allowed .
" It 's the kind of the deal that ministers would normally expect the competition watchdogs to block , " he said .
" But on this occasion they are using a national interest clause in competition law to override any objections the watchdogs would have , " he explained .

Ray Boulger , of John Charcol , said the deal would mean less competition and therefore reduced choice for consumers .
Following the takeover , Lloyds chief executive Eric Daniels is expected to take the helm of the enlarged group , with the future of HBOS chief Andy Hornby unclear .
