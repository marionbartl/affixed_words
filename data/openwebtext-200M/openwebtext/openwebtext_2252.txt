Librarians and social workers are among those on strike in Manchester Thousands of council staff are striking over pay in their biggest campaign of industrial unrest for years , forcing schools to close and hitting services .
Employers say 100,000 Unison and Unite members in England , Wales and N Ireland have joined the 48 - hour action - but the unions put the figure at 500,000 .
Unions say the rising cost of food and petrol effectively makes a 2.45 % pay offer a pay cut , and they want 6 % .
Council employers say they have reached the " limit of what is affordable " .
Meanwhile , members of the Public and Commercial Services Union ( PCS ) , who include driving test examiners and coastguard control room staff , are also striking in a separate row over their below - inflation pay offer .
The union estimates up to 5,000 driving tests across the UK may have been cancelled by the end of Wednesday .
Town hall services The Local Government Association ( LGA ) , the organisation representing local councils , said it estimated that about 8 % of the workforce directly affected by the pay dispute was on strike - or just over 100,000 people .

Strikes hit services countrywide
It said a snapshot survey of councils showed north - east and north - west England were suffering the greatest disruption to services .
Unison estimated that a total of about 11,000 schools had been shut , but the LGA said just 452 were completely closed and 159 partially closed .
Services affected across England , Wales and Northern Ireland include :
One in three schools in Wales closed
A third of all households in Southampton will not have their rubbish collected this week
Flights cancelled at Northern Ireland 's council - run City of Derry Airport
Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery closed
Main libraries in Leicester and Leeds city centres closed
Torpoint to Plymouth ferry service cancelled Hundreds of workers have also taken part in protest marches in cities including Brighton , Bristol , Cardiff and Newcastle .
Workers in Scotland are not on strike , but the Scottish secretary of Unison , Matt Smith , said a walkout was planned unless councils agreed to renegotiate their pay offer .
BBC
News employment correspondent Martin Shankleman said the strikes were the biggest challenge yet to the government 's tough line on public sector pay .
' Breadline ' Average basic salaries in councils in England and Wales vary greatly .
Figures from the LGA show a cleaner earns £ 12,732 a year , a refuse collector £ 15,685 , and a planning officer £ 27,561 .
AVERAGE ANNUAL SALARIES
Road sweeper : £ 14,430 Teaching assistant : £ 15,530 Care worker : £ 17,088 Sports coach : £ 21,411 Librarian : £ 22,388 Building control officer : £ 29,840 *LGA figures for England and Wales
Workers in Wales go on strike Picket lines in Northern Ireland
In pictures : Workers on strike Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said more than 250,000 of its members earned less than the basic rate of £ 6 per hour .
" The pounds in local government workers ' pockets are turning to pennies , " he said .
" The cost of everyday essentials like milk , bread , petrol , gas and electricity are going through the roof - our members cannot afford to take another cut in their pay . "
Unite national officer Peter Allenson said its members were " living on the breadline " .
But one council worker in south - east England , who broke the picket line and did not want to be named , said the pay offer was good in the " current economic climate " .
" In local government we are guaranteed a pay rise every year and over the last 10 years , it has varied between 2.5 % and 3 % - people in the private sector do n't get anywhere near that . "
The RPI inflation measure - often used as a benchmark in pay negotiations - is currently 4.6 % .
Service cuts Jan Parkinson , managing director of Local Government Employers ( LGE ) , which was created by the LGA in 2006 , said : " Our greatest asset is our staff but we have simply reached the limit of what is affordable .

John Ransford , LGA deputy chief executive , said councils would have to put up council tax or cut services in order to meet the pay demand .
In the PCS union dispute , more than 1,500 members working for the Driving Standards Agency ( DSA ) across the UK are taking take part in a one - day strike over pay .
And about 2,500 Valuation Office Agency staff in England and Wales are working to rule on Wednesday and Thursday .
On Friday , about 10,000 Home Office staff , including immigration officers , are expected to go on strike , while about 5,500 Land Registry workers in England and Wales only are due to walk out on Friday afternoon .
Coastguard control room staff around the UK are set to strike for 48 hours from Friday .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Police in Australia have charged a man for drink driving in a motorized wheelchair after he was found to be six times over the legal alcohol limit , local media reported on Monday .
Police in the tropical northern Queensland city of Cairns said the man had a blood alcohol reading of 0.31 , and was so drunk he was asleep at the controls of his motorized wheelchair in a turning lane of a major highway .
“ It beggars belief , ” Police Inspector Bob Walters told the Cairns Post newspaper , adding wheelchairs , bicycles , horses and skateboards were all considered to be vehicles under the state ’s road laws .
“ It ’s unlawful , it is unacceptable and people should realize it could lead to a fatality , ” he said .
Other motorists on the four - lane highway had to swerve to avoid the wheelchair , police said .

The first prerelease of NBAda , my library of lock - free algorithms and data structures , is now available .
It includes the the separate packages that were avaialble here previously and additional lock - free data structures and algorithms .
For more information on lock - free and wait - free synchronization , see e.g. the publications page of the research group on Distributed Computing and Systems where I did my Ph.D .
If you are looking for a production quality library of non-blocking data structures and algorithms I highly recommend NOBLE - a library of non-blocking synchronization protocols by Håkan Sundell and Philippas Tsigas .
( What I have here has not reached that level of maturity yet . )
The current set of data structures and algorithms implemented in NBAda
Atomic 1 - writer N - reader registers .
Atomic multi-writer snapshots .
Lock - free software load - linked / store - conditional for multi- word objects .
Lock - Free stacks of dynamic size .
Lock - free FIFO queues of bounded and dynamic size .
Lock - free deques of dynamic size .
Lock - free priority queues of dynamic size .
Lock - free sets of dynamic size .
Lock - free dictionaries of dynamic size .
Lock - free memory reclamation algorithms of various strength : epoch - based reclamation , hazard pointers , pass - the - buck , SLFRC , Beware & Cleanup .
Abstraction layer for the hardware synchronization primitives provided by most multiprocessor systems .
See the NBAda reference manual draft for more information .
Compilers / Platforms
NBAda is written in Ada 95 , but with some specific dependences on GNAT ( e.g. for inline assembler ) and some ( fairly reasonable ) assumptions on how various data types are represented that are not guranteed by the Ada Language Reference Manual but seem to hold on the platforms and compilers I have tried .
The 0.1.0 - pre0 release has been tested on :
Debian GNU / Linux testing , i686 ( 4x Intel Core2 Q9400 ) , GNAT GPL 2008 .
Currently only tested in 32 bit mode .
Tests in 64bit x86_64 mode are forthcomming .
Debian GNU / Linux 3.1 , i686 ( 2x Intel T2500 Centrino Duo ) , GNAT GPL 2007 and 2008 .
Debian GNU / Linux testing , i686 ( 1x AMD Athlon XP ) , GNAT GPL 2008 .
Older versions have been tested on ( among others ) :
Debian GNU / Linux testing / unstable , i686 ( 1x AMD Athlon XP ) , GNAT 3.15 p .
Red Hat Linux , i686 ( 4x Intel Xeon ) , GCC 3.4.4 .
Solaris 9 , SPARCv8 + ( 32 - bit ) and SPARCv9 ( 64 - bit ) ( 64x UltraSPARC III + ) , GNAT GPL 2006 .

EVEN the depths of winter are proving unable to halt the climate change - induced collapse of an Antarctic ice shelf .
When the Wilkins shelf began a runaway disintegration at the end of last summer , scientists thought it unlikely the collapse would continue through the pole 's coldest months .
But satellite images show losses growing in recent days , so that at last sight , only a thin and fractured ice bridge held the bulk of the giant shelf in place .
Its loss would put the rest of the 14,500 - square - kilometre ice shelf at risk , the European Space Agency said .
The British Antarctic Survey 's David Vaughan said the rate of break - up showed scientists were too conservative in the early 1990s when they predicted Wilkins would be lost in 30 years .
" The truth is it 's going more quickly than we guessed , " Dr Vaughan said .
Social media marketing is one of the fastest changing forms of marketing online .
Every time a new site , service , or community is launched , there comes both new opportunity for marketing and the possibility that the site you just spent months participating in will become obsolete .
Social media is not something you can do in your spare time .
You need to commit time and be dedicated to social media and keep up with the constant changes .
Here is a quick look at social media and the recent changes that have taken place .
Social News
The only real new player in the social news space has been Yahoo with their Buzz section .
However , it is not actually new and since you have to be asked to participate in their small pool of beta publishers , it makes it less appealing to most people .
I would encourage you to still head over to http://buzz.yahoo.com from time to time and cast some votes while logged into Yahoo .
Your participation will not only help out some of the few that are in the system , but can also make sure your account has some history of activity when the program launches out of beta .
You never know when your activity will be important with any given social media community .
One piece of really breaking news that happened lately was Reddit turning their site open source and allowing anyone to use the Reddit code and develop new features for the Reddit site and their own .
TechCrunch was the first to utilize the open source with the launch of their “ TechNews ” section .
Additionally , Reddit has gone through a complete redesign , launched a PBS television show called “ YourWeek ” , and added image thumbnail previews to their submissions .
Digg has made quite a few changes as well .
In May they launched their new comments system , followed by a navigational cleanup release that was in preparation for their big “ recommendation engine ” release .
Mixx also makes it into my list with their release of communities , which allow users to create their own custom communities that they can design and administrate .
Although sites like Reddit already have community sections ( Reddit has subreddits ) , Mixx is the first to allow visual customization .
Boudica , a new women ’s social news site launched recently .
Although it is very new and I have not had the chance to play with the site too much , it looks promising and has some really smart minds behind it .
Check it out if you have n’t and register an account .
Social Networking
Ahhh , social networking : the biggest waste of time and the most important thing any social media marketer can do .
You need a good network of friends to help support your social media campaigns , but how do you balance the time spent on all these social networking sites and services ?
It is actually a personal call , but here is a little info on what ’s happening in the social networking space .
Twitter has been around for a while , but only in the last few months did it really explode and become extremely popular .
So popular that social media genius Chris Winfield , @chriswinfield , even used Twitter to write both his recent Search Engine Land article and his presentation at SES Toronto , with great success .
The last few months have been a struggle for Twitter as they have fought hard to keep their servers up and their service available .
I like to refer to them as the “ Vonage ” of networking services , as they just did n’t really prepare for success .
They had to cut back many of the features and limit the API services in order to keep the site up and even functional .
During the downtime , people began immediately looking for alternative networking services and FriendFeed was one that was quickly adopted .
FriendFeed is a service that allows people to add multiple services from across the web into one feed so their friends can follow all their activities , such as Twitter , Flickr , Blogs , Reddit , and many others .
The hype around FriendFeed seemed to last only about a week or two , and was coincidentally only during the time Twitter was down .
When Twitter came back up in regular spurts , the buzz around FriendFeed seemed to fade away .
Some people still enjoy using FriendFeed since they recently added “ rooms ” , a mini friend feed focused on a particular subject or group of people .
Plurk is another interesting social networking site that popped up shortly after Twitters problems started .
Very similar to Twitter , Plurk is a “ social journal for your life ” , in that you submit updates into a timeline for your friends and fans to read and respond to .
Plurk is different than Twitter in that the updates are on a vertical timeline that you can move by clicking and dragging your screen left or right .
It also combines everyone ’s responses under the initial comment , which makes it easier to follow all the conversations .
The only real downside is that there is no API currently available , but an Adobe Air program called Plurkit makes it easier to use .
There seems to be a lot more activity amongst social media marketers on Plurk , so if you are looking to network more with other social media users , then I would advise signing up for Plurk and giving it a whirl .
Social Communities
There is not a whole lot to talk about in regards to social communities .
Outside of Facebook deciding to ban people at random , social communities are pretty much business as usual .
Did I miss something you felt was important about the ever changing social media industry ?

So basically the media is now calling John McCain an outright liar .
This is news .
It ’s also the media actually doing their job ( which Jake , among a handful of others , actually does routinely ) .
In any case , this is bad .
McCain is basically putting out ads ( well , they ’re not even ads , because they ’re not really running them anywhere – they ’re just hoping the media will show them for free , and they do ) – but McCain is running ads that are just flat out lies .
He did it about the BS “ Obama blew off the troops in Afghanistan ” lie , and he ’s been doing it ever since .
And now John McCain is lying about Iran , with the goal of scaring America ’s Jewish community – scaring them with a lie .
This from a man who does n’t even know where Iran is on a map .
John McCain should spend a little less time in his 12 homes , and shopping for $ 500 shoes , and a little more time studying the real threats facing America at home and abroad .
Then again , how long until John McCain reminds us that he spent five years in a POW camp without 12 homes – did we mention that John McCain was a former POW ?
– so he apparently thinks he ’s permitted to lie repeatedly about his opponent in a last ditch effort to divert attention from his upcoming 72nd birthday and his failing memory .
The mystery surrounding Heath Ledger 's death deepened yesterday , when it emerged that the actress Mary - Kate Olsen is refusing to co-operate with investigators trying to establish how the Dark Knight star got hold of the powerful painkillers that caused his accidental fatal overdose .
Olsen has twice told Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) officers that she will only give evidence about Ledger 's death if they grant her immunity from any future prosecution .
Her lawyer , Michael C Miller , is refusing to grant access to his client without a guarantee of immunity that protects her " constitutional rights " .
The actress was a close friend of Ledger , and remains a central figure in the DEA investigation because she was also the first person called by the masseuse who discovered Ledger 's body at his apartment in New York 's SoHo district .
Her initial reaction to his death raised eyebrows .
Instead of telephoning the emergency services , she sent her personal bodyguard to the scene ; he arrived at Ledger 's flat shortly after the first paramedics , at around 3 pm on 22 January .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
DEA officials now say that they need to question Olsen to conclude their investigation into Ledger 's death .
Although her lawyer said in a statement this week that Olsen had " nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Ledger 's home or his body " and did not know where he had obtained them from , he did not elaborate on her reasons for refusing the interview .
" Regarding the government 's investigation , at Ms Olsen 's request , we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding Mr Ledger 's death and the fact that Ms Olsen does not know the source of the drugs Mr. Ledger consumed , " he said .
The revelation has provoked intense speculation about what , if anything , Olsen may be trying to hide .
The actress , who with her twin sister Ashley became famous as a teenage star of the television show Full House , was rumoured to be involved in a relationship with Ledger , 28 .
Shortly before Ledger 's funeral , she released a statement through her publicist , saying : " Heath was a friend .
His death is a tragic loss .
My thoughts are with his family . "
Everyone else connected with Ledger and his death , including his doctors , the masseuse , his housekeepers , and business associates , have voluntarily co-operated with the DEA investigation .
Michelle Williams , who appeared with Ledger in Brokeback Mountain and is the mother of his daughter Matilda , also agreed to be interviewed by officials , according to the New York Post , which revealed details of Olsen 's refusal to co-operate .
" Ms Williams was extremely nice and cooperative , " a DEA source told the newspaper .
Another added : " Everyone has been very eager to help , saying what a great guy Heath Ledger was , everyone except Mary - Kate , who has refused to speak . "
The authorities have now obtained a subpoena that could force 22 - year - old Olsen to appear before a grand jury , should further negotiations with her lawyer fail .
Ledger 's death was caused by an accidental drug overdose , according to the official ruling of New York 's medical examiner .
DEA officials have discovered that all the drugs found in his body were legally obtained from two physicians , with the exception of two painkillers : OxyContin and Vicodin .
They are now " trying to identify the source , " of those painkillers , to determine whether they came from a fake prescription or were illegally obtained by other means " Did they come from a dealer , from a friend ? " an official asked in the Post .
" If he had a bottle from a friend , was it taken by someone else before police responded ?
That is what is trying to be determined . "
New research suggests that traits such as obesity during adolescence that may increase the risk of attacks from peers can result in health and psychological struggles that remain through young adulthood .
The researchers say that this is one of the first studies to explore a possible link between victimization and weight changes for obese adolescents .
The findings by principal investigator Ryan Adams , assistant professor of educational studies at the University of Cincinnati , and William Bukowski , professor of psychology at Concordia University in Montreal , Canada , are published in the current issue of the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry .
They examined peer victimization as a predictor of depression and body mass index in obese and non -obese adolescents .
Adams explains that while peer victimization is comparable to bullying , bullying behavior typically involves one - on - one targeting while peer victimization can also entail victimization that can come from the peer group in general .
Over a four - year period , the study found lower self - esteem and increased depression and body mass index for obese females who felt they were victimized by their peers .
Obese males reported increased depression and lower feelings about physical appearance .
However , negative feelings about their physical appearance earlier in the study were linked to a decrease in body mass index as they got older .
For non -obese males and females , there was no link between peer victimization and increased body mass index , but there were links to negative feelings about physical appearance as they got older .
“ Victimization may not only reinforce the negative self - concepts that a risk factor for victimization , such as obesity , may cause , but a risk factor for victimization , such as obesity , will also make it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized indefinitely .
In other words , the risk factors that strengthen the links in this pathway will also keep the pathway intact because it is also a risk factor for being victimized , ” Adams states in the report .
Using data from Statistics Canada ( Canada ’s national statistical agency ) , the researchers randomly selected Canadian children identified through the National Longitudinal Survey for Children and Youth and gathered self - report data from 1,287 participants over three different time periods , including when the children were 12 - 13 years old , 14 - 15 years old and 16 - 17 years old .
To determine if children were being victimized by peers , they were asked whether children said nasty things to them at school , whether they felt bullied at school , or if they were bullied on the way to or home from school .
To examine feelings about their physical appearance , the children were asked whether they liked the way they looked .
To check body mass index over the three time periods , the children were asked to report their weight and height .
Body Mass Index ( BMI ) was then calculated for males and females , and obesity was determined based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s growth charts .
“ The current study suggests that a risk - factor for being victimized , such as obesity , may play an important role in the long - term effects of victimization by making it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized over the long term , but also that victimization can reinforce the negative self - perceptions that the adolescent already has , ” Adams states in the study .
“ It is important to go beyond using obesity as a predictor of long - term adjustment and examine the processes and experiences of obese individuals that might cause depression or changes in health . ”
The study was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council as well as the Centre for Research and Development ’s Concordia University Research Chair in Psychology .

~ The Measure of The Man~
Anyone who has had an adversarial relationship with John McCain will tell you that there are few with less self - control than the senator from Arizona .
Many have questioned his ability to maintain a clear head in a time of crisis .
For those of us who have seen these sparks of insanity from McCain , we know all too well that what lies beneath is something dark , ominous and certainly not presidential .
John McCain makes reference to his service to our great nation by almost daily reminding us of his five and a half year captivity in the Hanoi Hilton .
Yet few have been able to look beyond McCain , the POW , to examine his political record , as if it were taboo somehow to be critical of a former prisoner of war .
But what about this former prisoner of war and his criticism of the very same people who fought to bring him home from the dark dank cell he likes to remind us about so much ?
–
The POW / MIA Families of those less fortunate than McCain , those who still have yet to be returned to the soil they gave their lives for .
Since his return from Hanoi , McCain has …
~ Ignored pleas of POW / MIA Family Members for his political influence in the overall POW / MIA Issue as well as with their individual cases
~ Verbally abused POW / MIA Family Members in public and private
~ Attempted to negatively influence those who testified before the 1992 Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs
~ Diminished legislation that gave oversight and protection to the families
~ Dismantled protection to any future servicemen that go missing .
Yes , John McCain , the American politician , the man who many think would and should be the primary advocate and activist for the POW / MIA Issue is in fact the Issue ’s primary adversary .
You read correctly , the Issue ’s primary adversary .
John McCain has not provided one positive contribution to these same families that fought along side the first Mrs. McCain for close to six years to bring home all of those who were known to be captured by the Vietnamese .
One would think that McCain would feel almost beholden to these fine American military families who united in one of their darkest hours to keep the POW / MIA Issue in the forefront of the War in Vietnam .
Yet , nothing could be further from the truth .
Cruel Encounters with McCain by POW / MIA Family Members
In the beginning , when McCain ’s political aspirations began to pan out at the national level , many POW / MIA families made the erroneous assumption that John McCain would be a logical ally as they still fought with the Department of Defense for answers on the fate of their loved ones .
Again , nothing could be further from the truth .
There are many very well known encounters between John McCain and POW / MIA family members .
Here we will quickly focus on three of these encounters .
The first is with the family of fellow Air Force pilot David Hrdlicka ’s wife Carol and Jane ( Duke ) Gaylord , mother of missing civilian Charles Duke .
Col .
David Hrdlicka , USAF while in captivity
A recent statement put out in January of 2008 by Mrs. Hrdlicka ’s attorney reads ;
According to Mrs. Carol Hrdlicka , when POW / MIA family members confronted Sen .
John McCain in the halls of Congress after the conclusion of the Committee ’s Report , he shoved the wheelchair of handicapped POW mother Jane Gaylord out of his way knocking it into her niece who was behind the chair attending to her aunt and she was pushed up against a wall .
Subsequently Mrs. Gaylord filed a complaint for assault against the Senator but the matter was squelched by the powers that be .
As Senator McCain attempted to jump on an elevator to make a quick escape from the POW / MIA family members gathered , he shouted at Mrs. Hrdlicka , “ You do n’t know what I ’ve been through ” ( indicating he was a former POW and inferring Mrs. Hrdlicka had no comparable experience or appreciation of his great suffering and sacrifice ) .
As the door to the elevator began to close around the cowering Senator who was making good his get - a- way , Mrs. Hrdlicka raised a large photo of her POW husband Col.
David Hrdlicka and thrust it at the elevator doors to show the Senator that she did indeed share in the suffering of POWs and family members and shouted that she had clear proof her husband David was still alive in captivity .
Unfortunately , Mrs. Hrdlicka ’s cries and pleas for help from government officials bent on closing the chapter on POWs fell on deaf ears and blackened hearts ! “
The 1991 - 92 Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs
Victor J. Apodaca , Jr. , USAF
Another incident and most likely the most disturbing occurred in 1992 while McCain was an outspoken member of the Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs .
The senator from Arizona continually interrupted , argued with and ridiculed testimony given by various governmental employees involved in the POW / MIA Issue as well as family members .
In fact , he brought the sister of a missing Air Force pilot to tears during one of his confrontational rants , Dolores Apodaca Alfond .
Her testimony ( p.379 ) at a hearing of the POW / MIA committee Nov. 11 , 1992 , was revealing .
She pleaded with the committee not to shut down in two months , as scheduled , because so much of its work was unfinished .
Also , she was critical of the committee , and in particular Kerry and McCain , for having “ discredited the overhead satellite symbol pictures , arguing there is no way to be sure that the [ distress ] symbols were made by U.S. POWs . ”
She also criticized them for similarly discounting data from special sensors , shaped like a large spike with an electronic pod and an antenna , that were airdropped to stick in the ground along the Ho Chi Minh trail .
These devices served as motion detectors , picking up passing convoys and other military movements , but they also had rescue capabilities .
Specifically , someone on the ground — a downed airman or a prisoner on a labor detail — could manually enter data into the sensor pods .
Alfond said the data from the sensor spikes , which was regularly gathered by Air Force jets flying overhead , had showed that a person or persons on the ground had manually entered into the sensors — as U.S. pilots had been trained to do — “ no less than 20 authenticator numbers that corresponded exactly to the classified authenticator numbers of 20 U.S. POWs who were lost in Laos . ”
Other than the panel ’s second co-chairman , Sen. Bob Smith , R - N.H. , not a single committee member attended this public hearing .
But McCain , having been advised of Alfond ’s testimony , suddenly rushed into the room to confront her .
His face angry and his voice very loud , he accused her of making “ allegations … that are patently and totally false and deceptive . ”
Making a fist , he shook his index finger at her and said she had insulted an emissary to Vietnam sent by President Bush .
He said she had insulted other MIA families with her remarks .
And then he said , through clenched teeth : “ And I am sick and tired of you insulting mine and other people ’s [ patriotism ] who happen to have different views than yours . ”
One of the many faces of John McCain
Here is the link to the video , just posted on YouTube
By this time , tears were running down Alfond ’s cheeks .
She reached into her handbag for a handkerchief .
She tried to speak : “ The family members have been waiting for years — years !
And now you ’re shutting down . ”
He kept interrupting her .
She tried to say , through tears , that she had issued no insults .
He kept talking over her words .
He said she was accusing him and others of “ some conspiracy without proof , and some cover - up . ”
She said she was merely seeking “ some answers .
That is what I am asking . ”
He ripped into her for using the word “ fiasco . ”
She replied : “ The fiasco was the people that stepped out and said we have written the end , the final chapter to Vietnam . ”
“ No one said that , ” he shouted .
“ No one said what you are saying they said , Ms. Alfond . ”
And then , his face flaming pink , he stalked out of the room , to shouts of disfavor from members of the audience .
As with most of McCain ’s remarks to Alfond , the facts in his closing blast at her were incorrect .
Less than three weeks earlier , on Oct. 23 , 1992 , in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden , President Bush — with John McCain standing beside him — said : “ Today , finally , I am convinced that we can begin writing the last chapter in the Vietnam War . ”
The committee did indeed , as Alfond said they planned to do , shut down two months after the hearing .
It is highly recommend that you take a few moments to follow the link provided below which will take you to the Library of Congress website and the specific record of the hearings from the Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs .
To give you a sampling of McCain ’s treatment of witness who appeared before the Committee , click on the November , 1991 hearings and proceed to page 437 of the record where Mr. Tracy Ursry , the Minority Staff chief investigator for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with regard to legislative inquiries on the POW / MIA Issue , is “ cross - examined ” by McCain .
McCain ’s segment begins on p. 443 .
After reading that portion , you will see that McCain did not sit on the Committee with an open mind but with a methodical agenda , that of giving then President Clinton the necessary cover to re-establish trade with Vietnam at the expense of the full and accurate accounting of our missing servicemen .
Make no qualms about it , a few years later both McCain and Sen.
John Kerry were there by design for the photo op with President Clinton when the official announcement regarding lifting the trade embargo with Vietnam was made public .
Re-establishment of Trade with Vietnam at the expense of our missing men
The Truth Bill
In 1989 , 11 members of the House of Representatives introduced a measure they called “ The Truth Bill . ” A brief and simple document , it said : “ [ The ] head of each department or agency which holds or receives any records and information , including live - sighting reports , which have been correlated or possibly correlated to United States personnel listed as prisoner of war or missing in action from World War II , the Korean conflict and the Vietnam conflict shall make available to the public all such records and information held or received by that department or agency .
In addition , the Department of Defense shall make available to the public with its records and information a complete listing of United States personnel classified as prisoner of war , missing in action , or killed in action ( body not returned ) from World War II , the Korean conflict , and the Vietnam conflict . ”
Bitterly opposed by the Pentagon , “ The Truth Bill ” got nowhere .
It was reintroduced in the next Congress in 1991 — and again disappeared .
Then , suddenly , out of the Senate , birthed by the Arizona senator , a new piece of legislation emerged .
It was called “ The McCain Bill . ”
This measure turned “ The Truth Bill ” on its head .
It created a bureaucratic maze from which only a fraction of the available documents could emerge .
And it became law .
So restrictive were its provisions that one clause actually said the Pentagon did n’t even have to inform the public when it received intelligence that Americans were alive in captivity .
First , it decreed that only three categories of information could be released , i.e. , “ information … that may pertain to the location , treatment , or condition of ” unaccounted - for personnel from the Vietnam War .
( This was later amended in 1995 and 1996 to include the Cold War and the Korean conflict . )
If information is received about anything other than “ location , treatment or condition , ” under this statute , which was enacted in December 199l , it does not get disclosed .
Second , before such information can be released to the public , permission must be granted by the primary next of kin , or PNOK .
In the case of Vietnam , letters were sent by the Department of Defense to the 2,266 PNOK .
More than 600 declined consent ( including 243 who failed to respond , considered under the law to be a “ no ” ) .
Finally , in addition to these hurdles and limitations , the McCain act does not specifically order the declassification of the information .
Further , it provides the Defense Department with other justifications for withholding documents .
One such clause says that if the information “ may compromise the safety of any United States personnel … who remain not accounted for but who may still be alive in captivity , then the Secretary [ of Defense ] may withhold that record or other information from the disclosure otherwise required by this section . ”
Boiled down , the preceding paragraph means that the Defense Department is not obligated to tell the public about prisoners believed alive in captivity and what efforts are being made to rescue them .
It only has to notify the White House and the intelligence committees in the Senate and House .
The committees are forbidden under law from releasing such information .
At the same time , the McCain act is now being used to deny access to other sorts of records .
For instance , part of a recent APBnews.com Freedom of Information
Act request for the records of a mutiny on a merchant marine vessel in the 1970s was rejected by a Defense Department official who cited the McCain act .
Similarly , requests for information about Americans missing in the Korean War and declared dead for the last 45 years have been denied by officials who reference the McCain statute .
The 1995 Missing Service Personnel Act
In the years following the 1992 – 93 Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs , the POW / MIA Community along with family members began working with concerned legislators and crafted legislation to strength their battles with the Department of Defense as they have little if any oversight from anywhere within the government when they were deceived or even outright lied to by POW / MIA agencies .
Wanting to shield future military families from the pain they had suffered for close to three decades they included language that would make the reporting of an MIA more responsive .
McCain , in short ordered weakened this act if not stripped it entirely making it almost worthless .
In the 1995 act , the theater commander , after receiving the MIA report , would have 14 days to report to his Cabinet secretary in Washington .
His report had to “ certify ” that all necessary actions were being taken and all appropriate assets were being used “ to resolve the status of the missing person . ”
This section was stricken from the act in 1996 by McCain and replaced with language that made the Cabinet secretary , not the theater commander , the recipient of the report from the field .
All the certification requirements also were stricken .
‘ Turn commanders into clerks ’
“ This , ” said a McCain memo , “ transfers the bureaucracy involved out of the field to Washington . ”
He argued that the original legislation , if left intact , “ would accomplish nothing but create new jobs for lawyers and turn military commanders into clerks . ”
One final blow in the law was McCain ’s removal of all its enforcement teeth .
The original act provided for criminal penalties for anyone , such as military bureaucrats in Washington , who destroy , cover up or withhold from families any information about a missing man .
McCain erased this part of the law .
He said the penalties would have a chilling effect on the Pentagon ’s ability to recruit personnel for its POW / MIA office .
Well , this writer would have to questions this line of thinking as we , thankfully live in a democracy where we all are innocent until proven guilty .
Therefore , these criminal penalties would have to be proven before any penalties could be enforced .
Just as with anyone accused or suspected with a crime , if you are innocent and have nothing to hide , then there should be no grounds for concern .
Does McCain no have faith in our federal judicial system ?
Cpl. Greg Harris , USMC
This last portion of McCain ’s heartless manipulation of this legislation has some present day ramifications .
Case in point , that of Marine Corporal Greg Harris .
During a recent meeting with the case analyst , the family has reported that they were lied to and deceived by their case analyst in an attempt to cover up a report that confirmed Harris ’ captivity .
The report was kept from the family and reported to them in writing and again during the meeting as being hearsay information .
Yet , the family had obtained the report without the knowledge of the analyst .
The report clearly stated that the information was a firsthand account of Harris ’ capture yet the case analyst , with no fear of repercussions , knowingly lied to the family trying to pass off the contents of the report as hearsay thus belittling its value .
According to family members who were present at this meeting , when the case analyst was confronted with this contradiction between “ firsthand ” and “ hearsay ” reporting , she simply replied , “ Well , it says firsthand , but it does n’t mean firsthand ” .
If McCain had not purposefully taken away the prosecutorial clause in the original Missing Service Personnel Act , the Harris case analyst would have been much less likely to lie to the family knowing the ramifications .
Yet , with no oversight whatsoever , case analysts and any other government official involved with the POW / MIA Issue can do and say what they like with the knowledge that John McCain has covered their six .
Conclusion
If indeed actions do speak louder than words , then the measure of the man that is John Sidney McCain is one of questionable character .
Being a former POW himself , knowing the pain and agony that his own family members and first wife went through during his captivity , how can he , in good conscience , prolong and even in some cases make more excruciating that same pain his loved ones endured ?
Does what has been referenced here give Americans a sigh of relief or cause for grave concern with regard to a potential McCain Presidency ?
Do the families of the four missing American soldiers in Iraq know how John McCain weakened their position and took control of their son ’s fate from those on the ground and transferred it to the political spin doctors in Washington ?
This is the measure of the man and he simply does not measure up .

The War Secrets Sen. John McCain hides by Sydney Schanberg , April 25 , 2000 .
P.S. – Although not POW / MIA related , here is another “ measure of the man ” during a visit to a wounded warrior at Walter Reed .
Major Z is indeed a true American Hero !
Sometimes a number best tells the story .
Especially if the story is simply that the U.S. has dropped a ton of money on contractors in Iraq .
By the end of this year , the U.S. will have spent $ 100 billion on contractors , says the Congressional Budget Office in a report just released this morning ( PDF ) .
Contractor spending accounted for about 20 percent of the war costs through 2007 .
According to the report , as of the beginning of 2008 there were approximately 190,000 contractor personnel in the Iraq theater ( which includes the surrounding countries ) .
That 's about equal to the number of military personnel there .
The report provides a fascinating breakdown of the ratio of contractor to military personnel in past wars .
The records suggest the U.S. has historically relied much less on contractors , from the U.S. Revolutionary War ( 1 to 6 ) , the Civil War ( 1 to 5 ) , World War II ( 1 to 7 ) , to Vietnam ( 1 to 5 ) , and so on .
The historical low point for reliance on contractors , interestingly , was the Gulf War , where the ratio was 1 to 55 .
The report notes that Saudi Arabia " provided significant amounts of products and services " during that conflict .
The conflict in the Balkans was the sole one to have a similar ratio , with both 20,000 soldiers and contractor employees involved .
What the report does not provide is a breakdown of contractor expenditures in past U.S. wars -- which makes one curious to see how the Iraq War would stack up against the cost of U.S. wars .
( Here 's a breakdown in 2008 dollars and as a percentage of GDP . )
The biggest contractor in Iraq , in both people and money terms , is KBR , which has 40,000 workers there .
As of May of this year , KBR had earned some $ 24 billion since the war began .
KBR has been notable for other reasons , of course -- like accusations of political favoritism , ( It was formerly a subsidiary of Halliburton , once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney . ) , overcharging and negligently endangering troops .
The only other contractor to garner as much negative publicity has been Blackwater , due primarily to last year ’s shooting of Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square .
The report calculates that between $ 6 billion and $ 10 billion has been spent in Iraq on private security contractors like Blackwater .
But the contracting bonanza in Iraq has spread far and wide , and the questions raised by the report go beyond waste and abuse ( which we 've been diligently tracking in Scandal Watch ) .
As James Risen writes in today 's New York Times , it becomes a question of what the ramifications are of privatizing what used to be fundamentally governmental activities :
LONDON , United Kingdom ( CNN ) --
Medicine has much to learn from nature .
There are literally millions of medical compounds out there that could cure diseases , help improve treatment and even protect us from some types of bacteria .
Scientists have been tapping into nature 's resources for inspiration on how to treat humans .
Humpback whales , sea cucumbers and Australian red algae are just a few of the species leading the way in modern medicine .
The humpback whale has a design within its heart that could help save the lives of many patients suffering from heart disease .
With a heart that can pump six bath tubs of blood around a circulation system that is 4,500 times as complex as our own , and in only three heartbeats a minute , it has fascinated scientists as to how it manages this feat .
But it was while studying how the whale 's heart is able to do this that Dr Jorge Reynolds ( who placed the first external pacemaker in the body of a priest who survived for an additional 17 years ) discovered nano - sized ' wires ' .
These wires allow electrical signals to stimulate the heartbeats even through masses of non-conductive blubber .
This discovery could be the key to replacing the traditional pacemaker , scientists say .
Instead of having to install a battery - powered pacemaker the whale ' wires ' could be used to stimulate heart beats .
Whale ' wires ' could save the extra bouts of surgery , which are currently needed to replace the batteries in pacemakers .
It does n't end there .
There 's also the added bonus of saving money .
With the worldwide market for pacemakers expected to reach $ 3.7 billion by 2010 , this technology , which costs only a few cents to make , could replace pacemakers and save billions .
At Ohio's Cleveland West Reserve University Jeffrey Capadona has pioneered the creation of a material that could help treat Parkinson 's disease , stroke and spinal chord injuries .
This time the inspiration was the humble sea cucumber , whose skin can change from a rigid to flexible state with ease .
Capadona argues that tiny electrodes implanted into the brain are sometimes used to treat Parkinson 's disease , stroke and spinal chord injuries .
But they can become less effective over time as the body creates scar tissue around the hard implant .
Using this new material , which was based on the skin of sea cucumber , could improve treatment as the material can become less rigid and prolong its effectiveness .
Even red algae have provided inspiration to scientists who now believe they could help control some diseases .
Researchers from the University of New South Wales , Australia , discovered that the red algae found just off the coast was free from biofilms -- a congregation of bacteria that are the cause of 70 percent of all human infections .
Pinpointing the compound that protects the algae from biofilms has led scientists to believe they will be able to control bacteria like cholera without it developing any resistance to the treatment .
Gunter Pauli , head of an organization called Zero Emissions Research & Initiatives ( ZERI ) says we need to rethink the way we use nature in our medical problems .
He told CNN : " The individual examples are great , but then the combination of many of these great technologies from nature makes it possible to imagine a new business model . "
He cites the example of a red seaweed Delicia pulchra , which jams the communications of bacteria , preventing them from settling on its surface .
" How does it do that ?
By making the bacteria deaf .
Now that is a fundamentally new way of looking at bactericides , instead of attempting to kill them , and then have to deal with their mutations , just make certain they cannot hear each other , " he says .
" This is a new look at therapeutics , but goes beyond the cure , it helps you rethink how nature deals with problems . "
However , he is the first to admit that the skeptics to this new model are abundant .
" If you 're Merck or Pfizer and you are making money on antibiotics , you do not even have the in house staff to look at ' jamming communications of bacteria . '
" The shape of this molecule is totally different from the synthetic antibiotics that have been made , and there is zero in house reference material or knowledge .
" No one has this and therefore skepticism is often based on the fundamental novelty and the total lack of in house expertise . "
It would seem that when it comes to medicine , nature has done all the hard work for us .
Chimpanzees , whales and virtually every other species on the planet have been learning how to survive for millions of years .
When chimps are ill they search out trees that have been found to contain a chemical compound that shows promise in treating parasites such as pinworm , hookworm , and giardia in humans .
Nick Nuttall , spokesperson for the UN Environment Program , told CNN : " Many of the world 's great pharmaceuticals have been derived from nature historically including aspirin , penicillin and the anti-breast cancer drug taxol . "
" Nature has solved many of the challenges we face -- renewable energy ( photosynthesis ) or bacterial resistance to man-made antibiotics ( certain kinds of algae ) and has been testing these designs and processes for some four billion years . "
Mummy 's little Lolita :
The 11 - year - old girl whose beauty treatments cost £ 300 a month to make her look like Barbie
She wore her first set of false eyelashes at eight , and her beauty treatments cost £ 300 a month .
A sick abuse of an 11 - year - old ?
' No ' , insists Sasha 's mother , ' I just want her to be famous ...'
At 11 , Sasha Bennington is too young to remember the days when Jordan was just a country and being branded ' fake ' was something to be ashamed of .
But maybe the youngster 's biggest tragedy is that her mother , Jayne , 31 , is in no hurry to paint a picture of how it used to be .
All about the look : Sasha Bennington is just 11 but her mother loves the way she looks
Jayne is talking breezily about how Sasha had her first set of false nails glued on at eight , and now enjoys the sort of rigorous beauty regime - hair extensions , fake tans , pedicures - that was once the preserve of porn stars and Dolly Parton , not school children from Burnley in Lancashire .
Still , times have changed .
' All the kids are at it now , ' insists Jayne .
' We spend about £ 300 a month on beauty treatments for her .
' Sasha 's friends are the same .
All girls their age are .
Of course they are !
Why else would you be able to buy make - up for pre-teens at Boots ?
' Perhaps it 's different in country areas , where they do n't need to grow up so fast .
But , around big cities , girls have got to be more forward and act older than they are .
That 's just the way it is .
' I do n't understand why people get so upset about it .
None of it is permanent .
Tans wash off .
Hair extensions come out .
Why all the fuss ? '
Just over a year ago , there was fuss galore when Jayne entered Sasha ( then ten ) in the junior Miss British Isles competition - Britain 's first adult - style beauty pageant for children .
Former glamour model Jayne and daughter Sasha attend beauty pageants all over the world
It was n't an altogether beautiful experience .
Jayne tells me she was uneasy about the way the contest was run , citing odd rules about how much make - up should be applied to those pre-pubescent faces and including confusing clauses about how contestants could bring make - up artists but should try to look ' natural ' .
At first , I think she is criticising the organisers for encouraging the children to look too adult .
Wrong !
She means the girls - some of whom were still toddling - were n't allowed to look adult enough .
' Because this country does n't have a tradition of this sort of thing , the organisers did n't quite know how to play things .
Looking back , it was all very conservative .
They kept saying they wanted the girls to look natural .
Why ?
Let them slap it on !
What 's the harm ? '
Earlier this year , Jayne was given free rein with the blusher when Sasha became the first British child to dip a scarlet - tipped toe into the American pageant scene .
Jayne was at her side , helping her practise her sashay .
The pair took a documentary team with them , and found what you 'd expect at a U.S. beauty pageant held in a down - market - looking Texan hotel : mums parading their daughters like prize poodles , kids who look disturbingly like mini Celine Dions , and enough lipgloss to pose a drowning risk to the tiniest entrants .
Jayne says : ' Sasha 's friends are the same .
All girls their age are .
Of course they are !
Why else would you be able to buy make - up for pre-teens at Boots ? '
There was a jaw - dropping moment in the film - Sasha , Beauty Queen
At 11 , to be shown on July 14 on BBC3 at 9 pm - when the pageant veteran charged with showing Sasha the ropes demonstrates how to walk like a beauty queen .
She explains how to turn your body round while holding the judges ' eyes , before flipping your head round at the last minute ' like that Exorcist child ' .
Sasha might not have won , but Jayne loved the process , describing it as ' the best fun ever ' .
' It was just fantastic , ' she says .
' What you see in U.S. pageants really is what you get .
It 's weird , but brilliant .
They take it so seriously , which can only be good for someone like Sasha .
' All the mums were up at 6 am so they could get started on hair and make - up .
' And everything is just the best .
No expense is spared .
You have to spend £ 2,000 on a pageant dress over there .
I thought £ 500 for one here was a lot .
The one we bought Sasha was out of this world .
' We went to this huge shop where there was every colour and style you could imagine .
Sasha just ran through all the dresses , she was in her element .
Jayne talks about Sasha 's media ' career ' , believing her daughter is a bona fide celebrity , and is proud to have been instrumental in making that happen
' Back home , we have to buy an adult dress and get it altered to fit , but there they are totally geared up for girls her age .
' The pageant was like a dream .
The girls are encouraged to put on masses of make - up .
It was just like a big theatrical event , like being transported to another world . '
Underpinning the fairy tale , though , was a deep desire to win .
' I fell in love with a pink dress that made her look like a princess , but the people advising us told us you should always match the dress to the eyes - so we went for green .
' That was OK , though .
I was n't there to have the dress I wanted .
I was there so that Sasha could win .
I was amazed at how much there was to learn , but I knew I was in the hands of the experts . '
Jayne and her husband , Martin , spent £ 26,000 on Sasha 's presents , which included a swimming pool
It seems that the main lesson learned was that her darling daughter could look like a plastic Barbie , and be rewarded with a sash to prove it .
' People always said she looked like a Barbie in Miss British Isles , but the girls in Texas truly did , ' enthuses Jayne .
' It was wonderful .
I watched them on the catwalk , with their arms held so precisely , walking slowly and turning just so .
They reminded me of little ballerina dolls . '
What sort of mother wants her daughter to look like a doll ?
The image I have in my head is of Exorcist Barbie , but Jayne sees something else entirely .
Her response to the pageant pictures of Sasha - looking shocking with deep red lips and heavily smoked eyes - probably says more about her than her daughter .
' The pictures are amazing , and Sasha is such a lucky girl to have them .
I 'd love to have those sort of pictures , nice pictures , rather than ones you hide away because you can't bear to look at them . '
It was about the same time she started dabbling in beauty pageants that Jayne declared she wanted her daughter to be the next Jordan .
She still does .
' Of course .
Jordan is her idol and I fully support her in that .
She 's a great role model , this really down - to - earth woman who has made a big success of her life .
She 's a better role model than Britney Spears - any day . '
Jayne always saw the public parading of Sasha as crucial to this goal , so maybe it's not surprising that she pushed the child Stateside , into a world few in Britain understand .
She chatters away about Sasha 's media ' career ' , believing her daughter is a bona fide celebrity , and is proud to have been instrumental in making that happen .
' She 's been on TV with Lorraine Kelly .
What girl of her age can say that ?
'' I 'm really proud that I 've helped her get to this stage by giving her all the opportunities I can .
Going to the States was just the next stage in all of this , and it 's been worthwhile .
' We 've been told she could have a really good future in American pageants , but anything is possible - film , adverts , mainstream modelling .
I want Sasha to have all the options . '
In the forthcoming documentary , Jayne takes Sasha to a major agency , in the hope that she will be signed up .
' People say she looks like Barbie ' - Jayne is so proud of her daughter 's success
The model booker says a vehement ' no ' , horrified by her portfolio , and tells Jayne that clients want their child models to look like children , and that for this sort of career success she would have to stop bleaching Sasha 's hair and encouraging her to wear plastic nails .
Jayne refuses to comply .
It comes as no surprise that Jayne used to be a model herself , and one who worked in the ' glamour ' side of the business .
She started at 23 - which , she explains , was ' far too late ' for real career success - and now believes that earlier is better , in order to maximise profit and notoriety .
One of her own happiest memories is of entering a beauty pageant and winning the coveted sash .
' I was on top of the world .
One day I was an ordinary clerical worker , the next everyone was looking at me .
It was wonderful .
' I 'd never been a particularly pretty child .
I was always short and fat - not like Sasha - but I did OK with the modelling .
Who knows what would have happened if I 'd started earlier ?'
Is it a coincidence that Jayne would have been working as a promotional model when Jordan came along and changed all the rules about how restrictive such a career can be .
She boasts she has met the pneumatic queen of the glamour world , and was even photographed with her .
They were both products of their time .
As she watched Jordan achieve extraordinary mainstream success , Jayne tried to forge her own path in the new world , where everything crass and ostentatious was celebrated rather than shunned .
She set up a limo hire business , and tried to get a foothold in the reality TV world , appearing on Wife Swap .
Then she turned her attentions to Sasha - getting her in front of the cameras became paramount .
When I ask whether this latest pageant business is just about her trying to realise her own thwarted ambitions through her daughter , she is offended - but only because the question assumes her career is over , which she denies .
' I might go back and do some more modelling .
Who knows ?
If something comes up .
I 'm not past it yet . '
She maintains it has always been Sasha who has driven her own ' career ' forward .
Even as a baby she was a ' total poser ' , playing up for the cameras and basking in the attention .
' She 's always wanted to be a model , 100 per cent .
I 'm just helping her do what she wants , like any good parent would .
It 's not pushing her into anything .
I hate it when people say I 'm a pushy parent .
I 'm not .
I just want the best for her . '
Yet can ' the best ' really involve holding her hand as she steps into a terrifyingly sexualised world ?
It is Jayne herself who says that her daughter looks ' about 18 ' when she has full make - up on .
' But , even without make - up , she looks about 13 or 14 , certainly older than her age . '
She thinks this is a good thing and brushes off questions about unwelcome male attention .
' People go on about the paedophile thing , but they 've got that one wrong .
Paedophiles do n't want girls who look 18 .
If anything , it 's the fresh - faced younger ones they want .
' And so what if she poses in a bikini ?
There are plenty of 11 - year - old girls on beaches in bikinis .
If people have a problem with it , I 'd say it is their problem , not mine .
' Besides , as I keep saying , this is what Sasha wants . '
And what Sasha wants , Sasha clearly gets .
Last Christmas , Jayne and her husband , Martin , a builder who works all over the UK and is barely at home , spent £ 26,000 on Sasha 's presents , which included a swimming pool .
Martin seems to exert no influence at all - ' I leave all that to Jayne , ' he says .
Has Jayne ever stopped Sasha doing anything ?
' She wanted to get her belly button pierced and I said no , ' she says .
This is puzzling .
Sasha clearly has her belly button pierced , and is happy to display the evidence in her photo shoots .
What happened ?
She sniggers .
' Maybe I gave in .
Yeah .
I 'm not always that strict with her .
' People can say what they want .
I know there is nothing bad about what I 'm doing .
I 'm just helping my daughter make something of her life .
Any good mum would do the same . '
After our interview , Jayne will be taking Sasha to cheerleading classes , in a further bid to realise that all - American dream .
She makes Sasha practise her cheerleading wherever she goes - even pushing her into the middle of the floor in restaurants .
Why ?
' You have to be out there , being noticed , even at a bus stop .
What if Andrew Lloyd Webber walks past ?'
What will become of the child , who turns just 12 in two weeks ?
We might hope for a reverse teenage rebellion - one in which she dyes her hair mousey brown and professes a desire to study political science at university - but it 's unlikely .
Ask Sasha how she sees herself and she replies : ' Blonde , pretty , dumb - I do n't need brains . '
Her mum laughs her head off at this , proud that the child is so like her .

Russian says troops withdrawing but some will stay in Georgia Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday August 22 , 2008
Print This Email This by Michael Mainville
TBILISI ( AFP ) - Russian forces began to pullout from parts of Georgia on Friday , but a top general said hundreds of soldiers would remain deep inside the country along the main strategic highway .
As the United Nations again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict , Russia finally began to withdraw , in line with a French - brokered plan , from the strongly pro-Western ex-Soviet republic .
Troops poured into Georgia on August 8 , initially to repulse a Georgian assault against Moscow - backed separatists in the South Ossetia region , then moving quickly to occupy areas beyond .
An international outcry has sent Russia 's already chilly relations with the West into crisis .
Twenty Russian military vehicles carrying hundreds of troops headed north from near the Georgian city of Gori toward the separatist region of South Ossetia , an AFP reporter said .
The nine tanks , nine trucks carrying troops and two armoured personnel carriers headed towards the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali .
" The troops are leaving , " Russian Lieutenant Colonel Andrei Bobrun said at the scene .
" By 10:00 pm ( 1800 GMT ) all the Russian troops in the area will have left . "
In the west of the country , troops left a barracks in Poti , a key oil port .
However they were dug in at checkpoints between the towns of Senaki and Zugdidi and also between Poti and Senaki .
Russia says 500 " peacekeepers " are to remain in a buffer zone around South Ossetia .
An unknown number of combat troops also remain inside South Ossetia as well as another Moscow - backed separatist zone , Abkhazia .
In Moscow , the deputy chief of general staff , Anatoly Nogovitsyn , showed journalists a map detailing what he said would be Russian " peacekeepers " " zone of responsibility . "
This includes control of a key highway linking the Georgian capital to the sea .
Military posts are to be established outside Poti and troops will have the right to deploy anywhere on the road between Poti and Senaki , according to the map .
Two other stretches of the same road that come within the " zone of responsibility " flank Gori , just west of Tbilisi , the map showed .
The deployments effectively strip Georgia 's control of the main east - west road , a vital economic artery .
In addition , Novogitsyn said that " if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces with units from the Russian peacekeepers contingent . "
Georgian National Security Council Secretary Alexander Lomaia told AFP that he would meet later with a Russian commander to discuss Russian deployment plans .
" We will listen to him , but of course it 's not Russia that must decide these things unilaterally , " he said , referring to the French - brokered peace plan .
Western capitals have rallied around Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , who is seeking NATO membership for his country of just under five million people .
US President George W. Bush told Saakashvili on Thursday that he wanted a quick end to Russia 's " siege , " the White House said .
" In the phone call , President Bush said that the United States is looking for Russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of Georgia , " said spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
NATO has condemned Russia 's military intervention and in response Russia has frozen cooperation with the western alliance .
There was so far no clarity about when the bulk of combat troops -- believed by analysts to be in the thousands , backed up by tanks and other heavy weapons -- would quit South Ossetia or Abkhazia .
The commander of Russian ground forces in the region , General Vladimir Boldyrev , said Thursday that most troops " will require around 10 days to leave their current positions , " ITAR - TASS reported .
But Georgia appears increasingly unlikely to recover control of its two separatist regions .
Russian officials and generals have made clear that Georgian troops will be barred from Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Prior to the Russian intervention Georgian troops were present in South Ossetia as part of a mixed peackeeping force .
On Thursday , tens of thousands gathered in Sukhumi , capital of Abkhazia , to demand Russian recognition of their independence .
Over 1,000 people attended a similar rally in South Ossetia 's main town and on Friday , the South Ossetia parliament formally asked Russia to recognise its independence , RIA Novosti news agency reported .
Moscow has hinted at giving both recognition in a move that would risk sparking one of the deepest crises between Russia and the West since the Cold War .
Russia 's two houses of parliament are to discuss the issue Monday .
A Dutch news cameraman has been killed in the Georgian city of Gori .
Stan Storimans , who has worked for RTL for 20 years , was killed in a Russian bombardment of the city in central Georgia .
Reporter Jeroen Akkermans was injured in the leg .
News agency AP reports that Gori was bombed overnight by Russian forces who have occupied the nearby Georgian separatist region of South Ossetia .
The bombing hit a media centre that had been set up on the roof of the city ’s television and radio centre , AP says .
In total , five people are thought to have been killed in the attack .
Dutch foreign minister Maxime Verhagen has summoned Russia ’s ambassador in The Hague for an explanation .
‘ My thoughts go to his family , especially his wife and two children , ’ Verhagen said in a statement .
‘ During my recent visit to Afghanistan I had a long conversation with Storimans and know him as a hardworking professional ’.
Verhagen said the Dutch government condemns the ‘ excessive use ’ of violence in Georgia .
‘ There is no military solution to this conflict , only a political one , ’ his statement said .
‘ The Netherlands supports the efforts of the French EU presidency … to enable the withdrawal of Russian and Georgian troops under international supervision and to negotiate a sustainable solution to the conflict . ’
The BBC reports that Russia ordered an end to the military operations against Georgia on Tuesday afternoon .
GORI , Georgia  Russian air attacks over northern Georgia intensified on Saturday morning , striking two apartment buildings in the city of Gori and clogging roads out of the area with fleeing refugees .
Russian authorities said their forces had retaken the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , from Georgian control during the morning hours .
They reported that 15 Russian peacekeepers and 1,500 civilians have been killed in the conflict .
Georgian forces shot down 10 Russian combat planes over the last two days , according to Alexander Lomaya , secretary of the Georgian National Security Council .
Shota Utiashvili , an official at the Georgian Interior Ministry , called the attack on Gori a “ major escalation , ” and said he expected attacks to increase over the course of Saturday .
He said some 16 Russian planes were in the air over Georgian territory at any given time on Saturday , four times the number of sorties seen Friday .
Bacteria , known to be capable of thriving in extremely harsh environments , could have traveled through space on comets .
If even one microbe survived space travel to Earth , it would be enough to start a colony on our planet .

Fans of extraterrestrial life may have been disappointed when internet - fed rumors of Martian life ended in a NASA press conference on soil composition .
But they can take solace in a newly popular theory that suggests the rest of space may teem with microbes .
This once - controversial notion holds that the universe is filled with the ingredients of microbial life , and that earthly life first came from the skies as comet dust or meteorites salted with hardy bacteria .
" Studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space , " said Charles Cockell , a microbiologist at the Open University .
" And as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions , it 's become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another . "
Not long ago , Cockell 's claims would have been greeted with scientific derision .
But as scientists learn more about Earth and space , the theory , which goes by the grandiose name of " galactic panspermia , " seems less far - fetched .
Bacteria , recent discoveries have shown , thrive in Earth 's most extreme locales , from Antarctic ice to the interiors of volcanoes and nuclear reactors , and have even survived in space .
Meanwhile , astronomers seem to find Earth - like planets wherever they train their telescopes ; comets have proven unexpectedly rich in organic material .
Closer to home , water was once widespread on Mars , and still suffuses the atmosphere of Venus .
Perhaps life could evolve in a comet , or survive inside a rock catapulted into orbit by a planetary meteor strike .
The odds might be against it – but life is good at beating the odds .
" One hundred years ago , people wondered if animals could go from one land mass to another , " said Cockell .
But then people discovered that birds migrate for thousands of miles , that storms carry insects across oceans and seeds between continents .
" Panspermia is the next step , " he said .
Galactic panspermia advocates are n't exactly saying that little green men came to Earth and planted the seeds of life here .
At the simplest end of the spectrum is the proposition that earthly life was jump - started by the arrival of its basic components from space .
Meteors have proven rich in amino acids – the building blocks of life – and Earth was pummeled by meteors for the first 200 million years of its existence .
In April , Columbia University chemist Ronald Breslow traced the molecular signatures of earthly amino acids to those of neutron stars .
" Everything that is going on on Earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here .
But they are obviously landing in other places , " he said at the time .
" If there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life , you should be able to get the same process rolling . "
But Earth – and planets in general – might not be the only habitable space locales .
Comets – orbiting collections of ice , dust and rocks – are rich in nitrogen and oxygen , as well as other organic material .
Chandra Wickramasinghe , a Cardiff University astronomer and astrobiology pioneer , suggests that heat from radioactive elements could melt the normally frozen water inside comets , making them a perfect interstellar petri dish .
Microbial life could evolve inside them , or simply be picked up from a passing meteor originally ejected into space from a life - rich planet .
Is that likely ?
In any given comet , perhaps not .
But there are billions of comets in our solar system alone , floating like so many dandelion seeds through the ether , and bacteria have proven freakishly durable .
They 've been recovered from Antarctic ice and revived after 10 million years in deep - freeze .
Some Black Sea strains photosynthesize in near - darkness , while others thrive on nuclear radiation or infrared light .
Bacteria have been found inside volcanoes and in sediments miles beneath the ocean floor .
Bacteria have even survived exposure to the vacuum of space , as well as pressures comparable to those generated by meteor strikes capable of kicking debris out of Earth 's orbit .
And all that 's necessary to establish a new bacteria colony , Wickramasinghe calculated , is for one microbe in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to flourish in its new environs .
Wickramasinghe even concluded that organic material found in comets – most recently by the Stardust spacecraft , which plucked amino acids from the 81P / Wild 2 comet – is biological in origin .
In other words , the comet is not just a good place for life to grow , but actually contains organic material produced by earlier life , Wickramasinghe believes .
That is , of course , hypothetical , and not everyone is convinced .
" Some astrobiologists are evangelists , " said Columbia University biometeorologist Nancy Kiang .
But with further bacteria - in - space experiments planned by NASA and the European Space Agency , and missions ongoing to sample other planets and interstellar bodies , the evangelists are being taken seriously .
" The universe is mostly empty space , but here and there are special places where complex things can happen : clouds of dust , planetary surfaces , comets and asteroids , " said Cornell University astrogeologist Jim Bell .
" They appear scattered throughout most of the observable space we can study with our instruments thus far .
Astronomers have been finding hundreds of planets around other stars .
There are probably lots more places out there where life could exist . "

Whether there really is a measurable benefit from PSA screening for younger men wo n’t be known for a few more years , after data from two major clinical trials studying the test are reported .

How can it be that finding prostate cancer early does n’t help save lives ?
For starters , a large percentage of prostate cancers are n’t deadly .
They are slow growing and unlikely to result in any symptoms before the end of a man ’s natural life expectancy .
By some estimates , as many as 44 percent of the men who are treated for prostate cancer as a result of PSA testing did n’t need to be .
Had they been left alone , they would have died of something else and never known they had cancer .
“ Screening tests do n’t only pick up life - threatening cancers , they pick up tumors that look identical to traditional tumors , but they do n’t have the same biologic behavior , ” said Dr. Barry Kramer , associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health .
“ Some are so slow growing they never would have caused medical problems in the person ’s natural life span . ”
In the case of PSA testing , the Preventive Services Task Force , an expert panel that makes recommendations about preventive care for healthy people , said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against screening of younger men , although they urged doctors to advise men of all the risks and benefits of screening .
But they did conclude that 75 is the age at which the risks clearly begin to outweigh the benefits , and the disease , if detected , would most likely not have a meaningful effect on life expectancy .
Another problem with determining the value of screening is that it results in “ lead time bias . ”
For instance , someone diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 65 may die at 67 and be remembered as a two - year survivor .
If the same man had been diagnosed at 57 through screening and died at the age of 67 , he would be known as a 10 - year survivor .
That sounds a lot better , but the reality is that diagnosis and treatment did n’t prolong his life .
He died at 67 either way .
“ Even a harmful screening test could appear on the surface as a helpful test , ” Dr. Kramer said .
“ Because you measure survival from the date of diagnosis , even if the person dies of the same cause on the same day they would have without screening , it looks like survival was longer . ”
Any screening test can lead to false positives , followed by invasive and risky tests .
Large numbers of people often end up being poked , prodded and tested only to discover they ’re fine .
During happy hour last Friday I spent some time listening to one of my colleagues confess her utter distaste for the Windows Vista Start menu .
“ The system is organized all wrong .
The programs I need are buried and the ones I never use are right at my finger tips .
I waste so much time digging through menus , ” she said .
“ But you can easily rearrange that , ” I replied .
She looked down with a despondent expression on her face .
“ I know , ” she said .
“ Someone else told me that too , but I have n’t taken the time to figure it out . ”
Suddenly it dawned on me , you have to spend a little time now to save a lot of time later .
It ’s the notion of giving some to get some .
This ties into the idea of working smarter not harder .
Countless hours can be saved over the long - term by spending just a few productive minutes now .
Here are a few ideas to help kick - start the practice of spending minutes to save hours :
Learn to Search Google Effectively – If Google is the prime portal to the information superhighway , Google ’s advanced search operators are the most efficient vehicles on the road .
Once you learn them , you will find what you seek in half the time … every time .
Organize Your Space – How fast can you access something in an organized space ?
Instantaneously !
Spend a little time organizing your space and you ’ll forever spend less time searching and more time doing .
Research and Use the Right Tools – Possessing the right tools can easily shrink a mountainous task into a molehill .
The time you take to find the right tool will be repaid 1000 times over .
Uncover the Shortcuts – Keyboard shortcuts , driving a less congested route , hitting 2 birds with one stone , etc .
There are simple shortcuts for almost everything you do .
It ’s worth your while to uncover them .
Once you do , you can shave a few minutes off your tasks on a daily basis .
Compound this over a year and you ’ll saving hours of precious life .
Automate Tasks – Spend the time necessary to automate everything you can .
Create checklists to help you remember things .
Design templates to speed the process of recreation .
Utilize modern technologies to automate bill payments , data backups , to - do list reminders , etc. Listen Carefully the First Time –
The better listener you are , the more you will learn .
The more you learn now , the fewer questions you will have later … and the less time you will spend searching for answers .
Take Useful Notes – … and store them in a trusted place so you always know where to look .
Not doing so will lead to extensive wastes of both time and opportunity .
Handle Simple Tasks Immediately – Constantly thinking about doing something simple but avoiding the actual act of doing it takes more time than actually doing it .
Follow the GTD 2 - Minute Rule .
If it takes less than two minutes , do it now .
Learn to Type Efficiently –
If you use a computer on a regular basis , learning to type efficiently will save you days ( if not weeks ) worth of time over the course of your lifetime .
Adhere to Basic Safety Precautions –
If you do n’t spend the time to put on a helmet , how much time will you waste in an injured state when you bang your head ?
If you do n’t spend the time to backup your data and the hard drive crashes , how much time will you waste trying to recover files ?
You get the idea .
Reflect on Your Goals and Direction – Not doing so is committing to wasteful misdirection .
The process of self reflection helps maintain a conscious awareness of where you ’ve been and where you intend to go , giving you the ability to realign your trajectory when necessary .
Teach Someone How to Help
You – Teach your dependants how to fish so you no longer have to fish for them .
Presort Before Placing – Presort the lights and darks before tossing them in the hamper .
Presort those files before stacking them on the desk .
That which takes a couple seconds now will take several minutes later on .
Make Reservations –
When a 1 minute phone call can save 1 hour of waiting .
Let Your Mouse Do The Walking – Shop online .
Rent movies online .
Pay bills online … etc .
It ’s sooo much faster .
In the custody settlement , the singer agrees to increase the monthly payments from $ 15,000
Britney Spears ‘s custody settlement with her ex Kevin Federline , in which he retained sole custody of the couple ’s two sons , came at a price .
A source close to the singer confirms she ’ll now pay Federline $ 20,000 a month in child support , an increase from $ 15,000 .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Federline ’s lawyer , Mark Vincent Kaplan , also demanded and received $ 250,000 for his work on the case , the source adds .
“ All Britney was seeking was a formalization of her increased visitation that she ’s obtained over recent weeks , and the additional overnight , ” the source said .
“ She won both of those requests . ”
Spears , who is represented by lawyer Laura Wasser , currently sees her sons twice a week with one overnight .
The source adds that she will get an additional overnight by year ’s end , barring any setbacks .

We expected that the first practical application for plasma laser technology would be a death ray gun , but Hanyoung Lee had another thought .
He designed what 's called the Virtual Wall using plasma lasers to make it safer for legal jay walkers to cross the street .
The system displays a giant virtual wall right where the crosswalk begins and displays images of people walking to get the point across to pointy - headed drivers .
We 're all for getting drivers to stop before the white line at a red light so their front bumpers do n't bogart the walking path , but we imagine municipalities might have a hard time stomaching the cost of four plasma laser walls at every intersection .
We 'd like to see a working Virtual Wall do its thing , as all we 've got are these renderings below that show what the wall would look like if it were real .
We 've seen renderings of death ray guns too , however , and still do n't have one in our hands .
Stocks are tumbling as oil once again shoots back above $ 115 .
But it 's still not expensive enough for Venezuela .
According to energy minister Rafael Ramirez , Venezuela will propose an oil production cut at the next OPEC meeting in September if prices fall further ( Reuters ) :
" What we can not permit is a collapse in the price of oil . "
He said OPEC should avoid allowing undue increases in oil inventory levels .
He said these levels are currently " good . "
Ramirez laid the blame for record oil prices on speculators .
Venezuela 's assumption is that once the fundamentals of supply and demand take hold once again ( whenever that is ) , the price of oil will return to more reasonable levels .
Therefore , they believe increases in supply could send oil prices unnecessarily low .
We 're not sure the other OPEC countries agree with Venezuela .
Iran has already tried to talk down oil prices and Saudi Arabia has made promises about increased oil production they may not even be able to keep .
The higher oil goes today , the sooner there will be alternatives .
Unlike Venezuela , most other oil - rich nations are willing to sacrifice a little cash now for the solace their customers will still want oil later .

Sir Cliff Richard 's first hits are due to go out of copyright on 1 January 2009 Ageing rock stars and session musicians will keep receiving royalties for their old recordings for the rest of their lives under a European Union plan .
Performers currently lose the rights to their recordings after 50 years .
Veteran artists like Sir Cliff Richard and Roger Daltrey are among those who have campaigned for it to be extended .
The EU has now announced a scheme for copyright on recordings to last for 95 years .
EU governments and the European Parliament still need to give approval .
Under the current regime , the first rock ' n ' roll recordings will go out of copyright in the coming years .
That means performers , producers and record labels would no longer get paid for sales or airplay , and the songs could be released cheaply by any record label .
A 95 - year term would bridge the income gap that performers face when they turn 70 , just as their early performances recorded in their 20s would lose protection
Charlie McCreevy
EC Single Market Commissioner Sir Cliff 's first hits will go out of copyright on 1 January next year , while The Beatles ' catalogue will start to enter the public domain in 2013 .
Sir Paul McCartney and U2 have also spoken out in favour of extending the copyright .
But the EU plan is potentially more important for the thousands of lesser - known band members , session musicians and producers who may be in greater need of an income during their retirement .
The proposals were unveiled by European Commission Single Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy .
" A 95 - year term would bridge the income gap that performers face when they turn 70 , just as their early performances recorded in their 20s would lose protection , " his scheme said .
' Invisible ' musicians Former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey , now chief executive of British Music Rights , welcomed the move .
He said : " I am especially pleased that the announcement focuses on the ' invisible ' members of our industry - the musicians , engineers and session players whose names are hidden away in the liner notes and credits .
" It is they , and not just ' featured ' artists and record labels , who could derive real benefits from this move - and at a time in life when their earning power would be severely diminished . "
The BPI , which respresents British record labels , said the change would " ensure that our performers and labels are no longer treated as the second class citizens in the copyright world " .
' Higher prices '
But the UK government , which rejected its own extension to the copyright term last year , said it was " not convinced " that there was an economic case for the move .
When it looked into the matter , the government said most artists would not benefit from an extension because of their record contracts .
Most musicians had contracts requiring them to pass royalties back to their record labels , the government said .
It also concluded that an extension would lead to increased costs for consumers , who would be forced to pay for royalties for longer .
And Anthony Baldwin , a musician and sound engineer who restores old recordings , told The Times : " If the legislation gets through , you can say goodbye to independent European vintage CD reissues . "
Separate royalties are paid for songwriting .
Those payments will continue for 70 years after the death of the writer .

I fully switched to linux about 2.5 years ago .
I loved reading through everyone else 's reasons for trying and using linux .
Many of the reasons were mine was well .
As we all obediently clicked through the versions of Windows , I saw that it was taking more control from me , the user , and giving it to Microsoft .
They decided how things must be set up , whether my music was legal or not ( I legally record spoken information , but since it 's seen by the computer as " music " MS deems it questionable ) , it had to phone home every day to decide whether my software was up to its standards , it kept getting more and more complicated , and I was just done with that .
I had been looking for a way out of Windows since W2 K , but did n't know how to get started with linux until 6 years ago , I found my local user group , and they pointed me in the right direction .
I loaded Ubuntu on an old machine , and fiddled with it until I knew what software I needed and how to get around .
I took a long time to do this because I used my computer for so many things , and I needed to make sure it would suit all my needs .
Three or so years in , I reformatted my main computer to linux and I 've never looked back .
I contentedly use OpenOffice , Audacity , Pidgin , irssi , FireFox , Blue Fish , Gimp and others .
It 's true that the fact that it 's free and that you can take one disk and load it on every computer far and wide , is a big draw .
The free part is good ( I do n't have much $ $ to throw around ) , but I especially like the lack of restrictions , and that my operating system is mine .
Once you get the system up and running , it 's stable as a rock , and while I have had a few problems on one or two computers along the way , I know I 've also had issues with my Windows computers , so it was no deterrent .
In fact , I have found linux much easier to grasp and if there is a problem , you can get at it to fix it , and be on your merry way .
My name is Priswell , and I 'm a linux user .

Advertisement Despite the chaos and carnage of three nights of live punk at the Institute of Contemporary Arts punters would still be hard pressed to miss the three pogo - dancing robots in their midst .
The machines , which have been created by a collaboration of artists and scientists , have been designed to fall in love with punk music and show their appreciation through dance .
The robot punks take pride of place in the mosh pit at a series of gigs called Neurotic .
Standing 2 m tall , padded and dressed in leather , they are no ordinary concert goers .
Professor McOwan , from Queen Mary University , and one of the creators of the robots , said they were built because of his fascination with human - computer interaction .
" I 'm a computational neuroscientist and my interest is in trying to build mathematical and computational models for the way the brain processes sensory information , such as visual or auditory information .
A robot " dances " in front of punk band the Fumadores " I work out how human beings do that , build a computer model to test how it works and then hopefully , if it works well , you understand more about humans but also you have software for use in robotic systems .
" The idea is to look at the information processing strategies that have taken billions of years to develop through evolution , steal them and put them into computers . "
The robots use neural networks , a collection of computer processors that function in a similar way to a simple animal brain .
Neural networks are popular in the field of artificial intelligence because of their ability to recognise patterns from the sensory input of external sources , much like a human brain .
The robots have been trained to like punk , explained Professor McOwan .
Appreciate patterns
" The robot brain , for want of a better word , was played lots of punk , reggae , disco and classical and over a period of time the robot has learned to recognise and appreciate the patterns of sound in punk music , " he said .
The neural network understands the music in a similar way to a human brain , breaking down the sound into a series of frequency bands .
Programmer Jons Jones Morris said : " Breaking down the sound produces a map of the audio over time which is turned into an image .
That image is submitted to one of the neural networks . "
Punk fans can dance alongside the pogoing robots .
Using this " adaptive resonance theory " , the neural networks begin to build up a history of different patterns relating to different sounds .
The teaching then shifts to supervised learning in which a more advanced neural network is used to statistically analyse the occurrence of these patterns in a song , said Mr Jones Morris .
" We tell it when the pattern is punk and soul , or whatever , so it has examples and counter examples .
" When the robot is listening to live music it is basically pattern matching against the statistics from other types of music it has listened to previously . "
During a gig , the robot is reacting in real time to music it has never encountered before .
Flicks between
The robots can decide whether a song is punk or not within 30 seconds .
" It depends on the form at the beginning of the song .
It flicks between thinking a song is punk and not punk at the start and then becomes convinced , " said Mr Jones Morris .
Professor McOwan added : " If you look at the audio cortex in the brain and the cochlea in the ear you find that 's exactly how the human system does it .
The robots move up and down together .
The robot reacts to the level of " punk " in the song .
The more punk it believes the song is , the more it pogos in a " happy and frenzied way " , said Professor McOwan .
During the gigs - which run form 3 - 5 July - the hope is that the audience will interact with the robots .
Professor McOwan said : " Is that level of performance within the robot something that human beings empathise with ?
" Do they think the robots like punk ?
It 's almost like a Turing test - producing something with makes people believe there is an intelligence , making them empathise with the robot . "
It is also a real - world test of the technology , he said .
" It 's real - time signal processing and robotic control in a fairly hostile environment - in a mosh pit with lots of sweaty punks .
" Also , hopefully people will become interested in the science behind it . "
Neurotic is at the ICA from 3 - 5 July and is funded by the Wellcome Trust .

Tremor - free Olympics expected
China Daily
Updated : 2008-07-21 07:56
The national seismic monitoring network has not detected any sign a strong earthquake would hit Beijing during the Olympics next month , a senior expert with the China Earthquake Networks Center said in the capital on Saturday .
The 107 quake - monitoring stations of the network cover a 150,000 - sq - km area around the capital and are said to be the most extensive such network in the country .
It can detect a temblor as light as magnitude 1.0 and report it within five to 10 minutes , Zhang Xiaodong , deputy director of the networks center , said at a press conference .
" Our experts are working round the clock to monitor the geophysical changes and analyze the data we collect , " he said .
The China Earthquake Administration ( CEA ) also began working with the Beijing city government and the organizers of the Beijing Olympic Games to develop contingency plans to deal with earthquakes of different magnitude three years ago , CEA deputy director Yin Chaomin said .
The plans include quake reporting , magnitude monitoring and information dissemination , Yin said .
" We even built several new monitoring stations near Beijing and six Olympic co-host cities . "
Officials also rehearsed quake drills for the Games , while cities have built emergency shelters to ready for possible disasters , Yin added .
Beijing has built 31 such shelters , which can hold a total of 3 million people , he said .
Quake rescue teams of the CEA and Beijing authorities are also on standby , he said .
" The Olympic stadiums and many buildings in Beijing are able to withstand earthquakes of magnitude 8.0 .
There will not be any big problems . "
The country has set up more than 1,200 quake - monitoring stations and 15,000 monitoring sites , officials have said .
In its eastern region and provincial capital cities , earthquakes as light as magnitude 1.5 can be detected and reported within 10 to 15 minutes .
However , Yin admitted the quake - monitoring system cannot provide for all conditions .
" We did not detect signs of abnormality before the 8.0 - magnitude quake struck Sichuan province on May 12 .
We are deeply sorry for not being able to forecast it . "

I ’ve been looking into violent deaths lately .
And now I understand a few things .
Mostly , I understand what we do n’t know about violent death in the United States .
For instance , consider one of the most horrific kinds of violent death — mass shootings in public places like malls and offices and schools .
How often does this happen somewhere in the United States ?
Nobody knows .
What kind of people wield the guns involved ?
How old are they ?
Do they have a criminal record or a history of mental illness ?
Nobody knows .
How many murders involve assault weapons ?
How many are drug - related ?
Nobody knows .
How many teens are drunk or stoned when they commit suicide ?
How often does a child die from abuse somewhere in this country ?
How many women who die from domestic violence have a restraining order against their attacker ?
Nobody knows .
I thought the answers to these questions would be easy to find .
How wrong I was .
What I found was some information from a few states , but nothing systematic .
Nothing that reports national - level data on violent death , which includes murder , suicide , domestic violence , and child abuse .
And I found a system that could provide this information .
The National Violent Death Reporting System gathers data for every violent death from a variety of sources .
By getting records from the police , medical examiners , crime labs , hospitals , and public health officials , the NVDRS can paint a picture of how and why people die the kind of deaths that spawn nightmares and media storms .
The NVDRS currently operates in 17 states .
That ’s all the funding there is .
Housed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , it depends on federal funding .
It ’s relatively inexpensive , too .
Another $ 4 million for FY2009 would expand participation to more than half the states , so email your Congressional delegates .
Why should you bother ?
This is n’t just about having numbers .
It ’s about keeping people from becoming victims .
Trying to prevent violent deaths without data about the how and why of it is like trying to treat cancer based on a biopsy report that ’s missing most of the words .
You might guess right , but the odds are against you .
And if you ’re wrong , somebody dies .
Ron Paul Affirms : Iran Attack Plan Has ‘ Green Light ’ By Steve Watson Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) has warned millions of radio listeners that the United States is heading into an illegal attack on Iran , stating his amazement at members of Congress who have openly voiced support for a criminal nuclear strike .
“ If we do ( attack ) it is going to be a disaster , ” the congressman told the Alex Jones radio show .
“ I was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack , but are we going to attack before or after the election ? ”
Paul continued .
Paul recently voiced concern over House Congressional Resolution 362 which he has dubbed a “ virtual Iran war resolution . ”
“ If that comes up it is demanding that the president [ put in place ] an absolute blockade of the entire country of Iran , and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with Iran , ” Paul told listeners .
Experts have predicted gas will rise to $ 6 per gallon if the resolution passes .
Paul believes that may happen anyway , just by anticipation .
“ The frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table , even nuclear first strike , ” Paul said .
Paul believes from talking with his contacts in and around Congress that a strike on Iran has already been green - lighted .
“ That is my sense because the Democratic leaders in the House are proposing no resistance whatsoever , Paul said .
“ We saw this when a supplemental bill came up and the president asked for $ 107 billion for the war , the Democrat leadership gave them $ 162 billion .
“ It is still totally bewildering to me when I see men and women in the Congress that I know and like doing this just to get along .
Most of them will say ‘ I agree with you on all you say but the Iranians are bad people and they might attack us some day .
. . .
I hear members of Congress saying if we could only nuke them . ’”
Ron Paul also spoke in detail about his new Campaign For Liberty Group and his views on the upcoming election .

( Issue # 33 , August 18 , 2008 )
By GottaLaff
The videos ( long , at 20 minutes and 14 minutes respectively ) , originally posted on August 14 by the Anchorage Daily News , are raw footage of Quaylin 's press conference .
Alaska 's former commissioner of public safety says Gov. Sarah Palin , John McCain 's pick to be vice president , personally talked him on two occasions about a state trooper who was locked in a bitter custody battle with the governor 's sister .
We posted a video about this here
In a phone conversation Friday night , Walt Monegan , who was Alaska 's top cop until Palin fired him July 11 , told the Daily News that the governor also had e-mailed him two or three times about her ex-brother - in - law , Trooper Mike Wooten , though the e-mails did n't mention Wooten by name .
Monegan claims his refusal to fire Wooten was a major reason that Palin dismissed him .
Wooten had been suspended for five days previously , based largely on complaints that Palin 's family had initiated before Palin was governor .
The events surrounding Monegan 's dismissal currently are under investigation by the state 's legislature .
Palin has acknowledged that a member of her staff phoned a trooper lieutenant in an effort that could have been perceived as pressure to have Wooten dismissed and that her husband and other officials also had contacted Monegan about Wooten .
She has insisted , however , that she did not authorize the phone call and was not aware of it .
She has said she does n't believe any of the contacts amounted to pressuring Monegan .
She suspended one of her aides after the recording of his discussions of Wooten with the trooper lieutenant became public .
Translation : After he was caught .
“ The Governor did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide , " the McCain / Palin campaign said in a statement , blaming the issue on the campaign of the Democratic nominee , U.S. Sen.
Barack Obama .
" It ’s outrageous that the Obama campaign is trying to attack her over a family issue .
As a reformer and a leader on ethics reform , she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter , because she was never directly involved . "
But the trooper controversy has been swirling around Palin for weeks , long before Palin was launched Friday into the bright lights of the national campaign .
Monegan , however , said that Palin raised the subject of Wooten with him herself on two occasions after becoming governor -- once on the phone soon after she took office and once in person not long after that .
Monegan also said that the governor 's husband , Todd , talked to him several times about Wooten and that three top officials in her administration contacted him .
Monegan also disclosed for the first time that Palin sent him two or three e-mails that referenced her ex-brother - in - law and his status with troopers .
Monegan declined to provide the e-mails because of the ongoing investigation .
Calls , e-mails , face - to - face = a big fat problem .
Monegan said he believes his firing was directly related to the fact Wooten stayed on the job .
" It was a significant factor if not the factor , " Monegan said .
No one from the McCain campaign ever contacted him to vet Palin as a candidate , Monegan said .
Who did they contact ?
" We do n't talk about the vetting process , " said Maria Comella , Palin 's vice president campaign press secretary .
Of course not .
Transparency is out of the question .
Palin 's replacement for Monegan , Chuck Kopp , was forced to resign just two weeks after he was appointed because of a sexual harassment complaint that had been filed against him when he was the chief of police in Kenai .
Palin , in a news conference announcing Kopp 's resignation July 24 , said she was unaware that the Kenai city council had reprimanded Kopp as a result of the complaint and would not discuss how her staff had vetted Kopp before naming him to replace Monegan three days after Monegan was fired .
I sense vetting problems in Republican circles .
Alaska 's legislature is spending up to $ 100,000 " to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former Public Safety Commissioner Monegan , and potential abuses of power and / or improper actions by members of the executive branch . "
The investigation is supposed to wrap up by Oct. 31 , just days before the Nov. 4 general election .
Palin will be deposed along with others in the governor 's office and former administration officials [...]
The special counsel just this week was trying to arrange Palin 's deposition , French said .
French said Palin's new role as vice - presidential candidate wo n't change the investigation .[...]
Before she was governor , Palin pushed for a trooper investigation of Wooten over a number of matters , including using a Taser on his stepson , illegally shooting a moose , and accusations of driving drunk .
At one point , Palin and her husband hired a private investigator .
Troopers did investigate , and Wooten was suspended for 10 days , later reduced to five .
That took care of it , Monegan said .
But the Palin administration and Todd Palin would n't let go , he said . [...]
Monegan said Palin called him on his cell phone one night in January 2007 about Wooten , but it was n't related to her security detail .
He said he had already met with Todd Palin about Wooten , whom he had n't heard of before , and had looked into the family 's complaints only to learn they already had been investigated .
Palin seemed frustrated that nothing more could be done , he said .
" For the record , no one ever said fire Wooten .
Not the governor .
Not Todd .
Not any of the other staff , " Monegan said Friday from Portland .
" What they said directly was more along the lines of ' This is n't a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers . ' " Palin again brought up Wooten in February 2007 as they were walking together to wish a state senator a happy birthday , Monegan said .
He said he told Palin he had to keep her at arm 's distance on the matter and she agreed .
To be continued ...
Will the ‘ Dream Act ’ be a nightmare for McCain ?
John McCain , recognizing the importance of Latino voters in the upcoming election , spoke to the National Council of La Raza yesterday .
He told the audience , “ I do ask for your trust , ” adding , “ I think I have earned that trust . ”
I know McCain often has a dry sense of humor , and in this case , I ca n’t help but wonder if he was kidding .
We ’ve already talked about McCain ’s efforts to mislead the audience about his on - again , off - again support / opposition to comprehensive immigration reform .
But after his speech , McCain opened the floor to about 15 minutes of Q&A .
A young woman asked whether the Republican senator would support the Dream Act ( Development , Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act ) , which gives undocumented young people a chance to earn U.S. citizenship by going to college or enlisting in the military .
McCain did n’t hesitate to endorse the legislation .
That ’s clearly the right position for McCain to take .
The Dream
Act should be a no- brainer : “ Roughly 65,000 children graduate each year from high school into a constrained future because they cannot work legally or qualify for most college aid .
These are the overlooked bystanders to the ferocious bickering over immigration .
They did not ask to be brought here , have worked hard in school and could , given the chance , hone their talents and become members of the homegrown , high - skilled American work force .
The bill is one of the least controversial immigration proposals that have been offered in the last five years . ”
But what McCain neglected to mention is that he already promised conservative activists that he opposes the Dream Act , and would have voted against it had he shown up for work last fall .
In fact , it was captured on tape .
The audio in the latter portion of the clip is from a conference call McCain held with right - wing bloggers in October , in which he vowed opposition to the Dream Act — in addition to opposition to the same comprehensive immigration proposal he now claims to support .
When the National Review asked McCain about the Dream Act , McCain said , “ I would have voted against it .
I have said a thousand times , I have heard the message from the American people . ”
The man is just shamelessly dishonest .
McCain co-sponsored the Dream Act , then refused to vote for it , then promised to oppose it , then promised to support it .
And just to add a little irony to the whole situation , McCain then concluded , “ I do ask for your trust . ”
Now , under normal circumstances , one might wonder whether McCain will be pressed to explain himself today , maybe with a clarifying press conference .
But that ’s almost certainly not going to happen .
Part of this , I suspect , is because the media just prefers to go easy on McCain .
But the other part of the problem is , I have a hunch reporters are n’t following the race as closely as we are .
That may sound silly — they are paid media professionals on the campaign beat — but I genuinely believe they ’re not especially well informed .
When I heard McCain vow to support the Dream Act , I immediately knew he was abandoning a pledge he ’d made during the primaries .
When the reporters who travel with McCain heard it , did they notice the same problem ?
Do they even know what the Dream Act is ?
It ’s one reason , I believe , that McCain is so reckless with his rhetoric .
He not only assumes the media has given up on holding him accountable , but he also assumes reporters are n’t quite sharp enough to keep track of minor policy details .
On this , McCain is probably right .
And what if I ’m wrong ?
What if campaign reporters really do know what the Dream Act is , and knew immediately that McCain is making completely contradictory promises to different groups at different times ?
That would speak to reporters ’ competence — but it would n’t explain why not one of them thought to mention it in their reports on McCain ’s La Raza appearance .
They danced the tango in Portland , Ore. , they 're doing the samba in New York , and by the end of this month , they 'll be dancing in the streets of San Francisco .
It 's urban planning with a Latin twist , a simple idea imported from South America for transforming the cityscape .
Temporary street closures , or ciclovias , are sweeping across the US , as cities take a new look at alternative uses for their streets .
It all started in Bogota , Colombia , about 30 years ago .
The ciclovia – which means " cycle way , " or bike path , in Spanish – was designed as a relatively inexpensive way to promote walking and bicycling , and to encourage the mingling of people from all backgrounds in the city 's streets .
It worked .
Every Sunday Bogota draws nearly one - fourth of its population of 7 million out to walk and cycle 81 miles of car - free streets .
In the early years of the event , residents from the poorer sections of town , many of them of Indian descent , and those from more affluent neighborhoods , of European descent , would halt at one another 's boundaries .
After a while , though , those invisible lines began to melt , and now people from all over the city mingle freely .
Gil Penalosa supervised Bogota 's ciclovias when he was the city 's parks and recreation commissioner from 1995 - 97 .
He expanded the program from eight to 70 miles of closed streets and now promotes ciclovias all over the world from his Toronto - based nonprofit , Walk & Bike For Life .
Mr. Penalosa likes to quote Central Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted on the positive benefits of public spaces .
Penalosa notes that Bogota 's ciclovia " is one of the few places where the owners of large corporations share activities out on the streets with their own employees . "
Some US cities are hoping for similar social benefits .
When it launches its first ciclovia Aug.
31 , San Francisco is hoping to help connect a currently isolated , low - income neighborhood , the Bayview , with other parts of the city on a six - mile route .
Portland 's June 22 event linked an African - American neighborhood with newer , gentrified neighborhoods on the city 's north side .
For some public space advocates , this is just the beginning : " London , Paris , and other cities have taken this idea much further , but they started with temporary street closures , " notes Wiley Norvell , whose organization , Transportation Alternatives , is participating in the New York event .
" Once you get out of the mind - set of ' all cars all the time , ' all sorts of possibilities open up . "
Every summer Paris closes a portion of one of its major expressways and creates a temporary beachfront and promenade – complete with sand and palm trees – along the Seine .
Starting with the closure of one street more than 40 years ago , Copenhagen has gradually developed a central city that prioritizes walking and cycling .
With the encouragement of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the city 's transportation czar , Janette Sadik - Khan , New York is becoming an open - air laboratory for alternative uses of public space .
On three Saturdays this month , seven miles of streets in Manhattan , including a long stretch of Park Avenue , will be closed to traffic for six hours each day .
Vehicular traffic has been permenantly removed from two lanes of Broadway in midtown Manhattan to make room for pedestrians and cyclists .
As part of this transformation , people will soon be sitting at cafe tables on what used to be one of Broadway 's busy southbound lanes .
Barbara Randall is in the thick of this latest experiment .
She heads an association of property owners in midtown Manhattan 's Fashion Center .
Both she and her organization are fully in support of the new project .
Ms. Randall points out that New York City 's population is expected to grow by 1 million in the next 20 years and asks : " How do we accommodate them as they move around the city ?
The obvious answer is to use our limited space more efficiently by freeing up more of it for pedestrians and cyclists .
And if you transform a crowded , traffic - choked environment to one that 's more beautiful , more user - friendly , it becomes a destination , and that 's good for neighborhood merchants . "
For some time now , New York has been temporarily closing some neighborhood streets in the summertime and turning them into " play streets " for children .
Its Department of Transportation has just launched a Public Plaza Initiative convert underused streets to public plazas throughout the city 's five boroughs .
Not surprisingly , with all these plans to limit auto access to city streets , there 's been some squawking from businesses .
It 's helped somewhat that the weekend ciclovia events occur on days when deliveries are usually minimal .
And the approach has generally been to avoid turning them into street fairs , where vendors often compete with established merchants .
Instead , the emphasis is on free activities such as yoga , bike repair lessons , dancing and , as Mr. Norvell puts it , " just letting open space be open space " for people to enjoy as they choose .
Before Brooklyn Heights closed a major boulevard to cars for four Sundays in July , organizers soothed merchants ' concerns with a survey that found that 91 percent of their customers arrived by foot , bike , or public transportation .
Still , it is n't an easy sell , this idea of car - free streets in cities that have long catered to the automobile .
Portland helped ease concerns with a " soft closing " of streets on its six - mile route .
Police were on hand to direct traffic through major intersections .
On other blocks , volunteers escorted drivers to and from homes on the route .
Portland is already making plans to expand to three or four ciclovias next summer .
In New York , supporters envision a regular event on the scale of Bogota 's that goes through all five boroughs .
Chicago plans two ciclovias for October ; Baltimore , one next April .
" It 's part of a sea change in how we 're viewing city streets , " says Susan King , the coordinator of San Francisco 's event .
" A city street becomes an entirely different landscape when you take the cars away .
It creates opportunities for people to come out and exercise , meet their neighbors , and learn to appreciate their city in a whole new way . "

How do other countries rate Batman ?

What are these ?
Mrs Clinton loaned her campaign $ 6.4 m last month Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton has vowed to continue her campaign despite losing ground in the latest primary contests and her financial problems .
Mrs Clinton beat rival Barack Obama by just two points in Indiana 's primary , while he won by 14 in North Carolina .
The votes were the final major Democratic primaries which help decide the party 's White House candidate .
Mrs Clinton is also facing a funding crisis - she was forced to lend her campaign $ 6.4 m ( £ 3.3 m ) last month .
Unhealthy sign Speaking to reporters , she pledged to remain in the race " until the nominee is chosen " , although she did not reveal whether this meant she would stay in until the party 's nominating convention in August .
Mrs Clinton also appealed to supporters for more funds to carry on the fight .
That is not a healthy sign , says the BBC's Justin Webb in West Virginia , where Mrs Clinton is campaigning .
Contributors will not throw money at what they see as a lost cause , and without daily infusions of cash , presidential campaigns cannot survive , our correspondent says .
PRIMARY RESULTS North Carolina Senator Obama 56 % Senator Clinton 42 % Indiana Senator Clinton 51 % Senator Obama 49 % Figures from AP
In pictures : US primaries
Who are the delegates ?
Send us your comments
The two candidates are locked in a drawn - out battle to stand for the Democratic Party against Republican John McCain in November 's presidential election .
With neither likely to win enough pledged delegates to the party conference in August to clinch the nomination , the outcome hangs on the decision of nearly 800 so - called super - delegates - many senior party members - who can choose which candidate to back .
The Clinton campaign is hoping that it can still persuade a majority of the remaining undecided super - delegates to back the New York senator .
Mrs Clinton met some of them on the day after her North Carolina defeat in an effort to shore up her support .
I honestly believe that she will find a way to get out of the race before the next primaries

Clinton ' heading for the exit ' Democratic voters ' reaction
So far she has received endorsements from 271 superdelegates , to Mr Obama 's 256 , with 270 still undecided , according to the Associated Press .
Many super - delegates say they will vote for the candidate chosen in the primary of their home state .
But the campaign suffered a setback when former senator and 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern announced that he was switching his support from Mrs Clinton to Mr Obama .
Mr McGovern , who is not a super - delegate and will therefore not have a vote at the party 's nominating convention , also called on Mrs Clinton to withdraw from the race .
Her team are also still arguing that the delegates from Michigan and Florida - barred by party chiefs from attending the convention after the states broke party rules by holding their contests early - should be allowed to take their seats at the convention after all .
Mrs Clinton did well in the disputed contests , and would benefit if the party opted to overturn its earlier ruling .
Mr Obama is leading the race in delegates who will choose the presidential nominee by 1,840 to 1,684 , according to the Associated Press news agency .
Race split Speaking to a raucous rally in Raleigh , North Carolina , on Tuesday night , Mr Obama said : " Tonight we stand less than 200 delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination for president of the United States . "
Analysts said Mr Obama 's win was vital after a recent difficult campaign stretch .
He has been dogged by controversy over his gaffe that small - town residents were " bitter " , and racially charged comments by his former pastor , Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
A win in Indiana was seen as critical for Mrs Clinton to stay in the race to stand against Republican John McCain in November 's presidential vote .
At her election gathering in the Indiana state capital , Indianapolis , she told cheering supporters it was " full speed on to the White House " .
But despite her defiant words , Mrs Clinton seems to have lost some of her trademark fighting spirit , says BBC Washington correspondent Jonathan Beale .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The rivals , courting voters suffering from an ailing economy , spent recent days sparring over Mrs Clinton 's proposal to suspend the federal petrol tax for the summer .
Mid-western Indiana is home to large numbers of blue - collar workers , a bloc which has backed Mrs Clinton in previous contests .
According to exit polls conducted for AP , about two - thirds of white voters in both states who had not completed a college education supported Mrs Clinton .
In North Carolina , Mr Obama won the backing of 90 % of the state 's African - American voters , who make up more than a third of the state 's electorate .
Mrs Clinton won 58 % of non -black voters in the state , according to the polls .
There are just six primary contests left : West Virginia , Oregon , Kentucky , Puerto Rico , Montana and South Dakota .
The Republicans also held primaries in Indiana and North Carolina on Tuesday , but the votes were largely symbolic as Senator John McCain has effectively secured the nomination .

While I understand this heartfelt attempt at satire , I believe naming the water treatment plant after someone as odious as the internationally recognized war criminal George W. Bush is wrong for one simple reason : Unlike Bush , the plant actually performs a valuable function .
I 've wracked my brain for a couple of weeks now trying to figure out some other entity that could be renamed , something that would truly reflect Bush 's legacy , but I 'm at a loss as to what that might be .
Anyone have any ideas ?

Tio -
It 's not about what comes out of the treatment plant , it 's about what goes in .
In any case , it would be up to the local organizers to decide want to rename in Bush 's honor in their communities , so sewage plants and garbage dumps are just a suggestion .

Tio , you make a good point , the plant is vital and should be respected , unlike Bushbaby .
If they did name it after him , there would probably be spills and containment leaks , anything for the Bush Crime Family to continue to shit on the Bay Area .
I would suggest then maybe renaming Gitmo after him , but that would be an insult to the Cubans .
With all due respect to Dr. Guillotin , perhaps we could rename his invention the Bushwacker after we use it on Chimpy .
But , I realize this whole discussion , is WHY Georgie was made President to beging with : he 's the perfect Mancherian front man to absorb the praise and scorn of the masses while the real players like Cheney , Addington , Baker , Kissinger pull strings from behind the curtain .

Here 's a thought : Perhaps we should limit the naming of George W. Bush Legacy sites to Superfund sites .
After all , they are extremely toxic and will take forever to clean up .
There are currently 1,623 Superfund sites nationwide ; 93 Superfund sites in California , with three more proposed .
Moreover , one out of two Americans live within 10 miles of a Superfund site .
That means half of us can live within biking distance of a George W. Bush Legacy Site !
Just imagine :
The EPA would be stacked to the rafters with documents headed Gorge W. Bush Legacy Site # 00001 through # 01623 ; newspaper articles would be headlined " George W. Bush Legacy Site # 00623 Contaminates Aquifer " ; etc. Again , just a thought .

A little family history .
My father worked his way up through the ranks to be a Supervisor who eventially became the Superintendent at a sewage treatment plant in Independence , Mo .
He worked there for roughly 30 years .
Late in his life , when he could n't meet the physical requirements , the city hired him as a consultant .
I have fond memories , as a child , going to work with dad and being allowed to go out on the settling pond with him .
He 'd launch a 14 ft boat on the settling pond and we'd go out and stir things up to help the settling .
That was many years ago .
The one thing I remember most fondly about dad is his since of humour .
In those days if you worked at a sewage treatment plant all the other city workers : parks department , transportation department , etc. were gonna kid you and tell jokes about working at a sewage treatment plant .
So , I have to ask ?
Is it fitting for San Fransisco to name one of its largest waste water treatment plants for George W.? I 'll answer that myself .
That 's a freaking excellent idea .
So , look at it this way .
George W. , and his ilk , are the shit pile of the world .
Where else would the excretement that he and his ilk produced flow to but a sewage treatment plant named after him .
My only question is .
Will TurdBlossom have a settling tank named after him ? :_)

# 8 Troubled Texan ,
Hey that was nice !
And also thanks for bringing up the topic of shit !
Because I wanted to share with y'all the lyrics to this song I wrote , The Bullshit Song , & I was thinking Hmmm ... does n't really fit in with water treatment plants ... but it sure fits the bush boys .
Be better with the melody , but here ya go , for what it 's worth ...
The Bullshit Song
What does it for you , what sets your hair on fire the most ?
Maybe it 's the war , or the fact that our reputation is toast ?
When you 're calling tech support & they 're in Bombay
And you can't understand a single a word they say ?
Well I know for me it's that every damn day
All we get is BULLSHIT Maybe it's that smirk on his face when the whole damn country 's gone to hell ,
Or maybe it 's the fact that he just can't speak the English language very well .
Is it all the good jobs that have just gone away ?
Or that filling up the car takes half of your pay ?
No , I 'd really still have to say
It 's the constant BULLSHIT Chorus
Do they think we 're stupid ?
Oh yeah , they do
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain
They want us fat & lazy , and deaf dumb & blind
Yeah , then we wo n't notice we 're hurtin '
Does it burn you up that they keep cutting taxes for billionnaires ?
You know I seem to recall New Orleans still could use a few minor repairs .
The country 's so in debt , we 're running out of dough ,
Ca n't expect Uncle Sam to help the average Joe ,
Oh no ya can't get in the way of the reliable flow
Of all their BULLSHIT Does it make you see red that Watergate now seems like a day at the beach ?
Do you pull out your hair when they keep pretending Noo we can't impeach ?
Is it that what they say is never what they mean ?
Or that they 're laying waste to the American Dream ?
No it 's more that reeking & reliable stream
Of never - ending BULLSHIT Chorus
You know our votes are safe , they would n't mess with those
Ha !
How stupid do they think we are ?
They guard 'em carefully until the polls are closed
And then we find 'em in the trunk of a car Does it make you crazy when their laws mean the opposite of what they 're called ?
( The Clean Air Act ... right )
Or when you hear another one 's caught with his pants down in a bathroom stall ?
These are powerful men , got the guns , got the toys
Why can't they just admit , they kinda like boys ?
( It 's OKAY guys ! )
No , they 'll cover it up using one of their ploys ...
Here comes more BULLSHIT
Hey , the economy 's great , lookin ' strong , gettin ' better every day !
And the Constitution , just a piece of paper , we did n't need it anyway !
I do n't know whose to blame for the fix we 're in
But my patience is really kinda wearin ' thin
You can call it hype , you can call it spin
Well I call it BULLSHIT

Hey Jon ! , Troy King has to purge himself from the voting roles now .
[...] the State Legislature clearly defined what those crimes are : murder , rape , sodomy , sexual abuse , incest , sexual torture and nine other crimes mainly involving pornography and abuses against children .
At issue in the lawsuit is not the list enacted in law but an expanded “ moral turpitude ” list developed by the state ’s attorney general , Troy King , in 2005 .
That list includes about a dozen additional offenses , most of them nonviolent , and several including the sale of marijuana .

The most fitting legacy / memorial for this unarguably worst US President EVER is the large smoking hole in the ground where the US economy used to be .
Not only can he not pronounce " nuclear " , he is apparently genetically incapable of saying the word " recession " .
Perhaps he will have an easier time with " depression " instead .
Right now , the most honorable thing he could do is go on a hunting trip with Dick Chaney ( this is your chance Dick , do n't screw it up . )
Then , hopefully , Dick will keel over from the excitement , and Nancy Palosi will have a chance to kick - start the Democrats until Obama takes over in January .

We 've got our wires crossed :
The bizarre stories of people whose brains have rewired themselves
The human brain : Numerous system which link up and work together
The human brain is the most complex organ in the body and contains 20 billion cells , responsible for everything from dreaming and movement to appetite and emotions .
It consists mainly of grey matter - the brain cells or neurons where information is processed .
It also contains white matter - the nerve fibres which , like electric cables , send out chemical messengers and relay information between the cells .
In fact , the brain contains more nerve fibres than there are wires in the entire international telephone network and sometimes the brain 's ' wires ' can become crossed , as a result of injury , illness or genetics .
Scientists used to think a brain injury resulted in permanent damage to the brain 's functions , but new research suggests this is not necessarily the case .
' When one area of our brain is damaged we now know from scans that the functions of that area are distributed elsewhere , ' says Dr Keith Muir , a senior lecturer in neuroscience at Glasgow University .
' That is why after a stroke people sometimes lose the use of their hand or leg then regain it because another area of the brain eventually takes up the job of movement . '
In fact , says Dr Muir , rather than talking about different areas of the brain it is better to think of it as having numerous different systems which link up and work together .
When the brain is injured , the systems learn to link up differently - sometimes with surprising results .
Some people are actually born with this kind of altered wiring .
At birth we all have far more brain cells than we need and as we develop there 's a period of so - called ' pruning ' - when only the connections and brain cells needed and used survive .
In some cases it 's thought that this process goes awry - perhaps because of a faulty gene - resulting in cross wiring or extra connections .
Here , we talk to people whose brains have been ' scrambled ' as a result of illness or birth .
But far from being a hindrance , some of them believe it is actually beneficial .
The brummie with a French accent
Richard Murray , 32 , a financial planning manager , suffered a stroke three years ago and as a result now speaks in a French accent .
Richard , from Hereford , is married to Amy , 32 , and has two children : Olivia , two , and 17 - month - old Finlay .
Richard Murray with his family :
His wife Amy helped him to learn to speak again
Richard says : ' Until I had my stroke , I spoke with a broad Brummie accent .
Now people assume I am a born - and - bred Frenchman , yet I have only ever been there twice briefly on holiday and speak only the basic French I learnt at school .
The stroke happened nine days after I got back from my honeymoon .
Suddenly I had a searing pain in my brain and then I felt numb down my right side .
I was fully conscious , but I could n't speak a word .
' I was taken to hospital and within hours the feeling started to come back in my right leg and arm , but by the next morning I was still only able to grunt and I started to feel really panicky .
' A brain scan showed that the stroke had been caused by a blood clot travelling through my system and lodging in the left side of the brain ; this is the area which controls speech .
They thought I got the clot after breaking my big toe while on honeymoon .
' Although the clot had been dispersed with drugs , I was warned I might never be able to speak again , which was devastating .
' I had all the vocabulary in my head , but I could not remember physically how to form words .
Instead , I had to write everything down .
' After eight days I was discharged from hospital , by which time I had full use of my arms and legs , but I was still mute .
' I was told I needed to start speech therapy as soon as possible , but the wait on the NHS was nine months .
' Luckily , a friend who is a speech therapist agreed to see me once a week and my wife worked with me daily .
' I had to learn how to talk again from scratch .
I knew how each word and letter was supposed to sound , but I did not know where to put my tongue or how to force out the words .
' My wife would use a mirror so she could describe to me exactly how my mouth should look when I was making letter sounds .
' Within two weeks I learned four basic words : 'hi , bye , yes and no . '
' Instantly my new accent was discernable .
Initially I sounded Italian .
My wife was just pleased I was talking again .
' One day I was at the supermarket when the cashier asked me a question .
I could only shrug and someone behind me muttered ' bloody foreigner ' .
' Slowly I started to talk more .
It felt different physically in my mouth to the way it did before the stroke and my accent turned from Italian to French .
When I bumped into old friends and started speaking , they thought I was taking the mickey .
' When I went back to work six months later , I visited each client face to face as they would n't have believed it was me on the phone .
' Now I can hold a steady , fluent conversation , but I still sound French .
The doctors are n't sure if my English accent will ever return .
But I really do n't mind - having thought I would never speak again , I am grateful just to be able to talk . '
What is happening ?
Foreign Language Syndrome is a very rare but recognised medical condition in which , due to a stroke or brain injury , a person starts speaking their mother language but with a foreign accent .
' The power of speech uses many different areas of the brain , ' says Dr Keith Muir , a senior lecturer in neuroscience at Glasgow University .
' That 's why total speech loss is a common effect of a stroke , because it can cause catastrophic damage to very large areas of the brain .
' It could be that people with this syndrome either regain their speech by using a different part of their brain , or that the effect of the stroke makes their mouth and tongue operate differently , which alters their pronunciation . '

The man who can taste words
James Wannerton ( right ) , an IT contractor from Blackpool , has synaesthesia , a condition which means two senses are stimulated at once .
For James , 49 , hearing or seeing words stimulates his sense of taste .
He says : ' When I hear a word , I actually taste it .
Some words taste really nice and some really unpleasant .
It 's something I can't switch it off .
I even dream with the sense of taste strong in my mouth .
' It can be quite distracting , like having ringing in your ears .
I 've always had it - one of my earliest memories is saying The Lord 's Prayer during assemblies when I was four or five and getting loads of different tastes , such as bacon , entering my mouth .
' When I was younger , I would pick my friends on the basis of the way their names tasted .
' For example .
I would like people called Robert because the name tasted like strawberry jam sandwiches , whereas the name Gordon made me taste dirt .
' Until my teens , I presumed everyone was the same as me .
It was only when I started opening up to girlfriends that I realised I was a bit different .
' In my late teens , my mum admitted she had a far less invasive version than mine .
However , she seemed to be really embarrassed talking about it , so I just dropped the subject and I presumed it was just a family trait .
' It was n't until the mid-Nineties while holidaying in America , that I saw a TV documentary about people like me realised I had a medical condition .
' I then found out about some into synaesthesia at the Maudsley Hospital in London and contacted them ten years ago .
' A brain scan showed that the area processing taste lit up not only when I ate something , as it does for everyone , but also unusually , when I heard words and word sounds .
' When I was at university I found it quite hard to concentrate as the words of lecturers would flood my mouth with flavours .
' That 's why I choose to work in information technology , a quiet profession which does not require me to talk or interact much with other people .
' This condition has also affected the types of women I go out with .
' Whereas Barbara or Helen are nice juicy flavours to me , a friend married a women whose name , Colleen , makes me nauseous .
I find it hard to say or hear her name as a result .
' Food names do n't necessarily bring the taste of the food .
For example , the word oyster triggers the taste of chocolate .
' I have actually stopped eating out with other people because their conversation creates so many different tastes in my mouth that it ruins my enjoyment of the food .
' Sometimes my synaesthesia has proved useful - at school it helped me memorise things because I could remember flavours .
' A good example would be the kings and queens of England which were a list of tastes .
' I would n't want to be without synaesthesia , but I would like to be without it briefly , so I could understand what other people 's lives are like .
I imagine it would n't be as interesting . '
What is happening ?
' People with synaesthesia find that one sense automatically triggers another , ' says Dr Jamie Ward , a neuroscientist from the University of Sussex who has written a book on the subject called The Frog Who Croaked Blue .
' The condition , which is often hereditary and affects around one in 20 in the UK to some degree , is caused by extra connections in the areas of the brain which control the senses .
' MRI scans have found that people with synaesthesia develop excess connections , often in the vision area .
The most common form is seeing colours when hearing letters .
' They remember things and perceive things in a different way .
For example , someone with synaesthesia might think of a phone number as a series of coloured stripes because each number also stimulates a colour in their brain . '

The obsessive artist
Tommy McHugh , 58 , a divorced father of two from Liverpool , was a builder until he had a brain haemorrhage which almost killed him in 2001 .
Tommy is now a prodigious artist even though he had never picked up a paintbrush before .
Tommy McHugh : From builder to prodigious artist
He says : ' My urge to draw is like an addiction .
My brain is so full of ideas for new sculptures or paintings that I struggle to sleep .
I never dreamed my life would take this path .
' As a youngster , I was in trouble for fighting and left school at 15 .
I had never been interested in art or poetry , but the haemorrhage changed all that .
' When it happened , I felt an intense pain in my head which was so bad I vomited .
My wife called an ambulance and I was rushed to hospital ; a scan found an artery in my brain had burst and there was a bulge in another which looked like it might burst at any minute .
' I immediately had surgery and when I came round after the five - hour operation the world was a completely different place .
' A doctor said my wife was there to see me , but I looked at this woman and had no recollection of her at all .
It was really , really frightening .
' My children and my brothers came to see me and with every arrival I thought : " Now , who is this ? "
The worst part , though , was looking in the mirror and having no recollection of having seen my face before .
' Slowly my kids , who are grown up now , made me laugh , triggering fragments of previous memories .
I started to remember them after a couple of weeks .
' About a month after the haemorrhage , the creative urges began .
I started writing poetry , but in a manic way .
Was it any good ?
I do n't know , but I could fill five exercise books a day .
The painting urge came on about two months later .
' I was filing up any spare paper I had with drawings and paintings .
Within weeks I wanted to paint more and more and had started painting walls .
Now my house looks like one big collage of my work with every surface - even furniture - painted with a face or scene .
' I do n't copy anything .
I just draw things that come into my mind .
I could never paint someone 's portrait , for example .
' In one way , I wish this had happened to me when I was 14 .
I would love to have been able to have a career as an artist , but it has had downsides , too .
' Jan and I split up six months after the haemorrhage .
She said she did not know me any more and the obsessive painting scared her .
I 'd stay up painting until 2 or 3 am and then get up at 6 am and start again .
' I do wish I could sometimes turn the ideas off .
The hospital referred me to a psychiatrist , but he only offered me sleeping pills .
' I do n't want to take pills , though .
All I take are painkillers for the headaches I get on a fairly regular basis , but I do n't want to stop my creative urges , just slow them down a bit .
' I am working with a gallery now and I hope that as well as exhibiting my work people will commission my paintings .
That would be magic .
What is happening ?
' Tommy 's experiences are unusual , but there are other cases of injury to the brain leading to extreme artistic output , ' says Dr Ailie Turton , an occupational therapist based in the experimental psychology unit at Bristol University .
' There have been cases of people with dementia who , like Tommy , have damage to the front of the brain , the area that plays a major part in emotion and language .
' There was a 68 - year - old man who had shown no previous artistic talent but suddenly became an accomplished painter .
' Our creative urges are driven by many different areas of the brain linked by various networks and it could be that these are somehow enhanced by injury .
The brain also has dampening actions to keep impulses and reactions in check and it may be that this response is damaged , which unleashes a manic desire to create art . '
Enlarge By Carolyn Kaster , AP John McCain walks with former GOP rival Rudy Giuliani , left , and his wife , Judith Giuliani , before Sunday ? s
Yankees game .
WASHINGTON  Republican John McCain 's campaign jousted Sunday with two prominent politicians over when and how to pull troops out of Iraq : Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
In an interview published over the weekend in a German magazine , al - Maliki seemed to endorse Obama 's short - term plan to pull out U.S. troops over 16 months .
However , an al - Maliki spokesman seemed to back away from those comments in a statement released Sunday .
Democrats embraced al - Maliki 's initial comments .
McCain campaign aides noted that al - Maliki 's government and U.S. military officials say security needs on the ground must dictate any withdrawal .
Obama " is stubbornly adhering to an unconditional withdrawal that places politics above the advice of our military commanders , " said McCain foreign policy aide Randy Scheunemann .
A foreign policy adviser for Obama , Susan Rice , said Obama welcomes al - Maliki 's support for a redeployment timetable .
" This presents an important opportunity to transition to Iraqi responsibility , while restoring our military and increasing our commitment to finish the fight in Afghanistan , " Rice said .
Al - Maliki 's initial comments created problems for McCain , said Peter Trubowitz , a government professor at the University of Texas - Austin .
The political fallout , Trubowitz said , may depend on " which al - Maliki statement sticks . "
" Maliki 's initial statement helps Obama , " he said , but the follow - up could mitigate matters for the Republican .
" I do n't think it really helps McCain , but it 's certainly less damaging than the first set of comments . "
Al - Maliki 's government is " driven by domestic politics in Iraq and not in the United States , " said Charles Kupchan , an international relations specialist at Georgetown University .
It 's clear the Iraqis want some kind of timetable for withdrawal , which puts McCain " in an awkward position , " said Kupchan , an informal adviser to Obama .
Whether it is called a timetable or something else , the United States and Iraq are negotiating some time frame in which U.S. troops leave Iraq .
Those talks , the Bush administration said , now include a " general time horizon " for certain goals , including " the resumption of Iraqi security control in their cities and provinces and the further reduction of U.S. combat forces from Iraq . "
The White House — which has opposed a specific timeline for withdrawal — said in an official statement that the goals " would be based on continued improving conditions on the ground and not an arbitrary date for withdrawal . "
The McCain campaign also spotlighted criticisms of a timeline by Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Appearing on Fox News Sunday , Mullen said " making reductions based on conditions on the ground ( is ) very important . "
McCain made no public campaign appearances Sunday .
Instead , he met with New York City Education Chancellor Joel Klein , then attended a New York Yankees baseball game .
The Arizona senator is likely to focus on jobs and energy this week as he travels to a series of battleground states .
On Monday morning , he has a Maine fundraiser and meeting with a notable foreign policy luminary : former president George H.W. Bush .

Finally we can all sleep at night , safe in the knowledge that Sony has created a prototype fuel cell system that fits in the palm of your hand .
The combination lithium - polymer battery , backup battery , and control circuit are destined for future mobile devices .
According to a company engineer , " We have been aiming to mount ( a fuel - cell system ) in mobile devices and finally reached a level of commercial design . "
The tiny power - pack uses methanol as a fuel and controls supply with a hybrid pump , which allows it to regulate the amount of power used based on a system 's needs .
The company claims that just 10 ml of methanol can power a mobile device through 14 hours of 1seg movie watching .
Sure , it sounds good on paper , but does this mean soon we 'll have to visit tiny , methanol refilling stations manned by a team of mice in jumpsuits ?
Probably not .

The German inflation of 1914 –1923 had an inconspicuous beginning , a creeping rate of one to two percent .
On the first day of the war , the German Reichsbank , like the other central banks of the belligerent powers , suspended redeemability of its notes in order to prevent a run on its gold reserves .
Like all the other banks , it offered assistance to the central government in financing the war effort .
Since taxes are always unpopular , the German government preferred to borrow the needed amounts of money rather than raise its taxes substantially .
To this end it was readily assisted by the Reichsbank , which discounted most treasury obligations .
A growing percentage of government debt thus found its way into the vaults of the central bank and an equivalent amount of printing press money into people 's cash holdings .
In short , the central bank was monetizing the growing government debt .
By the end of the war the amount of money in circulation had risen fourfold and prices some 140 percent .
Yet the German mark had suffered no more than the British pound , was somewhat weaker than the American dollar but stronger than the French franc .
Five years later , in December 1923 , the Reichsbank had issued 496.5 quintillion marks , each of which had fallen to one - trillionth of its 1914 gold value .
How stupendous !
Practically every economic good and service was costing trillions of marks .
The American dollar was quoted at 4.2 trillion marks , the American penny at 42 billion marks .
How could a European nation that prided itself on its high levels of education and scholarly knowledge suffer such a thorough destruction of its money ?
Who would inflict on a great nation such evil which had ominous economic , social , and political ramifications not only for Germany but for the whole world ?
Was it the victors of World War I who , in diabolical revenge , devastated the vanquished country through ruinous financial manipulation and plunder ?
Every mark was printed by Germans and issued by a central bank that was governed by Germans under a government that was purely German .
It was German political parties , such as the Socialists , the Catholic Centre Party , and the Democrats , forming various coalition governments , that were solely responsible for the policies they conducted .
Of course , admission of responsibility for any calamity cannot be expected from any political party .
The reasoning that led these parties to inflate the national currency at such astronomical rates is not only interesting for economic historians , but also very revealing of the rationale for monetary destruction .
The doctrines and theories that led to the German monetary destruction have since then caused destruction in many other countries .
In fact , they may be at work right now all over the western world .
In our judgment , four erroneous doctrines or theories guided the German monetary authorities in those baleful years .
No Inflation in Germany
The most amazing economic sophism that was advanced by eminent financiers , politicians , and economists endeavored to show that there was neither monetary nor credit inflation in Germany .
These experts readily admitted that the nominal amount of paper money issued was indeed enormous .
But the real value of all currency in circulation , that is , the gold value in terms of gold or goods prices , they argued , was much lower than before the war or than that of other industrial countries .
Minister of Finance and celebrated economist Helfferich repeatedly assured his nation that there was no inflation in Germany since the total value of currency in circulation , when measured in gold , was covered by the gold reserves in the Reichsbank at a much higher ratio than before the war .
President of the Reichsbank Havenstein categorically denied that the central bank had inflated the German currency .
He was convinced that it followed a restrictive policy since its portfolio was worth , in gold marks , less than half its 1913 holdings .
Professor Julius
Wolf wrote in the summer of 1922 : " In proportion to the need , less money circulates in Germany now than before the war .
This statement may cause surprise , but it is correct .
The circulation is now 15 – 20 times that of pre-war days , whilst prices have risen 40 – 50 times . "
Similarly Professor Elster reassured his people that " however enormous may be the apparent rise in the circulation in 1922 , actually the figures show a decline . "
The Statistical Bureau of the German government even calculated the real values of the per capita circulation in various countries .
It , too , concluded that there was a shortage of currency in Germany , but a great deal of inflation abroad .
Gold value of monies in circulation , gold marks per person 1920 1922 Germany 87.63 17.92 England 84.40 110.73 France 180.05 229.90 Switzerland 89.49 103.33 United States of America 101.35 97.66 Source : Wirtschaft und Statistjk , 1923 , No. 1 . ( To arrive at US dollar amounts these figures should be divided by 4.2 )
Of course , this fantastic conclusion drawn by monetary authorities and experts bore ominous consequences for millions of people .
Through devious sophisms it simply removed the cause of disaster from individual responsibility and thus also all limits to the issuance of more paper money .
The source of this momentous error probably lies in the ignorance of one of the most important determinants of money value , which is the very attitude of people toward money .
For one reason or another people may vary their cash holdings .
An increase in cash holdings by many people tends to raise the exchange value of money ; reduction in cash holdings tends to lower it .
Now in order to change radically their cash holdings , individuals must have cogent reasons .
They naturally enlarge their holdings whenever they anticipate rising money value as , for instance , in a depression .
And they reduce their holdings whenever they expect declining money value .
In the German hyperinflation they reduced their holdings to an absolute minimum and finally avoided any possession at all .
It is obvious that goods prices must then rise faster and the value of money depreciate faster than the rate of money creation .
If the value of individual cash holdings declines faster than the rate of money printing , the value of the total stock of money must also depreciate faster than this rate .
This is so well understood that even the mathematical economists emphasize the money " velocity " in their equations and calculations of money value .
But the German monetary authorities were unaware of such basic principles of human action .
For Health , Education , Welfare , and Full Employment
Immediately after the war the German government , under the leadership of the Socialist Party , embarked upon heavy expenditures for health , education , and welfare .
The demands on the treasury were extremely heavy anyway because of demobilization expenses , the demands of the Armistice , the disorders of the revolution , and the staggering deficits of the nationalized industries , especially the railroads , postal services , telephone , and telegraph .
Public administration by the new men raised to power by the revolution , nevertheless , was extravagant , as the resources made available by the creation of new money were apparently unlimited .
A number of measures for the nationalization of certain industries ( e.g. , the coal , electrical , and potash industries ) were introduced , but failed to become law .
The eight - hour day was enacted , and labor unions were given many legal immunities and privileges .
In fact , a system of labor councils was set up which authorized the workers in each enterprise to elect representatives who shared in the management of the company !
While government expenditures rose by leaps and bounds , the revenue suffered a gradual decline until , in October 1923 , only 0.8 percent of government expenses were covered by tax revenues .
For the period from 1914 to 1923 scarcely fifteen percent of the expenses were covered by means of taxes .
In the final phase of the inflation the German government experienced a complete atrophy of the fiscal system .
The depreciation of the currency brought about the destruction of taxable wealth in the form of mortgages , bonds , annuities , and pensions , which in turn reduced government revenue .
Some speculators reaped spectacular profits from the depreciation , but they easily evaded the tax collector .
Moreover , the fiscal policies of the socialist government were openly hostile toward capital and frequently endeavored to impose confiscatory capital levies upon all wealth .
Secretary of the Treasury Erzberger even vowed that " in the future Germany the rich should be no more . "
Consequently a massive " flight of capital " from Germany developed as all classes of savers invested their money in foreign bank accounts , currencies bills , securities , etc .
Much taxable wealth was removed from the grasp of tax collectors .
Finally , the rapid depreciation of currency greatly reduced all tax liabilities during the time interval between the taxable transaction and the date of tax payment .
The taxpayer usually paid a sum whose real value was greatly reduced by inflation .
Nevertheless , government expenditure accelerated while revenue in terms of real value continued to decline .
The growing deficits then were met with even larger quantities of printing press money , which in turn generated ever larger deficits .
The German monetary authorities , in fact , were trapped in a vicious circle from which they did not know how , nor have the courage , to extricate themselves .
The leading monetary authority , Dr. Helfferich , even warned his people against the dire consequences of monetary stabilization .
To follow the good counsel of stopping the printing of notes would mean refusing to economic life the circulating medium necessary for transactions , payments of salaries and wages , etc .
It would mean that in a very short time the entire public , and above all the Reich , could no longer pay merchants , employees , or workers .
In a few weeks , besides the printing of notes , factories , mines , railways , and post offices , national and local government , in short , all national and economic life would be stopped .
The Balance of Payments and the Treaty of Versailles
Throughout the period of the inflation the most popular explanation of the monetary depreciation laid the blame on an unfavorable balance of payments , which in turn was blamed on the payment of reparations and other burdens imposed by the Treaty of Versailles .
To most German writers and politicians , the government deficits and the paper inflation were not the causes but the consequences of the external depreciation of the mark .
The wide popularity of this explanation which charged the victorious allies with full responsibility for the German disaster bore ominous implications for the future .
Its simplicity made it appealing to the masses of economically ignorant people whose chauvinism and nationalism always make the idea of foreign intrigue and conspiracy so palatable .
The intellectual and political leaders who actively propagated the doctrine were sowing the seeds for the whirlwind they reaped a decade later .
During those baleful years , Germany actually procured gratuitously from abroad large quantities of raw materials and foodstuffs .
According to various authoritative estimates , foreign individuals and banks bought at least sixty billion paper marks which the Reichsbank had floated abroad at an average price of one - fourth gold mark for a paper mark .
The depreciation of the mark to one - trillionth of its earlier value repudiated these foreign claims to German goods .
Thus foreigners suffered losses of some fifteen billion gold marks , or some $ 3.5 billion US dollars , which was eight times more than Germany had paid in foreign exchange on account of reparations .
But even if it had been true that excessive burdens had been thrust on Germany by the Allies , there was no need for any monetary depreciation .
Both phenomena are entirely independent .
If excessive burdens are placed on a government , whether they be foreign or domestic , that government must raise taxes , or borrow some funds , or curtail other expenditures .
Excessive reparation payments may necessitate greatly higher taxes on the populace , or large loans that reduce the supply of savings for industry and commerce , or painful cuts in government service and employment .
The standards of living of the people thus burdened will probably be depressed — unless the reduction of bureaucracy should release new productive energy .
But the value of money is not affected by the reparation burden unless economic productivity is impaired by the fund - raising .
Once government has achieved the necessary budgetary surplus the payment of reparations is a simple matter of exchange .
The treasury buys the necessary gold or foreign exchange from its central bank and delivers it to the recipient government .
The loss of gold or foreign exchange then necessitates a corresponding reduction of central bank money , which in turn tends to depress goods prices .
Lower goods prices encourage more exports while they discourage imports , that is , generate what is commonly called a " favorable balance of payments " or new influx of gold and foreign exchange .
In short , there can be no shortage of gold or foreign exchange as long as the central bank refrains from inflation and monetary depreciation .
The German monetary authorities flatly denied this economic reasoning .
Instead , they preferred to lament about the excessive burdens thrust onto Germany and the unfavorable balance of payments generated thereby .
In 1923 they added yet another factor : the French occupation of the Ruhr district .
The Central Statistical Office put it this way :
The fundamental cause of the dislocation of the German monetary system is the disequilibrium of the balance of payments .
The disturbance of the national finances and the inflation are in their turn the consequences of the depreciation of the currency .
The depreciation of the currency upset the Budget balance , and determined with an inevitable necessity a divergence between income and expenditure , which provoked the upheaval .
Again I quote Dr. Helfferich :
Inflation and the collapse of the exchange are children of the same parent : the impossibility of paying the tributes imposed on us .
The problem of restoring the circulation is not a technical or banking problem ; it is , in the last analysis , the problem of the equilibrium between the burden and the capacity of the German economy for supporting this burden .
Even American economists echoed the German theory .
Professor Williams presented this causal order : " Reparation payments , depreciating exchanges , rising import and export prices , rising domestic prices , consequent budgeting deficits , and at the same time an increased demand for bank credit ; and finally increased note - issue . "
Professor Angell contended that " The reality of the type of analysis which runs from the balance of payments and the exchanges to general prices and the increased issue of paper seems to be definitely established . "
Speculators Did It
When all other explanations are exhausted , modern governments usually fall back on the speculator , who is held responsible for all economic and social evils .
What the witch was to medieval man , what the capitalist is to socialists and communists , the speculator is to most politicians and statesmen : the embodiment of evil .
He is said to be imbued with ruthless and fickle selfishness that is capable of wrecking the national economy , government plans , and , in the case of German inflation , the national currency .
No matter how blatantly contradictory this explanation may be , it is most popular with government authorities in search of a convenient explanation for the failure of their own policies .
The same German officials who denied the very existence of inflation lamented the depreciation caused by speculators , or they blamed the Allied reparation burdens and simultaneously denounced speculators for the depreciation .
Dr. Havenstein , the President of the Reichsbank , embracing every conceivable theory that exculpated his policies , also pointed at the speculators .
Before a parliamentary committee he testified : " On the 28th of March began the attack on the foreign exchange market .
In very numerous classes of the German economy , from that day onwards , thought was all for personal interests and not for the needs of the country . "
In a chorus the newspapers chanted the charge :
According to all appearances the fall of the mark did not have its origin in the New York exchange , from which it may be concluded that in Germany there was active speculation directed towards the continual rise of the dollar .
We are witnessing a rapid increase in the number of those who speculate on the fall of the mark and who are acquiring vested interests in a continual depreciation .
The enormous speculation on the rise of the American dollar is an open secret .
People who , having regard to their age , their inexperience , and their lack of responsibility , do not deserve support , have nevertheless secured the help of financiers , who are thinking exclusively of their own immediate interests .
Those who have studied seriously the conditions of the money market state that the movement against the German mark remained on the whole independent of foreign markets for more than six months .
It is the German bears , helped by the inaction of the Reichsbank , who have forced the collapse in the exchange .
In its broadest sense speculation is present in every economic action that makes provision for an uncertain future .
The student who studies aeronautical engineering speculates on the future demand for his services .
The businessman who enlarges his inventory speculates on a profitable market in the future .
The housewife who hoards sugar speculates on the availability of sugar in the future .
The buyer or seller of goods or securities hopes to make a profit from future changes in prices .
All such actions reflect a natural motivation of free men to improve their material well - being or , at least , to avert losses .
When speculators observe or anticipate more inflation and monetary depreciation they naturally endeavor to sell the depreciating currency and buy goods or foreign exchange that do not depreciate .
They are preserving their working capital .
Thus they are promoting not only their own interests but also those of society , which benefits from the preservation of productive capital .
The government that is actively destroying the currency is injuring the national interest — successful speculators are safeguarding it .
Surely the speculators who sold German marks and bought US dollars were proved to be right in the end .
The worldwide inflation that is engulfing the western world now springs from similar doctrines and theories .
There is no Treaty of Versailles and no reparation payments that can be blamed for the present inflation .
But in many countries of Central and Western Europe the responsibility for monetary depreciation is squarely laid on American balance - of - payments deficits that are flooding those countries with US dollars .
While European monetary authorities are actively inflating and depreciating their own currencies — although at slower rates than their American counterparts — they are pointing at the US balance of payments as the ultimate cause of their currency depreciation .
As in the German hyperinflation , foreign intrigue and artifice are said to be at work again .
American officials and politicians are quick to lay the blame for US difficulties on foreign intrigue , especially that of " the Arabs . "
Since the formation of the oil producers ' cartel and the significant boost in oil prices , US balance - of - payments deficits and the dollar weakness in foreign exchange markets are charged explicitly to the Arab countries .
Lest any suspicion should fall on the US monetary authorities , the American people themselves come in for some of the blame .
Their use of " excessive " quantities of foreign oil is said to contribute to the balance - of - payments deficits and the dollar weakness .
Therefore , our political leaders and economic authorities are debating the desirability of special taxes that would reduce the consumption of foreign oil .
After the Arab blow at economic well - being the US government is readying its blow for the sake of financial stability .
Again the speculators are charged for a share of the blame American investors who buy foreign securities or make direct foreign investments are said to be largely responsible for the outflow of US funds and the loss of gold , which is creating an unfavorable balance of payments and weakening the dollar .
Moreover , Americans who prefer foreign products over homemade products or choose to travel abroad rather than stay at home are decried as selfish and unpatriotic .
Numerous regulations imposed by the very monetary authorities who perpetrate the inflation aim to prevent speculation in order to save the dollar .
The specious argument that denies the presence of any inflation in terms of purchasing power or gold value has , in our judgment , not yet been raised .
But it must be expected to emerge in later phases of the inflation when our authorities will be desperate for any argument that promises to exculpate them .

The film 's stars joined Stiller at the premiere US groups that represent the disabled have protested at the premiere of Ben Stiller 's new film , Tropic Thunder .
Demonstrators who gathered outside the Mann Village Theatre , in Los Angeles , said the film " humiliates people with intellectual disabilities " .
Stars Stiller and Robert Downey
Jr shared the red carpet limelight with placard waving demonstrators .
Film company Dreamworks said there was no intention to " disparage or harm " people with disabilities .
Dignity Tim Shriver , chairman of disability group Special Olympics , said protestors were particularly offended by the use of the word " retard " regarding a character , Simple Jack , played by Stiller " We feel that the use of the word ' retard ' throughout the film , 15 or more times , is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know , almost hateful , and we want this to be the beginning of the end .
We want this to be the end of Hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes . "
When asked about the controversy , actor Robert Downey Jr said it was " open to interpretation , " but accepted people had a right to protest .
" That 's the great thing , you know , if I want to protest something because it offends me that 's my right as an American , and it's also any artist 's right to say and do whatever they want to do , " Downey said .
Tropic
Thunder follows a group of actors who end up fighting in a war Dreamworks spokesman Chip Sullivan said : " We have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future .
" However , no changes or cuts to the film will be made .
" Tropic Thunder is an R - rated comedy that satirizes Hollywood and its excesses , and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over - the top characters in ridiculous situations .
" The film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities . "
Tropic
Thunder is an action comedy which follows the group of prima donna actors filming a Vietnam War movie when their fed - up writer - director decides to dump them in the middle of a real war .
The film also features Downey Jr as a white actor who changes his skin colour to play a black soldier .
Jack Black , Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey also appear in the film .
The film , also directed by Stiller , has received mixed reviews from critics .
Variety 's Todd McCarthy praised Downey Jr's " startling " comic turns , but said the film 's antics were " pretty thin , redundant and one - note " .
David Ansen , in Newsweek , described it as " the funniest movie of the summer " .

President Ahmadinejad says Iran has the right to process uranium for fuel
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said Iran now possesses 6,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium - nearly twice the number of only a few months ago .
He has claimed the West has accepted the increase .
Iran is under UN sanctions , with the demand that it suspend the enrichment programme , which the West fears may be used for nuclear bombs
His announcement is likely to be met with a degree of scepticism by the outside world .
The Iranian president has often exaggerated the programme , as a deliberate challenge to the world powers who are trying to restrict Iran 's ability to enrich uranium .
This time he went further , claiming the West had agreed to allow Iran to have 5,000 to 6,000 centrifuges .
His comments come just as Iran is considering freezing the nuclear programme at current levels , in return for a freeze on new sanctions .
So perhaps Mr Ahmadinejad is trying to stake a claim to Iran 's right to the new higher figure , even if it agrees to a freeze .
Or perhaps it is just more of the tough rhetoric that he has revived , after a few weeks of relative silence on the nuclear issue .
For Immediate Release
Obama had chance stand for liberty , but did not
The Libertarian Party says that Republicans and Democrats have failed the American people by allowing telecommunication companies complicit in the Bush administration ’s illegal wiretap program to go without punishment .
“ Civil liberties were violated , and only 28 senators cared to see justice served , ” says Libertarian Party spokesperson Andrew Davis , “ and Barack Obama was not one of them . ”
The Libertarian Party has repeatedly called for the rejection of any amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that empowered the government to spy on American citizens and granted immunity to companies complicit in illegal surveillance operations .
“ Barack Obama , as well as a number of Republicans and Democrats , failed to stand for liberty when he could have , ” says Davis .
“ To say that Democrats are more adept at protecting American civil liberties is a lie .
Democrats are just as guilty , and have been nothing but a doormat to the Republican - lead assault on our Constitution .
The only party left that stands consistently on the side of freedom and the Constitution is the Libertarian Party . ”
‘ I challenge Sen . Obama to represent real change by standing for the people ’s liberties and against the administration ’s unlawful surveillance program , ’ Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr said yesterday .
‘ I call on Sen . Obama to oppose any measure that protects phone companies from liability for aiding illegal government spying .
Those who violate the Constitution and the law , whether politicians or businessmen , should be held accountable for their actions . ’
‘ When it comes to protecting the people ’s fundamental liberties , Senators John McCain and Barack Obama are Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum , ’ observed Barr .
‘ If Sen .
Obama will not confront the Bush administration over years of lawless conduct , why is he running for president ? ’
Barr is now polling at 6 percent nationwide , and anticipates more support from former Obama supporters who are unhappy with the Democratic presidential nominee ’s support of the FISA amendments .
The Libertarian Party is America ’s third largest political party , founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties .
You can find more information on the Libertarian Party by visiting www.LP.org .
The Libertarian Party proudly stands for smaller government , lower taxes and more freedom .

Unions - Skepsis gegenüber US - Kandidat Obama : Warum Merkel McCain will
Die Union fremdelt mit dem US - Präsidentschaftskandidaten Obama .
Denn wenn er die Wahl gewinnt , muss Kanzlerin Merkel ihre außenpolitischen Inszenierungen ändern .
Die Kanzlerin sitzt selten in der Bundesporessekonferenz , in diesem Jahr erst zum zweiten Mal .
Nun soll sie dort die achte Frage zum Besuch Barack Obamas in Berlin beantworten .
Warum wollte sie partout nicht , dass Obama vor dem Brandenburger Tor redet ?
Dieser
Ort , sagt sie , " ist Präsidenten vorbehalten .
Das können
Sie ja altmodisch finden .
Aber das ist meine Meinung .
Und die kann ich ja " , so Merkel verschmitzt , " in einem freien Land auch sagen . "
Merkel hatte die Frage , wo Obama reden darf , eigenhändig zur Staatsaffäre gemacht .
Brandenburger
Tor - ja oder nein wurde zu einer Glaubensfrage , zu einem zwischen Union und SPD mit bitterem Ernst umkämpften Symbol .
Dass Merkel sich nun auf das Recht der freien Meinungsäußerung beruft , ist mehr als understatement .
Obama hätte sich am Brandenburger Tor in der Tradition von Reagan inszenieren können .
Das wollte die Unionschefin nicht .
Die Union fremdelt mit Obama .
Warum eigentlich ?
Die hilflosen Versuche der SPD , die sich selbst in den Mehrzweckhallen der Republik " Yes we can " zuruft , dürften die Union nicht beunruhigen .
Was dann ?
Der CDU - Außenpolitiker Ruprecht Polenz gibt zu : " Traditionell hat die Union etwas engere Beziehungen zu den Republikanern " .
Aktuell gibt es noch mehr Gründe , warum die Merkel McCain lieber wäre .
Seit sich Bush und Schröder 2003 über dem Irakkrieg entzweiten , hat sich die Union unermüdlich als einzig wahrer deutscher US - Freund zu inszenieren versucht .
Merkel war , in Abgrenzung zu Schröder , kritisch gegenüber Russland und China - beim transatlantischen Verhältnis gelang es ihr , trotz George W. Bush , US - Nähe herzustellen .
Merkels vielfach als glänzend empfundene internationale Auftritte verdanken sich auch dieser spezifischen Konstellation .
Sie war es , die in Washington von Bush als treue Verbündete geschätzt wurde - und die ihm doch , als Menschenrechtlerin , ein paar kritische Worte zu Guatanamao sagte .
Wenn Obama gewinnt , muss Merkel ihren außenpolitischen Inszenierungsstil kräftig überarbeiten .
Die Rolle als Getreue , die Schröders Verrat beim Irakkkrieg nicht mitmachte , ist dann ausgespielt .
Obama war selbst gegen den Irakkrieg .
2009 wird hierzulande gewählt .
Die Wirtschaftsdaten sind mies - das kann Merkels Popularität schaden .
Wenn dann noch ihr bislang strahlender Ruf als Außenpolitikerin leidet und mit Obama ein neuer Star die Bühne betritt , kann es eng werden .
Bei Mc Cain hingegen , der in vielem Bushs Politik fortsetzen wird , kann Merkel ihre erprobte Rolle weiterspielen .
Vor den Journalisten antwortet Merkel auf Fragen zu Obama und McCain knapp .
" Schwungvoll " findet sie den Senator aus Illinois .
Bei der Frage , ob ihr Mc Cain oder Obama lieber wäre , wird sie sehr staatstragend .
In der Außenpolitik gebe es ja " immer eine hohes Maß an Kontinutität . "
Das stimmt im Generellen - für Merkel im Besonderen nicht .
What makes a great team ?
Henry Ford once said , “ Coming together is a beginning .
Keeping together is progress .
Working together is success . ”
That quote got me to thinking about the 21st Century version of a small business team .
Usually , we think of a work team as involving employees .
However , today ’s small business teams are likely to consist of a business owner working together with a group of freelancers and independent contractors , instead of employees .
The people in such a team are working at a distance , from their own offices .
They may be across town , across the country or across the globe .
This makes communication challenging .
They may work together on certain activities , but typically each is pulled in different directions on any given day .
Remember that each freelancer or contractor has his or her own business and other customers to contend with .
And when you are paying someone by the hour or paying a retainer for a set menu of duties each week or month , the business owner may hesitate to include the contractors in conference calls , email distributions , or meetings out of respect for the contractor ’s time .
After all , time is money for most freelancers and independents .
We small business people understand that .
How do you develop this kind of “ virtual small business team ” ?
I searched websites , article directories , and blogs .
I can find information on hiring freelancers or subcontractors .
What I find very little written about is how to make freelancers and contractors feel part of the team — or about communicating and working cohesively together when you are a group of contractors .
Yet — should n’t contractors and freelancers be part of the team ?
I looked around for advice on how to build a traditional team .
Perhaps these resources offer some clues :
Reward teamwork behaviors —
Perhaps we should be offering bonuses for team results .
Tonya Vinas recommends rewarding teamwork behaviors with money , in Small Business Team Building :
If building a team around results — units produced , cost reductions , meeting deadlines — include a monetary reward tied to the results .
Money is a great motivator .
Offer bonuses , compensation or other rewards for a great team performance .
Have clear goals —
Do we as business owners have a clearly defined mission and set of goals for the team ?
Susan Heathfield writes in 12 C’s to a successful team :
Has the team taken its assigned area of responsibility and designed its own mission , vision and strategies to accomplish the mission .
Has the team defined and communicated its goals ; its anticipated outcomes and contributions ; its timelines ; and how it will measure both the outcomes of its work and the process the team followed to accomplish their task ?
Does the leadership team or other coordinating group support what the team has designed ?
Treat it as a self - directed team —
Since everyone is an independent contractor in the team , should n’t we be considering this a “ self - directed team ” ?
Jeanne Dininni points out that this is a different style of work performance from a traditional team , in her Guide to Self - Directed Work Teams :
Prepare your staff for self - directed team membership with some training of their own .
Training your managers is n’t enough .
You ’ll also need to see that the team members , themselves , are thoroughly trained , developed and prepped for the exciting , though serious , responsibilities ahead .
Effective training will equip them to be productive members of the team .
Also helpful is an article by David Chaudron , Ph.D. entitled Nailing Jelly to a Tree : approaches to self - directed work teams .
Just the title itself should let you know Dr. Chaudron ’s feelings on the success rate of self - directed teams .
However , I think he is just saying that if you just state “ Pow — you are now a self - directed team ” and then walk away , that you ca n’t expect the participants to be successful .
It sounds like a fine line .
For those of us trying to build a team with freelancers and independent contractors , how do you do that ?
Share your practical tips for building a sense a teamwork among a loosely - tied group of contractors .
Giant 3,300 Lbs Stingray Caught by Local Fisherman
Early in the morning around 2:00 am a fishing boat near Hainan Sanya in China caught what is likely to be one of the largest stingrays ever caught .
Casting nets , the fishermen caught a 3,300 lbs Stingray , which took about 3 hours to pull back into the boat .
The net was strong enough to hold the huge fish , but the struggle cause the stingray to die .
The stingray measured about 16 1 /2 foot in width .
The fishermen tied the stingray to the back of the boat and dragged it back to their dock .
It remained in perfect condition even though it was dead for many hours .
The fisherman was able to sell the stingray for around $ 1,500 since they have a high commercial value .
Stingray ’s liver can be made into fish oil , the bones and intestines are used in medical fish powder , and the meat is a delicacy in most restaurants .

McCain rejects his own admissions , denies ignorance on the economy
Earlier this year , in a nationally televised debate , Tim Russert confronted John McCain with some of his inconvenient admissions : “ You have said repeatedly , ‘ I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues . ' ”
McCain was incredulous and dismissive , “ Actually , I do n’t know where you got that quote from . ”
Soon after , McCain appeared on “ Meet the Press , ” and Russert returned to the subject and responded to McCain ’s slight — “ I got [ the quote ] from John McCain ” — and highlighted McCain ’s record of admissions about economic ignorance .
“ OK , ” McCain said , no longer able to deny reality , “ Let me tell you what I was trying to say and what I meant . ”
This morning , in a disconcerting example of dishonesty , McCain went back to pretending his quote collection does n’t exist .
For those who ca n’t watch clips online , ABC ’s Robin Roberts prefaced a question about economics , telling McCain , “ You have admitted that you ’re not exactly an expert when it comes to the economy and many have said … ”
At that point , McCain interrupted : “ I have not .
I have not .
Actually , I have not .
I said that I am stronger on national security issues because of all the time I spent in the military .
I ’m very strong on the economy .
I understand it . ”
I know it ’s best to be cautious about throwing around words like “ lie , ” but McCain has been confronted with his own remarks on multiple occasions .
He knows what he ’s admitted , and has been asked to explain his comments .
What Roberts said was obviously and demonstrably true — McCain has admitted that he ’s “ not exactly an expert when it comes to the economy . ”
Why would McCain appear on national television and say something he knows to be false ?
Given his emphasis , especially lately , on honesty in the campaign , why take the risk by lying like this ?
Not only does it bring McCain ’s character into question when he makes obviously false claims , but it merely serves as another opportunity to remind folks about McCain ’s own admissions :
* Seeking to explain his shift to the left on economic issues , McCain claimed : “ I did n’t pay nearly the attention to those issues in the past .
I was probably a ‘ supply - sider ’ based on the fact that I really did n’t jump into the issue . ” [ Jan. 2000 ] * “ I ’m going to be honest : I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues .
I still need to be educated . ” [ Nov. 2005 ] * “ The issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should , ” but “ I ’ve got Greenspan ’s book . ” [ Dec. 2007 ]
Even one of his top campaign advisors has admitted that McCain has made these comments .
Why deny what is plainly true ?
What ’s more , in addition to the lie about his rhetorical record , it ’s worth noting that McCain ’s admissions happen to be accurate .
He ’s demonstrated over and over again that when it comes to economics , McCain is painfully confused .
McCain told an audience earlier this year , “ Every time in history we have raised taxes it has cut revenues . ”
As a matter of reality , McCain was talking gibberish .
A few days prior , at a Republican debate , McCain said , “ I do n’t believe we ’re headed into a recession .
I believe the fundamentals of this economy are strong and I believe they will remain strong . ”
He then reversed course , said the fundamentals of the economy are n’t strong , and inexplicably blamed government spending for creating an economic decline that he did n’t believe existed
He also recently told a national television audience that he ’s “ glad ” when interest rates fall , and “ wishes interest rates were zero , ” which really does n’t make any sense .
Since then , McCain has badly flubbed economic tests on energy , the deficit , poverty , and Social Security .
Look , I realize this must be embarrassing for McCain .
He ’s admitted to not understanding economics , and then went about proving how right he is .
But that ’s no reason for McCain to go on “ Good Morning America ” and lie about what he ’s said .
It ’s all right for a candidate to spin his or her record , but bogus denials are likely to cause a campaign trouble .
The Telegraph is reporting Sharp US money supply contraction points to Wall Street crunch ahead .
The US money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history , heightening the risk of a Wall Street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months .
Data compiled by Lombard Street Research shows that the M3 ' ' broad money " aggregates fell by almost $ 50 bn ( £ 26.8 bn ) in July , the biggest one - month fall since modern records began in 1959 .
" Monthly data for July show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed , " said Gabriel Stein , the group 's leading monetary economist .
On a three - month basis , the M3 growth rate has fallen from almost 19 pc earlier this year to just 2.1 pc ( annualised ) for the period from May to July .
This is below the rate of inflation , implying a shrinkage in real terms .
The growth in bank loans has turned negative to a halt since March .
" It 's obviously worrying .
People either can't borrow , or do n't want to borrow even if they can , " said Mr Stein .
My Comment :
What would be more worrying would be if banks kept lending in a world where asset prices are plunging .
Those with good credit do not want to borrow and those with bad credit can't borrow .
This is actually a good development .
Banks need to raise capital , as opposed to lending recklessly in a word of overcapacity in nearly everything .
Monetarists say it is the sharpness of the drop that is most disturbing , rather than the absolute level .
Moves of this speed are extremely rare .
My Comment
should not
The overall debt burden in the US economy is currently at record levels , raising concerns that a recession - if it occurs - could set off a sharp downward spiral .
My Comment
Monetarists insist that shifts in M3 are a lead indicator of asset prices moves , typically six months or so ahead .
If so , the latest collapse points to a grim autumn for Wall Street and for the American property market .
As a rule of thumb , the data gives a one - year advance signal on economic growth , and a two - year signal on future inflation .
My Comment
M3 surged after the onset of the credit crunch , but this was chiefly a distortion caused by the near total paralysis in parts of the American commercial paper market .
Borrowers were forced to take out bank loans instead .
The commercial paper market has yet to recover .
My Comment
People are failing to take into consideration why M3 is soaring .
And right now the why is extremely important .
The answer is businesses are tapping credit lines for fear they cannot tap them later .
They are parking that money in institutional money market accounts and in response M3 and MZM have been soaring .
These certainly are not inflationary conditions .

Scrotum Self - Repair 1991 At - Risk Survivor
Confirmed True by Darwin
After I asked the nurse to leave us , the patient permitted me to remove his trousers , shorts , and two or three yards of foul - smelling , stained gauze wrapped about his scrotum , which was swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit and extremely tender .
A jagged zig - zag laceration , oozing pus and blood , extended down the left scrotum .
Amid the matted hair , edematous skin , and various exudates , I saw some half - buried dark linear objects and asked the patient what they were .
Several days earlier , he replied , he had injured himself in the machine shop where he worked , and had closed the laceration himself with a heavy - duty stapling gun .
The dark objects were one - inch staples of the type used in putting up wallboard .
We x-rayed the patients scrotum to locate the staples ; admitting him to the hospital ; and gave him tetanus antitoxin , a broad - spectrum antibacterial therapy , and hexachlorophene sitz baths prior to surgery the next morning .
The procedure consisted of exploration and debridement of the left side of the scrotal pouch .
Eight rusty staples were retrieved , and the skin edges were trimmed and freshened .
The left testis had been avulsed and was missing .
The stump of the spermatic cord was recovered at the inguinal canal , debrided , and the vessels ligated properly , though not much of a hematoma was present .
Through - and through Penrose drains were sutured loosely in site , and the skin was loosely closed .
Convalescence was uneventful , and before his release from the hospital less then a week later , the patient confided the rest of his story to me .
An unmarried loner , he usually did n't leave the machine shop at lunchtime with his co-workers .
Finding himself alone , he had begun the regular practice of masturbating by holding his penis against the canvas drive - belt of a large floor - based piece of running machinery .
One day , as he approached orgasm , he lost his concentration and leaned too close to the belt .
When his scrotum suddenly became caught between the pulley - wheel and the drive - belt , he was thrown into the air and landed a few feet away .
Unaware that he had lost his left testis , and perhaps too stunned to feel much pain , he stapled the wound closed and resumed work .
I can only assume he abandoned this method of self - gratification .

and the " Green Games , " but they could be more aptly described as the
Commercial Games .
professed ideals of the Olympic Games , and subverting the Olympics '
veneration of sport with omnipresent commercial messaging and branding .
Commercialism is overrunning the Olympics .
It is undermining theprofessed ideals of the Olympic Games , and subverting the Olympics ' veneration of sport with omnipresent commercial messaging and branding .
The Olympics have auctioned off virtually every aspect of the Games to
the highest bidder .
In addition to multimillion - dollar sponsorship
deals between the International Olympic Committee and international
companies , smaller firms are paying for designations from " official
home and industrial flooring supplier " to the " frozen dumplings
exclusive supplier " of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games .
Corporate sponsors are showering money on each tier of the Olympic
organizational committees : the International Olympic Committee , the
Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games ( BOCOG ) and the
International Federations governing each individual sport , to each
country 's National Organizing Committees .
Corporations are sponsoring
many Olympic teams and national governing bodies for particular sports
-- including virtually every national governing body in the United
States -- and individual athletes themselves .
The scope of commercialism at the Olympics and the consequences of commercialization are detailed in " The Commercial Games , " a new report from Multinational Monitor magazine and Commercial Alert ( both of which I 'm associated with ) .
To its credit , the Olympics do prohibit advertising in sports stadia or
other venues .
The Olympics also prohibit advertisements on uniforms
( other than uniform maker logos ) .
Everywhere else , Olympic spectators , viewers and athletes , and the
citizens of Beijing should expect to be overwhelmed with
Olympics - related advertising .
A record 63 companies have become sponsors or partners of the Beijing
Olympics , and Olympics - related advertising in China alone could reach
$ 4 billion to $ 6 billion this year , according to CSM , a Beijing
marketing research firm .
The Olympic Partners ( TOP ) program ,
run and managed by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) since
1985 , includes 12 companies for the Beijing Olympics .
These 12
companies -- among them , Coca - Cola , GE , Johnson & Johnson , Lenovo ,
Panasonic and Visa -- have paid $ 866 million to the International
Olympic Committee .
The U.S. Olympic system is awash in corporate sponsor money .
Well over
100 corporations are sponsoring the U.S. Olympic Committee or U.S .
national teams .
Besides celebrating sport , there is an official ideology of the Olympics , called " Olympism . "
It aims to promote a pure blend of sport , culture and education .
Sports , of course , remain at the center of the Olympics , but
commercialism has overwhelmed whatever other values the Olympics hope
to embody .
The overwhelming cultural influence at the Olympics is now
commercial culture ; and the overwhelming informational message is : buy ,
buy , buy .
Commercial relations interfere with proper functioning of the Olympics .
In at least one notable case , commercial entanglements have called into
question the integrity of a national sports governing body .
A lawsuit
and accusations around the activities of USA Swimming and the national
team coach -- both sponsored by swimwear maker Speedo -- charge Speedo ,
the national team and the coach with antitrust violations .
The lawsuit ,
filed by Tyr , a Speedo competitor , alleges the coach has trumpeted the
benefits of LZR Racer , a new , high - profile Speedo suit , because of his
financial ties to the company .
Tyr says its Tracer Rise swimsuit ,
introduced weeks before the LZR Racer , is comparable to the Speedo
product .
The Olympic race for corporate sponsors has also put the Olympics in unhealthy -- and sometimes quite unpleasant -- company .
+ The International Olympic Committee will not partner with hard liquor
companies , but the IOC tolerates sponsorships by beer and wine
companies .
Anheuser - Busch says it is a sponsor of 25 national Olympic
Committees , including those of China , Japan , Great Britain and the
United States .
A tequila maker , Jose Cuervo , is a sponsor of the U.S .
Soccer Federation .
+ Notwithstanding the fundamental principles of " Olympism , " which
celebrate healthful living , two of the 12 Olympic TOP sponsors run
businesses centered around the sales of unhealthy food : Coca - Cola and
McDonald's .
Snickers , the candy bar made by Mars , is an official BOCOG
supplier .
Hershey 's is a sponsor of the USOC .
Coca - Cola is a sponsor of
FIFA , the international soccer federation .
McDonald 's and Sprite are
sponsors of USA Basketball .
McDonald 's and Sierra Mist are sponsors of
the U.S. Soccer Federation .
Coca -Cola is a sponsor of USA Softball .
Hershey 's is a sponsor of USA Track & Field .
+ Many of the sports apparel and equipment makers partnered with the Olympics and official Olympic bodies -- among them Adidas , Nike and Speedo -- source their products from sweatshop factories .
In a very disturbing development just before the start of the Olympics , Adidas reportedly announced it was transferring large amounts of its production out of China because wages set by the government were " too high " (! ) .
+ At least two major Olympic partners , the China National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) and Sinopec , have been linked to gross human rights violations in Sudan .
Both companies are sponsors of the Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games .
There is no doubt that the horse is out of the barn on Olympic
sponsorships , and the world is unlikely to see a commercial - free Games
anytime soon .
Nonetheless , the most egregious problems with the Olympics ' pervasive sponsorship arrangements can and should be addressed .
The IOC , National Olympic Committees , and international and national
sports governing bodies can and should scale back the number of
corporate sponsorships .
They can and should develop safeguards to ensure apparel and equipment
sponsorships do not compromise sports governing bodies ' decisions .
Coaches of national teams should be prohibited from serving as paid
spokespeople or consultants for apparel and equipment makers .
They can and should refuse to accept sponsorships from any alcohol
company , including beer and wine companies .
This recommendation does
not reflect a prohibitionist impulse .
It merely extends the insight in
the present IOC ban on hard liquor sponsorships : promoting more alcohol
consumption is unhealthful , and inappropriate for an event with
enormous appeal to children .
They can and should end partnerships and sponsorship arrangements with
junk food , soda and fast food companies .
These companies ' operations
are incompatible with Olympic ideals of promoting fitness and healthful
living , and the companies use the association with the Olympics to
remove some of the tarnish of their unhealthy products .
They can and should insist that official , sponsoring apparel and
equipment makers disclose where their products are manufactured , and
ensure that their products are manufactured in a fashion that respects
core labor standards .
They can and should refuse to enter into sponsorship arrangements with
companies connected to gross human rights abuses .
This is a simple
ethical standard , and one required by the Olympic commitment to
demonstrate " respect for universal fundamental ethical principles . "
Will the IOC and other committees move in these directions ?
They
refused to respond to repeated requests for comment .
It may be ,
however , that it will be the corporate sector driving reduced
commercialization of the Olympics .
The opportunity to project a
high - profile in China 's fast - growing market has made the Beijing
Olympics uniquely attractive ; but already leading sponsors
have indicated they do not intend to continue paying for the right to
besiege the planet with Olympics - related marketing in connection with
future Games .

Johannesburg , South Africa
After losing power in 1994 , South Africa 's white right - wingers withdrew into psychic exile , leaving the chattering classes to pursue a political agenda so correct that it sometimes verged on insanity .
Newspapers were soon filled with great billows of soft - left pabulum .
Talk show hosts routinely used appalling terms like " gendered " or " Othering , " and almost everyone observed an unwritten law stating that it was unfair to criticize black people on the grounds that any failings they might exhibit were attributable to poverty , oppression and bad education , otherwise known as " the legacy of apartheid . "
In time , I came to feel as if I were suffocating in a fog of high - minded pieties , a condition that often reduced me to cursing and throwing things at the TV set .
In the course of one such episode a few years ago , I switched channels and came upon a demented comedy sketch in which a gunman was tutoring a class of black schoolchildren in the finer points of armed robbery .
" You got to have an inside source to tell you where the money is , " yelled the gunman , " and when you get caught -- I just love this bit -- when you get caught , blame it on the legacy of apartheid .
OK !
So what have you learned today ? "
The children chorus , " Blame it on the legacy of apartheid ! "
If you 're not South African , you 'll probably never understand how dumbfounding this was , but let 's give it a try .
What do you do , if you 're young , gifted and African , when the Economist describes your home as " The Hopeless Continent " ?
Contest this assessment and you sound like a silly white liberal , which is anathema to a cool dude like comedian David Kibuuka .
" The way the foreigners see Africa is sort of the way it is , " he says .
" Wars , people dying of diseases that were cured long ago and so on . "
But acknowledging such truths is dangerous , too , because some brothers are always going to accuse you of being a self - loathing sellout , and that 's enough to keep most Africans quiet .
Not so for a group of young , black comedians who have taken South Africa by storm .
Their attitude , says 30 - year - old comic Kagiso Lediga , is , " Get lost if you can't take a joke .
Our job is to talk about things that are wrong , and we 'll keep doing it unless you kill us . "

Embarrassing moments are over with new anti-shyness drug
If you turn an embarrassing shade of crimson every time the spotlight is on you , things could be about to change as scientists say they have discovered a wonder drug to combat shyness .
The natural hormone , oxytocin , which is produced by the body during childbirth and sex has been found to reduce anxiety and relieve phobia .
After trials of the hormone , scientists are now determined to develop it into a commercial success , in the form of a nasal spray .
It is believed the ‘ wonder drug ’ could help a range of disorders including autism , depression and anxiety .
Oxytocin is produced naturally in the brain during social interaction , increasing romantic feelings and helping mothers bond with their babies .
Paul Zak , a professor of neuroscience at California ’s Claremont Graduate University said : ‘ Tests have shown that oxytocin reduces anxiety levels in users .
It is a hormone that facilitates social contact between people .
‘ What ’s more , it is a very safe product that does not have any side effects and is not addictive . ’
Apr99 : Regular Expressions
Brian and Rob are researchers at Lucent Technologies 's Bell Labs and can be contacted at [ email protected ] and [ email protected ] , respectively .
The right programming language can make all the difference in how easy it is to write a program .
This is why a programmer 's arsenal holds not only general - purpose languages like C and its relatives , but also programmable shells , scripting languages , and lots of application - specific languages .
The power of good notation reaches beyond traditional programming into specialized problem domains .
HTML lets us create interactive documents , often using embedded programs in other languages such as JavaScript .
PostScript expresses an entire document as a specialized program .
Spreadsheets and word processors often include languages to evaluate expressions , access information , and control layout .
Regular expressions are one of the most broadly applicable specialized languages , a compact and expressive notation for describing patterns of text .
Regular expressions are algorithmically interesting , easy to implement in their simpler forms , and very useful .
Regular expressions come in several flavors .
The so - called " wildcards " used in command - line processors or shells to match patterns of file names are a particularly simple example .
Typically , " * " is taken to mean " any string of characters , " so a command like
del *.exe
uses a pattern " *. exe " that matches all files with names that contain any string followed by the literal string " .exe " .
Regular expressions pervade UNIX , in editors , tools like grep , and scripting languages like Awk , Perl , and Tcl .
Although the variations among different programs may suggest that regular expressions are an ad hoc mechanism , they are , in fact , a language in a strong technical sense -- a formal grammar specifies their structure and a precise meaning can be attached to each utterance in the language .
Furthermore , the right implementation can run very fast ; a combination of theory and engineering practice pays off handsomely .
The Language of Regular Expressions
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a pattern .
Most characters in the pattern simply match themselves in a target string , so the regular expression " abc " matches that sequence of three letters wherever it occurs in the target .
A few characters are used in patterns as metacharacters to indicate repetition , grouping , or positioning .
In POSIX regular expressions , " ^ " stands for the beginning of a string and " $ " for the end , so " ^x " matches an " x " only at the beginning of a string , " x $ " matches an " x " only at the end , " ^x $ " matches " x " only if it is the sole character of the string , and " ^ $ " matches the empty string .
The character " . " ( a period ) matches any character , so " x.y " matches " xay , " " x2y , " and so on , but not " xy " or " xyxy . "
The regular expression " ^. $ " matches a string that contains any single character .
A set of characters inside brackets " [ ] " matches any single one of the enclosed characters ; for example , " [ 0123456789 ] " matches a single digit .
This pattern may be abbreviated " [ 0 - 9 ] . "
These building blocks are combined with parentheses for grouping , " | " for alternatives , " * " for zero or more occurrences , " + " for one or more occurrences , and " ? " for zero or one occurrences .
Finally , " \ " is used as a prefix to quote a metacharacter and turn off its special meaning .
These can be combined into remarkably rich patterns .
For example , " \. [ 0 - 9 ] + " matches a period followed by one or more digits ; " [ 0 - 9 ] +\.? [ 0 - 9 ] * " matches one or more digits followed by an optional period and zero or more further digits ; " ( \+ | - ) " matches a plus or a minus ( " \+ " is a literal plus sign ) ; and " [ eE ] ( \+|-) ?[ 0 - 9 ] + " matches an " e " or " E " followed by an optional sign and one or more digits .
These are combined in the following pattern that matches floating - point numbers :
( \+|-) ? ( [ 0 - 9 ] +\.? [ 0 - 9 ] *|\. [ 0 - 9 ] + ) ( [ eE ] ( \+ |-) ? [ 0 - 9 ] + ) ?
A Regular Expression Search Function
Some systems include a regular expression library , usually called " regex " or " regexp . "
However , if this is not available , it 's easy to implement a modest subset of the full regular expression language .
The regular expressions we present here make use of four metacharacters : " ^ , " " $ , " " . , " and " * , " with " * " specifying zero or more occurrences of the preceding period or literal character .
This provides a large fraction of the power of general regular expressions with a tiny fraction of the implementation complexity .
We 'll use these functions to implement a small but eminently useful version of grep ( available electronically ; see " Resource Center , " page 5 ) .
In Example 1 , the function match determines whether a string matches a regular expression .
If the regular expression begins with " ^ " the text must begin with a match of the remainder of the expression .
Otherwise , we walk along the text , using matchhere to see if the text matches at each position in turn .
As soon as we find a match , we 're done .
Expressions that contain " * " can match the empty string ( for example , " .*y " matches " y " among many other things ) , so we must call matchhere even if the text is empty .
In Example 2 , the recursive function matchhere does most of the work .
If the regular expression is empty , we have reached the end and thus have found a match .
If the regular expression ends with " $ , " it matches only if the text is also at the end .
If the regular expression begins with a period , it matches any character .
Otherwise , the expression begins with a plain character that matches itself in the text .
A " ^ " or " $ " that appears in the middle of a regular expression is thus taken as a literal character , not a metacharacter .
Notice that matchhere calls itself after matching one character of pattern and string .
Thus the depth of recursion can be as much as the length of the pattern .
The one tricky case occurs when the expression begins with a starred character , " x * , " for example .
Then we call matchstar with three arguments -- the operand of the star ( x ) , the pattern after the star , and the text ; see Example 3 .
Again , a starred regular expression can match zero characters .
The loop checks whether the text matches the remaining expression , trying at each position of the text as long as the first character matches the operand of the star .
Our implementation is admittedly unsophisticated , but it works .
And , at fewer than 30 lines of code , it shows that regular expressions do n't need advanced techniques to be put to use .
Grep
The pattern - matching program grep , invented by Ken Thompson ( the father of UNIX ) , is a marvelous example of the value of notation .
It applies a regular expression to each line of its input files and prints those lines that contain matching strings .
This simple specification , plus the power of regular expressions , lets it solve many day - to - day tasks .
In the following examples , note that the regular expression used as the argument to grep is different from the wildcard pattern used to specify file names .
Search for a name in a set of source files : grep fprintf * .c
. c Search for a phrase in a set of text files : grep ' regular expression ' *. txt
Filter output from some other program , for example to print all error messages : gcc *.c | grep Error :
Filter input to some other program , for example to count non-blank lines : grep .
*.cpp | wordcount
With flags to print line numbers of matched lines , count matches , do case - insensitive matching , select lines that do n't match the pattern , and other variations of the basic idea , grep is so widely used that it has become the classic example of tool - based programming .
Example 4 is the main routine of an implementation of grep that uses match .
It is conventional that UNIX programs return 0 for success and nonzero values for various failures .
Our grep , like the UNIX version , defines success as finding a matching line , so it returns 0 if there were any matches , 1 if there were none , and 2 if an error occurred .
These status values can be tested by other programs like a shell .
As Example 5 illustrates , the function grep scans a single file , calling match on each line .
This is mostly straightforward , but there are a couple of subtleties .
First , the main routine does n't quit if it fails to open a file .
This is because it 's common to say something like
% grep herpolhode *.*
and find that one of the files in the directory can't be read .
It 's better for grep to keep going after reporting the problem , rather than to give up and force users to type the file list manually to avoid the problem file .
Second , grep prints the matching line and the file name , but suppresses the file name if it is reading standard input or a single file .
This may seem an odd design , but it reflects a style of use based on experience .
When given only one input , grep 's task is usually selection , and the file name would clutter the output .
But if it is asked to search through many files , the task is most often to find all occurrences of something , and the file names are helpful .
Compare
% strings enormous.dll | grep Error :
with
% grep grammer *. txt
Our implementation of match returns as soon as it finds a match .
For grep , that is a fine default .
But , for implementing a substitution ( search - and - replace ) operator in a text editor , the leftmost longest match is more useful .
For example , given the text " aaaaa , " the pattern " a* " matches the null string at the beginning of the text , but the user probably intended to match all five characters .
To cause match to find the leftmost longest string , matchstar must be rewritten to be greedy :
Rather than looking at each character of the text from left to right , it should skip over the longest string that matches the starred operand , then back up if the rest of the string does n't match the rest of the pattern .
In other words , it should run from right to left .
Example 6 is a version of matchstar that does leftmost longest matching .
This might be the wrong version of matchstar for grep , because it does extra work ; but for a substitution operator , it is essential .
What Next ?
Our grep is competitive with system - supplied versions , regardless of the regular expression .
For example , it takes about six seconds to search a 40 - MB text file on a 400 - MHz Pentium ( compiled with Visual C++ ) .
Pathological expressions can cause exponential behavior , such as " a* a * a * a * a * b " when given the input " aaaaaaaaac , " but the exponential behavior exists in many commercial implementations , too .
A more sophisticated matching algorithm can guarantee linear performance by avoiding backtracking when a partial match fails ; the UNIX egrep program implements such an algorithm , as do scripting languages .
Full regular expressions would include character classes like " [ a - zA - Z ] " to match a single alphabetic character ; the ability to quote a metacharacter ( for example , to search for a literal period ) ; parentheses like " ( abc ) * " for grouping ; and alternatives , where " abc|def " matches " abc " or " def . "
The first step is to help match by compiling the pattern into a representation that is easier to scan .
It is expensive to parse a character class every time we compare it against a character ; a precomputed representation based on bit vectors could make character classes much more efficient .
For regular expressions with parentheses and alternatives , the implementation must be more sophisticated .
One approach is to compile the regular expression into a parse tree that captures its grammatical structure .
This tree is then traversed to create a state machine -- a table of states , each of which gives the next state for each possible input character .
The string is scanned by the state machine , which reports when it reaches a state corresponding to a match of the pattern .
Another approach is similar to what is done in just - in - time compilers :
The regular expression is compiled into instructions that will scan the string ; the state machine is implicit in the generated instructions .

DDJ
In 2004 , David Pritchard applied a dressing to his arm that was crawling with pin-size hookworm larvae , like maggots on the surface of meat .
He left the wrap on for several days to make sure that the squirming freeloaders would infiltrate his system .
“ The itch when they cross through your skin is indescribable , ” he said .
“ My wife was a bit nervous about the whole thing . ”
Dr. Pritchard , an immunologist - biologist at the University of Nottingham , is no masochist .
His self - infection was in the interest of science .
While carrying out field work in Papua New Guinea in the late 1980s , he noticed that Papuans infected with the Necator americanus hookworm , a parasite that lives in the human gut , did not suffer much from an assortment of autoimmune - related illnesses , including hay fever and asthma .
Over the years , Dr. Pritchard has developed a theory to explain the phenomenon .
Why does he make me feel this way ?
What was going through my mother ’s head when said such hurtful things to me ?
Ca n’t my boss tell that his words cut me down and make me feel so small ?
These are examples of our thinking sometimes when we feel hurt , ashamed , or angry – that the other person or some external event is making us feel the way we do .
But is it ?
Can someone else make us feel a certain way ?
Can an event in our life directly cause us to feel a specific way ?
Michael Edelstein , in his book Three Minute Therapy , argues the line of cognitive - behaviorists and rational emotive therapists have argued for decades .
External events and people cannot make us feel any one certain way , even though it often seems that way .
We enter into every situation with certain beliefs or expectations .
Those beliefs and expectations directly influence the way we are going to end up feeling about the event or person .
Here ’s an example Dr. Edelstein provides from Chapter 1 of his book : Suppose a hundred airplane passengers are unexpectedly given parachutes and instructed to jump from the plane .
If a physical situation alone could cause emotions , then all the hundred people would feel the same way .
But obviously those who regard skydiving positively are going to have a [ reaction ] very different from the others .
In other words , our beliefs and expectations about a person or event or situation directly influence and , many would argue , cause our feelings .
They are not the result of or inherent in of the situation itself .
Others do not cause our feelings — we cause them ourselves .
This turns out to be great news , because that means that we have control of our feelings , much like we have control over other choices we make in our life .
That also means that psychotherapy that focuses on helping a person overcome their belief system that ’s causing them so much pain or distress in their lives is short - term and more solution - focused .
Your feelings come from your thinking .
This does n’t mean that if you tell yourself everything is fine and you have no problems , then you will feel fine and your problems will disappear .
[ Rational emotive and cognitive behavioral methods do not ] recommend “ thinking positively , ” telling yourself to cheer up , or fondly dwelling on comfortable images that everything is wonderful .
The advice glibly offered to emotional sufferers , such as “ Worrying does n’t do any good , so why worry ? , ” is usually of little help because the anxious person does n’t know how to stop worrying .
Such a person has a definite system of beliefs , which has become a fixed dogma , and which automatically generates distress .
Without attacking and changing that system of beliefs , there will probably be little progress in reducing anxiety .
But the sufferer does n’t think much about the system of beliefs , does n’t consider that the beliefs might be questionable , and does n’t notice how the beliefs lead to counterproductive and self - destructive behavior .
To start on the path to healthy thought patterns , it ’s first necessary to identify the sufferer ’s system of beliefs .
This is n’t a lengthy process of excavating “ unconscious ” memories .
Usually a few minutes of asking simple questions will elicit a person ’s faulty thinking .
Sound too good to be true ?
It ’s really not .
This is the foundation of most modern psychotherapy as practiced today ( cognitive behavioral or rational emotive therapies ) .
These concepts have been empirically tested in hundreds of research studies and shown to be effective in helping a person become empowered over their own beliefs , which directly influence their feelings .
So next time you ’re feeling down about someone ’s comment to you , or a situation that “ made you ” feel awful , consider that the pain and distress you are feeling is in your hands .
And so is the solution .

We Are Responsible for Our Own Feelings
KABUL ( Reuters ) -
The killing of civilians in foreign military airstrikes is shattering Afghans ’ support for keeping international troops in their troubled land and driving angry young men into the arms of the Taliban , analysts say .
International troops do not target civilians and say they do their utmost to avoid harming them , but even as Taliban suicide bombers kill more innocents , it is foreign forces and the Afghan government they support that bear the brunt of the backlash .
“ Such acts provoke public hatred towards internal and foreign forces and force people to join the enemy who encourages them to carry out terrorist and suicide attacks , ” said the state - run Hewad newspaper after the first of two controversial airstrikes this month .
First , Afghan officials say , U.S. aircraft killed 15 civilians in the northeast on July 4 , then just three days later , hit a wedding in the east , killing 47 , mostly women and children .
“ The Americans will soon face new resistance with new motives if they continue such operations and do not care even a little about the lives of the people , ” the state - run daily Anis said .
While the U.S. military first of all denied civilians had been hit , then launched what is likely to be a lengthy investigation , most Afghans have already made up their minds .
“ Such arbitrary bombing raids and brutal killings have been repeated so many times during the past nearly seven years that now it is difficult to believe these foreign forces have come to our country for assistance , ” the pro-government Weesa daily said .
“ There is a perception problem , ” said NATO ’s civilian spokesman in Afghanistan , Mark Laity .
“ But it is a perception problem not a reality problem .
The reality is that we are very careful and the number of mistakes we make is very small . ”
The perception though that international forces are not careful enough when launching airstrikes is becoming entrenched in Afghan public opinion , and officials have been known to make hasty claims of civilian casualties .
FOG OF WAR
The Taliban also claim troops wantonly kill civilians almost every day , adding to the fog of war .
The remoteness of most airstrikes , the speed with which bodies are buried and a cultural taboo against mostly male reporters seeing wounded women in hospitals also make verifying claims and counter - claims a major problem .
More than 250 Afghan civilians were killed by Afghan and foreign forces in the first six months of this year , the United Nations says .
NATO disputes the figure and says it is much lower .
The Taliban have killed many more civilians , at least 450 so far this year , according to the U.N. , and as many as 80 percent of the victims of suicide bombs are innocent bystanders .
Even so , after such attacks ordinary Afghans more often than not blame local and foreign security forces for failing to stop them from happening , rather than those who carried them out .
A suicide bomb attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul last week that killed 58 people was no different .
“ Such incidents in Kabul where , apart from Afghan security forces , a countless number of foreign security forces are based , show security bodies are in fact not capable of doing anything or they deliberately do not want to do anything and are involved in the incidents , ” the independent Rah-e Nejat daily said .
Airstrikes by both NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) and U.S. - led coalition forces in Afghanistan are either pre-planned targeted airstrikes , or in response to calls for assistance from troops in combat .
The level of preparation that goes into pre-planned strikes means mistakes are extremely rare , Laity said .
But when troops ’ lives are threatened from militants firing from , for example a walled compound , “ you are entitled to reply even if you cannot be 100 percent sure there are not civilians in the compound .
That is the right of self - defence , ” he said .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly called for international troops to coordinate their operations more with Afghan forces so as to avoid civilian casualties .
But if most mistakes happen when airstrikes are called in during the heat of battle , it is hard to see how that could have an effect .
Mistakes do and will continue to happen .
“ The problem is this is a war , ” Laity said .
“ Although our weapons are remarkable and our people incredibly well - trained , although the rules of engagement and the principles under which we operate are of the highest standard , we are not perfect . ”
Today I ’ll continue the series on command - line tools for productivity , with sed .
Stream EDitor is the most complicated tool so far , an entire language in its own right .
It is much too big to cover completely in one post , so I ’m going to have a few posts covering the major parts of sed .
The bread and butter of sed is its search - and - replace functionality .
Let ’s start with that and then throw in some other fun commands .
Tutorial
As with the previous posts , if you are on Windows you ’ll want to install Cygwin or one of the various other tools suggested in the previous comments .
sed also uses regular expressions so you ’ll want to keep your regex reference handy .
From Wikipedia :
[ sed ] reads input files line by line ( sequentially ) , applying the operation which has been specified via the command line ( or a sed script ) , and then outputs the line .
sed 's /#FF0000/#0000 FF/g ' main.css
We can read this like so : search [ s / ] for red [ # FF0000 / ] and replace it with blue [ #0000 FF ] , globally [ /g ] in main.css .
Two notes here : 1 ) This does not actually modify the file , but outputs what the file would look like if it did the replace and 2 )
If we left off the “ g ” at the end it would only replace the first occurrence .
So let ’s modify the file this time .
sed - i -r 's /#( FF0000|F00 ) b/#0F0/g ' main.css
This is an example from the find tutorial that replaces all instances of red with green in our CSS file .
The -r option here gives us extra regex functionality .
As Sheila mentioned in the find post , - i does not work on Solaris and she suggests something like perl -e s / foo / bar / g - i instead .
Suppose we want to change a whole color scheme though , the best way is to use a sed script file like so :
# sedscript - one command per line s/#00CC00/#9900CC/g s/#990099/#000000/g s/#0000FF/#00FF00/g ... # use sedscript with -f sed - i -f sedscript * .css
sedscript is obviously a new file we have created .
Note that we do n’t quote the commands in the file .
Now we have successfully changed our color scheme in our CSS files .
Other Examples
# Trim whitespace from beginning and end of line #
You * might * have to type a tab instead of t here depending on your version of sed sed -r 's / ^ [ t]*//;s /[ t]*$ //g' # Delete all occurances of foo sed 's / foo//g'
Conclusion
You should start seeing how you can make a lot of changes with simple one - liners with sed .
Using it effectively can really increase your efficiency with some tasks .
Here are some good references you should bookmark ( including this page of course ;)

I ’d say that 90 % of the time I use sed for search - and - replace , so you ’ve got a good start here .
As I mentioned earlier , there is a LOT more to sed .
Later , I ’ll show you how to make deletions , add line numbers to files , print specific lines by line number , and much more .

More than 40 people have been caught trying to break into prisons in the last five years , highlighting a growing drug problem in the penal system , according to new government figures .
The data released by the justice secretary , Jack Straw , showed that 19 people were involved in such incidents last year alone .
The figures appeared to confirm warnings from the Prison Officer Association .
The shadow justice secretary , Nick Herbert , who requested the information , said : " Whether these are offenders trying to return to jail , as prison officers have alleged , or dealers trying to traffic drugs , it is ludicrous that supposedly secure establishments can be breached in this way . "
In April , the POA assistant general secretary , Glyn Travis , said : " Drugs are coming in at a rate that 's so dramatic that [ they ] are actually cheaper than on the outside .
" It tells me there 's something wrong in society when people are breaking into jail to bring in drugs and prostitutes , but the prisoners are quite happy to stay inside . "
He highlighted one break - in at Everthorpe prison , in east Yorkshire , when drug dealers and prostitutes entered the jail using ladders .
The figures said ladders were used by 13 of the 42 people who were caught trying to break into prisons since 2003 .
Most of the incidents involve break - in to open jails .
The Prison Service denied inmates had any opportunity to escape in the Everthorpe incident .
" The prison was aware of a security breach back in January during which drugs were being brought in at night .
At no time were prisoners out of their cells or able to access any other areas of the prison , " a spokesman said .
" Immediate action was taken with extra fencing , the removal of trees , extra CCTV cameras , and the transfer of the offender involved to another establishment . "
Frances Crook , the director of the Howard League for Prison Reform , said : " The majority of drugs being brought into prisons come through staff , who did it for money or are intimidated by prisoners .
The quantities involved could not come in from a kiss [ between inmates and visitors ] .
She added : " People trying to bring break in to prisons to bring in drugs are the stupid ones .
People break in for a range of different reasons .
They could be vulnerable people – if you get released from prison after 30 years , the only family and community you have is prison , it can be terrifying to be released because of the support on the outside . "
A justice department spokesman said : " Whilst trespass into open prisons , by their very nature , is more difficult to control , there has only been one identified case of a member of the public breaking into a closed prison in the last five years . "
He added : " Prison is anything but soft and it is absurd to suggest otherwise . "
[ darcs-users ] darcs 2.0.1 AND 2.0.2 released !
Hello darcs users , I 've just released darcs 2.0.1 and darcs 2.0.2 .
The second release was purely to fix some minor bugs in the build process revealed by the release of 2.0.1 .
In particular , the scripts that identified the version number and type ( e.g. " release " ) were buggy , leading to release tarballs that did n't properly include the version information .
The darcs 2.0.1 release also fixes quite a few bugs , and I strongly recommend that users of darcs 2 upgrade .

Clinton invokes RFK assassination in summer 1968 among reasons to stay in race ; later apologizes David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday May 23 , 2008

Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton , in defending her decision to continue running for the Democratic nomination that almost certainly will go to rival Sen. Barack Obama , invoked the shooting death of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in the summer of 1968 .
" My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ? "
Clinton said to the editorial board of the Sioux Falls , S.D. Argus Leader .
" We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California .
" I do n't understand " the calls to exit the race , she added .
The Obama campaign responded to Clinton 's statement , saying , " Sen. Clinton 's statement before the Argus Leader editorial board was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign . "
Clinton apologized for the remark , saying , " I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation and in particular the Kennedy family was in any way offensive .
I certainly had no intention of that whatsoever . "
The New York senator later elaborated , saying , " My view is that we have to look to the past and to our leaders who have inspired us and give us a lot to live up to and I 'm honored to hold Sen.
Kennedy 's seat for the state of New York . "
In early March of this year , Clinton made a similar RFK remark in an interview with Time : " Primary contests used to last a lot longer .
We all remember the great tragedy of Bobby Kennedy being assassinated in June in L.A .
My husband did n't wrap up the nomination in 1992 until June , also in California .
Having a primary contest go through June is nothing particularly unusual . "
Sensitivity to even the humorous suggestion of assassination in this campaign season has been high , particularly in regard to Sen. Obama .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee found that out recently when he kidded about Obama ducking a gunman , a spontaneous quip he later apologized for .
CNN earlier reported that the Clinton camp was in talks with the Obama team about joining forces for the November election , saying that if Obama does not run with Clinton on his ticket , " civil war " in the Democratic Party could result .
Clinton later denied that any such negotations were taking place .

The burdens of global rebalancing
Robert Dekle , Jonathan Eaton , Samuel Kortum
A correction of international imbalances seems inevitable .
What will that entail ?
This column presents estimates of the changes in trade flows required to rebalance the world ’s current accounts and analyses which countries will bear the burdens of adjustment .
The US runs the largest current account deficit in the world .
In 2006 the US deficit reached $ 788.1 billion , nearly 6 % of US GDP and more than the surpluses of Japan , Germany , and China combined .
The US deficit has been financed largely through the accumulation of US liabilities by foreign central banks .
As their appetite for US IOUs can only be finite , a predominant view is that a reversal in the US trade deficit is inevitable .
As Herbert Stein diagnosed a similar situation long ago , " If something ca n't go on forever , it wo n't . "
While the dynamic forces driving trade imbalances remain too poorly understood to allow us to say with much precision when a correction will occur , our understanding of what drives international trade can tell us a lot about what a correction will look like when it does happen .
What must happen to fully rebalance the US current account ?
What would a full " correction " of current account imbalances mean for the value of the dollar , the relative size of the US economy , and US living standards ?
What sort of adjustments inside the US economy will be needed ?
What will happen to the major surplus countries as well as to smaller players whose economies are tightly linked to the US , such as Canada and Mexico ?
To answer this question , we must have a way of linking trade flows – in particular US exports and imports – to economic factors such as the real exchange rate , US GDP , etc .
Here the gravity model comes in .
A successful venture in international trade has been the gravity model of bilateral trade .
Pioneers in econometric modelling , such as Tinbergen ( 1962 ) and Pöyhönen ( 1963 ) , observed that trade between country A and country B followed a simple formula .
Exports from A to B correlate very well with the size ( e.g. GDP ) of country A's economy multiplied by the size of country B's economy divided by the distance between them .
For a long time , this relationship lacked a theory .
More recent work , particularly by Anderson ( 1979 ) and Deardorff ( 1998 ) , tied this relationship to standard models of international trade .
In Eaton and Kortum ( 2002 ) , two of us developed a particular model that allowed for production of a large number of goods that can be traded but at a cost .
A feature of this model is that an increase in exports can occur at both the intensive margin ( selling more of the same good ) and the extensive margin ( selling a broader variety of goods ) .
1
Recently we have adapted this framework to address the US current account question ( Dekle , Eaton , and Kortum 2008 ) .
Fitting the model to 2004 data on GDP and bilateral trade flows among 42 countries , we solve for the new equilibrium in which trade in manufactures ( the major component of the current account imbalances of the big players such as the US , Japan , Germany , and China ) adjusts to eliminate all current account imbalances .
While achieving exactly this outcome would be a remarkable coincidence , the exercise gives some sense of the magnitudes rebalancing would entail .
The effects of correcting international imbalances
We perform this exercise making different assumptions about the flexibility of national economies in adapting to a rebalanced world .
How easily can productive resources ( most importantly workers ) move between the production of non-traded goods and manufactures ?
How easily can countries expand exports by increasing the range of products that they can produce and sell abroad ?
Table 1 presents a synopsis of our results ( for a handful of countries ) in the two most extreme cases .
Flexible case : Economies are fully flexible in both respects .
Workers can seamlessly change sectors , and countries can seamlessly change the portfolio of products that they sell in different markets .
Inflexible case : Workers are stuck in their initial sectors and exports to a market can adjust only at the intensive margin , by selling more or less of the same set of goods .
One can think of the first scenario as reflecting the ultimate long - term consequences and the second the immediate effect of a sudden change .
For each scenario , Table 1 reports in the first column the percentage change in the country 's GDP relative to world GDP .
This change is likely to correspond most closely to the change in the country 's exchange rate .
The second column reports the percentage point change in the share of manufacturing in the country 's GDP .
The third column reports the percentage change in GDP deflated by the change in local prices .
Table 1 . Changes in outcomes under different adjustment scenarios
Maximum Flexibility Minimum Flexibility
GDP Mfg. shr Real GDP GDP Mfg.shr .
Real GDP Canada - 0.9 - 0.9 0.3 - 5.7 - 1.2 0.1 China 1.5 - 0.4 0.0 8.2 - 0.5 - 0.2 Germany 2.5 - 1.4 0.2 18.8 - 1.8 0.8 Japan 3.3 - 1.7 0.2 26.2 - 2.1 0.3 Mexico - 2.2 0.3 - 0.1 - 14.7 0.2 - 1.7 US - 4.5 3.0 - 0.4 - 29.9 3.5 - 2.0
Note : First column is percentage change in GDP , holding world GDP fixed .
Second column is percentage change in manufacturing share of GDP .
Third column is percentage change in real GDP .
Interpreting the results
Beginning with the second column , we note that in either scenario adjustment requires a substantial increase in the size of the US manufacturing sector , between 3 and 3.5 percentage points .
The reasons behind the change in the two scenarios are different , however .
In the flexible case US manufacturing expands because resources move there .
In the inflexible case , the wages of workers in manufacturing rise relative to those in the rest of the economy .
Looking at the implied change in GDP ( first column ) and considering the flexible case , we see that the change in the relative sizes of the different economies under the flexible case is quite modest .
The US as a share of the world economy falls by just 4.5 % while Japan 's rises by 3.3 % .
The inflexible case , however , requires a much more radical realignment in the relative size of the major economies .
The US declines by nearly 30 % relative to the world while Japan grows by over 26 % .
( Combining the numbers , the adjustment would require over a 50 % devaluation of the US dollar in terms of the Japanese yen ) .
Turning the implications for the change in real GDP ( third column ) , we see that large changes in relative GDP translate into much more muted changes in real GDP .
For instance , the real GDP of the US falls by only 2 % .
The reason is that the more the US relative wage ( and hence relative GDP ) needs to decline to make US exports ( e.g. , tractors , wide - bodied aircraft ) more competitive abroad , the lower the price of what Americans produce for themselves ( e.g. , medical services , personal training , auto repair ) , which comprise the lion 's share of what Americans ( and other people ) spend money on .
The outcomes for the large surplus economies ( Japan , Germany , and China ) are the reverse image of those for the US .
Note that in either scenario the US pulls down the relative GDPs of Canada and Mexico , even though Canada starts out running a surplus and Mexico only a small deficit .
The reason is that these countries ' largest foreign customer shrinks substantially .
Despite the decline in the size of the Canadian economy , Canadian GDP can buy more , since goods from its largest foreign supplier have gotten much cheaper still .
Hence its real GDP rises .
To summarise , the realignment that is necessary depends on flexibility , with more flexibility requiring less adjustment .
Even if movements in relative GDP's are substantial , however , once price changes are taken into account real effects are much more modest .
The adjustment in progress
In fact , there are signs that the correction has already begun .
From 1 March 2007 to 1 March 2008 the value of the US dollar declined by nearly 18 % against the Canadian dollar , over 16 % against the Mexican peso , by nearly 14 % against the Euro , and by over 8 % against the Chinese yuan .
Various trade - weighted exchange rates reported by the IMF show a US dollar decline of 10 to 13 % from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008 .
During this same period US merchandise exports grew 18.4 % and merchandise imports grew 12.7 % .
Some of this growth is the consequence of the commodity boom .
But even removing soybeans , corn , and wheat from exports leaves growth in the remaining categories of US exports at a hefty 16.8 % .
Moreover , if imports of crude oil are taken out , US spending on imports grew by only 5.9 % .
Much larger changes than these are needed to bring the US current account into balance .
How much more of a dollar decline is needed depends on how adaptable the US economy is at moving resources into the production of goods that are exported or used to replace imports and on how successfully it expands the range of products it can produce and sell abroad .

Sprint Nextel , the troubled No. 3 wireless carrier , lost nearly a million customers in the second quarter .
But the company says it lost some of them on purpose .
Meanwhile its chief rivals , AT&T and Verizon Wireless , respectively gained 1.3 million and 1.5 million new wireless customers .
As customers tighten their spending during rough economic times and when nearly nine out of every 10 Americans already own a cellphone , winning customers from a competitor is the only way to grow quickly .
And at that task , analysts say , Sprint is struggling .
Daniel R. Hesse , who has been chief executive of the company since January , said that Sprint had deliberately rid itself of some of those 901,000 customers .
Mr. Hesse said Sprint tightened credit standards in order to focus on keeping dependable mobile phone customers who have the money to pay their monthly bills .
“ We did it knowingly , ” he said .
“ We are interested in quality , not quantity . ” Sprint said Wednesday that it now has 51.9 million customers .
Mr. Hesse , who appears in ads for Sprint , said the failure to attract new customers was because customers did not know that Sprint had improved .
Quebec 's open - source software association is suing the provincial government , saying it is giving preferential treatment to Microsoft Corp. by buying the company 's products rather than using free alternatives .
Facil estimates the Quebec government is spending $ 80 million a year on Windows Vista licences alone .
(( Mary Altaffer / Associated Press ) )
The lawsuit by Facil was lodged with the Quebec Superior Court on July 15 and made public on Wednesday .
In it , the group says the provincial government has refused to entertain competing bids from all software providers , opting instead to supply public - sector departments with products bought from proprietary vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle Corp .
Government buyers are using an exception in provincial law that allows them to buy directly from a proprietary vendor when there are no options available , but Facil said that loophole is being abused and goes against other legal requirements to buy locally .
" It should n't be the rule , " Facil president Mathieu Lutfy told CBC News .
" It goes against the public markets policy of the government , which requires them to stimulate competition and look for local alternatives .
It 's really an absurdity . "
Between February and June , the Quebec government spent $ 25 million on software from Microsoft , Facil said .
The group estimates the government is spending more than $ 80 million a year on licences for Microsoft 's Windows Vista operating system alone .
Whereas proprietary vendors sell software for a fee and then charge for support and upgrades , open - source makers supply the software for free and bill only for subsequent services .
" Those are costs that could be saved , " Lutfy said .
Officials at the Quebec government 's procurement office could not be reached for comment .
Facil said the provincial government , as well as its federal counterpart , is woefully behind the rest of the world in terms of adopting open - source software in the public sector .
Governments around the world are looking to lower their costs and reliance on specific software makers .
France , for example , migrated more than 400,000 public - sector employees to open - source software in 2006 , while the Netherlands recently banned the use of proprietary products in government .
" A strategic free software utilization in public administration could create thousands of jobs as well as a significant decrease in software licensing costs , " Facil said in a press release .
" However , Quebec 's public administration refuses to even consider and evaluate these options . "
Russell McOrmond of Facil 's federal counterpart , the Canadian Association of Open Source , agreed that there is some innate resistance to using free software within the procurement arm of the government .
" There 's a general lack of awareness of the software sector by the people who are actually making individual acquisition decisions , " he said .
" The policies say everything is open but the practice becomes a little different . "
Much of the issue stems from the lobbying efforts of the big software vendors , McOrmond said .
" The proprietary software vendors have been very successful in convincing people in procurement , whether in government or the private sector , that software is a product and you buy it like you do an automobile , " he said .
" If you actually look at what software does , it 's more like a service . "
Facil is asking the Quebec court to ban the government from using the regulatory loophole that allows it to purchase proprietary software , and to force it to entertain competitive requests for proposal .
The group is also seeking legal costs , but it is not asking for any damages .
Actually , make is really pretty good .
Well , GNU make is pretty good .
When used correctly it can rebuild large projects in the minimum number of steps , in parallel .
So what is wrong with it ?
I 'm not complaining about the simple annoyances like insane use of tabs or being based on two inflexible programming languages ( shell script and make macros ) .
No , it 's got two fundamental problems : it cannot enforce correct dependency tracking and its dependency language is insufficiently expressive for common tasks .
It is possible to write incorrect make rules
It 's far too easy to write incorrect rules -- rules where the named dependencies and targets do not match up with the action :
foo : bar cat bar baz > foo
So obviously that 's a totally contrived example and is easy to spot that it has an untracked dependency on baz , however it gets much harder with more complex rules and where the programs you call read or write files that you did not know about .
So the problem is that make cannot check that you 've written a bogus rule and yet if you do your makefile is broken .
What makes it worse is that it is not immediately obvious that the makefile is broken .
It will work initially but you 'll end up not trusting parallel make or running into quirks that are solved by make clean .
If you have to use make clean your makefile is broken .
The reason it cannot check for correctness of rules is of course because the actions are opaque blobs of shell script .
The decision to use shell script made it quicker to implement make and users were already familiar with the language but the cost is that makefiles are more or less impossible to check automatically .
Dynamic dependencies cannot be expressed sanely in make
Make takes the view that there is a single massive static dependency graph .
The single and massive aspects are not a problem but the static one is .
The problem is that in many cases you do actually need to run some build actions before you know all the dependencies of each file in a project .
The canonical example is running a tool to discover the dependencies of .hs or .c files .
GNU make has a clever extension which makes it possible to express this kind of dependency in simple cases .
It lets one include deps.mk .
That reads in the deps.mk file and extends the dependency graph with all the rules found in deps.mk .
The clever thing is that deps.mk itself can depend on other things and can have a rule to generate it .
For the example of dependencies of .hs or .c files , this lets us write a rule to call the compiler with a flag to dump make - format dependencies into a file .
This works quite nicely , in this simple case .
The problem with doing include deps.mk is that the file can specify any rules at all .
It can add edges between any existing nodes in make 's dependency graph .
That means that make cannot be confident that it knows everything unless it has got deps.mk up to date and included it .
So before anything else can be done , make has to update deps.mk , even if it turns out in the end that the deps given in the include file are irrelevant to the task at hand .
In practise we do not need to be able to add edges willy nilly all over the place and there is a great benefit to being more disciplined .
Suppose for the sake of argument that for each .hs file I have a .deps file listing the files that the .hs file depends on .
Now if I am trying to update foo.hs then I only need to look at the suffix rule for .hs files and the rules in foo.deps .
I know that I do not need to look in bar .deps ( unless I discover from foo . deps that foo.hs depends on bar .hi ) .
This is a massive saving .
It means I do not have to bring all the .deps files up to date .
That also means I do not have to bring the corresponding .hs files up to date .
That also means I do not have to run any pre-processors or code generators for those .hs files .
That also means I do not have to compile the code generators .
You might think this is a contrived situation but it is not .
The Gtk2 Hs build system use GNU make ( non-recursive of course ) .
It has lots of .chs.pp files which get pre-processed with cpp and then c2hs to generate a .hs file .
For each .chs file we look for all the imports and generate a .deps file which gets included into the top level makefile .
So just to calculate all the dependencies we actually have to two about two thirds of the build .
That 's because we first have to build c2hs and two other code generators and then run cpp and c2hs on a hundred or so files , just so we can generate all the .hs files and find their dependencies .
This means that from a clean state I cannot build just one particular .hs file because the very makefile itself depends on all the other .hs files .
Amusingly , just to make clean , make has to build half the project .
Obviously that is insane so we have to hack it using includes that are conditional on the make target .
That 's not a technique that scales however .
In any non-trivial build system it is necessary to interleave build actions with discovering dependencies .
Classic make ignores this fact completely .
GNU make notes it but forces us to do all the actions to discover the full dependency graph up front before we can get round to useful work .
A better build system would be built around the notion of interleaving graph exploration with graph reduction .
Saizan 's make - like framework is built around this principle .
Could we do better ?
Looking around at previous work , like the classic recursive make considered harmful or the Vesta or Maak build systems , one lesson comes up again and again : track dependencies absolutely precisely or you lose .
I am convinced that the solution to the first problem is not to specify the dependencies and targets separately from the action .
They should be specified together so that there is simply no way to express an untracked dependency .
This is also the approach taken by Vesta and Maak .
If we have a bunch of primitive actions that correctly declare their dependencies and ways of combining actions that remembers dependencies then we should never end up with untracked dependencies .
For example consider the above example again .
Lets suppose we have two primitives :
readFile :: FilePath -> Rule String writeFile :: FilePath -> Rule ( String -> ( ) )
Clearly one has a single dependency and the other a single target .
Lets write that contrived rule again :
rule = write <*> read where write = writeFile " foo " read = (++ ) <$> readFile " bar " <*> readFile " baz "
So the intuition here is that applicative composition gives us static rule - graph composition .
As for rules with dynamic dependencies , this corresponds to monadic composition :
(<**>) :: Rule a -> Rule ( a -> b ) -> Rule b ( >>= ) :: Rule a -> ( a -> Rule b ) ->
Rule b
This lets us express the cases where very structure of the dependency graph depends on a value calculated from another part of the graph .
With static composition we can look at the resulting rule and ' see ' down both branches of the composition to discover the graph structure without running any actions .
With dynamic composition we can look at the left branch statically but the right branch requires the value produced by the left before we can even discover its structure .
So we should use static composition where possible because it tells us more about the graph which gives us more opportunities for parallelism and for caching intermediate results to avoid needless recompilation .
Where necessary we can use dynamic dependencies but we should not over - use them or our dependency ' graph ' would just become one long chain .
So , that 's the idea .
I should make clear : there is no corresponding implementation !
Unlike my vaporware , Saizan has a working implementation of a slightly lower level API as part of his GSoC project .
We have talked about putting a higher level API on top though it 's not completely clear how to do that yet .
There are also undoubtedly connections to FRP that could do with further exploration .
I mean it is quite clearly an FRP style problem , but an ugly grungy one where many parts work by side effects in the file system .
Thousands of people have fled Gori in fear of Russian air attacks Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered an end to military operations against Georgia , the Kremlin says .
He told officials that the safety of Russian citizens and peacekeepers in South Ossetia had been restored .
Russia also backed an EU plan to end the five - day - old conflict .
Envoys will now try to get Georgian approval .
Each side continues to accuse the other of breaking ceasefire accords , and analysts warn that the two remain far apart on a number of issues .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it was vital that all sides cease fire , adding that Russian military operations " really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored " .
The conflict began overnight last Thursday , when Russia responded to Georgian military action in South Ossetia .
See map of the region Russia received heavy criticism on Monday after its troops pushed on from the secessionist territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia towards the town of Gori in central Georgia , and into Senaki in the west .
On Tuesday morning there were more reports of fighting near Gori , but witnesses later said that Russian troops appeared to have pulled back from both towns .
SIX - POINT PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions International talks about future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Gori smoulders after fighting Analysis : Russia 's endgame Falling victim to pipeline politics Georgia 's civilian emergency French President Nicolas Sarkozy , in his current role as EU president , held talks with Mr Medvedev in Moscow for most of the day .
In a joint news conference , they said a six - point peace plan had been agreed by Russia and would now be taken to Georgia .
The deal included a pledge to pull troops on both sides back to their pre-conflict positions , and a plan to begin international discussions about the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
If Georgia agrees to the plan , Mr Medvedev said the " path to a gradual normalisation " in South Ossetia was open .
But during the same press conference , Mr Medvedev called Georgian troops " lunatics " and accused Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili of lying over a previous ceasefire agreement .
And just hours earlier , tens of thousands of Georgians gathered in Tbilisi 's main square to hear Mr Saakashvili claim that Russia was continuing its " ruthless , heartless destruction " of Georgian citizens .
Neither side 's claims could be verified , but analysts point out that the inflamed rhetoric signifies how far away from an agreement they are .
In other developments : • Nato said Russia 's withdrawal announcement was " not enough " and that it deplored the " disproportionate " force used by Moscow .
• President Saakashvili said Georgia would leave the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) - a group which includes most of the former Soviet republics .
•
He also announced that Russian peacekeepers in Georgia 's other breakaway region , Abkhazia , would now be regarded as an occupying army - ending an agreement in place since 1994 .
•
Separatist rebels continued to fight against Georgian troops in the Kodori Gorge region of Abkhazia - the only area of Abkhazia still under Georgian military control .
• British oil firm BP closed a key pipeline that runs through Georgia .
' Safety restored '
According to a Kremlin statement , Mr Medvedev told his defence minister and chief of staff that " the goal has been attained " .

Russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
US President George W Bush
Bush 's tough talk on Russia Day - by - day : Georgia - Russia crisis But Mr Medvedev warned that Russia would not tolerate any further Georgian military activity in South Ossetia , saying : " Should centres of resistance or other aggressive attempts arise , you must take the decision to destroy them . "
Georgia also remained sceptical , the country 's prime minister telling Reuters that troops would remain " mobilised ... ready for anything " until a binding agreement was signed between the two countries .
The Russian move followed strong comments from US President George W Bush , in which he spoke directly of concerns that Russia was planning to topple Georgia 's pro-Western president .
" Russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people , " he said .
" Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st Century . "

The BBC 's diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall says Mr Medvedev 's announcement must be seen in the light of the US president 's words .
President Bush 's language was unusually blunt , she says , and if Russia cares about its relations with the US and Europe , it might have been given pause for thought .
The five - day - old conflict began late on 7 August when Georgian forces bombarded South Ossetia , where a majority of people hold Russian passports .
Russia quickly became involved , bombing targets throughout Georgia and sending troops in to recapture South Ossetia .
Some 100,000 people are estimated to have been displaced by the conflict .

WASHINGTON  A Justice Department plan would loosen restrictions on the Federal Bureau of Investigation to allow agents to open a national security or criminal investigation against someone without any clear basis for suspicion , Democratic lawmakers briefed on the details said Wednesday .
The plan , which could be made public next month , has already generated intense interest and speculation .
Little is known about its precise language , but civil liberties advocates say they fear it could give the government even broader license to open terrorism investigations .
Congressional staff members got a glimpse of some of the details in closed briefings this month , and four Democratic senators told Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey in a letter on Wednesday that they were troubled by what they heard .
The senators said the new guidelines would allow the F.B.I. to open an investigation of an American , conduct surveillance , pry into private records and take other investigative steps “ without any basis for suspicion . ”
The plan “ might permit an innocent American to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , or on protected First Amendment activities , ” the letter said .
It was signed by Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island .
It All Depends On Who You Ask
Las Vegas Water Offical Warns Radioactive Levels Rising
Sunday ’s news was a bit disconcerting , when I read a small story at Tri-State Online .
Pat Mulroy , head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority was quoted as saying measurable quantities of uranium are showing up in Colorado River water , something difficult and expensive to remove before passing it on to consumers in Las Vegas .
She blames upstream uranium mining , especially in the Moab , Utah area , so I decided to take a look and see what ’s happening up there .
To the best of my knowledge , there are no operating uranium mines in or near Moab , UT , or anywhere in the state of Utah .
So , I felt Ms. Mulroy was referring to the uranium mill tailings just outside Moab , where they ’ve been for decades after the failure of the Atlas Minerals Corporation mill .
Well , the 16 million tons of radioactive dirt is still there , but according to Moab Mayor David Sakrison , they are no danger to the community or the river .
In a phone interview , the mayor said the federal government has done an exemplary job of mitigating dust and water runoff that would contaminate the Colorado .
Sakrison did say , however , this has been the case for the past eight years , and before that , Colorado River water was indeed being polluted .
Had the tailings pile presented a health risk to his community , especially through it ’s drinking water ?
“ No ” , said the mayor , “ our aquifer is on the other side of the Colorado and our water supply is not contaminated . ”
It was in 2000 that then Energy Secretary Bill Richardson promised to relocate the tailings pile , and Congress had given the Department of Energy authority to begin cleanup .
President Bush , however , included NO money in his 2000 budget for the removal project .
Cleanup About To Begin at Moab
Donald Metzler , Federal Project Director for the Moab cleanup , told me everything is in place to begin transporting the contaminated soil to a storage area at Crescent Junction , Utah .
The site is about 30 miles north of Moab , and is in a formation called Mancos Shale bedrock , a hard , almost impenetrable formation that will isolate the site from any aquifer .
After all the tailings have been removed from the Moab site and placed in storage , it will be capped and should be safe for at least 1000 years .
I asked Mr. Metzler about the possibility that the tailings were still polluting the river , and he assured me there is absolutely no contamination .
He said tests from a few hundred feet south of the Ajax site showed no increase in radiation other than background , caused by nature .
Taking my query a bit further , some 500 miles , I spoke with Mitch Basefsky , PIO for the Tucson Water District , and he assured me they are monitoring the level of radiation in water coming into the area from the Colorado River via the Central Arizona Project .
Basefsky said they have not seen a change in water radioactivity over the years , but remain concerned that eventually , if nothing is done to stem the release of radioactive materials into the river , it will become a problem here .
So , Where ’s The Radiation Coming From ?
Southern Nevada ’s Mulroy has supposedly written federal Interior Secretary Dick Kempthorne , asking him to “ carefully evaluate ” further uranium mining along the Colorado to determine the risk of further contamination of the river .
I ’ve tried for days to get someone in her office to talk with me about her statement and what they ’re finding in the water near Las Vegas , but no one has been forthcoming , and I can find nothing on the SNWA website concerning the issue .
There are no operating uranium mines in Utah , and according to Mayor Sakrison , most of the abandoned sites have been cleaned up , and clean water is leaving the Moab area .
What ’s the problem ?
Grand Canyon Exploration and Possible Uranium Mining
While writing this story , word came to me from the Sierra Club , stating the House Natural Resources Committee has ordered the Bush administration to immediately stop mining claims on public lands surrounding the Grand Canyon .
Good news , because of fears that pollution from uranium mines could threaten the drinking water for more than 25 million people living in the southwest , and just the idea that mining operations are going on within three miles of the canyon is unthinkable .
Until I hear something concrete from the folks in Nevada , there appears little or no danger at this time from uranium - polluted Colorado River water .
Stay tuned .

Many LinuxInsider readers are probably familiar with , or at least aware of , OpenMoko ’s FreeRunner — the new Linux - based cell phone .
This smartphone uses the Linux kernel along with various other free and open source software packages , including X.org Server with Matchbox window manager .
These tools will be familiar to users of the original OpenMoko developer ’s phone that came out last summer , the Neo1973 , or the OLPC XO - 1 laptop before it ran Windows XP .
This phone is so open source that you can get scans of the hardware off the Web site , but OpenMoko is just the tip of the iceberg .
Whereas most of the world was conscripted to Microsoft products through top - down bureaucracies , Linux is reaching the marketplace organically through the channel that is most common to people throughout the world : their mobile phones .
With Nokia porting Trolltech ’s Qt to Maemo and Verizon choosing LiMo in its effort to compete against the iPhone , it ’s looking like we ’re imminently facing LUG meeting show - and - tells .
Linux Empowerment
Speaking of the iPhone , the member roster of theLiMo Foundation is really just a list of companies that either want to compete with Apple or AT&T , or are jaded Microsoft vendors ( I ’m looking at you , McAfee ) .
A cursory Google search suggests about 20 percent of all mobile users will have Linux - based phones by 2013 .
By the end of 2007 , we already had 3.3 billion mobile phone users on the planet , meaning about one phone for every two people worldwide .
Practically speaking , most adults in digital societies have mobile phones , so one in five running Linux is huge .
People are now getting Linux on their phones because some of the people who know the score have managed to convince some of the people that call the shots to act rationally .
Fortunately , progress will happen with or without the corporate shot - callers , so this is n’t the sort of scenario that requires whining to a turtleneck overlord .
With Linux , we are empowered — so long as we release our code .
Actually , speaking of releasing code , even the phone from OpenMoko , which releases its hardware diagrams , uses GTK + so that software vendors can write proprietary software to sell .
I imagine we ’ll see blogs in the near future about people not getting what they expected , and flamewars over how to package software to monetize it while not being obnoxious to users , and I look forward to that future .
What makes Linux far superior to Microsoft ’s mobile software is that you can have different permutations of Linux smartphones .
Historically — and presently , for many of us — smartphones are mostly pretty limited in scope .
The software on them is abysmal ; I ca n’t even SSH into mine .
And do n’t even get me started on the user interface of my Razr .
Ironing Out the Kinks
One of the greatest things about free and open source software — and even peripheral proprietary software to a lesser extent — is that , to quote the old saw , “ with enough eyeballs , all bugs are superficial . ”
When it comes to user interface , your company can never test it as rigorously as well as the general public with its misuses and special cases .
Given that you can work your business model around that , should n’t you ?
The iPhone raised the bar of expectations and demands of mobile phone users .
The days of Windows Mobile are numbered , and they will run out far sooner than Microsoft ’s days dominating the desktop market , because more people have decision - making power over their handheld device preference than over their office operating system preference .
As opposed to the top - down method of takeover that Microsoft employed in the 1990s business world , the successful model for today entails reaching people where they want to be rather than where they have to be .
Inevitably , this approach will lead to a sustainable long - term infiltration of many more market segments ; after all , it ’s the lack of user comfort with Linux that ’s supposedly keeping hardware manufacturers and software developers away from Linux - based systems .
When enough Linux - based phones have pervaded the mobile phone market , savvy users will abound in workplaces where “ whether to port to Linux or not ” decisions are made .
The decision will more likely be yes if enough users are already personally familiar with Linux - based handsets .
Instead of operating system dominance trickling down from one super - monolithic corporation , it will trickle up from the grassroots .

The merge window phase of the kernel development cycle is a hectic time .
Over a period of about two weeks , between 5,000 and 10,000 changesets find their way into the mainline git repository .
Simply managing that many patches would be hard enough , but the job is made more complicated by the fact that these changesets are not all independent of each other .
The first changes to be merged can change the code base in ways that cause later patches to fail to apply .
So merge windows have traditionally required maintainers to rework their queued patches to resolve conflicts which arise as other trees are merged .
Given the tight time constraints ( patches which are n't ready when the merge window closes generally sit out until the next cycle starts ) , this integration process has been known to put a fair amount of pressure on subsystem maintainers .
The other person feeling the stress was Andrew Morton ; one of his many jobs was to bash subsystem trees together in his - mm releases .
That took a lot of his time and did n't really solve the problem in the end ; much of the work which shows up in - mm is n't necessarily intended for the next development cycle .
The end result of all this is that each merge window brought together large amounts of code which had never been integrated before .
Back in February , the linux - next tree was announced as a way to help ease some of these problems .
We are now nearing the end of the first full development cycle to use linux - next , so it 's worth taking a look to see how it is working out .
The idea behind this tree is relatively simple .
Linux - next maintainer Stephen Rothwell keeps a list of trees ( maintained with git or quilt ) which are intended to be merged in the next development cycle .
As of this writing , that list contains 95 trees , all full of patches aimed at 2.6.27 .
Once a day , Stephen goes through the process of applying these trees to the mainline , one at a time .
With each merge , he looks for merge conflicts and build failures .
The original plan for linux - next stated that trees causing conflicts or build failures would simply be dropped .
In reality , so far , Stephen usually takes the time to figure out the problem ; he 'll then fix up or drop an individual patch to make everything fit again .
When this process is done , he releases the result as the linux - next tree for the day .
Others then grab it and perform build testing on it ; some people even boot and run the daily linux - next releases .
All this results in a steady stream of problem reports , small fixes , patches moving from one tree to another , and so on - various bits of integration work required to make all of the pieces fit together nicely .
There is an interesting sort of implicit hierarchy in the ordering of the trees .
Subsystem trees which are merged early in the process are less likely to run into conflicts than those which come later .
When two trees do come into conflict , it 's the owner of the later tree - the one which actually shows the conflict - who feels the most pressure to fix things up .
The history so far , though , shows that there has been very little in the way of finger - pointing when conflicts arise , as they do almost every day .
All of the developers understand that they are working on the same kernel , and they share a common interest in solving problems .
[ PULL QUOTE :
One aspect of this whole system remains untested , though : the movement of patches from linux - next into the mainline .
END QUOTE ]
So , thus far , linux - next appears to be functioning as intended .
It is serving as an integration point for the next kernel and helping to get many of the merging problems out of the way ahead of time .
One aspect of this whole system remains untested , though : the movement of patches from linux - next into the mainline .
As things stand now , there is no automatic movement between the trees ; instead , maintainers will send their pull requests directly to Linus as always .
If Linus refuses to merge certain trees , or if he merges them in an order different from their ordering in linux - next , integration problems could return .
In the end , it seems like linux - next will have to drive the final integration process more than is anticipated now , but it will probably take a few development cycles to figure out how to make it all work .
Meanwhile , anybody who is interested in 2.6.27 can , to a great extent , run it now by grabbing linux - next .
This tree has clarified one aspect of the development process : the 2 - 3 month " development cycle " run by Linus is , in fact , just the tip of the kernel development iceberg .
It is the final integration and stabilization stage .
Linux - next nearly doubles the length of the visible development cycle by assembling the next kernel long before Linus starts working on it .
And even linux - next only comes into play toward the end of a patch 's life .
In the past , Linus has pointedly worked to avoid overlapping the development and stabilization phases of the development cycle .
There was no development tree at all for almost a year while 2.4 was beaten into reasonable shape .
This separation was maintained out of a simple fear that an open development tree would distract developers from the more important task of finding and fixing bugs in the current stable release .
That separation is a thing of the past now ; there are literally dozens of development trees which are open for business at all times .
That can only be worrisome to those who are concerned about the quality of kernel releases ; why should developers concern themselves with 2.6.26 bugs when 2.6.27 is being assembled and 2.6.28 is already on the radar ?
Whether such concerns are valid is likely to be a matter of ongoing debate .
Meanwhile , however , linux - next appears to have settled in as a long - term feature of the kernel development landscape .
It is serving its purpose as a place to find and resolve integration problems ; it has also had the effect of taking much of that integration work off of Andrew Morton 's shoulders .
And that , in turn , should free him to spend more time trying to get developers to fix all those bugs .
( See the linux - next wiki for more information on how to work with this tree ) .
Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee in the upcoming election to choose the next President of the U.S.A. , is reportedly displeased by the amount of coverage that Barack Obama 's overseas trip has been getting - even though he himself had suggested that Senator Obama make such a trip .
I realize McCain 's been in the game a long time , and he probably feels that he 's entitled to a little more respect than he believes he 's getting .
So I thought I 'd share a video with you ; a musical tribute to his campaign speeches , you might say , reminiscent of that will .i.am " Yes We Can " video .

So Yoo is saying he feels no president would need to order a person buried alive , but if he did it would be OK .
When can we throw this piece of shit in jail ?

Dont forget John Ashcroft who was the force behind this garbage and the other one who drafted the PATRIOT ACT and who is now teaching Constitutional law at Georgetown .
They are both rewarded by Ashcroft to their current , elevated positions by a lack of understanding of the Constitution .
You both are the kind of legal mind we need .
Amen .

John ( sick puppy )
Yoo refuses to answer John Conyers in this very public hearing , but when asked an even more disturbing question many years ago by somebody named Doug Cassel , he gave a clearer answer .
This is an actual transcript and audio : Q : “ If the president deems that he ’s got to torture somebody , including by crushing the testicles of the person ’s child , there is no law that can stop him ? ”
Yoo : ” No treaty . ” Q : “ Also no law by Congress .
That is what you wrote in the August 2002 memo . ”
Yoo : “ I think it depends on why the president thinks he needs to do that . ”
Whore is NOT the worst pejorative .

Wow , that reminds me of Ron Paul asking the Iraqi General ( whoever was recently in charge ) if Bush could order an attack on Iran .
After much hemming and hawing and avoiding answering the question , Ron Paul tells him " the answer is No .
No , the president cannot order an attack on Iran without Congress declaring an act of war " .
JFC this is why education and history is so important .
People do n't know wtf the constitution is , why its important , and how to speak truth to power ---- and these people are top lawyers and generals running this country in many cases .
One of the few attorneys who actually understands the constitution and legal implications of messing with it is Russ Feingold .

It ’s not enough to run a great business , you need to make sure that it also has a professional look .
The way that you carry yourself , and the improvements that you make to your company create a first impression that builds your brand .
This is how people identify with you and will generate future business .
Start with these five points so that you ’re creating the high - tech , professional first impression that you ’ve always wanted .
1. Make Some Eco-Friendly , High - Tech Improvements
Eco-friendliness and high - tech seemingly go hand in hand .
If you adapt to new utilities and technology , your company will waste less energy and will abuse the planet less .
Invest in a backup generator , and consider switching to solar power .
Install low - flow toilets and bathroom sinks with infrared sensors .
Switch to tankless water heaters .
Making these improvements will give you huge benefits and a great first impression .
2. Set Up a Tech - Savvy Meeting Room
Close to 60 % of professionals today that work remotely now do so full - time .
Because of this , you need a meeting hub in your office that lets you broadcast to thousands without missing a beat .
This room should have projector screens , 4 K cameras , tablets , audio systems and of course , a seamless internet connection .
This way , you ’ll be able to communicate with other professionals across the globe as though you ’re in the same room with them .
3. Get Virtual Addresses and Phone Numbers
Having a digital phone number , virtual address , branded e-mail address , and digital P.O. Box will create a seriously professional impression for your company .
These purchases and subscriptions cost very little , and from the outside looking in , people wo n’t be able to distinguish them from physical addresses or landlines .
What ’s more , this technology often works better and is more flexible than traditional versions .
Being able to communicate means that your company will be more collaborative and productive .
Make sure to learn more about phone numbers and answering machines so that your business can communicate accordingly .
4. Continuously Keep Your Website Professional
Your brand depends on your ability to maintain a professional looking website .

Now that Joe Lieberman has emerged as John McCain 's lead attack dog against Barack Obama -- even going so far as to
suggest
that Obama 's judgment could pose a danger to our safety -- there 's some very interesting behind - the - scenes back - story to the Lieberman - Obama relationship that you should know about .
Specifically , a top official on Joe Lieberman 's 2006 Senate reelection campaign tells me that Lieberman 's staff practically begged Barack Obama to come in and endorse him at a critical moment -- requests that Obama agreed to , helping Lieberman minimize the damage from challenger Ned Lamont 's recent entry into the contest .
Rayonnante et apparemment en bonne santé , Ingrid Betancourt a fait le récit , mercredi 2 juillet , de sa libération .
Souriante et vêtue d'un treillis militaire , ses longs cheveux noués sur la nuque , elle est descendue la première de l'avion qui l'a amenée à Bogota , et s'est jetée dans les bras de sa mère , Yolanda Pulecio , puis dans ceux de son mari , Juan Carlos Lecompte .
La sénatrice franco - colombienne a raconté comment elle avait elle - même été dans un premier temps trompée par le subterfuge utilisé par les militaires pour parvenir à sa libération et à celle de ses codétenus dans la jungle , en se faisant passer pour une mission humanitaire .
Elle a rendu hommage à l'armée pour une opération " très risquée " mais " impeccable " .
PRIÈRE
" Accompagnez - moi d'abord pour remercier Dieu et la Vierge " , a - t - elle dit en préambule devant l'appareil des autorités colombiennes qui l'avait transportée avec ses compagnons à la base de Catam , près de Bogota .
" J'ai imaginé tellement de fois ce moment " , a - t - elle dit , en remerciant en français " vous tous dans le monde qui nous avez accompagnés " .
Des soldats se sont présentés comme les membres d'une ONG fictive censée transporter les otages par hélicoptère vers un camp pour y rencontrer le nouveau chef des Forces armées révolutionnaires de Colombie ( FARC ) , Alfonso Cano .
" Ce matin quand je me suis levée à 4 heures du matin , nous avions l'espoir que l'un d'entre nous serait bientôt libéré par une commission internationale de la Croix - Rouge " , a - t - elle dit .
Lorsque les faux humanitaires sont arrivés , Ingrid Betancourt a noté qu'ils portaient des T - shirts à l'effigie de Che Guevara et a cru qu'il s'agissait d'autres éléments des FARC .
Lorsqu'on a lui a annoncé qu'elle allait avec ses compagnons être transférée dans un autre lieu de captivité , Ingrid Betancourt a été en proie au découragement : " Là , mon cœur s'est brisé , parce que cela signifiait plus de captivité . "
" Nous sommes arrivés dans un endroit avec des guérilleros armés qui nous faisaient se dépêcher , avancer comme toujours . (...)
Les hélicoptères sont arrivés , et des personnages surréalistes en sont sortis (...)
Ils ont parlé avec les chefs , le commandant Henrique , le commandant Cesar .
Ils avaient des T - shirts de Che Guevara et je me suis dit : ' Ça , c'est des FARC ' . "
Les otages sont montés menottés dans un hélicoptère .
" C'EST UN MIRACLE "
" C'était très humiliant ( ... ) .
Quand nous somme montés dans l'hélicoptère , très frustrés , je ne voulais même pas parler aux personnes qui étaient là .
L'hélicoptère s'est envolé , et tout à coup quelque chose s'est passé , je ne me suis pas bien rendu compte de quoi et tout à coup j'ai vu le commandant qui pendant tant d'années avait été si cruel et si humiliant , je l'ai vu au sol , les yeux bandés .
" Je crois que je n'ai même pas été heureuse (...) ; le chef de l'opération a dit : ' Nous sommes l'armée colombienne , vous êtes libres ' et l'hélicoptère est presque tombé !
On a sauté , on a crié , on s'est embrassés , on pouvait pas le croire , c'est un miracle . "
L'ex - otage a insisté sur le rôle essentiel joué par les divers soutiens dont elle a bénéficié pendant ses six ans et demi de captivité .
" Nous pouvions rêver , maintenir l'espoir vivant parce que nous écoutions les nôtres " , a dit Ingrid Betancourt .
" Cette victoire est aussi due aux moyens de communication " , a - t - elle estimé , en évoquant les messages que lui ont adressés les membres de sa famille et le soutien international .
" J'entendais mon ex-époux , Fabrice [ Delloye ] , qui me disait qu'il y avait une photo de moi sur le Mont - Blanc , en France " , a - t - elle raconté .
" Merci la Colombie , merci la France .
Nous les Colombiens , nous savons que nous avons des frères de l'autre côté de l'Atlantique " , a conclu Ingrid Betancourt .

Today , August 19 , marks a very special anniversary for Star Trek fans everywhere .
On this date in 1921 , a man named Eugene Wesley Roddenberry was born in Texas .
Following distinguished service in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II , he became a police officer while trying to start a career writing for television in Hollywood .
When that career began to take off , he quit the police force and wrote full - time , on many different 1950s TV shows .
After a stint on Have Gun , Will Travel , he produced his own series , called The Lieutenant .
When that did n't do very well , he produced a pilot for a science - fiction series , which he famously pitched as " A Wagon Train to the Stars . "
Of course , that series was the original Star Trek , or at least it was after another , different pilot was made .
He was also heavily involved in the films and the other series , right up until his death , of heart failure , on October 24 , 1991 .
Great Bird of the Galaxy , we still miss you .
But wait : there 's more !
Today is also the birthday of Jonathan Frakes , the man behind the beard of Commander William Thelonious Thomas Riker .

There are parts of Maine that could �become uninhabitable � this winter .
The words were those of U.S. Sen .
Olympia Snowe and they came last week at a meeting of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee .
Snowe is the ranking Republican member of the panel .
It was n't rhetoric .
It was a realistic evaluation of what some parts of northern New England may be facing in the winter of 2008 - 2009 .
� When people can't afford the cost of home heating oil , they simply freeze , � Snowe said .
She was n't being dramatic .
She was simply giving us a cold dose of reality .
The threat of home heating oil selling for almost $ 5 a gallon is very real .
As the price of heating fuels rise , some people will be forced to lower their thermostats to unhealthy levels .
Some will even be forced to leave their homes .
The elderly and the poor will be hit the hardest .
Sens .
Snowe and John Kerry of Massachusetts are co-sponsors of a bill to mandate that home heating oil from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve should be released if home heating should reach $ 4 a gallon .
It has already passed that plateau and is continuing to rise .
The Northeast � New England and the central Atlantic states � will be hit hardest again this year .
Some predictions have the cost of heating an average home for the winter reaching $ 3,000 or $ 4,000 .
It is predicted the national average this year will be $ 2,593 � a jump of more than 32 percent over last year .
Many of the people hit hardest will be unable to commit to those costs .
� Consumers and small businesses are being stretched to the limit and beyond , � Snowe said last week , �but nowhere is the ensuing calamity looming larger than in New England , where just getting through this winter is fast becoming our No. 1 priority . �
While Democrats and Republicans squabble over how to best cope with the future , the future for tens of thousands of people in northern New England is only several months away .
And it does n't look good .
While debate rages over the comparative merits of exotic energy sources , offshore drilling , drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve , and nuclear energy , there are people in northern Maine and elsewhere who are struggling to keep out the cold from homes that are a hundred year olds or older .
There is no relief in sight .
OPEC has no plans to increase its level of production , saying prices are n't likely to fall because of the increased demand by China and India .
There are also the influences having nothing to do with supply and demand � the weak American dollar , and the geopolitical situation in the Middle East .
The future is indeed bleak in terms of the cost of energy and our commitment to do anything about it .

We ’ve been listening to your feedback today , about the new jQuery site redesign and one thing has become clear :
Death to JavaScript Rock Stars !
Poor dude did n’t even last 24 hours .
We wanted to have some fun with the home page , but this bordered on a little too “ extreme ” for most tastes .
We plan on bringing some further revisions to the homepage in the future , but in the meantime here ’s a quick overhaul , put together by the always - excellent Scott Jehl , that ’ll help tide everyone over :
As a token of our appreciation for sticking with the “ JavaScript Rock Star ” for a day we ’ve included a little Easter Egg in the new site .
It would be useful if you knew the Konami Code .
Naturally , the whole redesign still has many tweaks that ’ll be made over the next couple weeks , especially to individual page fonts , font sizes , and colors .
I want to , once again , thank Scott Jehl for all the hard work that he ’s been putting in to the site design – and the excellent Varick Rosete ( of nGenWorks and Happy Webbies ) for the great illustration that he drew for us .
Here ’s to many happy days of rockin’ out with jQuery !
Norman Mailer ’s brilliant novel Why Are We in Vietnam ?
does n’t talk explicitly about the Vietnam war ; it tells a story about American culture and the American psyche , thereby producing a devastating critique of the war with the title and last line alone .
In a similar way , it may be easier to understand why America is falling behind at math and science with a few simple stories .
Last week , Robert Bruce Thompson , author of An Illustrated Guide to Home Chemistry Experiments , wrote a guest blog post on makezine.com , Home Science Under Attack , which told the sad story of how a retired chemist was arrested and his lab confiscated because he was doing experiments :
The Worcester Telegram & Gazette reports that Victor Deeb , a retired chemist who lives in Marlboro , has finally been allowed to return to his Fremont Street home , after Massachusetts authorities spent three days ransacking his basement lab and making off with its contents .
Deeb is not accused of making methamphetamine or other illegal drugs .
He ’s not accused of aiding terrorists , synthesizing explosives , nor even of making illegal fireworks .
Deeb fell afoul of the Massachusetts authorities for … doing experiments .
Authorities concede that the chemicals found in Deeb ’s basement lab were no more hazardous than typical household cleaning products .
Despite that , authorities confiscated “ all potentially hazardous chemicals ” ( which is to say the chemicals in Deeb ’s lab ) from his home , and called in a hazardous waste cleanup company to test the chemicals and clean up the lab .
Pamela Wilderman , the code enforcement officer for Marlboro , stated , “ I think Mr. Deeb has crossed a line somewhere .
This is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation . ”
Allow me to translate Ms. Wilderman ’s words into plain English : “ Mr. Deeb has n’t actually violated any law or regulation that I can find , but I do n’t like what he ’s doing because I ’m ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals … ”
I forwarded this message to Dave Farber ’s IP list ( which is now searchable via markmail , the amazing mailing list search engine ! ) , and got back some great stories that I wanted to share .
Armando Stettner wrote one story that illustrates just how much our culture has changed .
His story also involves the cops , but here , they understand and support science .
Too bad that was 40 + years ago :
When I was about 13 or so , I also had a chemistry set in my
basement .
I was living on Long Island – Freeport , to be exact .
I
also remember the hobby shop with ALL sorts of glassware and little
labeled bottles of chemicals .
I had some really neat stuff : all
sorts of chemicals – I seem to remember potassium ferrocyanide with
which I did some chemoluminescence ( I think that ’s one of the
ingredients ) , sodium in liquid form , various acids , a few rolls of
magnesium – not to mention all the paraphernalia : lots of pyrex
stuff , triple beam balances , etc .
All the chemicals were neatly
arranged in this cabinet .
One day , I had mixed a concoction and was carrying it ( premixed ! ) in
a tin coffee can .
Myself and a friend were carrying the stuff to
the train tracks to test it out ( light it ) where it was relatively
safe .
The stuff started getting warm but I thought it was the sun
heading the can up .
Then it started getting REALLY warm .
As it got
hot , I dropped it in the middle of the street .
The stuff flashed
over .
It was VERY cool .
But , I decided I did n’t want to stay around any more and left .
Unfortunately for me , this all occurred in front of the house of
someone who knew me ( she was a ‘ friend ’ of my parents ) .
She called
the cops .
The Freeport police came to my house questioned me and my parents ,
joined in a little while by some county detectives .
They were very
polite .
We took them down to the basement where I showed them all
the stuff .
The uniformed police left and the detectives continued
to look at all the stuff and ask questions .
They called somebody to
ask some advice .
It turns out they called the county labs .
The guy
got off the phone and asked ‘ you ’re not making any drugs down here
are you ? ” I said no !!
He smiled – he winked at my parents .
Then
he said the most unexpected thing : he said the gang at the labs
offered to give me a tour of the labs anytime I wanted .
Then they left asking me to be careful .
For me , it was actually a
positive experience .
Today , I ’m sure I ’d face a visit from the Hazmat teams and the DHS .
And , because of the triple beam balance , my house ( or my parents ’ )
would be confiscated under the forfeiture rules .
At Maker Faire earlier this year , Robert Bruce Thompson gave a talk ( video unfortunately truncated at both ends ) that highlighted how attitudes towards chemistry have changed since he was a kid , starting with a tour of the powerful chemistry sets available in 1964 ( courtesy of the Sears Catalog ) , and tracing the dumbing down and rising fear of liability that doomed them , until , as Kevin Kelly noted in a recent review of Robert ’s book , we reached “ the so - called chemistry sets today which boldly ( and insanely ) advertise they contain ‘ No Chemicals ! ' ”
( Review sent out in Cool Tools email , up on the Cool Tools site soon . )
Why are we failing at math and science ?
Because it is n’t fun any more .
When you put safety on the highest altar , what do you give up ?
When fear of lawsuits — not to mention fear of technology — drives product design , marketing , and public policy , you eliminate science at its roots , in the natural experimentation of kids who want to know how the world works .
Associated Press | August 7 , 2008
NEW YORK — Lawyers for the families of four 9/11 victims are urging a judge to reconsider his decision to reject $ 28.5 million in settlements that he now says are excessive compared with those other survivors received .
U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein had approved four settlements ranging from $ 5.5 million to $ 8 million weeks ago , but reversed himself July 24 , saying the amounts were “ disproportionately large ” and that they “ embarrass and prejudice ” those who settled earlier .
He referred to the four victims as “ modest wage earners at the Pentagon . ”
Their families were among fewer than 100 who sued over deaths or injuries from the Sept. 11 attacks .
More than 5,000 others received money from a special fund established by Congress that distributed more than $ 7 billion .
Hellerstein said individuals who went to court generally won larger awards than those who opted to file claims with the Victim Compensation Fund , but that those who filed lawsuits may have faced more expenses , as well as the added risks and challenges of litigation .
The specifics of settlements that were not rejected have been kept secret .
Hellerstein harshly criticized the lawyers in the four rejected settlements , saying the 25 percent fee they requested was far above the 15 percent given most other lawyers handling the cases .
He accused the lawyers of trying to get a “ very large windfall ” of more than $ 7 million of the total $ 28.5 million agreed to by insurance companies for airlines and airport - security companies .
Baltimore lawyer Jonathan Asrael , who represented the families , said in papers filed in federal court Monday that the settlements were fair and should be reinstated .
“ Vacating settlements which were previously approved for these families has rubbed raw the wounds of September 11 .
It has caused severe upset , disappointment and for some , anger , ” he wrote .
Families who filed lawsuits have said they did so seeking answers rather than money , on matters such as how the terrorists made it through airport checkpoints .
Asrael said the plaintiffs were not available to comment on the judge ’s ruling , but in an affidavit unsealed Wednesday , one of the four plaintiffs , a 57 - year - old woman whose husband worked for the Army at the Pentagon , supported the law firm ’s 25 percent fee .
She said she pursued the suit in part for “ moral reasons of corporate responsibility and a desire that U.S. taxpayers not be required to pay for my family ’s loss , ” adding that she has been satisfied by the outcome .
Even with her lawyers ’ 25 percent fee , she wrote , she is still getting about $ 1.75 million more than she would have had she followed the mediator ’s recommendation .
“ My attorneys ’ fees were agreed at 25 percent , were earned at 25 percent and I request that Your Honor please pay these attorneys ’ fees at 25 percent of my recovery , ” she wrote April 16 .
“ Ultimately , I believe that ‘ a deal is a deal . ’
I received what I bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well . ”
Hellerstein said he was concerned that the hefty sums would not be fair to the plaintiffs who settled their lawsuits long ago .
“ Although I approved the settlements , I did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them , ” he wrote .
He also scolded the lawyers for “ coasting ” on the efforts of the attorneys who handled the previous settlements , essentially accusing them of playing a waiting game in order to get more money for their clients .
In response , Asrael said his law firm had done considerably more work than most other lawyers in the cases , including participating in depositions of airport workers who had screened the hijackers of the plane that struck the Pentagon .
With the seven - year anniversary of the 2001 attacks just weeks away , Hellerstein ’s ruling provided a status report on the more than 10,000 lawsuits slowly winding through the courts .
He said settlements had been reached in all but a dozen of the 95 wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits he oversees stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks .
The judge also is responsible for thousands of lawsuits brought by workers involved in the search , rescue and clean - up efforts at the World Trade Center after the attacks .
Hellerstein frequently comments on the shortcomings of the legal process after a national tragedy .
“ The wounds of 9/11 will not easily be assuaged , ” the judge wrote in his July 24 ruling .
“ But neither should they be exacerbated by rich rewards of fees and benign indifference to unreasonably large awards . ”

While Artist - in - Residence at Cornell 's arts dorm , I was expected to come up with stimulating art - related programs for the students to participate in .
" Letters to Walken " allowed them the chance to write their yearly Christmas letter to Christopher Walken .
DENVER -- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama used his editing pen on Cleveland Congressman Dennis Kucinich 's speech Tuesday night , according to The Hill , a Washington , D.C. , newspaper .
The Obama campaign has been looking closely at speeches during the convention , trying to keep them on message .
The campaign struck this line , addressing Republicans , from Kucinich 's speech :
" They 're asking for another four years -- in a just world , they 'd get 10 to 20 . "
Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano signed a bill today that prohibits the implementation of the REAL ID in Arizona .
SB2677 received a Final vote of approval in the House last week by an overwhelming margin of 51 to 1 .
Napolitano 's signature was uncertain until today when she signed the bill into law .
The bill prohibits implementation of the REAL ID Act of 2005 , which was passed by Congress as part of a supplemental spending bill for tsunami relief and the War on Terror .
The bill did not receive a hearing in either the House or the Senate , and the public was largely unaware of it until it had already been signed into law .
" Everyone thinks that the REAL ID is just about protecting us against terrorism , " said co-sponsor Senator Karen Johnson ( R - 18 ) .
" But it really represents a cash cow for technology companies as well as the birth of the National ID card , complete with all the biometric information that technology can handle ­ face recognition , fingerprints , etc . "
" Corporations which specialize in selling identity cards stand to gain millions of dollars in profits if the Real ID Act is implemented , " said Johnson , " so , of course , they 're eager for everyone to be required to carry a National ID card everywhere they go . "
Two of those corporations are Digimarc ID Systems and L - 1 ­ the Number 1 and Number 2 companies for the manufacture of state driver 's licenses and identity cards .
L - 1 is considered the main driver behind the REAL ID and last year had nearly $ 100 million in federal contracts involving identity cards .
Digimarc spent $ 350,000 in the first six months of 2007 lobbying Congress on the Real ID Act .
Apparently the two companies are soon to be merged , resulting in a powerhouse corporation , pushing the " identification - as - security " concept to the maximum in order to increase company profits as they add more and more biometric features to state driver 's licenses .
" It 's misguided to think that identification equals security , " says Johnson .
" Identification is just identification ­ it does n't prove intent and it does n't stop terrorists .
Indeed , terrorists will forge documents ­ as they always have ­ to obtain the identification they want to commit crimes .
Making U.S. citizens carry identity papers to board a plane or enter a government building stinks , " says Johnson .
" It 's odious , onerous , and a violation of our civil liberties . "
" I refuse to be tagged and numbered , " said Johnson .
" Requiring people to carry papers takes away their freedom .
There are other , better ways to stop terrorism and to protect us against criminals .
The federal government needs to butt out and let the states handle driver licensing .
It 's not the business of the Dept. of Homeland Security to tell us how to run our state . "
Real ID ­ SB2677 1 . Proponents always claim that the sole purpose of the Real ID is to prevent another 9/11 - type attack by disrupting terrorists travel .
That is bogus .
If the government really wanted to prevent such an attack , they would secure our borders , which would ( 1 ) cost less than implementing Real ID , ( 2 ) would be more effective at keeping terrorists out , and ( 3 ) would be less intrusive and less inconvenient for American citizens .
Until the borders are secure , all the rosy pleas for the Real ID are just so much hogwash .
2 . The Real ID will cost the states billions of dollars .
The Dept. of Transportation estimates that in Arizona alone , it will cost $ 40 to $ 70 million to implement just in the first year , and $ 15 to $ 20 million in subsequent years .
But they really do n't have a clue ­ they do n't know what the regulations are going to be yet .
They are just estimating .
It will depend on what the Rules say when they are finally issued .
They already do some things that will be part of the requirements .
For example , they already check citizenship , or whether or not someone is legally authorized to be in the country .
So that would not be an additional expense .
But even factoring in that some things required by REAL ID are already being handled , the $ 40 to $ 70 million is over and above what we already do !!!
3 . The Real ID is an invasion of privacy .
Why should so much personal information be compiled on one place for so many people to have access to ?
* medical history * social security number * insurance information 4 . The Real ID increases the risk of Identity Theft .
Identity theft is a major problem in Arizona already .
Throwing everyone 's personal information ­ including social security numbers , birth dates , medical information , driver 's license and auto licensing information , etc .
­ into one massive data base just makes it easier for identity thieves to harvest identities for fraudulent purposes .
The Real ID requires all Arizona driver 's license information to be compiled with all the information for the other 49 states and the District of Columbia into one massive database that will be accessible by thousands of clerks and government employees throughout the country .
This is a horrendous idea ­ an invitation to identity theft on a massive scale .

Despite the fact gas prices have declined for nearly a month and a half straight – falling from a record high of $ 4.12 per gallon on July 16 , to today ’s average price of $ 3.69 per gallon – according to a recent poll on Daily Fuel Economy Tip , roughly two - thirds of drivers believe we wo n’t see much more relief by the end of the year , if we see any at all .
The poll very simply asked , “ What will the national average gas price be on January 1 , 2009 ? ”
Here ’s how over a hundred readers responded :
66 % believe gas prices will be in excess of $ 3.50
17 % believe gas prices will be between $ 3.26 and $ 3.50
11 % believe gas prices will be less than $ 3
6 % believe gas prices will be between $ 3.00 and $ 3.25
To put things in perspective , between 11 and 17 percent of respondents believe we will be paying less for gas on January 1 , 2009 than we were on January 1 , 2008 , when the national average stood at $ 3.05 per gallon .
Considering the price of gas would have to fall by about 20 % from today ’s price , it seems pretty hard to believe that we ’ll see $ 3 gas this coming January .
Should prices fall to $ 3 , that would mark a nearly 30 % drop from July ’s record high price .
However , while it ’s unlikely we ’ll see sub - $ 3 gas within the next four months , it ’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility .
In order to stand a good chance of getting to $ 3 gas , I think the following things would have to occur :
The United States would have to get through this hurricane season without much damage to the Gulf Coast ’s oil refineries Geopolitical tensions – especially with Iran and Russia – would need to ease a bit .
The dollar would have to continue to strengthen The U.S. economy would have to stay weak American drivers would have to continue buying more fuel efficient vehicles and driving less
Again , it ’s not out of the realm of possibility , however , the chances of all five of these things happening are slim to none .
Now that Amazon ’s Elastic Block Store ( EBS ) is publicly available , running a complete Django installation on Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) is easier than ever .
Why EBS ?
EBS provides persistent storage , which means that the Django database is kept safe even after the Django EC2 instances terminate .
This tutorial will take you through all the necessary steps for setting up Django with a persistent PostgreSQL database on AWS .
I will be assuming no prior knowledge of AWS , so those of you who have dabbled with it before might want to skim through the first steps .
Knowing your way around Django is an advantage but not a requirement .
I am deliberately keeping things simple — to get a deeper understanding of the hows and whys of AWS you should take a look at James Gardner ’s excellent article as well as the official documentation .
The command line tools can be a bit intimidating so I will also show you how Elasticfox can be a fully satisfactory alternative .
Summary
We are going to register with AWS , get acquainted with Elasticfox , start up an EC2 instance , install Django and PostgreSQL on the instance , and finally mount an EBS drive and move our database to it .
Step 1 : Set up an AWS account
To use AWS you need to register at the AWS web page .
If you already have an account with Amazon you can extend this to also cover AWS .
Step 2 : Download and install the Elasticfox Firefox extension
This tool will make life a whole lot easier for you .
Down the road there is no avoiding the official command line tools or alternatively boto if you want to access AWS programmatically .
For now , let ’s stick with Elasticfox .
You can install the extension from this page .
Step 3 : Add your AWS credentials to Firefox
Launch Elasticfox ( ‘ Tools ’ -> ‘ Elasticfox ’) and click on the ‘ credentials ’ button .
Enter your account name ( typically the email address you registered with ) , AWS access key and AWS secret access key .
This information can be found via the ‘ Your web services account ’ on the AWS start page .
Step 4 : Create a new EC2 security group
Let ’s pause for a while to consider what we are doing .
You will be running your Django installation off an EC2 instance .
There is no magic to them at all — they are simply fully functional servers that you access the same way as , say , a dedicated server or a web hosting account .
By default , EC2 instances are an introverted lot :
They prefer keeping to themselves and do n’t expose any of their ports to the outside world .
We will be running a web application on port 8000 so therefore port 8000 has to be opened .
( Normally we would be opening port 80 , but since I will only be using the Django development web server then port 8000 is preferable ) .
SSH access is also essential , so port 22 should be opened as well .
To make this happen we must create a new security group where these ports are opened .
Click on the ‘ Security Groups ’ tab and then the ‘ Refresh ’ icon .
The list should update to show you the ‘ default ’ group .
Then click the ‘ Create Security Group ’ icon and create a new group named ‘ django ’ .
Now we need to add the actual permissions .
Click the ‘ Grant Permission ’ icon and add ‘ From port 8000 to 8000 ’ under ‘ Protocol Details ’ .
Repeat the same action for port 22 .
Your security group is now ready for use .
Step 5 : Set up a key pair
Having a security group is not enough ; we also have to set up a key pair to access the instance via SSH .
Why is this necessary ?
Think about it :
You are launching a server instance but no one has told you the root password .
So , setting up a private / public key pair is the only way to gain access .
Click on the ‘ KeyPairs ’ tab and then the ‘ Create a new keypair ’ icon .
Name your new key pair ‘ django - keypair ’ .
A save dialog will pop up , allowing you to save the private key in a safe location .
Use the filename ‘ django.pem ’.
Step 6 : Launch an EC2 instance
I have a certain fondness for Fedora , so I ’ll be using the fedora-8 - i386 - base - v1.07 AMI with AMI ID ami -2b5 fba42 .
Return to the ‘ AMIs and Instances ’ tab .
If you click the ‘ Refresh ’ icon in the ‘ Machine Images ’ section you will get a list of all public images .
To find the one we ’re after , enter ‘ fedora - 8 ’ in the search box — after a while all the relevant images will appear .
Right - click the image with the AMI ID as above and select ‘ Launch instance (s ) of this AMI ’ .
This is where the actions from the previous steps start making sense .
Set the key pair to ‘ django - keypair ’ and add the ‘ django ’ security group to the launch set .
Leave all the other settings as they are .
Then click the ‘ Launch ’ button .
Important : From this point and on the meter will be running !
If the fire alarm goes off , you get bored with this tutorial , or whatever :
Do remember to shut down the instance before you leave , otherwise it will cost you $ 2.40 per day .
The ‘ Your Instances ’ section should update , showing you that the instance you just launched is ‘ pending ’ .
Click the ‘ Refresh ’ icon after a while — in a minute or so the status should change to ‘ running ’ .
Step 7 : Connect with your new instance
Double click on the running instance and copy the ‘ Public DNS Name ’ entry .
This is the domain name you use to access the instance from the outside .
In this tutorial , my instance is hosted at ‘ ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com ’.
Now we are going to SSH into the instance .
I am doing this via Cygwin on Windows , but any SSH client should do .
If you are on Windows and have Putty installed you can even launch directly from Elasticfox by right - clicking on the running instance and selecting ‘ SSH to Public DNS Name ’ .
Let ’s start with a basic sanity check :
$ ssh root@ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com
The authenticity of host 'ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws . com ( 75.101.248.101 ) ' can't be established .
RSA key fingerprint is db:0a:85:36:99:5f:65:6b:c7:77:3e:37:59 :fc:16 : fd .
Are you sure you want to continue connecting ( yes / no ) ? yes Warning : Permanently added 'ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws . com,75.101.248.101 ' ( RSA ) to the list of known hosts .
Permission denied ( publickey , gssapi - with - mic ) .
As expected , this is n’t working ; we need to use the private key you saved earlier .
Go to the directory where you saved the django.pem file and type the following :
$ ssh -i django - keypair.pem root@ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com __| __|_ ) Fedora 8 _| ( / 32-bit ___|\___|___|
Welcome to an EC2 Public Image : -)
Base [ root@ ~ ]#
That ’s better !
If you try pointing your browser towards ‘ http://ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/’ you should get a ‘ ca n’t establish a connection ’ error since there is no web server running on port 8000 as of yet .
Step 8 : Install required software
Most AMI instances are stripped to the bone , so we have to add the software packages we need to get Django up and running .
The steps required will of course vary from AMI to AMI , but running the following script as root is sufficient for our v1.07 Fedora 8 instance :
# Install subversion yum -y install subversion # Install , initialize and launch PostgreSQL yum -y install postgresql postgresql - server service postgresql initdb service postgresql start # Modify PostgreSQL config to avoid username / password problems # Note :
This grants access to _all_ local traffic !
cat >
/ var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
<< EOM local all all trust host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust EOM # Restart PostgreSQL to enable new security policy service postgresql restart #
Set up a database for Django psql - U postgres -c " create database djangotest encoding ' utf8 ' " # Install Django ( I always checkout from SVN ) cd /opt svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ django-trunk ln -s /opt/django-trunk/django
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django ln -s /opt/django-trunk/django/bin/django-admin.py
/usr/local / bin # Install psycopg2 ( for database access from Python ) yum -y install python - psycopg2
Step 9 : Set up a Django project
First we set up an account for our test Django project :
[ root ~ ] # useradd djangotest [ root ~ ] # su - djangotest [ djangotest ~ ] $
For the full story on how to create a new Django project you should have a look at the official tutorial .
For now , just execute the following as the ‘ djangotest ’ user :
[ djangotest ~ ] $ django - admin.py startproject mysite
Now we have all we need to test if the installation is working .
Launch the development server like this :
[ djangotest ~ ] $ python mysite / manage .py runserver ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000
Validating models ... 0 errors found Django version 1.0 - beta_1-SVN -8461 , using settings ' mysite.settings '
Development server is running at http://ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C .
Note that I am using the full external domain name with the ‘ runserver ’ command .
Visit ‘ http://ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/’ with your browser and you should see the regular Django ‘ It worked ! ’ page .
Note : Please do n’t use the Django development server in a production setting .
In fact , you probably should n’t use it on anything that is exposed to the outside world .
The only reason I am doing it this way in this tutorial is to keep things simple — normally you should set up a proper web server such as Apache or Lighttpd .
Refer to the Django documentation for information on how to do this .
Step 10 : Create a Django application
I will show you how to put the Django database in persistent storage later on , so we have to set up a simple database - backed Django application .
Modify mysite / settings.py as follows :
DATABASE_ENGINE = ' postgresql_psycopg2 ' DATABASE_NAME = ' djangotest ' DATABASE_USER = ' postgres ' DATABASE_PASSWORD
= '' ...
INSTALLED_APPS = ( ' django.contrib.admin' , ' django.contrib.auth ' , ...
Then modify mysite / urls.py to allow access to the admin GUI :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * #
Uncomment the next two lines to enable the admin : from django.contrib import admin admin.autodiscover ( ) urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , # Example : # ( r'^mysite / ' , include ('mysite.foo.urls ' ) ) , # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation : # ( r' ^admin/doc / ' , include ( 'django.contrib.admindocs.urls ' ) ) , # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin : ( r'^admin / ( .* ) ' , admin.site.root ) , )
Now we have to sync the database :
[ djangotest ~ ] $ python mysite / manage .py syncdb
You will be asked to create an admin user — set both the username and the password to ‘ djangotest ’ .
Then create a Django app :
[ djangotest ~ ] $ python mysite / manage .py startapp myapp
If you got the preceding steps right , you should now be able to log on to the admin GUI at http://ec2-75-101-248-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/admin/ with the ‘ djangotest ’ user .
Add a new user to verify that the database connection works — we will be needing that new user later on .
Step 11 : Create and mount an EBS instance
This is where things get really cool !
There is a huge problem with our current setup :
Once you shut down the AMI instance , all the data in our database will disappear .
Enter EBS .
EBS lets you define a persistent storage volume that can be mounted by EC2 instances .
If we move our database files to an EBS volume then they will persist no matter what happens to our EC2 instances .
First , go back to Elasticfox and make a note of the availability zone of your running instance — this should be something like ‘ us - east - 1 b ’ .
Then click on the ‘ Volumes and Snapshots ’ tab .
Click the ‘ Create Volume ’ icon and create a 1GB volume that belongs to the same availability zone as your instance .
Right - click the new volume and choose ‘ Attach this volume ’ .
This will let you attach the volume to the running instance .
Use / dev/sdh as the mount point .
Refresh after a couple of seconds and the ‘ Attachment status ’ should have changed to ‘ attached ’ .
Go back to your terminal and create an ext3 filesystem on the new volume :
[ root ~ ] # mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdh mke2fs 1.40.4 ( 31 - Dec - 2007 ) / dev / sdh is entire device , not just one partition !
Proceed anyway ?
( y , n ) y Filesystem label= OS type : Linux Block size=4096 ( log=2 ) Fragment size=4096 ( log=2 ) 131072 inodes , 262144 blocks 13107 blocks ( 5.00 % ) reserved for the super user First data block=0 Maximum filesystem blocks =268435456 8 block groups 32768 blocks per group , 32768 fragments per group 16384 inodes per group Superblock backups stored on blocks : 32768 , 98304 , 163840 , 229376
Writing inode tables : done Creating journal ( 8192 blocks ) : done Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information : done
This filesystem will be automatically checked every 35 mounts or 180 days , whichever comes first .
Use tune2 fs -c or - i to override .
All that remains is to mount the filesystem , in this case to /vol :
[ root ~ ] # echo " / dev/sdh / vol ext3 noatime 0 0 " >>
/etc/ fstab [ root ~ ] # mkdir / vol [ root ~ ] # mount / vol [ root ~ ] # df -- si Filesystem Size Used Avail Use % Mounted on / dev/sda1 11G 1.4G 8.8G 14 % / /dev/sda2 158G 197M 150G 1 % / mnt none 895M 0 895M 0 % /dev/shm / dev/sdh 1.1G 35 M 969M 4 % /vol
Step 12 : Moving the database to persistent storage
First make sure that PostgreSQL is stopped :
[ root ~ ] # service postgresql stop Stopping postgresql service : [ OK ]
You should also terminate your Django development server in case it is still running .
Now move the PostgreSQL database files to the EBS volume mounted at /vol :
[ root ~ ] # mv / var / lib / pgsql /vol
For this to work we have to make a small modification to the / etc / init.d / postgresql file — make sure that the lines starting at around line 100 look exactly like this :
... #
Set defaults for configuration variables PGENGINE=/usr / bin PGPORT=5432 PGDATA=/var/lib/pgsql if [ -f " $ PGDATA / PG_VERSION " ] &amp ; &amp ; [ -d " $ PGDATA / base / template1 " ] then echo " Using old - style directory structure " else PGDATA=/ var/lib/pgsql/data fi PGDATA=/vol/pgsql/data
PGLOG=/vol/pgsql/pgstartup.log ...
Note that this is a Fedora - specific hack — the main idea is to have the $ PGDATA system variable point at / vol / pgsql / data .
For other databases the procedure will differ .
A similar procedure for MySQL is available here .
PostgreSQL can now be restarted :
[ root ~ ] # service postgresql start Starting postgresql service : [ OK ]
To verify that Django is using the same database as before you can revisit the admin GUI — the new user you added previously should still be available .
And there you have it !
Step 13 : Shutting down
For completeness ’ sake , let ’s review the steps required to shut everything down .
First , stop the database server and unmount the EBS volume :
[ root ~ ] # service postgresql stop Stopping postgresql service : [ OK ] [ root ~ ] # umount /vol
Then return to Elasticfox , right - click the EBS volume and select ‘ Detach this instance ’ .
When you are done with this tutorial you can delete the volume instance as well — having it in storage will cost you money .
Finally , go to the ‘ AMIs and Instances ’ tab and terminate the running instance .
That should conclude your current transaction with AWS .
( Refresh the volume and instances sections to verify that everything has really shut down ) .
Final words
If you now repeat steps 6 to 11 you should be able to launch a brand new EC2 instance that uses the database on your stored volume — this is left as an exercise for the reader .
The only deviations from the procedure are that you should n’t have to run the PostgreSQL ‘ initdb ’ command , or create the ‘ djangotest ’ database .
This has been a bare - bones introduction to how EBS lets you run a persistent Django installation on AWS .
In real life , the following issues have to be considered :
Use a proper web server .
Make sure the web server log files , database log , django logs etc. are moved to persistent storage as well .
Create a custom AMI that is properly set up for your Django project ( so that you do n’t have to do the full setup procedure every time you launch an instance ) .
Then there ’s scaling , backup , and so on .
Nonetheless , hopefully this article should be enough to get you started .
Addendum
A reader pointed out that the PostgreSQL user home directory should also be changed .
While I have n’t tried this myself , the correct procedure is probably to do a usermod -d / vol / pgsql postgres as root .
Several people have sent a link to this post on the Time Magazine effort to push national service .
In an addition to violating liberties on a massive scale , this program would be a colossal waste .
It will rob young people of their most important years early in life , taking them out of productive work and making them less able to offer anything to the marketplace after : an extension of an already catastrophic system of publicly funded education , which already drains brain power and time .
That both the left and right favor this scheme perfectly illustrates the intellectual bankruptcy and state - worshiping mentality of these people .
Fear the future under their rule .

What are these ?
Sylvia Stocking and Matthew Skaggs
By Ray Stern
The couple pictured above not only allowed their 2 - year - old daughter to ingest marijuana , police say , but exposed the kid to " horrendously unhealthy " conditions inside their El Mirage home .
Bill Louis , El Mirage 's assistant police chief , says the home barely had any furnishings .
The child 's room was among the worst in the house , containing " soiled diapers , dog feces , spoiled food and drug paraphernalia , " he says .
TV stations and newspapers covering the story since yesterday have dutifully reported that marijuana was found in the home , along with assorted paraphernalia .
So this is a story about the depths of hardcore marijuana addiction , right ?
Wrong .
Though local news outlets have yet to report it , the couple 's home contained a lot more than just weed .
The El Mirage police report on the couple lists several other items seized from the home , Louis says , after he was contacted by New Times :
A meth pipe .
A white powdery substance in clear , plastic baggies .
Razor blades in at least two different locations in the house .
And what Louis calls a " dope- cooking spoon . "
This couple , who were arrested and charged with a slew of crimes , apparently had problems that went far beyond using marijuana , he says .
Trouble is , you would n't know that just from reading the Arizona Republic or watching TV news .

This post was provided by one of our paid sponsors , Ecomugs , a company that offers lead - free mugs as a green alternative to disposable cups , while at the same time providing a healthy work environment and support system for recovering alcoholics .
Here is good news for offices taking steps towards going green – a blossoming company in California makes eco-friendly coffee mugs featuring your logo and employee name .
There ’s no minimum order required , so even the smallest startups can take advantage of Ecomugs handy dual purpose – the mugs are valuable promotional tools that also serve as a highly effective way to let your customers know that you are doing your part for the environment .
Styrofoam – Alarming Statistics
Did you know that over 25,000,000 styrofoam cups go into landfills every year ?
Styrofoam makes up 25 % of our landfill space and is not recyclable , so any cup you use today will still be around 500 years from now .
Incinerating styrofoam is not an acceptable alternative to burying the impervious material , as it gives off over 90 different hazardous chemicals , including styrene vapors and dioxin .
Ecomugs Provide a Solution to the Styrofoam Epidemic
Ecomugs are made of lead - free ceramic and are personalized with water - soluble inks that are dishwasher safe .
The company ’s founder , Kirk Meyer , put together a system to economically imprint one personalized mug at a time .
Meyer ’s inspiration for Ecomugs came from a sign he saw in a hospital requesting patients and visitors to reuse their styrofoam cups .
As we all know , styrofoam is made to be thrown away , and does n’t hold up well to repeated use .
He knew there was a better way to handle office coffee consumption .
Meyer made the first few mugs himself and passed them out for free .
His product testers liked both the personalization and practicality so much that it was n’t long before orders began pouring in .
Nowadays , Ecomugs employees are trained in - house and hired from local recovery centers and women ’s shelters .
Ecomugs is in talks with the nonprofit Safe Havens to create a women ’s shelter in the Spring of 2008 , complete with in - house employee living , mug administration , production , life and work training and 12 - step fellowship meetings .

Statistics for this article were taken from The Life Cycle of Styrofoam by Andrea Kremer , San Francisco State University , 2003 .
( CNN ) -- Authorities identified 18 - year - old Kia Johnson as the woman found tied up with her uterus cut open inside a Pennsylvania apartment , the Allegheny County Medical Examiner 's office said Sunday .
The medical examiner says the body found in a Pennsylvania apartment is that of Kia Johnson .
Authorities used dental records to confirm the woman 's identity .
Johnson 's partially eviscerated body was found at the apartment of a Wilkinsburg , Pennsylvania , woman who arrived at a hospital with a newborn infant earlier in the week .
A placenta was found at the scene , the Allegheny County , Pennsylvania , medical examiner said .
Johnson 's body " was in a state of moderate decomposition " and the woman had been dead for about two days , Medical Examiner Karl Williams said in a written statement .
Johnson 's hands and feet were bound by duct tape .
The cause of death remains undetermined , Williams said .
Drugs were found at the scene , and authorities are awaiting toxicology results to determine whether the woman was sedated , he said .
It 's unclear whether the woman was alive when the infant was taken , he added .
The body was found Friday at an apartment belonging to a woman with a history of attempting to steal newborns , according to court records obtained by Pittsburgh Tribune - Review .
Andrea Curry - Demus , 38 , is charged with endangering the welfare of a child , a felony , and dealing in infant children , a misdemeanor .
Court records show that she was arraigned on the felony charge Friday and is next set to appear in court on Thursday .
She is being held at the Allegheny County Jail , WTAE reported .
Watch Andrea Curry - Demus being taken into custody »
According to a criminal complaint , Curry - Demus was taken by ambulance to a local hospital Wednesday with the baby , claiming it was hers .
Tests at the hospital proved that she was not the mother , and police were notified .
Curry - Demus told Grande she had suffered a miscarriage in June and " did not want her mother to get upset . "
In the complaint , Detective Rich Grande said Curry - Demus told him she purchased the baby from a woman named Tina for $ 1,000 .
Morton said fingerprint testing had ruled out a woman named Tina Carter , one of two other pregnant black women who have been reported missing in the area .
Do n't Miss WTAE : Autopsy provides clues
On Wednesday , Curry - Demus said , Tina showed up with her newborn wrapped in a towel and left .
Curry - Demus said she called medics because the baby was still " dirty from birth , " the complaint said .
The baby is in good condition , a hospital spokeswoman said , and will be released to child welfare workers when he is ready .
Reporters visiting Curry - Demus ' apartment earlier Friday had noticed flies and smelled an odor from the sidewalk below , WTAE said .
Police Chief Ophelia Coleman said the body was not found earlier because Curry - Demus ' sister led them to another apartment .
Friends and relatives said Curry - Demus had told them she was pregnant for months , even having a baby shower .
" I went to the baby shower and her wedding , " Ivee Blunt said .
" I had no idea something like this could happen .
I 'm totally shocked .
And she was so nice and kind .
It 's just unbelievable . "
But Stephanie Epps , Curry - Demus ' sister - in - law , said Curry - Demus would never allow her to touch her stomach .
" Pregnant women do things like that , " she said .
" They 're happy because they 're pregnant .
But she would never do none of that . "
As she was led out of the Wilkinsburg Police Department , Curry - Demus told reporters , " I did n't do nothing , " according to WTAE .
According to court records obtained by the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review , Curry - Demus became pregnant at 12 and miscarried four months later .
She had a second miscarriage in 1990 , when she was 21 , the paper said .
Only a few months after the second miscarriage , Curry - Demus befriended a woman who had just given birth but later attacked her with a knife and tried to steal the baby , the paper said , citing the court records .
The woman 's husband intervened , and she fled , the newspaper reported .
The next day , she went to a hospital and befriended a woman who had brought her 3 - week - old daughter to the hospital to be treated for meningitis , the Tribune - Review said .
When the woman went home for the night , Curry - Demus left the hospital with the baby .
It was found at her home , unharmed , the following day .
In 1991 , according to the records , she pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from both incidents and was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison , the newspaper reported .
She was paroled in August 1998 and ordered to serve 10 years of probation , the paper said .
Curry - Demus was examined by psychiatrists at the Allegheny County Jail before her sentencing and was diagnosed with severe depression , personality disorders and auditory hallucinations , the newspaper reported , citing court records .
She told doctors she spent a lot of time thinking about her miscarriages and " kept hearing babies cry , " the Tribune - Review said .
Wilkinsburg is just east of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Earlier this year , a Kansas woman was sentenced to death in the 2004 killing of a Missouri woman whose baby was cut from her womb .
Lisa Montgomery was convicted in October in the death of Bobbie Jo Stinnett , 23 , who was found strangled in her Skidmore , Missouri , home .
Stinnett 's womb was cut open , and her unborn child was missing .
Montgomery was found days later at home in Kansas , where she was attempting to pass the baby off as her own .
CNN 's Christina Chinnici and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report .

A successful face transplant in a 30 - year - old Chinese man who was attacked by the bear in October 2004 .
SOME MAY FIND THE FOLLOWING IMAGES DISTURBING .
The surgery included connection of arteries and veins , repair of the nose , lip , and sinuses , as well as other structures in the damaged part of the face .
Although not without complications , face transplants can be used successfully in severe disfigurement , the researchers said .
Four different drugs were used to modulate the immune system and decrease the chances of the body rejecting the partial transplant .
This 29 - year - old male patient had a facial tumour called a neurofibroma , which was infiltrating the middle and lower part of his face .
A year after a partial face transplant , the patient regained good movement and sensation in his face .

What are these ?
Despite a sentence that effectively means convicted war criminal Salim Hamdan could be a free man before the end of this year , the future of Osama bin Laden ’s driver is far from clear .
Hamdan was found guilty Wednesday of providing " material support " for the al - Qaeda terrorist organization  but acquitted on the more serious charge of conspiracy that alleged he was part of the al - Qaeda effort to attack the United States .
A panel of six Pentagon - appointed military officers sentenced the 40 - year - old Yemeni to five and a half years in prison .
Given credit for the five years he has already served at the U.S. Navy ’s detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Hamdan ’s release date could be later this year .
But the George W. Bush administration has said it has no intention of releasing Hamdan .
Since he has been designated an " unlawful enemy combatant , " he could be held until the end of the " war on terror . "
And what would constitute that end remains undefined .
What appears clear is that , if Hamdan is to be held beyond his release date , his attorneys will appeal to both the U.S. military and civilian court systems .
Hamdan ’s was the first trial held at Guantanamo in seven years , and the first convened by the U.S. since Nazi leaders were tried at Nuremberg after the World War Two .
Government prosecutors asked for a sentence of 30 years to life in prison for Hamdan .
In the aftermath of Hamdan ’s trial , human rights groups and legal scholars voiced sharp criticism of the trial and the process through which Hamdan was brought to trial  and predicted that his legal journey was far from over .
Critics said the trial  which featured secret and hearsay evidence , closed proceedings , and the introduction of evidence obtained through coercion  was a demonstration of the flawed military commission process designed by the Bush administration .
" For all the government ’s attempts to paint the commissions as another Nuremberg , they remain utterly outside the law and will be mired in challenges for years to come , " Vincent Warren , executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights , an advocacy group that has mobilized many of the defense attorneys for Guantanamo inmates , told IPS .
" Hamdan was convicted based on laws that were passed long after he was picked up , and the commission allowed coerced evidence  both illegal under not only international law , but U.S. law , as well , " Warren stressed .
His view was echoed by Larry Cox , executive director of Amnesty International USA .
He said , " Hamdan ’s trial revealed what is common knowledge  the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law .
Hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention , only to face a process that falls far short .
So far the trial continues the Bush administration ’s efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice . "
" The trial was a show trial .
The rules of evidence are so tilted in the government ’s favor that the tribunal is ill - designed for getting at truth , " Brian J. Foley , visiting associate professor at Boston University law school , told IPS .
" It ’s hard to credit any verdict , though it ’s telling that the executive failed to win the entire case even in its contrived system , " Foley explained , adding , " That , however , in no way proves the system is fair or that it works . "
But others who support the military commission system termed verdict legitimate and fair .
For example , Washington lawyer David Rivkin , a consistent supporter of the administration ’s detention policies , said , " This is an enormously compelling indication of how independent the process has been . "
Deputy White House spokesman Tony Fratto described the trial as fair .
He said it would now open the way for prosecutors to proceed to try about 80 Guantanamo detainees for war crimes .
Nineteen of these have already been charged .
Wednesday ’s verdict and sentence will automatically be appealed to a special military appeals court in Washington .
That court can reduce , but cannot increase , his sentence .
Hamdan can then appeal to U.S. civilian courts as well .
Defense lawyers said Hamdan ’s rights were denied by an unfair process crafted by Congress after several Supreme Court decisions found previous tribunal systems in violation of U.S. and international law .
They criticized the use of interrogations as key to the government ’s case , saying that these were the products of coercive tactics  including sleep deprivation and solitary confinement .
" The problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target Mr. Hamdan , " said Charles Swift , one of Hamdan ’s civilian lawyers .
Swift began his defense of Hamdan as a U.S. Navy officer and continued his representation after he retired from the Navy .
Hamdan was convicted of providing material support to terrorism by driving bin Laden around Afghanistan at the time of the 9/11 attacks .
But , he said he " needed a job " and that he merely had a " relationship of respect " with bin Laden , as would any other employee .
He was acquitted of the far more serious charges of conspiracy to participate in the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. and in other terrorist attacks .
He was also found not guilty on three other counts alleging he knew that his work would be used for terrorism and that he provided surface - to - air missiles to al - Qaeda .
Hamdan has been held at Guantanamo since May 2002 .
The military has not said where he would serve a sentence , but the commander of the detention center , Navy Rear Adm .
David Thomas , said last week that convicted prisoners will be held apart from the general detainee population .
Hamdan has already become an iconic figure in American jurisprudence .
It was the lawsuit he brought against then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 2006 that resulted in the Supreme Court ruling that military commissions set up by the Bush administration to try detainees at Guantanamo Bay lack " the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949 . "
Following that ruling  one of several major legal setbacks for the Bush administration  Congress hastily passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , under which Hamdan was tried .
It is unclear why the government chose a case involving arguably the lowest - level Guantanamo detainee as its first defendant .
But legal authorities speculate that prosecutors saw the Hamdan case as a " test run " for the military commission structure and process .
Many of the cases yet to come to trial involve so - called " high value " detainees , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks .
His case is also far more problematic , since the Bush administration has acknowledged that he was subjected to what it calls " enhanced interrogation techniques , " including waterboarding .

The Tyranny of Good Intentions : How Prosecutors and Law Enforcement are Trampling the Constitution in the Name of Justice .
Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence M. Stratton , New York : Three Rivers Press , 2008 , 264 pages ( paperback ) , $ 16.95 .
In the past six years , I have written a number of articles , papers , and columns about how any pretense of the rule of law in the United States is dead .
This was not always the position I took , but after reading the hardback version of The Tyranny of Good Intentions in 2001 , I realized that not only were the people who were officially entrusted with keeping the law in this country not interested in fulfilling their duties , but that the very nature of law itself in the USA has fundamentally changed .
That change , unfortunately , has been for the worse .
I wish I had more comforting words .
Paul Craig Roberts , an economist and a former assistant secretary of the Treasury during the Reagan administration , and Lawrence M. Stratton , an attorney and currently a Ph.D. candidate in Christian Ethics at Princeton Seminary , have exposed the modern U.S. legal system for the wretched lie that it has become .
From the fraud of the " War on Terror " to the destruction of ancient legal doctrines , Roberts and Stratton document the death of law in the United States .
Before I go through the litany of cases and situations that Roberts and Stratton present , I first must point out that the main service they do is not the presentation of many injustices that are a regular part of U.S. law today — though what they say is important , if not downright discouraging .
( I would warn all readers that they need to prepare to be angry and shocked at the many evils done today in the name of the law .
If a reader has problems with high blood pressure , I would urge that person to stop right here . )
No , the most important thing that Roberts and Stratton do is to educate the reader about the source of U.S. law , how it began , and why it has become so corrupted .
In this review , I will deal first with their vision of the law and the downfall of that vision , before mentioning a few cases .
While we might look back to the signing of the Magna Charta in 1215 as the beginnings of what are called the Rights of Englishmen , perhaps the most influential document in the history of our law was ( I emphasize " was " ) William Blackstone ’s Commentaries on the Laws of England , published between 1765 and 1769 .
As Roberts and Stratton point out , Blackstone believed that the law should be a " shield for the innocent " and that the purpose of law ( and government ) was protection of innocent people ( and their property ) from predators — and from the predatory state .
From Blackstone ’s vision came the view of " innocent until proven guilty , " and the protection of rights for those who were accused .
From Blackstone , we are given the famous quote : " It is better that ten guilty persons escape than one innocent suffer . "
Indeed , the concept Rights of Englishmen has been absolutely vital to the very idea of liberty in this country .
However , there also was a competing vision , one that was drawn up by the " father " of modern government , Jeremy Bentham , a British philosopher of the late 18th and early 19th centuries , the one who penned the term , " utilitarianism . "
Bentham scoffed at the idea of individual rights , and believed that the state needed to be a mechanism by which the largest number of people could be able to experience the greatest pleasure with the least amount of pain .
In Bentham ’s view , the state was to accomplish that purpose by being as unrestrained as possible , led by people whose vision was superior to the vision of ordinary people who did not know better .
Law , in Bentham ’s view , was not to be a " shield " for innocent people , but rather a set of rules that would push people in a certain direction through incentives , both benign and harsh .
Even wrongful convictions of innocent people were not harmful , for they empowered the state and sent a message to everyone else .
For example , readers of this page and ( one would hope ) most Americans recoil at the thought of government using torture to extract confessions .
While Blackstone railed against the use of the " rack " and other such torture devices , Bentham saw torture as useful for the state , to be administered by the Wise State as a mechanism to teach the subjects of a country to obey their political masters .
Another example came with the use of prisons .
Bentham believed that people should be arrested and imprisoned before they committed crimes .
The state would be wise enough to determine who was a threat and who was not , and those people deemed to be a threat to " society " were to be locked up and forced to engage in labor .
Moreover , prisons were not to be dedicated to incarcerating dangerous and violent people ; they were to be used as tool to strengthen the power of the state .
Where Blackstone believed that government should be restrained by natural law , and be a " shield " for the innocent , Bentham saw the state ’s role to be a sword against people who might threaten the well - being of those in political power .
In his view , there was no such thing as " natural law ; " indeed , law was nothing but a set of rules put into place by those who had power .
It does not take a particularly astute person to see which vision has triumphed in the United States .
Roberts and Stratton , after laying out the competing visions of law , demonstrate unequivocally just where U.S. law is headed , and the many injustices that the Benthamite vision has visited upon innocent people .
From the Drug War ( and the policies of asset forfeiture — read that , seizure by government authorities of property under flimsy pretenses of guilt ) to the creation of ex post facto laws to bills of attainder , they document conclusively just how prosecutors , corrupt judges , and the police have destroyed any last vestiges of natural law and constitutional rule .
For example , they deal with the ancient doctrine of mens rea , which meant that in order for a person to be charged with a crime , authorities had to show that he or she intended to commit a crime .
Blackstone wrote that a " vicious will " was necessary for such charges to be made justly .
Bentham thought otherwise .
Today , the U.S. Supreme Court and lawmakers have obliterated mens rea , in the process wiping out a very real protection that individuals had against the predatory state .
In their chapter , " Crimes Without Intent , " Roberts and Stratton outline a number of criminal cases brought in which it was clear that the defendants did not intend to break the law — or even knew they were doing so .
One very sad case involves that of Benjamin Lacy of Linden , Virginia , a 73 - year - old producer of apple juice who was targeted by the Clinton administration and the Environmental Protection Agency in 1994 .
Lacy , who had written down a few wrong numbers on waste water forms ( he received his information over the telephone ) was tried and convicted in federal court for " conspiracy to mislead " the government .
Prosecutors theorized that Lacy was trying to cover up polluting a nearby stream .
However , they never offered proof that the stream was ever polluted , and they were successful in convincing a judge not to permit Lacy to use evidence that no pollution had taken place as a defense .
A sycophantic jury ( What other kind of jury exists these days ? ) believed the prosecutors , and Lacy went to prison , his life ruined .
In case someone thinks Roberts and Stratton exaggerate , perhaps a line from the majority 1957 opinion in Lambert v. California , written by Justice William O. Douglas ( mistakenly called a " libertarian " by many ) will be enlightening : " We do not go with Blackstone in saying that u2018a vicious will ’ is necessary to constitute a crime . "
In fact , while legal historians and others might claim that the Earl Warren Court of the 1950s and 60s expanded the rights of the accused , Roberts and Stratton demonstrate that this court accelerated a trend in which the state — and especially the bureaucracy — gained huge amounts of power against individuals .
When agents of the state are given unlimited power by legislators and judges ( the Constitution be damned or turned into a mechanism by which to expand the powers of the state ) , then one should not be surprised when those agents lie or suborn false testimony .
Throughout this book , Roberts and Stratton document — and I mean document — how the authorities themselves have become the lawless , and the examples are endless .
I must point out — if only because the critics of this review will accuse me of being overly favorable to the authors — that they mention my name in their section on the false prosecution of innocent Duke University students by the infamous Michael B. Nifong .
As readers of my articles already know , Nifong indicted three Duke student - athletes for rape , kidnapping , and sexual assault despite knowing that they were innocent , but needing to bring charges in order to gain enough black votes in Durham County , North Carolina , to win an election .
( The accuser was black , and the defendants were white .
That was enough for the authorities and voters of Durham — and much of the Duke faculty and administration — to conclude that the charges simply had to be true , even if no evidence of a crime existed . )
While I appreciate the authors ’ pointing out my very small role in exposing Nifong ’s predations , I also can say that I would have written this review even had they not mentioned my name .
In fact , I will say here that no book — no book — has influenced me more than their 2000 hardback version of Tyranny , and this book is an improvement over the original .
If a reader wishes to understand the points from which I come as I deal with the legal abominations of the authorities of this country , this book is the best place to start .
I will go farther and say that I really did not understand the law until I read the first version of Tyranny , and that the book gave me the equivalent of a legal education .
Had it not been for Roberts and Stratton , I never would have become involved in the Duke case at all , not because I would have believed Nifong , but rather because I would not have understood the real issues behind the case .
This book is not a politically - motivated polemic , as both conservatives and liberals are exposed .
The modern Drug War is the creation of the Reagan and Bush I administrations , and is championed by most conservatives ( and especially the Christian Right ) .
The legacy of this " war " has been the explosion of the U.S. prison population from about 300,000 when Reagan took office in 1981 , to more than two million today .
Yet , liberals also come under scrutiny .
Roberts and Stratton document the massacre of innocents at the home of the Branch Davidians in Waco , Texas , which liberals championed aggressively .
( I watched the 1995 U.S. Senate hearings on the affair , and Senate Democrats did everything they could to discredit the critics of Janet Reno ’s Department of " Justice " which ordered the attacks . )
The evisceration of mens rea accelerated during the Clinton administration and is a staple today of modern political liberalism , which seeks to criminalize normal business practices and more .
As I warned earlier , a careful reading of this book is guaranteed to raise one ’s awareness — and blood pressure .
I can feel mine rising as I write these words , so I will stop at this point , for the sake of my own health .
I cannot overemphasize just how important this book really is for those who care about liberty and the rule of law .
This is not something which looks at modern law and makes a few recommendations , as though a few " reforms " would make a difference .
No , Roberts and Stratton have attacked the modern tyrannical state root and branch and have demonstrated conclusively not only that the Bentham vision has " won " the legal battle in this country , but just how utterly destructive that " vision " really has become .

Synthetic molecules emulate enzyme behavior for the first time
When chemists want to produce a lot of a substance -- such as a newly designed drug -- they often turn to catalysts , molecules that speed chemical reactions .
Many jobs require highly specialized catalysts , and finding one in just the right shape to connect with certain molecules can be difficult .
Natural catalysts , such as enzymes in the human body that help us digest food , get around this problem by shape - shifting to suit the task at hand .
Chemists have made little progress in getting synthetic molecules to mimic this shape shifting behavior -- until now .
Ohio State University chemists have created a synthetic catalyst that can fold its molecular structure into a specific shape for a specific job , similar to natural catalysts .
In laboratory tests , researchers were able to cause a synthetic catalyst -- an enzyme - like molecule that enables hydrogenation , a reaction used to transform fats in the food industry -- to fold itself into a specific shape , or into its mirror image .
The study appears in the June 25 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
Being able to quickly produce a catalyst of a particular shape would be a boon for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries , said Jonathan Parquette , professor of chemistry at Ohio State .
The nature of the fold in a molecule determines its shape and function , he explained .
Natural catalysts reconfigure themselves over and over again in response to different chemical cues -- as enzymes do in the body , for example .
When scientists need a catalyst of a particular shape or function , they synthesize it through a process that involves a lot of trial and error .
" It 's not uncommon to have to synthesize dozens of different catalysts before you get the shape you 're looking for , " Parquette said .
" Probably the most important contribution this research makes is that it might give scientists a quick and easy way to get the catalyst that they want . "
The catalyst in this study is just a prototype for all the other molecules that the chemists hope to make , said co-author and professor of chemistry T.V. RajanBabu .
" Eventually , we want to make catalysts for many other reactions using the fundamental principles we unearthed here , " RajanBabu said .
For this study , Parquette , RajanBabu , and postdoctoral researcher Jianfeng
Yu synthesized batches of a hydrogenation catalyst in the lab and coaxed the molecules to change shape .
The technique that the chemists developed amounts to nudging certain atoms on the periphery of the catalyst molecule in just the right way to initiate a change in shape .
The change propagates to a key chemical bond in the middle of the molecule .
That bond swings like a hinge , to initiate a twist in one particular direction that spreads throughout the rest of the molecule .
Parquette offered a concrete analogy for the effect .
" Think of the Radio City Rockettes dance line .
The first Rockette kicks her leg in one direction , and the rest of them kick the same leg in the same direction -- all the way down the line .
A change in shape that starts at one end of a molecule will propagate smoothly all the way to the other end . "
In tests , the chemists caused the catalysts to twist one way or the other , either to form one chemical product or its mirror image .
They confirmed the shape of the molecules at each step using techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy .
That 's what the Ohio State chemists find most exciting : the molecule does not maintain only one shape .
Depending on its surroundings -- the chemical " nudges " that it receives on the outside -- it will adjust .
" For many chemical reactions to work , molecules must be able to fit a catalyst like a hand fits a glove , " RajanBabu said .
" Our synthetic molecules are special because they 're flexible .
It does n't matter if the hand is a small hand or a big hand , the ' glove ' will change its shape to fit it , as long as there is even a slight chemical preference for one of the hands .
The ' flexible glove ' will find a way to make a better fit , and so it will assist in specifically making one of the mirror image forms . "
Despite decades of research , scientists are n't sure exactly how this kind of propagation works .
It may have something to do with the polarity of different parts of the molecule , or the chemical environment around the edges of the molecule .
But Parquette says the new study demonstrates that propagation can be used to make synthetic catalysts change shape quickly and efficiently -- an idea that was n't apparent before .
The use of adaptable synthetic molecules may even speed the discovery of new catalysts .
What do you get when you cross a bus with a train ?
A dual - mode vehicle that has the versatility of a bus , the speed of light rail and fuel economy vastly better than either .
Toyota and its truck - making subsidiary Hino Motors have signed on with Japan Rail Hokkaido to develop the vehicles , which carry 25 people and reportedly burn one - fourth the amount of diesel fuel required by conventional buses .
Japan Rail started testing them about 18 months ago , and bringing Toyota aboard could speed up development and commercialization of what may be the mass transit vehicle of the future .
Dual - mode vehicles have four rubber tires for road use and four steel wheels for the rails , and it takes less than 15 seconds to go from road to rail and back again .
It drives just like a bus on the road , and a hydraulic system raises the tires and lowers the steel wheels as the driver guides the vehicle onto the tracks .
Japan Rail provides rail service for the island of Hokkaido , and about one - third of its lines carry less than 500 people .
It developed the dual - mode vehicles as a means of cutting costs on those lines without reducing service .
The vehicles use a Toyota microbus body and axles built by Hino .
The two companies will help Japan Rail refine the technology and increase passenger capacity with an eye toward commercial production .
" Our contribution is expected to be another step toward more practical use of the dual mode vehicle , " company spokesman Kenichiro Baba told AFP .
Combing the versatility of a bus with the speed of a train has allowed Japan Rail to tailor routes and services to the communities it serves .
Rather than scuttling service on under-utilized lines , Japan Rail has simply switched to smaller vehicles .
Dual - mode vehicles would be a great addition to America 's mass transit infrastructure .
It would make rail transit feasible in those areas that do n't have the population density to support a lot of stations , and make mass transit a more viable option for exurbs .
Riders could simply hop on at a bus stop in their neighborhood , then ride the rails to their destination .

Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is slated to meet with Barack Obama .
McCain is winning — in Israel
While the European leg of Barack Obama ’s much - touted overseas trip will take him to nations where he ’s vastly more popular than John McCain , Obama is not nearly as well - liked in Israel .
Polls there show Israelis prefer John McCain by as much as 20 percentage points .
Obama ’s Middle Eastern swing will also take him to Jordan and possibly to Iraq , but the electoral stakes may be highest in Israel , which has long played a prominent role in American foreign policy and domestic politics .
Advertisement
Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor downplayed the electoral significance of the senator ’s Israel visit , saying the purpose is “ to convey to Israeli leaders and the Israeli people his commitment to the special U.S. - Israel relationship and his strong personal feelings of friendship .
He is deeply committed to Israel 's security . ”
If Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , impresses in his visit , it could help him close the international affairs experience gap with his Republican rival , and also solidify his support among Jews and evangelicals skeptical of Obama ’s expressed commitment to Israel .
Israelis appear to share those concerns .
In the past month , one poll found 36 percent of Israelis preferred McCain , versus 27 percent for Obama , while in another , 46 percent of respondents said a McCain presidency “ would be better for Israel , ” compared to 20 percent who said the same about Obama .
Those results stand in stark contrast to public surveys conducted in most other nations .
A spring Pew Global Attitudes Project poll of 23 foreign nations — not including Israel — on six continents found respondents in all but two countries had more confidence in Obama than McCain to do the right thing in world affairs , often by wide margins .
( In the two outlying countries , Jordan and Pakistan , few people expressed confidence in either candidate . )
Obama ’s support tended to track fairly closely with widespread distaste for President Bush ’s foreign policy — which includes strong support for Israel in its conflicts with the Palestinians and Israel 's Arab neighbors .
But that foreign policy has been embraced in Israel , where Bush remains a popular figure .
“ Israelis see Bush as having been better to Israel than almost any president before has been , ” said Albert Baumgarten , a Jewish history professor at Bar - Ilan University in Ramat - Gan , Israel .
Israelis , he said , “ feel almost as if he ’s their president . ”
Baumgarten , a dual Israeli - U.S. citizen who ’s supporting Obama , said Israelis believe McCain is more likely to continue pursuing the Bush administration ’s foreign policy agenda .
McCain has received mostly positive coverage in Israel , both for his hard line on Iran and for his military service , including his time as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam .
That ’s an experience valued by Israelis , who are required to serve in the country ’s armed forces .
He ’s also benefited from the support of Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman , the former - Democrat - turned - independent , whose Orthodox Judaism and staunch support of Israel make him a popular figure in Israel .
Some Israelis , said Jerusalem - based pollster Mitchell Barak , count against Obama “ that the Democratic Party is not a welcome place for Joe Lieberman . ”
But McCain ’s edge in the Jewish state seems to stem in large part from an antipathy toward Obama .
In May , New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , then seeking the Democratic presidential nomination , outpolled McCain in a head - to - head matchup by a margin of 57 percent to 18 percent .
The same poll , conducted by Barak ’s firm , showed McCain with a 43 percent to 20 percent edge over Obama among Israeli voters .
Barak asserted that Clinton ’s popularity stemmed mostly from her years as first lady to President Bill Clinton , who was also popular in Israel .
“ Israelis generally do n’t know senators , even the more popular ones , ” said Barak , who was raised in the U.S. and worked briefly for the Republican Jewish Coalition .
Obama ’s press coverage in Israel has not won him many friends .
He got harsh treatment after backtracking on his declaration last month to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that " Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel , and it must remain undivided , " and for saying he would meet without preconditions with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Discredited rumors that Obama is Muslim have spread to Israel , said Baumgarten , as have supportive comments toward Palestine made by Obama ’s former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Obama ’s visit should boost his standing with Israelis , Barak said .
“ He ’s going to get great coverage .
They ’ll be pictures of him at the Kotel , ” one of the nation ’s most significant religious sites for Jews , “ and Israelis will listen very carefully to what he says . ”
Obama will be accompanied by Dennis Ross , a high - ranking diplomat who worked for Presidents Clinton and George H. W. Bush , and is a popular figure among organized American Jewry .
He ’s slotted to meet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and former Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu , as well as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayad .
According to Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi , president of The Israel Project , a nonpartisan group that helped plan Obama ’s trip , the candidate intends to travel to Sderot , a city near the Gaza Strip that has been barraged by Qassam rockets fired from Palestinian territory .
The city , which McCain toured in March with Lieberman and Ehud Barak , currently the Israeli Defense Minister , has become a rallying point for Israelis and American Jews concerned about Israel ’s national security .
Obama ’s likely to do well with American Jewish voters no matter what impression he makes on Israelis , asserted Walter Russell Mead , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ American Jews almost always vote heavily Democratic , and my guess is that Obama will carry the American Jewish vote regardless of what his polling is in Israel , ” he said .
A poll released on Wednesday by J Street , a self - described “ pro-Israel , pro-peace movement " polling firm , found American Jews favor Obama over McCain 62 percent to 32 percent .
That ’s a drop from the 79 percent of American Jews that exit polls showed voted for Al Gore in 2000 and 74 percent that voted for John Kerry in 2004 .
Steven Kull , director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland , said enthusiastic receptions in Israel and the rest of his stops could be very effective for Obama .
While the trip wo n’t help Obama show that he’d be a tough commander in chief , that does n’t mean such displays are meaningless , said Kull , who pointed to studies showing that Americans care about world opinion of U.S. foreign policy .
“ It ’s not hard power , ” he said .
“ It ’s soft power .
And American soft power can be a real asset . ”
The U.S. economy appears to be caught in a cycle of recurrent panic attacks .
So many things have gone wrong , and so much anxiety has accumulated in the financial system , that nothing seems safe .
As a result , no sooner has one crisis seemed to recede than another has popped up , to be followed by another and still another .
“ We ’ve gotten to that classic point in a financial crisis where it ’s gone on for long enough we know there are losses .
We just do n’t know where they are , ” said Joseph R. Mason , a financial economist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
“ The only way to find out is for investors to push every institution toward failure and see which ones keep operating , ” Mason said .

About the sunniest assessment that analysts will offer is that if the current crisis holds to historical patterns , it could end as unexpectedly as it began .
“ Most panics are like summer storms , ” said David A. Moss , an economic historian at Harvard University .
“ They come up abruptly , are erratically intense , then suddenly dissipate . ”
The cycle started last summer with the near collapse of two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds specializing in exotic mortgage - backed securities .
What followed was a succession of panics that went so far that even the mainstays of the U.S. mortgage market -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- had to be propped up by the Federal Reserve .
And a series of other crises are tugging at such disparate threads of the nation ’s financial fabric as credit cards , student loans , municipal debt and even money market funds .

Last week held true to the storm pattern Moss described .
After another round of potentially catastrophic developments in the housing , financial and energy markets , the system pulled to the brink , caught its breath and took a turn for the better .
Oil prices not only halted their upward rush , they fell back a remarkable $ 16 a barrel in the space of a few days .
And after a frenzy of concern about the banking system , markets suddenly calmed when three major institutions -- Citigroup Inc. , Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- reported better - than - expected results .
Few economists think the storms are over , though .
“ This thing simply has n’t run its course , ” said veteran banking consultant Bert Ely of Alexandria , Va .
“ We have a multiple - chapter housing saga that could go on well into the next decade . ”

And when home values fall , shocks destabilize the financial system and the economy , setting off still more ripples .
Trouble has even been showing up in a seemingly safe and sound corner of the financial world : money market mutual funds .
Most people treat such funds as the equivalent of bank savings accounts .
Customers , who favor them because they generally pay higher rates than bank accounts , have parked $ 3 trillion in them -- nearly a quarter of all the money held by the nation ’s mutual fund industry , according to the Investment Company Institute .
The problem is that money market funds differ from bank accounts in two key ways .
First , they ’re not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
( Money market funds , which are offered by mutual fund companies and are not federally insured , should not be confused with money market accounts , which are offered by banks and are insured . )
Advertisement
Second , a fraction of the money put into money market funds recently has been used on investments that have gone sour .
That has forced some companies offering the funds to rush to plug the losses .
Legg Mason Inc. and SunTrust Banks Inc. , for example , recently had to pump $ 1.4 billion each into its money market funds .
Bank of America Corp. has injected $ 600 million .
The culprit in those cases does n’t appear to be housing prices alone so much as the wildly complicated securities that investment firms created out of mortgages and a laundry list of other hard - to - price ( and therefore risky ) assets such as timber and highways .
The idea behind such financial concoctions was that if each security contained only a small share of each of those items , the overall security would be safer than the individual assets that underpinned them .
But it has n’t worked out that way , according to Mason of Louisiana State University .

“ New financial instruments are invented every day .
Normally they get boiled down to a standardized form , ” he said .
But this time , banks and investment houses sought to maintain high profits and a lock on the markets by keeping their inventions “ customized . ”
The result today is that nobody can figure out how risky the new securities are , how much they are now worth or how dependent their owners -- mostly big institutional investors -- are on them .
In such circumstances , investors and customers will seek answers by using the extraordinarily crude technique of trying to knock over one institution after another and seeing if each survives .
“ It ’s not a very efficient way to run a financial system , but how else are you going to find out ? ” Mason said .

That ’s precisely what happened to Fannie and Freddie , which are especially exposed to slumping housing prices because they own or guarantee nearly half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion in mortgages .
Investors tripped over one another last week to sell shares of the government - sponsored but shareholder - owned companies , slicing Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s market values by nearly half .
That prompted the Treasury and the Fed to rush out a plan that plants the federal government firmly behind the two mortgage giants .
Much the same thing happened to Bear Stearns in March .
Investors in the nation ’s fifth - largest investment bank battered its stock , but what really sank the company was the fact that its lenders cut off the firm ’s lines of credit .
Lenders feared that the brokerage was so burdened with bad mortgage securities , it could n’t repay what it had borrowed .
The Fed was forced to assume control of some of the least appealing securities and provide $ 30 billion in financing to pave the way for a fire sale to JPMorgan .
Advertisement
For Countrywide Financial Corp. , the situation was similar .
The largest private - sector mortgage lender watched its finances fall apart as late payments on its loans surged with tumbling home prices .
The Calabasas - based lender was forced in January to let itself be snapped up by Bank of America -- for a sixth of its year - ago market value .
In each instance , the most prominent culprit behind the financial troubles has been a housing market that has fallen faster and further than almost anybody predicted .
As housing prices have continued to fall , they have exposed the weakness of firms built on the presumption that prices would keep rising .
As banking consultant Ely , quoting legendary investor Warren E. Buffett , put it : “ When the tide goes out , you find out who ’s swimming without their trunks . ”
But the nation ’s troubles have not remained neatly confined to housing , suggesting that other forces besides tumbling home prices are at work .
Advertisement
Just as Americans were growing accustomed to the housing slump and the slump - fed credit crisis , problems broke out in the market for the sort of municipal bonds that underwrite such plain - vanilla projects as hospital and college dorm construction , and that fund student loans .
The trouble was especially surprising because , unlike the typical municipal bond , which requires lenders to fork over funds for lengthy periods in return for fixed interest payments , the bonds at the center of this crisis were so - called auction - rate securities -- on which interest rates are reset daily , weekly or monthly based on the outcome of regular auctions .
In the case of student loans , it was surprising because the federal government guarantees most of the loans -- meaning there was almost no chance that lenders would get stuck with losses if borrowers failed to repay .
Nevertheless , major lenders suddenly retreated from the $ 330 - billion auction - rate market , forcing several states to suspend building projects and delay offering student loans .
Advertisement
The economy has survived such batterings repeatedly over the course of the nation ’s history and has almost always come back to prosper , said Moss of Harvard University .
“ At the moment , the crisis feels like it ’s everywhere , ” Moss said .
“ But that ’s not that unusual .
Crises seem to go away and then pop back up again ” before finally ending , he said .

Not only does independent developer / publisher Stardock put out some great strategy games , they ’re also somewhat well known for completely omitting any sort of DRM in their releases .
Building upon this idea of actually , y’know , treating PC gamers with some modicum of respect , they ’ve released a list entitled “ The Gamer ’s Bill of Rights , ” a collection of standards that we can expect to see the company employ from this point on .
Gamers shall have the right to return games that do n't work with their computers for a full refund .
Gamers shall have the right to demand that games be released in a finished state .
Gamers shall have the right to expect meaningful updates after a game 's release .
Gamers shall have the right to demand that download managers and updaters not force themselves to run or be forced to load in order to play a game .
Gamers shall have the right to expect that the minimum requirements for a game will mean that the game will play adequately on that computer .
Gamers shall have the right to expect that games wo n't install hidden drivers or other potentially harmful software without their consent .
Gamers shall have the right to re-download the latest versions of the games they own at any time .
Gamers shall have the right to not be treated as potential criminals by developers or publishers .
Gamers shall have the right to demand that a single - player game not force them to be connected to the Internet every time they wish to play .
Gamers shall have the right that games which are installed to the hard drive shall not require a CD / DVD to remain in the drive to play .
Best list ever or best list ever ?
Some of the items -- ok , more like ALL of them -- might seem like painfully obvious things to do , but , as I ’m sure most of you are aware , are still not practiced by many publishers and developers .
And yeah , I understand that piracy is part of the reason for why they do n’t do some of them , but if more and more companies started employing these standards then pirates would have absolutely no credible excuses to download games beyond “ I ’m a cheap bastard . ”
Plymouth , MI – August 29 , 2008 – Stardock announced today the Gamer 's Bill of Rights : a statement of principles that it hopes will encourage the PC game industry to adopt standards that are more supportive of PC gamers .
The document contains 10 specific " rights " that video game enthusiasts can expect from Stardock as an independent developer and publisher that it hopes that other publishers will embrace .
The Bill of Rights is featured on Stardock 's website ( www.stardock.com) and is on prominent display in Stardock 's booth ( 1142 ) at the Penny Arcade Expo .
" As an industry , we need to begin setting some basic , common sense standards that reward PC gamers for purchasing our games , " stated Brad Wardell , president and CEO of Stardock Corporation .
" The console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as Nintendo , Microsoft , or Sony .
But on the PC , publishers can release games that are scarcely completed , poorly supported , and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it . "
Chris Taylor , CEO and founder of Gas Powered Games stated , " This is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to , and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years , and really deserve . "
As an example of The Gamer 's Bill of Rights in action , Stardock instituted a policy of allowing users to return copies of The Political Machine purchased at retail to Stardock for a full refund if they found that their PC was n't sufficient to run the game adequately .
" The PC market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has PCs that may or may not be adequate to run our games .
Without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund , many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their PC .
The average consumer does n't know what ' pixel shader 2.0 support ' means , for instance , " said Wardell .
According to Stardock , the objective of the Gamer 's Bill of Rights is to increase the confidence of consumers of the quality of PC games which in turn will lead to more sales and a better gaming experience .
The Gamer 's Bill of Rights :
1 ) Gamers shall have the right to return games that do n't work with their computers for a full refund .
2 ) Gamers shall have the right to demand that games be released in a finished state .
3 ) Gamers shall have the right to expect meaningful updates after a game 's release .
4 ) Gamers shall have the right to demand that download managers and updaters not force themselves to run or be forced to load in order to play a game .
5 ) Gamers shall have the right to expect that the minimum requirements for a game will mean that the game will play adequately on that computer .
6 ) Gamers shall have the right to expect that games wo n't install hidden drivers or other potentially harmful software without their consent .
7 ) Gamers shall have the right to re-download the latest versions of the games they own at any time .
8 ) Gamers shall have the right to not be treated as potential criminals by developers or publishers .
9 ) Gamers shall have the right to demand that a single - player game not force them to be connected to the Internet every time they wish to play .
10 ) Gamers shall have the right that games which are installed to the hard drive shall not require a CD / DVD to remain in the drive to play .
Introduction
Ars Technica 's original Wireless Security Blackpaper was first published back in 2002 , and in the intervening years , it has been a great reference for getting the technical lowdown on different wireless security protocols .
As a sequel to the original blackpaper , we wanted to do something a little more basic and practical , because the number of devices with 802.11 x support has greatly expanded since 2002 .
Wireless security is no longer the domain of geeks and system administrators , but is now an issue in the lives of everyday users , from the worker with a home office who wants to keep sensitive files secure to the homemaker who wants to avoid an RIAA lawsuit because the teen next door is a wireless - leeching P2P addict .
In this practical introduction to the basics of securing your home wireless network , we 'll cover the important , high - level points that ordinary users need to know in order to secure a network of game consoles , phones , and PCs .
Along the way , we 'll also recap some of the relevant information from the original wireless blackpaper , which I recommend if you want to pursue the topic further .
So look through the guide , and if you 're already technically savvy then send it along to your uncle or your sister - in - law , and you may get one less phone call when it comes time for them to set up their new WLAN .
Note :
This short guide will focus on securing 802.11g/802.11 draft - n routers , since these are the two most common types on the market today .
Most of the information we 'll present should be applicable to older 802.11 b or even 802.11a routers as well , assuming that your device 's manufacturer provided appropriate firmware updates .
First things first
The first thing to understand about wireless security is that by default , you have none .
The router you buy from Newegg or Best Buy is going to come preconfigured for open access , which means that all of your neighbors can hop on and begin snarfing up MP3s with your bandwidth .
This makes the router easier to set up — on a modern OS , you should n't have to do much more than plug in both adapter and router — but it leaves the wireless access point ( WAP ) completely open to attack .
Most manufacturers use a simple login / password combination , and such information is easily available online .
The first step to securing any wireless network , therefore , is to change the default router password .
Most manufacturers set the default password to something along the lines of " admin , " " password , " or " changeme , " and the router IP address is almost always a simple variation on 192.168.x.1 , where x = 0 , 1 , or 15 .
A nonstandard , strong password is no substitute for actual encryption , but it 's a step in the right direction .
The next step should be to check for a firmware update for your router , particularly if it's an older model .
Many routers that did n't support more advanced security settings ( i.e. , WPA , which I 'll describe later ) had such support added via later firmware updates .
Setting a password for your router should be one of the first things you do
Debunking myths
You 're likely to get some bad wireless security advice from the guy at your local electronics superstore who sold you your router , because many of the commonly recommended wireless security tips floating around out there are n't actually all that useful and may even do more harm than good by lulling the end - user into a false sense of security .
Hiding the SSID
The SSID ( Service Set Identifier ) is an identification code ( typically a simple name ) broadcast by a wireless router .
If a wireless device detects multiple SSIDs from multiple access points ( APs ) , it will typically ask the end - user which one it should connect to .
Telling a router not to broadcast its SSID may prevent basic wireless access software from displaying the network in question as a connection option , but it does nothing to actually secure the network .
Any time a user connects to a router , the SSID is broadcast in plaintext , regardless of whether or not encryption is enabled .
SSID information can also be picked up by anyone listening to the network in passive mode .
Changing the SSID
This is sometimes touted as a security measure .
It is n't .
Changing your access point 's SSID will change the identification code the router is broadcasting , but it wo n't change anything else .
It does n't prevent the router from being detected , snooped , or hacked in any way .
Disable DHCP
Switching DHCP off and using static IP addressing is no defense against hacking .
Anyone snooping the network can usually figure out the pattern that has been used to assign the IP addresses in question and then make a specific request accordingly .
Filtering MAC addresses
In theory , this sounds great .
Every NIC has its own unique MAC address , and wireless access points can be configured to block all but a handful of specified NICs .
The problem with filtering by MAC address , however , is that these addresses are easily faked and readily detected by anyone using appropriate monitoring software .
In addition , this approach requires a great deal of overhead in corporate environments , and even for a large home network with multiple machines and gadgets ( consoles , phones , and consumer electronics ) it quickly becomes untenable .
Of the above bogus " security " measures , filtering MAC addresses is the only one with even a minimal level of value .
MAC address filtering can keep obnoxious and non-tech - savvy neighbors from easily freeloading on your wireless network , but it wo n't do much else .
To keep more determined intruders off of your network , you 'll have to use encryption .
Anne Carroll Moore was born long ago but not so far away , in Limerick , Maine , in 1871 .
She had a horse named Pocahontas , a father who read to her from Aesop ’s Fables , and a grandmother with no small fondness for “ Uncle Tom ’s Cabin . ”
Annie , whose taste ran to “ Little Women , ” was a reader and a runt .
Her seven older brothers called her Shrimp .
In 1895 , when she was twenty - four , she moved to New York , where she more or less invented the children ’s library .
Illustration by Ian Falconer
At the time , you had to be fourteen , and a boy , to get into the Astor Library , which opened in 1854 , the same year as the Boston Public Library , the country ’s first publicly funded city library , where you had to be sixteen .
Even if you got inside , the librarians would shush you , carping about how the “ young fry ” read nothing but “ the trashy ” : Scott , Cooper , and Dickens ( one century ’s garbage being , as ever , another century ’s Great Books ) .
Samuel Tilden , who left $ 2.4 million to establish a free library in New York , nearly changed his mind when he found out that ninety per cent of the books checked out of the Boston Public Library were fiction .
Meanwhile , libraries were popping up in American cities and towns like crocuses at first melt .
Between 1881 and 1917 , Andrew Carnegie underwrote the construction of more than sixteen hundred public libraries in the United States , buildings from which children were routinely turned away , because they needed to be protected from morally corrupting books , especially novels .
In 1894 , at the annual meeting of the American Library Association , the Milwaukee Public Library ’s Lutie Stearns read a “ Report on the Reading of the Young . ”
What if libraries were to set aside special books for children , Stearns wondered , shelved in separate rooms for children , staffed by librarians who actually liked children ?
In 1896 , Anne Carroll Moore was given the task of running just such an experiment , the Children ’s Library of the Pratt Institute , in Brooklyn , built at a time when the Brooklyn schools had a policy that “ children below the third grade do not read well enough to profit from the use of library books . ”
Moore toured settlement houses and kindergartens ( also a new thing ) , and made a list of what she needed : tables and chairs sized for children ; plants , especially ones with flowers ; art work ; and very good books .
The kids lined up around the block .
The cornerstone of the New York Public Library was laid in 1902 , at Forty - second Street and Fifth Avenue .
Four years later , after the library ’s directors established a Department of Work with Children , they hired Moore to serve as its superintendent , a position in which she not only oversaw the children ’s programs at all the branch libraries but also planned the Central Children ’s Room .
After the library opened , in 1911 , its Children ’s Room became a pint - sized paradise , with its pots of pansies and pussy willows and oak tables and coveted window seats , so low to the floor that even the shortest legs did n’t dangle .
Much of what Moore did in that room had never been done before , or half as well .
She brought in storytellers and , in her first year , organized two hundred story hours ( and ten times as many two years later ) .
She compiled a list of twenty - five hundred standard titles in children ’s literature .
She won the right to grant borrowing privileges to children ; by 1913 , children ’s books accounted for a third of all the volumes borrowed from New York ’s branch libraries .
Against the prevailing sentiment of the day , she believed that her job was to give “ to the child of foreign parentage a feeling of pride in the beautiful things of the country his parents have left . ”
She celebrated the holidays of immigrants ( reading Irish poetry aloud , for instance , on St. Patrick ’s Day ) and stocked the shelves with books in French , German , Russian , and Swedish .
In 1924 , she hired the African - American writer Nella Larsen to head the Children ’s Room in Harlem .
In each of the library ’s branches , Moore abolished age restrictions .
Down came the “ Silence ” signs , up went framed prints of the work of children ’s - book illustrators .
“ Do not expect or demand perfect quiet , ” she instructed her staff .
“ The education of children begins at the open shelves . ”
In place of locked cabinets , she provided every library with a big black ledger ; if you could sign your name , you could borrow a book .
Moore considered signing the ledger something between an act of citizenship and a sacrament , to be undertaken only after reading a pledge : “ When I write my name in this book I promise to take good care of the books I use in the Library and at home , and to obey the rules of the Library . ”
During both the First and Second World Wars , soldiers on leave in the city climbed the steps past Patience and Fortitude , walked into the Children ’s Room , and asked to see the black books from years past .
They wanted to look up their names , to trace the record of a childhood lost , an inky , smudged once - upon - a - time .
In the first half of the twentieth century , no one wielded more power in the field of children ’s literature than Moore , a librarian in a city of publishers .
She never lacked for an opinion .
“ Dull in a new way , ” she labelled books that she despised .
When , in 1938 , William R. Scott brought her copies of his press ’s new books , tricked out with pop-ups and bells and buttons , Moore snapped , “ Truck ! Mr. Scott .
They are truck ! ”
Her verdict , not any editor ’s , not any bookseller ’s , sealed a book ’s fate .
She kept a rubber stamp at her desk that she used , liberally , while paging through publishers ’ catalogues : “ Not recommended for purchase by expert . ”
The end .
The end of Moore ’s influence came when , years later , she tried to block the publication of a book by E. B. White .
Watching Moore stand in the way of “ Stuart Little , ” White ’s editor , Ursula Nordstrom , remembered , was like watching a horse fall down , its spindly legs crumpling beneath its great weight .
E. B. White , born in Mount Vernon , New York , in 1899 , was a generation Moore ’s junior .
As a boy , he was frustrated that there were books in his town library he was n’t allowed to look at .
He had a pet mouse ; he thought he looked a little mousy himself .
In 1909 , when he was nine , he won a prize for a poem about a mouse .
The New York Public Library opened the year he turned twelve and won a silver badge for “ A Winter Walk , ” an essay published in St. Nicholas , a magazine that Moore stocked on the shelves of her Children ’s Room .
White grew up and in 1917 went to Cornell , where he became the editor of the college paper , the Cornell Daily Sun .
In 1918 , Anne Carroll Moore wrote her first book review , in The Bookman .
That review marks the birth of serious criticism of children ’s literature .
( The next year saw still more firsts : the first Children ’s Book Week , organized by Moore , and the appointment of Louise Seaman — soon to be Louise Seaman Bechtel — to head the first children ’s department at a major publishing house , Macmillan .
In 1922 , the Newbery Medal was first awarded . )
Moore ’s column ran in The Bookman until it folded , in 1926 , the year after Harold Ross launched The New Yorker , where he hired White as a writer and a crackerjack thirty - two - year - old freelancer named Katharine Angell as a reader of manuscripts .
Not long afterward , Angell became the magazine ’s fiction editor .
About this time , E. B .
White fell asleep on a train and “ dreamed of a small character who had the features of a mouse , was nicely dressed , courageous , and questing . ”
White had eighteen nieces and nephews , who were always begging him to tell them a story , but he shied away from making one up off the top of his head .
Instead , he set to writing , and stocked a desk drawer with tales about his “ mouse - child . . . the only fictional figure ever to have honored and disturbed my sleep . ”
He named him Stuart .
Anne Carroll Moore had an imaginary friend , too .
“ I have brought someone with me , ” she would tell children , singsongy , as she fished out of her handbag a wooden doll she called Nicholas Knickerbocker .
She even had letterhead made for him .
“ I ’m the sorriest little Dutch boy you ever knew over your accident , ” she once wrote , signing herself “ Nicholas , ” in a letter to Louise Seaman Bechtel .
( When Moore forgot Nicholas in a taxi , her colleagues did not mourn his loss . )
In 1924 , Moore published her own children ’s book , “ Nicholas : A Manhattan Christmas Story . ”
It begins with Nicholas ’s Christmas Eve arrival in a New York Public Library Children ’s Room filled with fairy creatures :
The Troll gave a leap from the Christmas Tree and landed right beside the Brownie in a corner of the window seat .
Just then the Fifth Avenue window swung wide open and in walked a strange boy about eight inches high .
It has not aged well .
From 1924 to 1930 , Moore reviewed children ’s books for the New York Herald Tribune ; beginning in 1936 , her reviews also appeared in The Horn Book .
She could be a tough critic , especially of books that violated her rules : “ Books about girls should be as interesting as girls are ” or “ Avoid those histories that gain dramatic interest by appeal to prejudice .
Especially true of American histories . ”
But merely in bothering to regularly criticize children ’s books Moore was ahead of everyone .
Only in 1927 did The Saturday Review begin running a twice - monthly column called “ The Children ’s Bookshop . ”
The Times Book Review did n’t routinely review children ’s books until 1930 .
In 1928 , The New Yorker ’s Dorothy Parker , in her Constant Reader column , reviewed A. A. Milne ’s “ The House at Pooh Corner . ” ( Moore called another Pooh book “ a nonsense story in the best tradition of the nursery . ” )
Pooh ’s was n’t just a Good Hum and a Hopeful Hum , Parker noted .
It was a hummy hum .
“ And it is that word ‘ hummy , ’ my darlings , ” Parker wrote , “ that marks the first place in ‘ The House at Pooh Corner ’ at which Tonstant Weader fwowed up . ”
In 1929 , E. B . White married Katharine Angell and , with his office mate , James Thurber , published his first book , a lampoon featuring fake Freudian sexologists , titled “ Is Sex Necessary ? ” ( Their answer : not strictly , no , but it beats raising begonias . )
In 1933 , when the Whites ’ son , Joel , was three , Katharine , who also had two children from her first marriage , began writing an annual and sometimes semi-annual roundup of children ’s books for The New Yorker .
Katharine
White ’s taste in children ’s literature , if it fell short of Tonstant Weader ’s fwowing up , was more than spitting distance from Moore ’s indulgence in the adventures of Troll , Brownie , and Nicholas Knickerbocker .
White found an A. A. Milne introduction to Jean de Brunhoff ’s “ Travels of Babar ” to be “ an unnecessary and misleading condescension , since de Brunhoff is witty without being Poohish , and Babar is an elephant who can stand on his own feet . ”
She favored sturdy characters and spare prose .
But there was something else at stake .
White ’s column , which she once titled “ The Children ’s Shelf , ” called into question the very idea of a children ’s library .
Maybe all kids needed was a shelf ?
Then , as now , some of the best prose and poetry , not to mention the best art , was to be found in books written for children — disciplined , inspired , elevated , even , by the constraints of the form .
Katharine
White loved many books for children ; above all , she admired the beauty and lyricism of picture books and readers for the under - twelve set .
But she had her doubts about books aimed at older kids :
It has always seemed to us that boys and girls who are worth their salt begin at twelve or thirteen to read , with a brilliant indiscrimination , every book they can lay their hands on .
In the welter , they manage to read some good ones .
A girl of twelve may take up Jane Austen , a boy Dickens ; and you wonder how writers of juveniles have the brass to compete in this field , blithely announcing their works as “ suitable for the child of twelve to fourteen . ”
Their implication is that everything else is distinctly _un_suitable .
Well , who knows ?
Suitability is n’t so simple .
And who decides what ’s suitable , anyway ?
Parents ?
Librarians ?
Editors ?
White had her own ideas about who should draw the line , if a line had to be drawn , between what was good for children , what was childish , and what was just plain rotten .
About Anne Carroll
Moore she once fumed , “ Critic , my eye ! ”
Sometimes , books labelled juvenile are , instead , antique .
Children ’s literature , at least in the West , is utterly bound up in the medieval , as Seth Lerer , a Stanford literature professor , argues in “ Children ’s Literature : A Reader ’s History from Aesop to Harry Potter . ”
Lots of books for kids are about the Middle Ages ( everything from “ The Hobbit ” to “ Robin Hood ” and “ Redwall ” ) , but the conventions of the genre ( allegory , moral fable , romance , and heavy - handed symbolism ) are also themselves distinctly premodern .
It ’s not only that many books we shelve as “ children ’s literature ” — Grimms ’ Fairy Tales or “ Gulliver ’s Travels ” or “ Huck Finn ” — were born as biting political satire , for adults ; it ’s also that books written for children in the twentieth century tend to be distinctly , willfully , and often delightfully antimodern .
“ The Phantom Tollbooth ” has more in common with “ The Pilgrim ’s Progress ” than it does with “ On the Road . ” Lurking in the stacks of every “ children ’s library ” are dozens of literary impostors : satires , from ages past , hiding their fangs ; and shiny new books , dressed up in some very old clothes .
“ I had a wonderful time .
I just wish you were Oprah giving away cars . ”

Today , children ’s book publishing — an industry richly described in Leonard S. Marcus ’s excellent new book , “ Minders of Make - Believe ” — is one of the most profitable parts of the book business .
But that industry exists only because , in much the same way that the nineteenth - century middle class invented childhood as we know it , early - twentieth - century writers , illustrators , editors , and publishers — and , most of all , Anne Carroll Moore — invented children ’s literature .
It would be convenient if White and Moore stood on either side of a divide between antimodernist and modernist writing .
But things do n’t really sort out along those lines .
A better way of thinking about it might be to say that Anne Carroll Moore did not like fangs .
She loved what was precious , innocent , and sentimental .
White found the same stuff mawkish , prudish , and daffy .
“ There are too many coy books full of talking animals , whimsical children , and condescending adults , ” White complained .
Katharine
White also hated the word “ juvenile , ” and sorely regretted , in the nineteen - thirties , that “ it still adequately describes the calibre of the great majority of these books . ”
But what about her husband ’s teensy talking mouse - child ?
True , Stuart was six inches shorter than Nicholas Knickerbocker .
Whether he was juvenile remained to be seen , because , for now , he was still stuck in that desk drawer .
In April , 1938 , Life ran a photo - essay called “ The Birth of a Baby , ” still shots from a film that depicted one woman ’s pregnancy , labor , and delivery .
The film had been banned in New York .
Even the photographs proved too much for the American public , and the issue was pulled from newsstands in thirty - three cities .
In The New Yorker , E. B .
White offered a lampoon called “ The Birth of an Adult , ” stills of a film — drawings by Rea Irvin — portraying “ the waning phenomenon of adulthood . ”
( Frame 1 : “ The Birth of an Adult is presented with no particular regard for good taste .
The editors feel that adults are so rare , no question of taste is involved . ” )
“ I have written a fine parody of Life ’s ‘ The Birth of a Baby , ’ ” White wrote to Thurber , adding , “ I also have a children ’s book about half done . ”
He had , at last , opened the drawer .
That summer , the Whites moved to the tiny town of North Brooklin , Maine .
In a November , 1938 , essay for Harper ’s , White complained that review copies of children ’s books , two hundred of them , sent to his wife by publishers , were spilling out of the cupboards , stuck under sofa cushions , tumbling out of the hearth .
About the only one he liked was Dr. Seuss ’s “ The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins . ”
The rest were cloying , clunky , and hopelessly naïve .
( “ One laughs in demoniac glee , ” he wrote , “ but this laugh has a hollow sound . ” )
What E. B . White found most depressing — and he was pretty discouraged in 1938 , “ this year of infinite terror ” — was the looming war that threatened to make the whole planet unsuitable for anyone , while , in the world of children ’s literature , “ adults with blueprints of bombproof shelters sticking from their pants pockets solemnly caution their little ones against running downstairs with lollypops in their mouths . ”
In his Harper ’s essay , White mused , “ It must be a lot of fun to write for children — reasonably easy work , perhaps even important work . ”
After Theodor Geisel ( Dr. Seuss ) pointed White ’s essay out to Anne Carroll Moore , she sent White a letter .
If it ’s so easy , why do n’t you do it ?
“ I wish to goodness you would do a real children ’s book yourself , ” she wrote .
“ I feel sure you could , if you would , and I assure you the Library Lions would roar with all their might in its praise . ”
( Moore often inscribed her letters with a return address of “ Behind the Lions . ” )
White replied that he had started writing a children ’s book , but was finding it difficult .
“ I really only go at it when I am laid up in bed , sick , and lately I have been enjoying fine health .
My fears about writing for children are great — one can so easily slip into a cheap sort of whimsy or cuteness .
I do n’t trust myself in this treacherous field unless I am running a degree of fever . ”
I used to adore Pee - wee 's Playhouse as a child .
But when Adult Swim began showing old episodes of it on the Cartoon Network a couple of years ago , I was kind of stunned .
How insane was this show ?!
They bounced around from random topic to random topic with all kinds of inanimate objects talking and bright colors and loud noises " “ I can see why it might drive an adult nuts .
However , it 's still a pretty fascinating show " “ and apparently still relevant , since Paul Reubens says Pee - wee 's Playhouse : The Movie is in the works for 2009 .
Here 's a few Pee - wee tidbits I thought you guys might appreciate .
1 . Pee - wee was largely inspired by Pinky Lee , who was the host of his eponymous children 's show in the early " ˜50s .
He wore a distinctive plaid suit and displayed childish behavior similar to that of Pee - wee's .
2 . Does the voice behind the theme song sound familiar to you ?
It should , especially if you grew up in the " ˜80s : it 's Cyndi Lauper .
But she was credited as Ellen Shaw on the show .
3 . There were plenty of up - and - coming celebrities on the show .
Most of us know about Phil Hartman as Captain Carl and Laurence Fishburne as Cowboy Curtis , but there was also S. Epatha Merkerson as Mailman Reba and Natasha Lyonne as a neighborhood kid named Opal .
Behind the scenes we had Sally Hershberger as the hair stylist ; Rob Zombie and John Singleton as production assistants and Dweezil Zappa , Todd Rundgren , George Clinton and Danny Elfman as composers .
OK , the weirdness of the show is starting to make more sense .
4 . Pee - wee first showed up in the comedy group the Groundlings when Paul Reubens was a member .
It was definitely not kid material then .
The Groundlings is where Reubens and Phil Hartman met , forming a writing team that would carry them through all of Pee - wee 's adventures .
5. According to the Christmas Special , Magic Johnson and Magic Screen are cousins .
I found that out at this site , which is a really entertaining read on Pee - wee 's Playhouse , if you 've got a few minutes .
6 . Who knew Duke the dog - faced boy from Big Top Pee - wee would go on to win an Academy Award ?
Big Top was Benicio del Toro 's first film .
7 . It 's no surprise that Paul Reubens was inspired to write Big Top Pee - wee " “ he grew up in Sarasota , Florida .
Apparently it's where the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus liked to winter , so he had the Flying Wallendas as neighbors .
Circus life probably seemed pretty normal to him .
8. Remember Dottie from Pee - wee 's Big Adventure ?
In real life , she 's E.G. Daily " “ AKA the voice of Tommy Pickles from Rugrats .
9. Pee - Wee 's Big Adventure was one of Tim Burton 's first successes .
He has said that without the financial success of that movie , he never would have gone on to make Batman .
10 . Tim Burton never forgot his first collaboration with Paul Reubens " “ he has since featured Reubens in Batman Returns and as the voice of Lock in The Nightmare Before Christmas .
OK , one more : Jambi the Genie and Pterri the Pterodactyl were played / voiced by the same person .
The test of literature is , I suppose , whether we ourselves live more intensely for the reading of it .

In my recent article , How to Read a Book , I offered some ideas for extracting value from dead trees .
I focussed primarily on non-fiction in that article .
Now I want to offer you an approach for fiction .
Fiction differs from non-fiction in only one necessary way : it ’s made up .
But that small variation in its linguistic DNA produces an entirely different organism .
While the primary goal of fact - driven content is to extract the information you need , the primary goal of reading a story could be anything .
A work of fiction is , essentially , an artifact of self - expression .
There are as many motivations for writing a story as there are reasons for us to communicate with one another .
Many authors write stories to explore issues they ’re experiencing in their own lives .
Others attempt to get us thinking about the good , bad , and ugly things in our world .
But if works of fiction are made up , why bother reading them ?
What value can we possibly derive from the people , places , and things that exist purely in our imagination ?
And how can those fictitious forces inspire us to push our own boundaries and do things we ’ve never done before ?
Why Read Fiction ?
Obviously a question like , “ Why read fiction ? ” , has many answers : for entertainment value , to improve your vocabulary , to be inspired , etc .
For me the primary value of fiction , the one that is most beneficial from a growth perspective , is that it offers an experience .
What kind of experience ?
Whatever one I choose .
The literary landscape is as diverse as a very diverse thing .
If I want to live in a world full of robots , I ’ll read Asimov .
If I ’m in more of an anarchist mood , I ’ll reach for Orwell .
When I wanted a taste of life in Soviet Russia , I read Ayn Rand ’s We the Living
.
I immersed myself so completely in the story that I began to feel the agonizing boredom of waiting for hours in line for rations of stale bread and rancid butter .
I came to understand the paranoia that people felt , how careful they had to be with their words towards the Party , fearing that one of their listeners might be a member , knowing the fate that came to those who begged to differ .
Several weeks after reading that book I found myself in conversation with a couple friends from eastern Europe , who ’d lived under the Soviet regime .
It was fascinating to discover how much their real - world experiences paralleled my not - real - world ones .
A lot of what they said refreshed the mental images of what I ’d read , almost as if they were things I ’d lived through myself .
This episode is explained by more than just my overactive imagination .
Even science has something to say about the ability our creative powers have to shape our reality .
In an article entitled “ Experiencing the Future ” , in the June 2008 issue of Le Monde de l’intelligence , Daniel Gilbert , author of Stumbling on Happiness
, talks about how our thoughts are processed in ways similar to real sensory experiences .
Here ’s a quote :
The pleasure that we feel when we imagine future events comes from the same parts of the brain as the pleasure we feel when we live events in the present .
The visual imagination activates the visual cortex , in the same way as our visual sense ; the auditory imagination activates the auditory cortex , in the same way as our hearing , and the affective imagination activates the affective centers of the brain , exactly like affective experience .
So while we know that fiction is — obviously — quite fictional , diving deeply into a great story can be an almost visceral adventure .
A decent novel can entertain you .
A good novel can make you feel stuff .
A great novel can change your life .
Read Only What Interests You
That a novel offers an experience is of no inherent value .
Getting the most value out of a novel requires asking yourself :
What kind of experience do you want to have ?
My answer to that question is usually a reflection of where I ’m headed with my life .
I often use my intentions as a compass to point me to the right section in the bookstore .
Since my primary relationship to a story is through its characters , I look for books populated with intriguing personalities : people I ’d want to know in real life , or at least have a conversation with through a bullet - proof glass window .
I used to choose books to read because they were “ classics ” , or recommended by so - and - so .
I ’ve since become wise to the folly of that approach .
There are so many words to choose from that knowing where to begin your search for a good book can be overwhelming .
Here are my preferred sources , all of which can also apply to non-fiction :
Bloggers .
A great deal of what I read is stuff recommended by bloggers I respect .

Online forums .
Shared interests are a great source of reading ideas , particularly for novels , since their titles rarely give a clear hint at what they ’re about .

Fiction as Vehicle for Growth
Great fiction expands your emotional repertoire and deepens your self - understanding .
This makes it a particularly useful tool in the conscious pursuit of happiness .
I prefer to choose a reading path that floods my imagination with images and ideas that are aligned with my present goals .
For example , reading Atlas Shrugged
taught me a lot about self - reliance .
I was so inspired by the characters in Ayn Rand ’s epic novel that I decided to devour her other well - known works of fiction :
The Fountainhead , We the Living , and Anthem .
This kind of tunnel vision is a healthy thing , for short periods .
It gives the ideas a chance to soak in , for the mindset to really rub off on you .
Unlike most non-fiction , a novel takes an idea and wraps it in context so you can see how it might play out in the real world .
By focussing your reading around a particular theme , you build up a database of reference “ experiences ” related to that subject .
Of course , fiction is no replacement for real life , but like the example I gave earlier about We the Living , it can still offer profound insights .
Invite the Characters Into Your Life
Every so often , you ’ll meet someone who changes your perception of the world .
You might work alongside a brilliant computer geek who redefines your notion of competence , or you might connect with someone in your social life whose ability to deal with a rough situation inspires you .
This same reservoir of human potential is available in paperback form .
It requires only the force of your imagination to be extracted .
So when you read a novel , really read it .
Invite the characters into your life .
Think about them even when you ’re not reading .
Weigh the events in your life against the events in theirs .
What might they be doing right now ?
How would they handle the situation that you currently find most challenging ?
How is your personality different from theirs and in what ways do those differences shape your lives differently ?
Experiment with all the ways you can think of to weave the story and characters into your own existence — without getting arrested .
Only fiction can provide such a broad context in which to think about life , the universe , and everything .
Use this to your advantage .
Just like we exercise caution in who we choose to associate with in real life , so we should be picky about what we read .
Read deliberately , with your mind wide open .
Use fiction to live ; not as a replacement for the real world , but as an extension of it .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Scientists in Japan have designed artificial molecules that when used with rats successfully reversed liver cirrhosis , a serious chronic disease in humans that until now can only be cured by transplants .
Cirrhosis is the hardening or scarring of the liver , and is caused by factors such as heavy drinking and Hepatitis B and C .
The disease is especially serious in parts of Asia , including China .
Cirrhosis occurs when a class of liver cells starts producing collagen , a fibrous material that toughens skin and tendons .
Such damage cannot be reversed although steps can be taken to prevent further damage .
In advanced cases , transplants are the only way out .
In the journal Nature Biotechnology , the researchers said they designed molecules that can block collagen production by liver “ stellate cells ” , which are also known to absorb vitamin
A .
The scientists then loaded the molecules into carriers that were coated with vitamin A , which tricked the stellate cells into absorbing the molecules .
“ By packaging the ( molecules ) in carriers coated with vitamin A , they tricked the stellate cells into letting in the inhibitor , which shut down collagen secretion , ” the researchers wrote .
In the study , the researchers induced liver cirrhosis in rats and then injected them with the vitamin A - laced molecules .
“ We were able to completely eradicate the fibrosis by injecting this agent ... we cured them of the cirrhosis , ” Yoshiro Niitsu at the Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine in Japan said in a telephone interview .
“ The liver is such an important organ , after you remove the fibrosis , the liver by itself starts to regenerate tissues .
So liver damage is reversible . ”
Explaining how the damage reversal came about , Niitsu said : “ Liver is itself responsible for the production and deposition of collagen , it also secretes certain enzymes that dissolve collagen ... dissolve the fibrosis which has already been deposited in the tissues . ”
Niitsu was hopeful that the molecules would provide a cure for cirrhosis patients in time .
“ We hope it ( a drug ) will be ready for humans in a few years , ” he said .
The 5 real reasons to avoid iPhone 3G :
i Phone completely blocks free software .
Developers must pay a tax to Apple , who becomes the sole authority over what can and can't be on everyone 's phones .
i Phone endorses and supports Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) technology .
i Phone exposes your whereabouts and provides ways for others to track you without your knowledge .
i Phone wo n't play patent - and DRM - free formats like Ogg Vorbis and Theora .
i Phone is not the only option .
There are better alternatives on the horizon that respect your freedom , do n't spy on you , play free media formats , and let you use free software -- like the FreeRunner .
" This is the phone that has changed phones forever , " Mr. Jobs said .
We agree .
A snake oil salesman not satisfied with his business of pushing proprietary software and Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) technology into your home , Jobs has set his sights on getting DRM and proprietary software into your pocket as well .
There is a reason so much emphasis was put on the visual design of the iPhone .
There is a reason that Apple is so concerned about unsightly seams that they wo n't even let you change the battery in your own phone .
Apple , through its marketing and visual design techniques , is manufacturing an illusion that merely buying an Apple makes you part of an alternative community .
But the technology they use is explicitly chosen to divide people into separate digital cells , and to position Apple as sole warden .
When your business depends on people paying for the privilege of being locked up , the prison better look and feel luxurious , and the bars better not be too visible .
Wait , locked up ?
Prison ?
It 's a phone .
Are n't we being a little extreme ?
Unfortunately , we are not .
The extreme here is represented by Jobs and Apple .
The iPhone is an attack on very old and fundamental values -- the value of people having control over their stuff rather than their stuff having control over them , the right to freely communicate and share with others , and the importance of privacy .
The iPhone does make phone calls , but it is not just a phone .
It is a general - purpose computer , more powerful in terms of hardware than the ones we might have had sitting on our desks just a few years ago .
It 's also a tracking device , and like other proprietary GPS - enabled phones , can transmit your location without your knowledge .
As of November 2007 , 3.3 billion people in the world had mobile telephones , and the number continues to rise rapidly .
For many of these people , phones are becoming the most important computers they own .
They are vital to their communications and they are with them all the time .
Of all the technology people use that could be turned against them , this is one of the most frightening possibilities .
But there is an important difference between the iPhone and prior general - purpose computers :
The iPhone is broken , on purpose .
It is in theory capable of running many different kinds of programs , but software applications and media will be limited via Apple 's ironically named Digital Restrictions Management technology -- " FairPlay " .
FoulPlay
Apple 's DRM system monitors your activities and tells you what you are and are not allowed to do .
What you are not allowed to do is install any software that Apple does n't like .
This restriction prevents you from installing free software -- software whose authors want you to freely share , copy and modify their work .
Free software has given us many exciting things on the desktop -- the GNU / Linux operating system , the Firefox web browser , the OpenOffice.org suite , the Apache webserver that runs most of the web sites on the internet .
Why would we want to buy a computer that goes out of its way to obstruct the freedom of such creators ?
This system is not Apple 's only FoulPlay .
i Phones can now also only be activated in stores -- despite the fact that in the U.S. , the Register of Copyrights ruled that consumers have the right to unlock their phones and switch to a different carrier .
Fingerpointing ( and we do n't mean the touch screen )
Jobs would have us believe that all of these restrictions are necessary .
He nods and agrees when we complain about them , and says that he does n't like them either .
He claims that Apple is forced to include them for our own good -- for the safety of the whole telephone network , and to allow access to all the movies and music we want .
But it 's been a year and a half since Jobs , under pressure from the public , spoke out strongly against DRM and in favor of freedom .
With great hesitation , he allowed a handful of files to go DRM - free on iTunes , but kept in place the requirement that they be purchased using the proprietary , DRM - infected iTunes software .
Since then , he has done absolutely nothing to act on those words .
In his movie and video ventures , he has continued to push DRM .
And now he 's bringing it to mobile software applications as well .
It 's become clear that those words were a ploy to defuse opposition .
The truth is that there are thousands of software , music , and media creators who want to share their work more freely .
It 's funny -- as in reprehensible -- because Apple 's OS X operating system was in fact largely built on software written by people who voluntarily made their work free to others for further copying , modification and improvement .
When people have the freedom to tinker , create , and innovate , they make exciting and useful creations .
People have already been writing their own free software to run mobile platforms .
The telephone network is still standing .
We know Jobs is afraid of competition , and is manufacturing threats and excuses .
This is simply a business decision , and it's a kind of business we should n't support .
Jobs wants the iPhone to restrict you because he wants your money and increased control is a means to that -- he wants to take as much from you as possible , give you back as little as possible , and keep his costs at the absolute minimum .
He 's trying to make sure that nobody writes software for the iPhone to do things that he does n't want the iPhone to be able to do -- such software might make FoulPlay less foul , play alternative media formats , show the user exactly what 's being communicated from the phone to the people monitoring it , or even disable transmission of that information .
Being the future we want to see
Fortunately , we will soon be able to have all the convenience of a mobile computer that also makes phone calls without selling our freedom to Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , or anyone else .
The Neo FreeRunner is a promising free - software phone , being developed in cooperation with the same worldwide community responsible for the GNU / Linux operating system .
These are creators who want to share their work and who want you and others to be able to do what they did -- build on the work of people who came before them to make new , empowering devices .
Jobs built on the work of people before him too , only his answer is to kick away the ladder and try to prevent anyone else from doing what he did .
His customers are fighting back -- according to Apple in October 2007 , over 250,000 of the 1.4 million iPhones sold were unlocked by their users .
Rather than embracing this , Jobs thinks it should be stopped .
We have a choice .
The FreeRunner does n't yet do as much as the iPhone and it 's certainly not as pretty .
But in terms of potential , the fact that it 's supported by a worldwide community of people rather than a single greedy , dishonest and secretive entity puts it light - years ahead .
We can trade our freedom and our money to get something flashy on the surface , or we can spend a little more money , keep our freedom , and support a better kind of business .
If we want businesses to be ethical , we have to reward the ones that are .
By not enriching companies that want to take away our freedom and by rewarding those that respect us , we will be helping to bring about a better future .

The mystery has been cleared up about what else Jesse Jackson said last week when he made his crude remarks about Barack Obama .
The previously unreported comment , disclosed Wednesday morning by the TVNewser blog , was :
“ Barack ... he ’s talking down to black people ... telling [ black people ] how to behave . ”
Only Jackson used the plural form of the “ n - word , ” not “ black people , ” in the second part of his comment .
Initially , the firestorm was over comments Jackson made to a guest before a July 6 interview on " Fox & Friends . "
The civil rights leader whispered that Obama was " talking down to black people " and that Jackson wanted to " cut his nuts off . "
The comments went unnoticed in the control room , Fox News said .
But , as reported by The Times ’ Matea Gold in a story published Friday , an employee working the overnight shift transcribed the tape , and the remarks that first caused the stir were reported several days later on Fox ’s " The O’Reilly Factor . "
Then , as The Ticket reported , there was a controversy over exactly what Jackson said he wanted to do .
At the time , host Bill O’Reilly told viewers the network had decided to air only portions of what Jackson had said , adding there was " more damaging " material , too .
That gave rise to rumors that Jackson had used the “ n word ” –- and aimed it directly at Obama .
In a Wednesday afternoon interview with fellow Fox host Shepard Smith , O’Reilly said he had withheld the “ n - word ” remark because , “ I ’m not in the business of creating some kind of controversy that ’s not relevant to the general subject -- one civil rights leader disparaging another over policy . ”
But why did O’Reilly mention in the first place that he had “ more damaging ” material ?
In a one - sentence statement offered as a reply , O’Reilly said Wednesday : “ We tell the audience the full breadth of everything we report on . ”
There was no elaboration on why the “ full breadth ” did n’t include the actual comment .
As for how the “ n - word ” comment eventually got out , O’Reilly told Smith that “ some weasel leaked it to the Internet . ”

After a closer examination of a surviving marvel of ancient Greek technology known as the Antikythera Mechanism , scientists have found that the device not only predicted solar eclipses but also organized the calendar in the four - year cycles of the Olympiad , forerunner of the modern Olympic Games .
The new findings , reported Wednesday in the journal Nature , also suggested that the mechanism ’s concept originated in the colonies of Corinth , possibly Syracuse , on Sicily .
The scientists said this implied a likely connection with Archimedes .
Archimedes , who lived in Syracuse and died in 212 B.C. , invented a planetarium calculating motions of the Moon and the known planets and wrote a lost manuscript on astronomical mechanisms .
Some evidence had previously linked the complex device of gears and dials to the island of Rhodes and the astronomer Hipparchos , who had made a study of irregularities in the Moon ’s orbital course .
The Antikythera Mechanism , sometimes called the first analog computer , was recovered more than a century ago in the wreckage of a ship that sank off the tiny island of Antikythera , north of Crete .
Earlier research showed that the device was probably built between 140 and 100 B.C .
Medical castration to treat localized prostate tumors does not prolong survival and its side effects far outweigh any potential benefit for most patients , researchers reported today .
The technique , which involves using drugs to block the body ’s production of the male hormone androgen , is a powerful tool when used in conjunction with surgery or radiation for treating aggressive prostate tumors .
Many oncologists had assumed this treatment could be of benefit with localized tumors as well , and the use of the drugs surged a decade ago , with an estimated 30 % to 50 % of such patients receiving the therapy .
But its use has fallen in the last five years because of changes in Medicare ’s reimbursement policy , and some experts think this new finding might spell the end for the treatment .

“ This study suggests that physicians who recommend hormonal therapy for localized tumors are not doing their patients any favors , ” said Dr. Howard M. Sandler , a radiation oncologist at the University of Michigan Medical School who spoke as a representative of the American Society of Clinical Oncology .
“ I hope that it does change clinical practice and that fewer men do receive primary hormonal therapy , ” he said .
Added Dr. Matthew B. Rettig , an oncologist at UCLA ’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center , “ There is no clear data that has ever shown that patients with early - stage disease benefit from primary hormone therapy . . . and this is further evidence to support that . ”
One in six American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime .
An estimated 186,000 new cases will occur this year , with nearly 29,000 deaths .

An estimated 85 % of newly diagnosed prostate tumors are localized , so - called stages T - 1 and T - 2 . Guidelines promulgated by national organizations recommend one of three approaches for treating such tumors : surgical removal , radiation therapy or expectant management , better known as watchful waiting .
The rationale for watchful waiting is that most of these tumors grow so slowly that an elderly patient is likely to die of something else before the tumor kills him .
“ A lot of men think radiation and surgery are too aggressive , but observation sounds like you are not doing enough , ” said Dr. Siu -Long Yao of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey , who led the new study .
Hormonal therapy , which sounds rather benign , “ has become the second - most popular treatment after surgery , surpassing radiation , ” he said .
But it has dramatic side effects , including a 10 % to 50 % increase in the risk of fractures , diabetes , heart disease and sudden cardiac death ; a 500 % increase in hot flashes ; and a 267 % increase in impotence .
It also has adverse effects on fats and cholesterol and causes enlargement of the breasts .

It is also expensive .
Treatment with such drugs as leuprolide ( Lupron , Viadur , Eligard ) , goserelin ( Zoladex ) and triptorelin ( Trelstar ) peaked at more than $ 1.23 billion in the U.S. in 2003 , the second - highest Medicare Part B drug expenditure that year .
Yao and his colleagues used national databases to collect information on 19,271 men -- who had a median age of 77 and were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 1992 and 2002 -- and followed them through 2006 .
About 41 % received only primary hormonal therapy and the rest were merely observed .
The team reported in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. that the 10 - year death rate from prostate cancer was 17.4 % in those receiving no therapy , compared with 19.9 % in those receiving hormonal therapy .
There was , however , no difference between the two groups in deaths from all causes .
There was a slight benefit from the therapy for men who had what are known as poorly differentiated tumors , which are generally more aggressive .
About 40.2 % of the men with those tumors who received hormonal therapy died of prostate cancer , compared with 45.7 % of those who received no treatment .
No effect on deaths from all causes was seen , however .

Earlier studies seemed to show that the less advanced a tumor was at diagnosis , the less benefit there was from hormone therapy .
The therapy started to fall out of favor after the Medicare Act of 2003 reduced reimbursement for it by about 50 % , according to a recent study by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic .

Enlarge By Douglas C. Pizac , AP A worker guides a statue of Brigham Young , which had been removed during renovations , in front of the State Capitol building in Salt Lake City on May 30 .
Workers in the state court system will be exempt from a new state - wide mandatory 4 - day work week for most state employees .
Utah this summer will become what experts say is the first state to institute a mandatory four - day work week for most state employees , joining local governments across the nation that are altering schedules to save money , energy and resources .
Gov. Jon Huntsman , a first - term Republican , says he 's making the change to reduce the state 's carbon footprint , increase energy efficiency , improve customer service and provide workers more flexibility .
RELATED STORY : Gas prices spurring switch to 4 - day week " The reaction ( from the public ) has been very much a willingness to give this a go , " he says .
The change will apply to about 17,000 employees , roughly 80 % of the state workforce , Huntsman says .
Public universities , the state court system , prisons and other critical services will be exempt .
Residents still will have sufficient access to state offices , many staying open from 7 a.m.- 6 p.m. , and more than 800 state services are available online , he says .
Leslie Scott , executive director of the National Association of State Personnel Directors , says Huntsman 's action is a first .
" Most states have a four - day work week option for their employees , but Utah is the first to go to a mandatory four - day work week , " she says .
" A good number of the states are encouraging their agencies and managers to offer a four - day work week whenever possible . "
The four - day work week is fairly common among city and county governments .
Rex Facer , an assistant professor at Brigham Young University whose research team is studying the four - day work week concept , estimates that about one - sixth of U.S. cities with populations above 25,000 offer employees a four - day work week .
His projection is based on the team 's continuing survey of 150 city human resource directors .
Facer expects more cities to begin shuttering offices on Fridays .
" The increasing pressures the American is facing around gas prices is certainly a significant factor , and the overall fiscal pressures governments are facing in general , " he says .
Jacqueline Byers , director of research at the National Association of Counties , says the four - day work week is gaining in popularity among county governments .
Marion County , Fla. , has a mandatory four - day work week for employees ; Oconee County , S.C. , and Walworth County , Wis. , have it for road work crews , while Will County , Ill. , has it for the auditor 's office .
Oakland County , Mich. , is seeking volunteers for a four - day work week , and Miami - Dade County , Fla. , and Suffolk County , N.Y. , are moving toward it , she says .
" They like it for a couple of reasons , " says Byers .
" They 're not able to give raises , so this is like a bonus , to cut off one day 's commute .
Also , if they can close a whole department ( for a day ) , they save money for the county . "
It takes some adjusting .
" One thing that has to be changed is the level of expectation from taxpayers , because they 've always wanted five - day access , " Byers says .
" They have to adjust to offices that are open longer on weekdays , but closed on Fridays . "
Cities offering employees condensed work weeks include Coconut Creek , Fla. , Birmingham , Ala. , and Avondale , Ariz. , according to the National League of Cities .
In Utah , the new schedule starts Aug .
4 . In the meantime , Huntsman says , the state is moving to iron out problems for employees with child - care concerns and those using public transportation that currently would not accommodate a longer workday .
Huntsman says the change will help
Utah reach its goal of reducing energy use 20 % by 2015 .
Beyond the energy and financial implications , the four - day work week is a quality - of - life issue for many .
Huntsman says it is especially popular among younger employees and that his action will make Utah more competitive in luring talent .
Facer agrees that an improved " work - life balance " often results from a shorter work week .
" More and more young workers are entering the work force , " Facer says .
" They 're looking for ways to enhance their work - life balance .
Alternative work schedules offer more of this work - life balance than do traditional work schedules . "
What are the pros and cons of a four - day work week ?
Would you switch to a four - day week if you could ?
Would you rather have government offices open five days a week or open longer hours for four days a week ?

Competition for customers between eBay ( EBAY ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) is heating up .
In an attempt to win market share EBay Cuts Fixed - Price Fees More Than 70 % , Maintains Forecast .
EBay Inc. , the world 's largest Internet auctioneer , lowered fees for listing fixed - cost items by more than 70 percent to attract additional sellers and compete with Amazon.com .
EBay said the changes wo n't affect its annual earnings projection .
Sellers will pay 35 cents to list multiple quantities of the same item for 30 days , the San Jose , California - based company said today in a statement .
Previously , sellers paid between 35 cents and $ 4 per item listed for seven days .
Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe 's strategy of removing most upfront fees is designed to boost listings and grab market share from Amazon.com , the world 's largest online retailer .
EBay 's sales growth in the second quarter slowed the most since 1998 as consumers , hurt by rising energy and food costs , reduced purchases .
The new prices take effect Sept. 16 .
" The news signals EBay 's renewed focus on competing with Amazon.com and other e-tailers in fixed price , " said Benjamin Schachter , a New York - based analyst with UBS Securities LLC .
" While these changes will increase listings , impact to the demand side of the equation remains to be seen . "
EBay also eliminated the use of check and money orders and shifted to electronic checkout solely through its PayPal service .
Last month , Amazon.com introduced an electronic - payment system to compete with PayPal .

Insiders Bailing As Fast As Possible
Even the most fabulous , high - flying lives hit pockets of dead air , periods when the sails go slack .
Movie stars get marooned in D.M.V. lines .
Prime ministers sit with frozen smiles through interminable state events .
Living - large rappers endure empty August afternoons , pacing the mansion , checking the refrigerator , staring idly out the window , baseball droning on the radio .
Wondering :
When does the mail come , exactly ?
Scientists know plenty about boredom , too , though more as a result of poring through thickets of meaningless data than from studying the mental state itself .
Much of the research on the topic has focused on the bad company it tends to keep , from depression and overeating to smoking and drug use .
Yet boredom is more than a mere flagging of interest or a precursor to mischief .
Some experts say that people tune things out for good reasons , and that over time boredom becomes a tool for sorting information  an increasingly sensitive spam filter .
In various fields including neuroscience and education , research suggests that falling into a numbed trance allows the brain to recast the outside world in ways that can be productive and creative at least as often as they are disruptive .
In a recent paper in The Cambridge Journal of Education , Teresa Belton and Esther Priyadharshini of East Anglia University in England reviewed decades of research and theory on boredom , and concluded that it ’s time that boredom “ be recognized as a legitimate human emotion that can be central to learning and creativity . ”
This article is part of the Center for Media & Democracy 's spotlight on front groups and corporate spin .
Americans for American Energy ( AAE ) is run by and operated out of a pro-energy lobbyist firm with offices in Colorado and Washington , DC called Policy Communications Inc .
AAE described itself as in 2006 as " a non-profit , grassroots - based organization dedicated to promoting public policies that encourage greater energy independence for America ...
We have members , allies and supporters from the agriculture , small business , manufacturing , state legislative leaders and others from coast to coast , " it stated . [ 1 ]
More recently the group has dropped the claim that it is a grassroots organisation but instead refers to having " grassroots supporters " .
[ 2 ]
Its domain registration was created in mid-March 2005 . [ 3 ]
AAE Run by Lobbyists
The President and CEO of Americans for American Energy is Greg Schnacke who is also a Vice President at Policy Communications Inc , where he " helps lead Policy Communication 's energy advocacy practice . "
Prior to his work as a lobbyist Schenke was Executive Director of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association ( COGA ) .
AAE and Policy Communications Inc. , are run our of the same address in Colorado .
Investigating environmentalists
In September 2008 , AAE asked Congress to investigate " possible illegal coordination between U.S. Interior Department officials and several national environmental groups . "
At issue were contacts between staffers with the Department 's National Landscape Conservation System ( NLCS ) and the Wilderness Society and National Wildlife Federation -- groups AAE accused of " pursuing an anti-American energy political agenda . " [ 4 ]
According to Representative Rob Bishop , a Republican from Utah , the Interior Department 's inspector general had already begun looking into the matter .
Federal employees are generally prohibited " from using appropriated funds or their official positions to lobby Congress . " [ 5 ]
As the Deseret News noted , the probe " comes after the Interior Department ... found that officials at its Minerals Management Service engaged in sexual relationships with energy industry representatives , and accepted gifts from them . " [ 6 ]
" Stop the War on the Poor " pro-drilling campaign
In July 2008 , AAE -- along with the industry - funded civil rights group Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) and the conservative values group High Impact Leadership Coalition -- launched a campaign to " Stop the War on the Poor . "
The goal of the campaign was to increase U.S. domestic oil and gas production . [ 7 ]
The campaign was launched at a Washington DC rally on July 15 , 2008 .
Rally speakers stressed " the need to expand domestic oil and gas production with the goal of reducing fuel costs for low - income households that feel a disproportionate pinch from rising energy prices , " reported Greenwire .
Signs at the rally included " My family needs affordable energy " and " Environmental groups do n't feed my family . "
CORE has received funding from ExxonMobil .
CORE 's Niger Innis said the group favors " government spending on oil shale , coal and drilling on the continental shelf and throughout Alaska , " because " when these resources are developed ... that is going to have a direct impact on the price of fuel . "
While some rally attendees told Greenwire about their difficulties " budgeting around today 's gasoline prices , " others " backd away from a reporter with a notebook .
...
One woman , who declined to give her name , said she was demonstrating at her boss 's behest . " [ 7 ]
Funding
On its website in 2006 the AAE stated that it operated as a non-profit " social welfare organization " under IRS Section 501( c ) ( 4 ) .
Contributions to Americans for American Energy are generally not considered deductible unless as they can be properly considered a business expense . " [ 1 ]
Americans for American Energy is funded by Pac / West Communications after receiving a three million dollar no bid contract from the State of Alaska to campaign for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Jim Sims , President of Policy Communications , is working with Pac / West Communications . [ 8 ]
In an interview with Jeff Young from the Living on Earth program , a consultant from Pac / West , Tom Randall , referring to AAE stated that " Well , grass roots are very effective .
We do grassroots political Campaigns .
Every campaign for president has a grass roots component ; because that 's one of the ways you can reach people . "
Randall told Young that the group was essentially one employee paid by Pac / West .
When this was put to Randall , he agreed ; " Sure " , he said . [ 8 ]
YOUNG :
Is it really grass roots , though ?
I mean if a PR firm gets 3 million dollars to carry out a campaign , that 's not what I think most people think of when they hear grass roots .
RANDALL : It 's grass roots if it gets a grassroots response , if other people in the grassroots join in , and that effort is multiplied , then you have a grassroots movement . [ 8 ]
Labeling environmentalists as terrorists
The AAE website attempts to link environmental concerns to terrorism , with a petition on its website which states :
AMERICA IS AT WAR !
And The U.S. Naval Oil Shale Reserve is Under Attack !
While Americans fight overseas defending America 's access to vital energy supplies , we are under attack here at home .
Liberal lawyers and environmental extremists are attacking the U.S. Naval Oil Shale Reserve , trying to prevent America from producing American energy there . [ 9 ]

Scientists , who termed the air pollutants persistent free radicals ( PFRs ) , say they form on fine airborne particles , usually the main culprit behind air pollution alerts in a lot of cities .
Even worse are the particles with metals like copper and iron , which are more likely to persist .
When inhaled , the lungs and other tissues absorb the PFRs , causing health effects similar to smoking .
While more research is needed to tie PFRs to certain diseases , scientists believe this could explain why 10 to 15 percent of those diagnosed with lung cancers are non-smokers .
The FBI 's Digital Collection System 3000 collects real - time phone records for authorized spy and criminal pen traps and traces .
Photo Illustration : Wired.com
In poring through the latest round of documents the FBI turned over to the Electronic Frontier Foundation about how the FBI legally plugs into the nation 's telephone system , THREAT LEVEL discovered that the nation 's secret spy court repeatedly questioned the FBI in 2005 and 2006 about whether the Bureau was exceeding its wiretap authority .
But there were other fine eavesdropping nuggets in those pages , including info on when the FBI learned to wiretap VOIP calls , how number portability messed with FBI taps , and a moment of candor from an FBI technician about how the FBI 's wiretapping software could work with the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .
For instance , the FBI accidentally listened in on one innocent American phone conversations due to a hack a phone company used to let people take port their phone numbers from one cell provider to another .
At issue is a workaround used by CDMA providers , where a carrier assigns an alias number to a ported number in order to speed up switching at a user 's usual calling area .
The workaround has the unfortunate side effect of occasionally reporting the alias – which could actually be a real person 's number – instead of the real caller to the FBI 's wiretapping software .
In the FBI 's own words , " due to misinformation in the call records , the unrelated subscriber was temporarily included in the investigation " and " this error has recently misled a few FBI investigations .
Secondly , in one message thread ( .pdf ) about moving offices in Manhattan and wiretapping the traditional wireline phone service in March 2006 , one FBI employee who works for the FBI 's Operational Technology Division asks if the NSA still does warrantless wiretaps and suggests how the FBI 's equipment could be configured to deal with the lack of court orders .
Does the [ redacted ] do intercepts without court orders ?
I thought we act as a proxy for [ redacted – likely FISA ] .
That is , we serve the company the order for the [ FISA ] targets .
If so there should not be a problem : the DCS - 3000 can direct all FISA traffic to the [ redacted - likely DCS - 5000 system ] .
If not , then we can segreagate the [ redacted - likely NSA ] traffic from our traffic by giving [ redacted - likely the carriers ] separate telephone numbers for [ redacted - likely the NSA ] and Bureau to deliver the CDC data .
For example , [ redacted - likely the NSA 's ] targets ' CDC data can be delivered to 212 - [ redacted phone number ] the FBI 's target 's CDC data can be delivered to 212 [ redacted phone number ] .
In reply , an FBI agent from New York City wrote back :
It is my understanding that we do act as a proxy with delivering their orders .
The [ redacted ] does that .
However , they do a lot more surveillance than we do .
I will get someone from the [ redacted - likely NSA ] down here when you guys come to set up the equipment for the DCS_3000 move .
A third message of interest note that in June 2005 , the FBI 's wiretapping software successfully collected foreign intelligence wiretaps on two separate VOIP subscribers ( provider is redacted in the docs ) .
The call records were delivered like any phone switch would , while the phone communication itself was snagged via a CALEA - like feature built - into Cisco CMTS routers , which delivered copies of the conversation to the FBI .
That 's pretty significant since the Justice Department argued that this capability had to be mandated for VOIP companies , when it seems the feds were able to pull it off without design mandates .
That interception predated the extension of CALEA mandates to the internet and IP traffic generally .
That mandate went into effect May 11 , 2007 , on what THREAT LEVEL dubbed " Wiretap the Internet Day . "

According to a report , Microsoft is n't just looking at the next version of Windows ( no , not Mojave ) for future OS possibilities , but is looking beyond the Windows architecture altogether with a project known as Midori .
The new OS is still in the " incubation " phase ( which puts it slightly closer to market than R&D projects ) , but Microsoft has admitted to its existence , and the Software Daily Times says at least one team in Redmond is actively working on the new architecture .
The basis for the platform centers around research related to Microsoft 's Singularity project , and envisions a distributed environment where applications , documents , and connectivity are blurred in a cloud - computing phantasmagoria which can be run natively or hosted across multiple systems .
The researchers are working to create a concurrent / parallel distribution of resources , as well as a method of handling applications across separate machines -- religiously - dubbed the Asynchronous Promise Architecture -- which will set the stage for a backwards - compatible operating system built from the ground up , with networks of varying size in mind .
Says the SD Times , " The Midori documents foresee applications running across a multitude of topologies , ranging from client - server and multi-tier deployments to peer - to - peer at the edge , and in the cloud data center .
Those topologies form a heterogeneous mesh where capabilities can exist at separate places . "

Help spread the truth about medicinal cannabis by commenting , ‘ Digging , ’ and passing this story on to others .
According to the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , colloquially known as MRSA or ‘ the superbug , ’ is now responsible for more annual US deaths than AIDS .
Yet despite this sobering statistic , it ’s unlikely that either JAMA or anyone in the mainstream US media will report on the findings of a forthcoming Italian study — you did n’t actually think I was going to say that this took place in America did you ?
— demonstrating that compounds in cannabis possess “ exceptional antibacterial activity ” against multi-drug resistant pathogens , including MRSA .
“ Although the use of cannabinoids as systemic antibacterial agents awaits rigorous clinical trials , … their topical application to reduce skin colonization by MRSA seems promising , ” the study ’s authors write .
“ Cannabis sativa … represents an interesting source of antibacterial agents to address the problem of multidrug resistance in MRSA and other pathogenic bacteria . ”
( You can read the full text ahead of publication here . )
Ironically , the study notes that preparations from cannabis were “ investigated extensively in the 1950s as highly active topical antiseptic agents . ”
Predictably — in yet another ‘ victory ’ for prohibition — authors declare that little , if any , research into this potential clinical application has taken place since .
Several years ago , when I first began writing the booklet Emerging Clinical Applications for Cannabis and Cannabinoids , I mused about what sort of advancements in the treatment of disease may have been achieved over the past 70 + years had U.S. government chosen to advance — rather than stifle — clinical research into the therapeutic effects of cannabis .
Now , more than ever , this is a question that our elected officials — both Republican and Democrat — must answer .

In a hotel in Louisville once , I overheard the guests in the lift .
They were attending the Kentucky state convention of colonic hydrotherapists .
At the time , I wondered :
What do they do in their hotel rooms between sessions ?
Last week I wondered if I could get them into joint session with the American Publishers ' Association , whose members definitely need their colons washed out .
I had been writing an essay for the Common Review in Chicago on second world war revisionism and had just finished the bibliography .
Check out some of the titles I cited .
Clive Ponting 's Armageddon : The Reality Behind the Distortions , Myths , Lies and Illusion of World War II ; Nicholson Baker 's Human Smoke : The Beginnings of World War II , the End of Civilisation ; Patrick Buchanan 's Churchill , Hitler and the Unnecessary War : How Britain Lost its Empire and the West Lost the World .
You will note : Notwithstanding the fall of empire , there is a rampant high tide of colonisation .
You will also detect an agenda .
These books are trying to tell or warn potential buyers that they will not be getting the conventional " good war " fought by the " greatest generation " .
David McCullough 's publishers felt no need to rename his book 1776 : The War in Which the Brits May Not Have Been Quite as Evil and King George Not Quite as Tyrannical as Our School Histories and Walt Disney Told Us .
Colons have been a staple of academic publishers for many years .
After all , no academic ever lost tenure by stinting on words .
Certainly , with some published theses you get the impression that the academic assessors weighed them in the balance – literally .
And their titles reflect it .
Now they have colonised even popular non-fiction titles like those above , and I can testify that publishers adorned my own books with subtitles .
They felt that short , pithy titles like The Alms Trade , Rum or Deserter all needed a mini- foreword to be pinned to them .
Indeed , word is that the internet is making it worse .
Publishers want to put as many keywords in the title as possible to get the click - on traffic for online buyers .
However , this expansion used to be mostly for non-fiction titles .
Now Nicholson Baker is breaking the boundaries .
His Human Smoke tries to get the best of both worlds , a creative Dos Passos cut - and - paste - style work masquerading as history .
Most historians , even tendentious ones , may have mentioned Hitler 's part in declaring war on the US .
Baker 's addition of the colonial subtitle lends a spurious historicity and academic rectitude to his polemic , while dangerously introducing the colon to creative works .
Think of what would have happened to George Orwell 's snappy title .

You can forgive Herman Melville for adding " or , The Whale " , to Moby Dick , since , firstly it has no colon , and secondly , when he published it no one would have had a clue what it was all about .
However , Moby Dick : How Ishmael Lost His Shipmates and Found His Soul While Chasing Jungian Archetypes Around the Globe and Carrying Out Experimental Marine Mammal Research , does not really cut the wasabi for the sushi .
Better still , imagine trying to get a plot summary behind a colon for one of Dickens 's discursive novels , or for that matter , imagine summarising War and Peace in a snappy subtitle .
No , it 's all gone too far .
We must all cleanse our colons .
How widely is the United States government using cellphones to pinpoint the locations or track the movements of Americans , or people living on American soil ?
In November 2007 , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Justice seeking records related to such tracking practices .
The Justice Department did not provide the requested information , the ACLU said .
And so Tuesday , the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit in federal court to try to force the Justice Deaprtment to comply .
In a news release , the ACLU said that the information about how and how often the government tracks Americans using cellphones needs to come to light to determine if the efforts are unconstitutional .
The ACLU said it filed the initial data request after media reports showed that some government officials were claiming not to require “ probable cause ” of a crime being committed before getting court permission to do real - time tracking of cell phones .
Specifically , the civil - liberties group said , it based its request on an article I wrote in December 2005 .
That article discussed the discomfort that some courts were feeling about the government ’s use of cellphone tracking technology .
In that story , legal officials said that some judges wanted government investigators to show probable cause .
As I noted in that article , the government can get such information from cellular operators , like Verizon Wireless and AT&T , which generally know the location of their subscribers within about 300 feet when their phones are turned on .
Such tracking information could be critical , prosecutors have said , to finding suspects or corroborating their whereabouts .
And prosecutors have said that there already were legal protections in place to prevent law enforcement from tracking at will , without cause .
But the ACLU and the EFF , an organization that focuses on Internet and technology law , said that the public has an “ overwhelming interest ” in finding out how often the government is seeking to track Americans and why .
If the information is withheld , it distances Americans from the decision - making process about how and when tracking should be permitted , the legal advocates said .
“ Further delays will allow important privacy polices to be developed behind closed doors , ” said David L. Sobel , senior counsel to the EFF .
It was n’t until 1968 that Fannie was privatized ....
The main reason for the change was surprisingly mundane : accounting .
At the time , Lyndon Johnson was concerned about the effect of the Vietnam War on the federal budget .
Making Fannie
Mae private moved its liabilities off the government ’s books , even if , as the recent crisis made clear , the U.S. was still responsible for those debts .
It was a bit like what Enron did thirty years later , when it used “ special - purpose entities ” to move liabilities off its balance sheet .
A report just released in the most recent issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society offers hope that a new high - resolution storm surge modeling system developed by scientists at Stony Brook University will better be able to predict flood levels and when flooding will occur in the New York metropolitan area , information crucial to emergency managers when planning for impending storms .
The report also warns that flooding is dependent not just upon the intensity of the tropical storm , hurricane , or nor 'easter , but also on the local phase of the tide at the time of the storm .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
In a project funded by New York Sea Grant , Brian Colle , Associate Professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science ( SoMAS ) at Stony Brook University , and colleagues tested the utility of coupling a state - of the art atmospheric model with an ocean model from the Stony Brook Storm Surge ( SBSS ) system in order to predict storm surges for the NYC metropolitan region .
Colle and colleagues tested their combined model against Tropical Storm Floyd and a nor 'easter from 11 - 12 December 1992 , and found the model predicted peak water levels comparable ( within 10 percent ) to those measured during the storms at several water level gauges around the region .
" Ultimately , the goal is to provide emergency managers with a range of possibilities as to what may happen as the result of a storm , and this approach shows great promise , " says Dr. Colle .
The modelers also performed simulations to assess the impact of parameters such as local tide level and wind intensity on flooding severity .
Model simulations showed that if Tropical Storm Floyd had arrived in NYC a week earlier , coinciding with a spring ( fortnightly ) high tide , water levels would likely have been high enough for minor flooding to occur .
Another simulation , which used wind levels of a Category 1 hurricane timed to arrive at spring high tide , predicted water levels likely to have caused significant flooding .
These results suggest that the New York City metropolitan region was spared from flooding during Tropical Storm Floyd only because the storm 's winds had weakened before reaching the region and because the strongest winds luckily occurred during local low tide .
" We 're playing Russian roulette in some sense with these storms coming up the coast , " says Colle .
" If we have a high tide or spring high tide when we have one of these events , then we 're in trouble . "
If a category - 3 hurricane hit NYC , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that nearly 30 % of the south side of Manhattan would be flooded .
Storm surge flooding could threaten billions of dollars of property and have a grave impact on the lives of the millions of people who live in NYC .
During the December 1992 nor 'easter , storm tides over - topped some of the region 's seawalls for only a few hours , but managed to flood the NYC subway and the PATH train systems at the train station in Hoboken New Jersey , shutting down these transportation systems for several days .
As sea level rises , NYC becomes even more vulnerable to storm surge flooding .
It takes high water levels of only 1.5- 1.75 m ( 4.92 â€ “ 5.74 feet ) above mean sea level to cause flooding over some of the southern Manhattan Island seawalls and global warming is expected to increase the rate at which sea level rises from 0.3 m ( 0.98 feet ) per century to 0.5 - .75 m ( 1.64 â€ “ 2.46 feet ) per century .
" The vulnerability of the area speaks for itself as we 've already had cases of flooding , " says Colle .
" When coupled with sea level rise , it 's not going to take much of a storm to cause flooding as we go into the coming decades , so we are working to provide better forecasting of these events in the future . "

Researchers at Johns Hopkins are reporting what is believed to be the most conclusive evidence to date that inadequate levels of vitamin D , obtained from milk , fortified cereals and exposure to sunlight , lead to substantially increased risk of death .
In a study set to appear in the Archives of Internal Medicine online Aug. 11 , the Johns Hopkins team analyzed a diverse sample of 13,000 initially healthy men and women participating in an ongoing national health survey and compared the risk of death between those with the lowest blood levels of vitamin D to those with higher amounts .
An unhealthy deficiency , experts say , is considered blood levels of 17.8 nanograms per milliliter or lower .
Of the 1,800 study participants known to have died by Dec. 31 , 2000 , nearly 700 died from some form of heart disease , with 400 of these being deficient in vitamin D .
This translates overall to an estimated 26 percent increased risk of any death , though the number of deaths from heart disease alone was not large enough to meet scientific criteria to resolve that it was due to low vitamin D levels .
Yet , researchers say it does highlight a trend , with other studies linking shortages of vitamin D to increased rates of breast cancer and depression in the elderly .
And earlier published findings by the team , from the same national study , have established a possible tie - in , showing an 80 percent increased risk of peripheral artery disease from vitamin D deficits .
Researchers note that other studies in the last year or so in animals and humans have identified a connection between low levels of vitamin D and heart disease .
But these studies , they say , were weakened by small sample numbers , lack of diversity in the population studied and other factors that limited scientists ' ability to generalize the findings to the public at large .
" Our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin D , and make sure they have enough , " says study co-lead investigator Erin Michos , M.D. , M.H.S .

" We think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin D deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease , putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors , such as age , gender , family history , smoking , high blood cholesterol levels , high blood pressure , lack of exercise , obesity and diabetes , " says Michos .
Vitamin D is well known to play an essential role in cell growth , in boosting the body 's immune system and in strengthening bones .
" Now that we know vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor , we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment , " says Michos , who adds that test screening for nutrient levels is relatively simple .
It can , she says , be made part of routine blood work and done while monitoring other known risk factors , including blood pressure , glucose and lipid levels .
Heart disease remains the nation 's leading cause of death , killing more than a million Americans each year .
Nearly 10 percent of those with the condition have not one identifiable , traditional risk factor , which the experts say is why a considerable extent of the disease goes unexplained .
Michos , an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and its Heart and Vascular Institute , recommends that people boost their vitamin D levels by eating diets rich in such fish as sardines and mackerel , consuming fortified dairy products , taking cod-liver oil and vitamin supplements , and in warmer weather briefly exposing skin to the sun 's vitamin - D producing ultraviolet light .
advertisement
Aware of the cancer risks linked to too much time spent in the sun , she says as little as 10 to 15 minutes of daily exposure to the sun can produce sufficient amounts of vitamin D to sustain health .
The hormone - like nutrient controls blood levels of calcium and phosphorus , essential chemicals in the body .
If vitamin supplements are used , Michos says there is no evidence that more than 2,000 international units per day do any good .
Study results show that heart disease death rates flattened out in participants with the highest vitamin D levels ( above 50 nanograms per milliliter of blood ) , signaling a possible loss of the vitamin 's protective effects at too - high doses .
The U.S. Institute of Medicine suggests that an adequate daily intake of vitamin D is between 200 and 400 international units ( or blood levels nearing 30 nanograms per milliliter ) .
Previous results from the same nationwide survey showed that 41 percent of men and 53 percent of women are technically deficient in the nutrient , with vitamin D levels below 28 nanograms per milliliter .
Michal Melamed , M.D. , M.H.S. , study co-lead investigator who started the research as a clinical fellow at Johns Hopkins , says no one knows yet why or how vitamin D's hormone - like properties may protect the heart , but she adds that there are plenty of leads in the better known links the vitamin has to problems with muscle overgrowth and high blood pressure , in addition to its control of inflammation , which scientists are showing plays a stronger role in all kinds of heart disease .
But more research is needed to determine the nutrient 's precise biological action .
Researchers say their next steps are to test various high doses of vitamin D to find out if the nutritional supplementation results in fewer deaths and lower incidence of heart disease , including heart attack or moments of prolonged and severe chest pain .
The team also plans to investigate what biological triggers , such as obesity or hypertension , might offset or worsen the action of vitamin D on heart muscle , or whether vitamin D sets off some other reaction in the heart .
Melamed says that because vitamin D levels are known to fluctuate in direct proportion with daily physical activity , the growing epidemic of obesity and indoor sedentary lifestyles lend more urgency to act on the vitamin D factor .
Funding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health , the P.J. Schafer Cardiovascular Research Fund and the Paul Beeson Physician Faculty Scholars in Aging Program .
Michos has received previous consulting fees from vitamin D therapeutics manufacturer Abbott Pharmaceuticals .
The terms of these arrangements are being managed by the Johns Hopkins University in accordance with its conflict of interest policies .
Besides Michos and Melamed , other Hopkins researchers involved in this study , conducted solely at Hopkins , were Wendy Post , M.D. ; and Brad Astor , Ph.D. Melamed is now an assistant professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York City .
How I nearly lost my business after refusing to hire a Muslim hair stylist who would n't show her hair
It seems too lunatic to be true .
But here a hair salon boss reveals how she was driven to the brink of ruin - and forced to pay £ 4,000 for ' hurt feelings ' - after refusing to hire a Muslim stylist who would n't show her hair at work
For Sarah Desrosiers , meeting Bushra Noah was not a moment in her life that she would describe as especially memorable .
Not only was it brief - lasting little more than ten minutes - but it was rapidly obvious to Sarah that Bushra was not the person for the junior stylist position she was trying to fill at her hairdressing salon .
Sarah 's reasoning ?
Quite simply that Bushra , a Muslim who wears a headscarf for religions reasons , had made it clear she would not be removing the garment even while at work .
Sarah Desrosiers says she did nothing wrong by not employing Bushra Noah and would have done the same if an employee refused to remove a baseball cap
Sarah felt that a job requirement of any hairdresser was that the stylist 's hair would provide clients with a showcase of different looks .
Especially one working in a salon such as hers , which specialises in alternative cuts and colours .
Yet the ten minutes during which Sarah 's world collided with Bushra 's has resulted in an extraordinary employment battle , in which she was accused of ' direct ' and ' indirect ' discrimination .
For a year , Sarah has been facing financial ruin , due to a compensation claim for £ 34,000 brought by Bushra , 19 , who has maintained she is due that figure after being turned down for a job at the Wedge salon in London 's King 's Cross .
In the event , the tribunal ruled this week that while Bushra 's claim of direct discrimination failed , her claim for indirect discrimination had succeeded .
Sarah has therefore been ordered to pay £ 4,000 compensation by way of ' injury to feelings ' .
Although this is a smaller sum than she 'd feared she might have to hand over , Sarah , 32 , is still outraged .
' I am a small business and the bottom line is that this is not a woman who worked for me , ' says Sarah .
Bushra Noah says that Sarah Desrosiers ' hurt her feelings ' by not employing her after a ten minute interview
' She is simply someone I met for a job interview , who , for a host of reasons , was not right for the job .
I can not see how she deserves £ 4,000 .
' As for the notion that I 've injured her feelings - well , people 's feelings get injured every day .
I dread to think the sorts of things that people will try to claim injured feelings for now that this precedent has been set . '
In its ruling , the tribunal said it was ' satisfied that Bushra was not treated less favourably than Sarah would have treated any woman who , whether Muslim or not , wears a hair covering at all times when at work ' .
Accordingly , the claim of direct discrimination failed .
But with regard to the issue of indirect discrimination , they found that Sarah had pursued a ' legitimate aim - that aim being to promote the image of the business ' .
However , the burden of proof was on Sarah to prove that her means of achieving that legitimate aim was proportionate .
She was not able to prove her contention that employing someone with a headscarf would have the negative impact on her business 's stylistic integrity that she feared .
Since the judgment , Bushra , who is of Syrian descent and has worn a headscarf since she was 13 , has , so far at least , chosen not to comment .
But , speaking last year , she admitted she had attended 25 interviews for hairdressing jobs without success .
But Sarah , she told the tribunal , had upset her the most .
She said : ' I felt so down and got so depressed .
I thought : " If I am not going to defend myself , who is ? "
Hairdressing has been what I 've wanted to do ever since I was at high school .
Bushra Noah ( left ) and Sarah Derosiers ( right ) arriving at court during the employment tribunal battle
' This has ruined my ambitions .
Wearing a headscarf is essential to my beliefs . '
Bushra had a job in a salon in London , where her tasks included cutting hair , highlighting , tinting and perming , before she left to get married in Syria in 2006 .
But on her return to Britain , she was unable to find work .
She has given up her ambitions to become a hairdresser and is studying travel and tourism at Hammersmith and West London College while working part - time in a shop .
At the tribunal , Bushra was asked if Sarah had made derogatory remarks about her headscarf .
She replied : ' She did not .
She just asked me if I wore it all the time , or whether I 'd take it off . '
Although Bushra is believed to have been acting alone , in the past similar cases have been championed by Muslim traditionalist groups .
In 2006 , the Law Lords overturned a court ruling that teenager Shabina Begum 's human rights were violated when she was banned from wearing full Islamic dress at school .
Sarah in her salon - Wedge - located in north London says that the discrimination case against her almost ruined her business
The extremist Muslim group Hizb ut - Tahrir later admitted that it had ' advised her ' .
Meanwhile , Sarah Desrosiers is wondering how to raise the £ 4,000 she has been ordered to pay Bushra .
She has spent her savings on her legal battle and simply has no money left .
' I am a one - woman band , and am already in debt due to the set - up costs of opening my own salon , ' says Sarah .
' I dread to think how many haircuts I 'm going to have to do to earn the £ 4,000 I have to pay Bushra .
This has , without doubt , been the worst year of my life . '
Such a messy set of circumstances , let alone the strain of having the case bought against her , was certainly not what Sarah expected when she started out on her career aged 17 .
From the outset , she had grand ambitions , telling her mother that she would one day have her own salon .
' Even back then , I realised how important your own hair is to the job , ' says Sarah .
' I went into hairdressing a rather plain brunette , but within a few weeks I had a bright red crop .
' I wanted to provide clients with inspiration through my own hair .
Whether they 're in a conventional High Street salon , or something slightly different like my salon , customers expect to see the stylists with hair that is on trend , striking and can give them ideas for their own look . '
In 1997 , Sarah got a job at a salon on London 's Portobello Road , where she remained for almost a decade .
In March 2006 , feeling ready to spread her wings , she wrote a business plan , secured a loan and invested £ 5,000 of her savings into the lease on a small salon on Caledonian Road .
She named it Wedge , and planned to specialise in ' urban and edgy ' cuts , rather like the cerise colour she often dyes her own hair .
' I 'd never felt as proud as I did on the day I picked up the keys to my salon , ' says Sarah .
' I was prepared to put my heart and soul into my business in order to make ends meet , and for the first few months , I worked 12 hours a day , six days a week , all by myself .
' I barely saw daylight , but I did n't mind because I was fulfilling my ambition .
' Of course , there were a few nerve - racking moments , such as when another salon opened a few doors away .
But that is part of owning your own business , and I felt proud of all I was achieving .'
By March 2007 , the business was doing so well that Sarah needed to take on another stylist .
To minimise her overheads , she decided the best way to do this would be by renting out a chair in her salon to an experienced stylist - who would take a share of her profits - and employ a junior to work for both of them .
Sarah received dozens of applications for the junior position , one of which was from Bushra Noah .
' Her CV did n't stand out because I was looking for someone who lived locally - something I 'd specified in the advert so that I could call them in as and when required - and she lived several miles away in Acton , ' says Sarah .
' One day she rang up to see if I 'd got her CV and begged me for an interview .
I told her I had concerns about where she lived , but she sounded so desperate that I agreed she could come in for a chat . '
A few days later , Bushra duly arrived at the salon .
' I have to say I did n't take to her , ' says Sarah .
' She waltzed into the salon and hung up her coat as though she already had the job .
' Naturally , I noticed her headscarf .
But I presumed that , as she 's a hairdresser , she 'd take if off when she was working .
In 16 years , I 've never known any stylist cover their hair with a headscarf .
And this particular headscarf came all the way down to her eyebrows and covered her entire hairline .'
Sarah broached the subject with Bushra , who said she would not be removing the garment .
After ten minutes , with the interview complete , Sarah said she would come back to Bushra about the vacancy .
' As she left , Bushra turned to me and said that she 'd been turned down for jobs before , ' says Sarah .
' And I admit I thought : " Well , what do you expect ? "
' It was not a religious matter .
If she 'd come in wearing a baseball cap and saying she would n't take it off for work , then she would n't have got the job either . '
One morning in the second week of June 2007 , an innocuous white envelope landed on Sarah 's doormat .
It contained a letter saying that she was being sued for £ 15,000 for indirect and direct discrimination by Bushra Noah .
This , the letter stated , related to compensation for injury to her feelings and lost earnings .
Later , that figure was increased to £ 34,000 .
' I read it and re-read it and stood there dumbfounded , ' says Sarah .
' I remembered Bushra , and I guessed straight away that the claim related to the headscarf .
In my mind I was saying " But I was n't discriminating , it 's just a part of the job " , over and over again .
' I dialled the number at the top of the letter and was told I needed to get a solicitor , but that because I worked , I was n't entitled to Legal Aid .
I thought : " This is it - my business is over . "
I was devastated .'
Using her savings of £ 2,000 , Sarah employed a lawyer who helped her draft a statement about her meeting with Bushra .
But with his fees at £ 280 an hour , she knew she could n't afford to fight a satisfactory legal battle .
Her parents - her mother is a nurse , and her father is retired - were n't in a position to help her out financially either .
' I was at my wits ' end , and I had no idea how I was going to pay for my legal fees , ' says Sarah .
' I was virtually being accused of racism , which is ridiculous .
I 've cut the hair of people from all walks of life , including transsexuals , and you can hardly run an alternative salon if you are prejudiced . '
Help came when a friend tipped off a reporter about what was happening , and Sarah 's case gained publicity , first locally , then nationally .
Since then , she has received support from hundreds of people in the hairdressing industry , including black celebrity stylist Errol Douglas .
Still , the wave of support did little to ease the stress as she fought to clear her name .
' For months , I could n't sleep , I could n't eat , I felt as though my whole life was on hold .
All I could see was that I 'd be forced into bankruptcy and lose my business . '
In the course of preparing for her trial , Sarah estimates she has lost £ 40,000 of her salon 's annual income .
She also faced a further blow when it emerged that Bushra had increased the figure to £ 34,000 to compensate for hate mail she had received following Press coverage of the trial .
In March , Sarah faced a three - day employment tribunal , and endured four hours of cross-examination .
' I managed to defend myself and not cry , but it was incredibly difficult , ' she says .
' I 'd even had to ask my accountant , who is a Muslim , and another Muslim friend to write letters confirming that I am not racist .
The whole experience was so humiliating and , most importantly , unnecessary . '
' I kept thinking : " I 've worked hard all my life - how can it be possible that someone can come into my shop , talk to me for ten minutes and then sue me for £ 34,000 ?
How is that possibly fair ? " .'
As she reels from the verdict , Sarah is contemplating her next move .
While part of her is tempted to pay , simply to close the door on this unpleasant episode , she also feels she should fight to clear her name .
Her lawyers are advising her on whether or not she can appeal .
' Because of this there will be a black mark against my name for the rest of my life , ' she says .
' I feel I have not done anything wrong , and this is a terrible price to pay for a meeting that lasted ten minutes . '
Daily Telegraph | November 24 , 2008
TASER electronic stun guns are a form of torture that can kill , a UN committee has declared after several recent deaths in North America .
“ The use of these weapons causes acute pain , constituting a form of torture , ” the UN ’s Committee against Torture said .
“ In certain cases , they can even cause death , as has been shown by reliable studies and recent real - life events , ” the committee of 10 experts said .
Three men , all in their early 20s , were reported to have died in the United States this week , days after a Polish man died at Vancouver airport after being Tasered by Canadian police .
The man , Robert Dziekanski , 40 , fell to the ground and died after the police officers piled on top of him .
There have been three deaths in Canada after the use of Tasers over the past five weeks .
The company that makes the weapons has said that similar deaths have been shown by “ medical science and forensic analysis ” to be “ attributable to other factors and not the low - energy electrical discharge of the Taser ” .
The UN committee made its comments in recommendations to Portugal , which has bought the newest Taser X26 stun gun for use by police .
Portugal “ should consider giving up the use of the Taser X26 , ” as its use can have a grave physical and mental impact on those targeted , which violates the UN ’s Convention against Torture , the experts said .

This guide is intended to provide readers with ideas , how - to tips , and resources to build multiple income streams and make more money .
If you are interested in becoming less dependent on your job and earn your way to wealth , this is the guide for you .
On the other hand , this guide is not about getting rich quick or making easy money .
Two Types of Income
There are many different opinion on how many types of income there are .
Personally , I feel it comes down to two main types :
Active Income ( or Earned Income ) —
You are working for money .
The key characteristic of active income is the cost of time .
You must trade time ( a limited resource ) for money .
If you stop , the income also stops .
Passive Income ( or Residual Income ) —
Money is working for you .
This is the opposite of active income .
Once you stop spending time on these income sources , the income flows do n’t necessarily stop .
Of course , there are varying degrees of passivity and it ’s desirable to have highly passive income sources .
Here ’s an illustration of active - passive income spectrum :
Your goal is to have more passive income , and depend less on active income as you grow older .
Seven Sources of Income
In term of sources of income , or streams of income , you want to build up as many as you can , especially the passive ones .
Here are some sources of income … the exact categorization is not as important as the focus on building up many sources of income .
Job Income –
This includes your primary job , part - time job , second job , side gigs , etc .
One important thing to note is that if your “ business ” requires your active participation , then it is a job .
This is where you trade time for money .
Business Income –
This is any business that does n’t require 100 % of your active participation to generate income .
If you can scale it so that you do n’t always have to work for the business to make money , then it falls into this category .
Investment Income –
This is a huge category since there are many types of investment .
Real Estate Income –
This is an important investment and I think it deserves its own category .
Royalties and Patents – This covers all the sales and licensing of intellectual properties and creative work .
Inherited Income –
If you ’re one of the lucky ones that do n’t have to work for your money …. well , you would n’t be reading this blog anyway …
Other Income –
This is a catch - all category that includes income from Social Security , Pension , Unemployment , and anything else I ca n’t think of right now .
Did I leave out anything ?
Your goal is to have as many sources of income as you efficiently can .
Alternative Income
Alternative income is basically a catch - all for any non-primary job income .
This phrase will make it easier for us to discuss the concept of income generation and wealth building since I do n’t have to keep saying “ all your income streams that are not from your primary job ” — that ’s a mouthful !
Most people have one job and may be a small investment portfolio and that ’s it !
Having a healthy alternative income is an essential component of financial freedom … after all , you have to be able to quit your job in order to retire .
Alternative income is important because it increases your total income and accelerates your wealth building capacity .
As you can see from the image , addition income can be channeled into your income producing assets like investments , real estate , and business to generate even more income .
Your New Career
When most people think about career , they are thinking about their job .
This is the wrong way to think .
While your job is important early in your life , your career should be focus on building alternative income streams NOT building your job .
Why ?
There are several advantages to having multiple income streams :
If you lose your job , your income disappear .
If you lose an income stream , your income is lowered .
.
The higher you are on the job career ladder , the harder it is to find an equivalent paying replacement job .
Multiple income streams will help you reach your financial goals faster .
Multiple income streams give you a taste of financial freedom .
For most people , financial freedom occurs when you no longer need your job to cover your living expenses .
.
Multiple income streams give you greater flexibility and leverage .
You ’re in a much more powerful position when you know that you are not 100 % dependent on your job .
I believe that the concept of having a traditional career is dead ( with a few exceptions ) .
It ’s too risky to rely on one source of income , especially when most employers do not hesitate to cut jobs to make their numbers look good .
It ’s imperative for everyone to minimize their income risk by building multiple income streams .
The Time and Effort to Build Alternative Income Streams
I received several comments about time an effort it takes to build and grow alternative income streams .
Why should you try to build another income stream when you could work a few extra hours at work to get the same amount ?
Here are two good reasons to build an additional income stream , rather than work more hours at a job ( or get a second job ) :
Building your primary income ( i.e. , your job ) takes a tremendous amount of time , effort , and money as well .
Many jobs require a college degree and some require even more education and training .
I think 4 years of college is a lot of time , effort , and money !
Compare all of that time to spending 3 hours a day for a year to build an income stream that could produce $ 1,000 a month .
Once you set up an income stream ( particularly a passive one ) you could shift your focus to other income ideas .
For example , if you have $ 10,000 in a savings account earning 1 % per year , you will continue to receive $ 100 a year even if you stop paying attention to that income stream .
On the other hand , if you stop working , your paycheck will stop .
How to Make More Money with Multiple Income Streams
I have a simple framework that can be used to create multiple income streams .
There are endless possibilities when it comes to business ideas , and you can apply this framework to many of them .
7 Key Factors to Building Successful Income Streams
Building multiple income streams is simple , but not easy .
Based on my own experience , I feel that there are 7 key success factors :
Passion —
Do what you love .
Proficiency — Focus on what you are good at .
Patience —
Do n’t expect to see the desired results right away .
Effort —
Understand that some income ideas take more effort than others .
Persistence —
Not everything you try will be successful ; keep trying .
Diversify —
Do n’t stop at the first thing that works ; keep looking for more and different ways .
Little by little —
Trickles of money from many streams combine to provide a decent amount of money .
For additional information , please take a look at 7 Key Factors to Build Successful Income Streams .
Become a Part - Time Entrepreneur
As we established above , it ’s unwise to rely on one source of income and bet the farm on your career .
One option is to become a part - time entrepreneur .
Being a part - time entrepreneur allows you to maintain your regular income plus benefits , while at the same time giving you the opportunity to explore and expand your alternative income streams .
As a part - time entrepreneur , you can afford to make mistakes and take on more risks .
You can also go at your own pace as you develop your income streams .
For additional information , please take a look at Why Should You Become a Part - Time Entrepreneur .
How to Start Building a New Income Stream
If you are looking for a concrete place to start as you develop alternative income streams , here is my 4 - step guide :
Start with ideas related to things that you enjoy doing .
Get away from the stuff that you do not like .
You ’ll spend a lot of time getting your business going , so you might as well do something you like .
Create a proper business plan .
Even if you have a very simple business , a good business plan can help keep you on the right track , providing you with direction .
Small Business Administration ( SBA ) has some of the best resources on the web to get you started .
At the very least , make sure your business is viable .
Implement and execute .
The best plans and ideas do n’t mean a thing unless you can turn them into reality .
It takes some courage and a lot of willpower to make things happen , and you need to be persistent in your efforts .
Learn and improve .
Even if your business fails , it ’s a success if you learn something from the experience .
Very few people are successful on their first attempt at starting a business , so do n’t give up .
Your task is to learn from past failures and turn that cumulative experience into an eventual success .
Income Ideas and Resources
To help you get started , I ’ve put together a couple of list that could be a good starting point to help you zero in on idea(s ) that you want to try :
What to Do With the Extra Income
Once you have extra money flowing in , it ’s time to use the cash to help you achieve your financial goals .
Here are some ideas :
Pay off debt
Start an emergency fund
Save and invest
Reinvest in your income streams to make them bigger and better
Research and start a new income stream
Buy a new income stream
Spend it and enjoy life
Lastly …
I ’d love to hear your comments regarding this guide so that I can make it more useful .

Posted by Sir Cucumber at on Wednesday , August 6 , 2008
There is nothing better in this life than getting paid to do what you love , which I guess is why I ’ve always been so fond of the Hitman series .
Actually , there are many reasons :
To start , there ’s 47 .
We ’ve walked in many ( unconscious or dead ) men ’s shoes , he and I , and if there ’s one thing I ’ve learned about him it ’s that he ’s not a judging man .
Yes , he believes people should maintain a standard of professional discretion and strive for self improvement by learning from our mistakes , but if someone were to tire of exploratory subterfuge and lurking in bathroom stalls with hypodermic needles and just blast their way through a job , well that ’s on them .
47 ’s never been much of a conversationalist , but I ’d sooner drink a beer or catch a fish with a cloned sociopath than some angst - ridden spiky - do in shortpants that does n’t know when to shut up .
Also he still reads local newspapers .
Solid Snake is a fucking geriatric but do you ever see him pick up a copy of the Shadow Moses Sun -Times when he 's in town ?
47 gets a chuckle from the police blotter but his favorite has always been Marmaduke ...
Hitman also does n’t fuck with the program .
Like Ratchet & Clank , I know what to expect from this franchise , and I get it .
In fact , the most significant addition to Blood Money is not multiplayer garotte - offs , downloadable 47 facial hair upgrades , or a spunky sidekick , but that guards no longer become suspicious of your disguises when they see you run .
This may make the game a little less realistic , but if I ’m going to spend my night repeating a sequence over and over and over to get it right I ’m grateful to not have to do it at a snail ’s pace .
And anyway it ’s rather silly to strive for realism when not a single bodyguard or federal agent can recognize an infamous albino assassin with a barcode on the back of his bald head just because he dons a chef ’s hat .
Chengdu , China
The world can be divided in many ways  rich and poor , democratic and authoritarian  but one of the most striking is the divide between the societies with an individualist mentality and the ones with a collectivist mentality .
This is a divide that goes deeper than economics into the way people perceive the world .
If you show an American an image of a fish tank , the American will usually describe the biggest fish in the tank and what it is doing .
If you ask a Chinese person to describe a fish tank , the Chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim .
These sorts of experiments have been done over and over again , and the results reveal the same underlying pattern .
Americans usually see individuals ; Chinese and other Asians see contexts .
When the psychologist Richard Nisbett showed Americans individual pictures of a chicken , a cow and hay and asked the subjects to pick out the two that go together , the Americans would usually pick out the chicken and the cow .
They ’re both animals .
Most Asian people , on the other hand , would pick out the cow and the hay , since cows depend on hay .
Americans are more likely to see categories .
Asians are more likely to see relationships .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Terry Read transferred $ 400 into his wife 's checking account on a Friday .
Over the weekend , his wife used her debit card to make some small purchases , and on Monday she was slammed with a $ 35 overdraft fee because his cash transfer had n't cleared yet .
" They took my $ 400 out of my account immediately of course , " Read said .
Since both use the same bank , hitting his wife with an overdraft fee seemed " absolutely ridiculous " to him .
Overdraft fees set in when a bank approves a transaction even if the customer does n't have sufficient funds .
The bank is essentially providing a temporary loan and charging plenty - usually between $ 25 and $ 35 , no matter how big or small the transaction .
Banks typically provide overdraft protection automatically , and while it 's touted as a convenience , the cost can come as a shock to unsuspecting customers .
" Banks should have to get their customers ' affirmative consent before signing them up for their most expensive loans , " Jean Ann Fox , director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America said in a statement .
Almost half of all overdrafts happen with debit card purchases , according to the Center for Responsible Lending .
And most debit overdrafts are small , averaging less than the overdraft fee , the consumer advocacy group said .
In a recent study , the Consumer Federation of America found that overdraft fees at the 10 largest banks are on the rise .
The average highest fee charged for overdrafts is $ 34.65 , up 15 % from 2005 , the consumer group said .
There can be additional fees if the overdraft is not repaid by making a sufficient deposit within a few days and customers can rack up as many as six or seven overdraft fees in one day if they are n't aware of their low balance .
Now Congress may step in .
Reps . Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. and Barney Frank , D - Mass. , have proposed the Consumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices
Act in an attempt to protect consumers from hefty fees .
" I 've been working on reducing sky - high overdraft fees for several years now , " Congresswoman Maloney said in an e-mail to CNNMoney.com .
" Overdraft loans can be useful financial tools , but many consumers are being enrolled in costly overdraft protection programs without their consent .
[ Under the bill ] consumers would have to " opt- in " to overdraft protection programs and banks would be required to inform consumers when they are about to overdraw their accounts . "
The bill , which is currently pending before Congress , also requires that banks provide full , written disclosure of their overdraft policies to customers .
In a statement , Citibank ( C , Fortune 500 ) said that full disclosure is already standard practice , and overdraft fees should not be viewed as unfair or deceptive , since Citi customers are informed about the practice and the $ 34 overdraft fee .
What can you do ?
Other banks also counter that their overdraft policies are clear and the fees are disclosed at the time an account is opened .
Also , since many banks offer online banking , telephone banking and balance alerts via e-mail for free , consumers should be able to keep a careful eye on their balance .
" In most cases , banking customers can avoid overdrafting their accounts and paying any associated fee by knowing their balances , " said Fred Solomon , a spokesman at PNC ( PNC , Fortune 500 ) bank .
PNC recently sent its customers a notice allowing them to opt - out of overdraft access .
" They can call PNC and we will automatically exclude them from the convenience of overdraft access for all ATM transactions and purchases , " Solomon said .
Other banks will do this too , although the consumer may have to take the initiative and ask for it .
Another way to avoid costly overdraft fees is to sign up for an overdraft protection plan with a linked account .
Those plans allow banking customers to link their checking account with a savings account or even their credit card .
So if you write a check and there is n't enough money in your checking account to cover it , then the bank will draw the money from another account .
But that assumes that you have other funds .
And despite the fact that you 're backing the account with your own money , in most cases there 's a charge for that service too , although it 's far less than the overdraft fee .
For example , Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) customers get charged $ 5 for each time they use their overdraft protection plan .
Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB , Fortune 500 ) offers this service for $ 9 a pop .
If you use the overdraft protection more than 10 times in a 12 - month period , then the fee gets upped to $ 15 .
Despite the expense , there is an upside to overdraft protection .
It not only allows you to complete a transaction and remain in good standing with the parties you do business with , you also avoid the potential embarrassment of being denied at the register .
That might be worth $ 35 to some people .
When I was sixteen the local Driver ’s Ed course was offered on a muggy , unbearably humid week in the dead of summer .
The classroom was on the top floor of an old , downtown building , the kind housing a mixed bag of dentists , lawyers , and old travel agencies with faded posters in the windows , brown beaches and blue oceans now all a uniform dull gray , the dented and scratched selling point under the bold promise “ You ’ll never want to come home again ! ”
The classroom had no air conditioning — just a few windows propped open with books and rulers , pleading with ol ’
Ma Nature for some heavenly breeze to keep us awake and help us get through the day .
We panted and dripped and the room reeked like a pack of chalk crumbled like saltines into a big soup bowl of sweat .
It was a strange class , because nobody knew each other and we were all going separate ways after the week was up .
The in - car lessons following the in - classroom ones were to be done one - on - one , with the instructor picking us up from our house and taking us to parking lots and quiet sideroads to master The Art of the Wheel .
I do n’t know about you , but for me that week of Driver ’s Ed classes was torture .
Learning how to drive in a classroom is like learning to ride a bike in a swimming pool .
It just makes no sense .
Overheads were thrown up on screen and the instructor would spend half an hour drawing triangles to show us our blind spots .
We would discuss the history and importance of seatbelts and watch lengthy videos of a camera pointed out the windshield of a moving car with the narrator saying things like “ I see an intersection on my left .
I notice there are no cars coming .
I proceed through the intersection . ”
It ’s fair to say most of Driver ’s Ed class is pretty foggy to me .
My notes are long gone and there ’s no way I could draw you a picture of my blind spot .
But there is one thing that I do remember from those classes .
One bit of one lecture on one afternoon that stuck in my head .
It was when the instructor said that every driver goes through four steps on their way to learning how to drive .
Tapping his chalk on the blackboard to get our attention he continued , “ It ’s just a matter of knowing what step you ’re in . ”
Step 1 : You do n’t know you do n’t know .
You ’ve never tried to drive a car before so you have no idea that you suck at it .
All you know is that there are cars everywhere and people driving them .
So what ’s so hard about that ?
You ’ve never tried to drive a car before so you have no idea that you suck at it .
All you know is that there are cars everywhere and people driving them .
So what ’s so hard about that ?
Step 2 : You know you do n’t know .
Surprise !
You ca n’t drive .
You realize it the first time you make a painfully slow and wide turn into the wrong lane .
It hits home when you tire - punch the curb and accidentally run a red light , but slow down for a green one you think should be changing .
You ca n’t park , ca n’t parallel park , ca n’t park on a hill , and forget to signal .
It ’s depressing , but at least now you know you do n’t know .
You made it to Step 2 , whether you wanted to or not .

Step 3 : You know you know .
After a while it finally comes — the blissful day when you realize for the first time you can drive !
Step 3 usually arrives after scaring a few pedestrians , enduring a few frustrating coaching sessions with your parents , and listening to a few dozen “ Uh - oh , you ’re on the road ? ” jokes .
But you finally made it .
And now you ’re higher than a kite , sitting pretty on Cloud 10 .
Congratulations !

Step 4 : You do n’t know you know .
Eventually , it becomes old hat .
You know you ’re on Step 4 the first time you arrive at work instead of the grocery store on Saturday morning or land in your driveway with a sudden panic that you ca n’t remember the last fifteen minutes of your commute .
“ How did I get here , ” you ask yourself , before eventually realizing that you must ’ve just driven home in a waking dream , signaling subconsciously and turning effortlessly , your brain clicking over to autopilot without letting you know .
When this happens you ’re on Step 4 .
You do n’t even know you know anymore .
But this is n’t about Step 4 .
It ’s about Step 3 .
It ’s about the great joy of realizing you ’ve learned something new , something massively new , and can feel proud that your effort , practice , and determination have finally paid off .
That first day you first realize you can drive is a wicked high .
And is n’t it a great sense of freedom when the road hockey rinks and street chalkboards of your childhood transform into highways to drive-ins and out - of - town parties ?
The world seems to suddenly shrink and open up .
It ’s cool thinking how many cities and places connect to the street you live on .
That ’s when you look up to the sky , smile and nod slowly , and recall the faded posters of the old travel agency downtown .
“ You ’ll never want to come home again ! ”
AWESOME !

Marlboro Man loves this sandwich .
It uses very simple ingredients and is so rich and satisfying , he ’ll forego food for weeks ( okay , hours ) if he knows one is on the horizon .
Matteo loves this sandwich , too .
Matteo is Marlboro Man ’s cousin , and he requires ( not requests — requires ) that I make this sandwich for him whenever he comes to town .
He loves this sandwich every bit as much as Marlboro Man does , but with a slightly disturbing twist : he does n’t want anyone else on earth ever to have one .
In fact , yesterday when Marlboro Man informed Matteo that a demonstration of their favorite sandwich would be appearing on this website today , Matteo actually objected .
He did n’t think it was a good idea for Ree to share the idea with the world , he said .
I was puzzled .
" What ’s he gonna do ? " I asked .
" Market the recipe to the masses , make a fortune , and retire at 35 ? " Marlboro Man explained , " No .
He just does n’t want anyone else to know about it .
He ’s very protective of his sandwich . "
I still do n’t understand it , but the sheer lunacy this sandwich has apparently fostered in Matteo is a clear illustration of just how good it is .
It ’s meaty .
It ’s manly .
It ’s flavorful .
And your man will grunt and daydream about Makita table saws and heavy machinery as he woofs it down .
Let ’s get started on this testosterone - beef - fest , shall we ?
The Cast of Characters : 2 1/2 pounds cube steak ( tenderized round steak that ’s been extra-tenderized ) , sliced onions , butter , Lawry ’s Seasoned Salt , Worcestershire sauce , and Tabasco .
How simple is that ?
Let ’s start by slicing the onion .
Here ’s how I do it : First , cut in half from the root end to the top .
Then lay each half on its side and cut off the top .
Peel off the outer layer of skin …
… And start slicing away .
Next , melt 1/4 stick of regular butter in a skillet .
( This is not the last you ’ll see of the butter , mark my words . )
Add the onions .
Stir together .
Cook over medium - low heat , stirring occasionally , until onions are soft and light brown ( about 7 - 10 minutes . )
While the onions are cooking , go ahead and slice the meat .
Notice how the tenderizing has given the meat a directional grain ?
You ’ll want to slice against — or perpendicular to — the grain .
Cut each piece into strips …
Until it ’s all sliced .
Now season the meat with a nice sprinkling of Lawry’s .
The onions , meanwhile , have been cooking away .
They ’re just about right .
Transfer the onions from the skillet to a plate .
Now it ’s time to cook the meat .
Add 2 Tablespoons butter to the same skillet .
Turn the heat to high .
Let the butter melt and begin to turn brown , about two minutes .
You ’ll want the skillet to be hot .
Now add the meat to the hot skillet in a single layer .
Do not stir .
Let it sit for about a minute , or long enough for one side to turn brown .
Using a spatula , flip the meat to the other side .
Notice the first side was allowed to get nice and brown .
When it comes to the surface of meat , I ’m a big fan of color .
In my humble opinion , there ’s nothing worse than gray meat .
Once the meat is brown , generously add Worcestershire sauce .
Start with about 1 /2 cup .
You can always add more later if it needs more juice .
Next , add Tabasco to taste .
About five or six shakes is sufficiently hot for Marlboro Man , way too hot for most kids , and not hot enough for Matteo .
Stir to combine .
Then add another 2 tablespoons of butter ( yes , I said " butter " again ) just to finish off the sauce .
I promise , you wo n’t regret it .
Oh .
One more thing .
If you ’re looking for low - fat recipes , you ’ve come to the wrong place .
Next , add in the onions …
Stir together .
Now cover the meat mixture and let it sit while you prepare the rolls .
I use these .
Or these , whichever happens to be available in my teeny - tiny local grocery store .
Now , if you like to do things the right way , spread each half generously with softened butter .
( Yes , I said " butter " .
Wanna make somethin ’ of it ? )
But if you ’re a rebel like me and ca n’t be bothered with softening butter and dirtying a knife , just do this .
And keep ON doing it …and doing it …and doing it …
Until the surface is sufficiently coated with sizzling butter .
Lay the rolls face down on the pan .
When they ’re lightly browned , flip ’em over for just a few seconds , to warm them through and through .
Lay the bottom of the roll face - up on a plate .
Place a layer of meat and onions …
All over the top .
Then — and this is vital — spoon a little sauce from the bottom of the pan over the meat .
This makes the sandwich extra yummy and moist .
Place the other half of the roll on top of the meat …
And voila !
A rib - stickin’ , man-pleasin ’ , not non -fat sandwich your whole family will love .
Just be sure to double up on the Stairmaster for the three weeks following this meal .
Now , if I were n’t married to a straight - up - meat - and - potatoes rancher , I would probably cook a bunch of sliced mushrooms with the onions .
I ’d add a little sherry to the meat mixture .
And I ’d melt a little sliced mozzarella on the top .
But that ’s just me .
Truth is , you could play around with this sandwich as much as you ’d like : different veggies , different seasonings ( thyme , fresh garlic , etc. ) , or a topping of different cheeses .
Go play !
Have fun !
And report back to me if you make any life - altering modifications .
And go get on the Stairmaster .

Editor ’s Note :
In the latest issue of Mother Jones , Daphne Eviatar explored KBR ’s attempts to use the so - called “ political question doctrine ” — a legal precedent allowing a court to decline ruling on matters it believes should be sussed out by other branches of government — to immunize itself from lawsuits brought by former employees who survived a deadly 2004 ambush in Iraq ( and the family members of those who did n’t ) .
While in 2006 the company succeeded in convincing a federal court that its activities in Iraq were effectively above the law , an appeals court overturned that decision on May 28 , paving the way for the lawsuits to proceed .
On April 9 , 2004 , Edward Sanchez and a group of kbr truck drivers were milling around Camp Anaconda , near the Iraqi city of Balad , waiting for the go - ahead for their convoy to move out .
The truckers had been told that morning that the roads outside the base were Code Red — off - limits .
What they had n’t heard is that earlier that day at least six other kbr convoys had been attacked by insurgents .
So when the company ’s security officials announced hours later that the road was open , Sanchez climbed into his unarmored , camouflaged vehicle and joined the line of idling trucks waiting to head outside the wire .
About an hour and a half into the trip , Sanchez saw kbr tractor trailers in flames along the side of the road , then heard drivers screaming over their radios .
“ Bill Bradley yelled for help twice , ” Sanchez , a 39 - year - old rancher from New Mexico , recalls .
“ That was the last I ever heard from him . ”
In what became known as the Good Friday Massacre , Bradley and 5 other American drivers were killed and 14 were wounded ; 1 is still missing and presumed dead .
The military ’s heavy reliance on contractors in Iraq has led to significant civilian casualties : more than 1,000 contractors have been killed and another 13,000 have been wounded since the war began .
With their employees in harm ’s way , kbr and other contractors have sought ways to immunize themselves from liability , as Sanchez and nine others who survived the attack — and relatives of those who did n’t — discovered in 2005 , when they sued kbr and its former parent company , Halliburton , for wrongful death and fraud .
The plaintiffs have gathered compelling evidence that the companies had reason to believe the convoy would come under siege but dispatched it anyway .
But kbr has fought back with a controversial defense .
Invoking the so - called “ political question doctrine , ” which allows the court to avoid deciding questions it believes should be left to other branches of government , kbr ‘s lawyers have successfully argued that judging the contractor would require the court to judge the U.S. military , which is beyond the scope of its authority .
The survivors say they simply want a court to determine whether kbr violated a basic commitment to protect its employees .
“ When I saw some of the evidence in black and white , ” says Ray Stannard , a 49 - year - old former Marine from El Paso who was driving for kbr that day , “ that ’s when I knew — these people are murderers . ”
Stannard , who injured his leg and broke his arm during the hours - long attack , says he has seen emails sent among kbr ‘s top brass revealing that supervisors knew they were sending the men into an area under insurgent assault .
Those emails , like much of the evidence in this case , have been filed under seal at kbr ‘s insistence .
But deposition testimony from former kbr security personnel , which is public record , confirms the company was warned repeatedly of the danger .
A lawyer for the company argues that what kbr ‘s security team knew on the day of the attack is irrelevant .
“ The military decides everything and is responsible for everything ” — including providing security for kbr convoys — says David Kasanow , who is defending the company in this and similar cases .
So for a court to weigh kbr ‘s actions , it would also have to take the military ’s into account .
In September 2006 , Judge Gray H. Miller , a recent Bush appointee to the federal court in Houston , agreed .
There is no way , he wrote , to “ try a case set on a battlefield during wartime without an impermissible intrusion into powers expressly granted to the Executive by the Constitution . ”
In late January , kbr ‘s lawyers echoed that argument to a federal appeals court in a session that was closed to the public at kbr ‘s request .
As Mother Jones went to press , the appeals court had yet to render a verdict , but if it upholds Miller ’s ruling , the implications are vast .
If kbr is n’t subject to American law , then neither is any other contractor working alongside U.S. troops .
“ Simply because an act took place in a contingency operation does n’t mean the court can’t decide a claim , ” says Laura Dickinson , a University of Connecticut law professor and expert on government contracting law .
“ That alone should n’t be the basis for assertion of the political question doctrine . ”
Yet at least three similar cases filed against kbr , all claiming the company failed to protect its employees , have been dismissed on the same grounds .
Most recently , several women who worked for kbr in Iraq claimed they were sexually assaulted by coworkers .
In each case , kbr argued successfully that the court lacks jurisdiction either because the women ’s employment contracts , signed with a Cayman Islands - based subsidiary of kbr , require disputes to be decided in private arbitration or because , as a military contractor operating overseas , the company is immune from civil legal liability .
Congress is considering legislation to allow for prosecution of private security guards who ’ve gunned down Iraqi civilians .
But the question of how private military companies treat the unarmed workers they send into the line of fire — or why these workers have no legal recourse — is n’t part of the discussion .

Good morning , everyone , and thank you for inviting me to meet with you .
The topic of my talk today is the nation ’s economic outlook .
I recently returned from a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , where we voted to leave our policy target , the federal funds rate , unchanged for the time being .
The discussion around the table focused on three developments that for some time have been presenting serious challenges to the Federal Reserve in meeting its dual mandate of low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment and economic growth .
These three developments , of course , are the housing slump , the financial market turmoil and ensuing credit crunch , and the surge in commodity prices , especially oil prices .
Today I ’d like to give you my own perspective on these developments , focusing on where things stand now , their likely impact on the near - term outlook for economic activity and inflation , and their implications for monetary policy .
Before discussing the current economic situation — that is , where things stand now — let me set the stage by describing briefly how we got here .
To get a little fanciful with the stage - setting metaphor for a moment , it is a bit like the opening of Macbeth , with the three ghastly witches brewing up trouble amid thunder and lightning — only here , the three troublemakers are the housing market , the financial markets , and commodity prices .
The housing market has been declining for a few years now .
For example , residential investment has fallen by more than a third , in inflation - adjusted terms , since the end of 2005 .
And house prices have tumbled — according to the various Case - Shiller home price indices , they are down some 15 to 20 percent over the past two years .
For the first couple of years , the housing downturn appears to have had remarkably few spillovers to the rest of the economy in terms of curtailed spending .
However , knock - on effects to the financial sector were brewing , for as house prices continued to fall , home mortgage delinquencies started to rise .
Indeed , the subprime mortgage market , which took off after 2001 and ran strong through late 2005 largely on the expectation of continued home price appreciation , is now in shambles .
After posting delinquency rates in the single digits in 2005 , around 20 percent of subprime mortgages are currently delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide .
Last summer , it became clear that losses on subprime and other mortgages would be far higher than markets had anticipated .
This realization contributed to a broad reappraisal of credit market risks , which sparked the severe , ongoing financial market crisis and credit crunch .
Meanwhile , prices for oil and other commodities have continued a breathtaking rise .
The average retail gasoline price was about $ 1.10 / gallon at the beginning of 2002 and is now above $ 4 a gallon .
Food prices also spiked in early 2007 .
Weighed down by these growing troubles , the economy slowed sharply starting in the fourth quarter of last year .
Indeed , in the first quarter of this year , the growth rate of consumer spending slowed to its lowest pace since the 2001 recession , and business fixed investment stalled .
On the consumer side , falling home and equity values have eroded household wealth .
Employment has fallen steadily since late last year , reducing disposable income .
In addition , surging food and gas prices mean that the income people have gotten does n’t go as far .
So it ’s not surprising that consumer sentiment has soured on the economy .
On the business side , the slowdown in demand , the elevated levels of uncertainty , and tight financing conditions have continued to weigh on investment .
In the face of these adverse developments , the recent strength of spending data has been somewhat reassuring .
The pace of consumer spending , in particular , has been surprisingly robust of late , fueled in part by tax rebates .
The spending appeared to be broad - based , with the not - so - surprising exception of motor vehicles , where sales have been very weak in recent months .
On the business side , orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also look to have rebounded somewhat in recent months .
In addition , export growth has been a continuing bright spot .
It has been buoyed by continued strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the dollar .
The strong incoming data on spending ease my concerns somewhat about the intensity of the slowdown .
However , a few months of data do n’t make a trend , particularly because we ca n’t be sure how large the effects of the roughly $ 100 billion temporary tax rebate program have been .
About $ 50 billion of the rebates were sent out in May .
Inflation has become an increasing concern .
Over the past twelve months , the personal consumption expenditures — or PCE — price index rose 3.1 percent , up from 2.4 percent over the prior year .
An important reason for these disappointing numbers , of course , is the rise in commodity prices .
Some of those increases may have also passed through to core PCE price inflation , which excludes food and energy .
This measure has averaged 2.1 percent over the past twelve months , which is slightly above the range that I consider consistent with price stability , but very close to its pace of increase over the last several years .
Let me say a few words on how conditions in San Diego compare with the national economy .
The troubles in the housing and finance sectors have perhaps been even more severe than elsewhere , with the unemployment rate in the area rising about 2 percentage points since 2006 — from a rate that was well below to a rate that is somewhat above the national average .
Not everyone is affected equally , of course , either here or elsewhere .
For example , San Diego arguably is the nation ’s leading center for biotechnology research and development , and activity in this sector has continued expanding strongly .
Tourism is another important element of the local economy , and this sector also has been performing well — possibly reflecting , in part , an increase in foreign tourism spurred by the lower value of the dollar .
The resulting job gains at restaurants and hotels , along with the associated income gains , have helped offset losses in other sectors .
This view from San Diego highlights the point that , although the macroeconomic effects of the shocks hitting the economy are felt broadly , they are not felt evenly — either in San Diego or anywhere else .
Returning to the national outlook , the key questions looking forward are : when will economic activity get back to normal ?
And when will inflationary pressures moderate ?
The answers to these questions depend , to a great extent , on how conditions in the housing , financial , and commodity markets evolve .
Let me discuss each of them in turn , beginning with housing .
Housing
Changes in housing prices are inextricably linked to household wealth , which in turn affects consumer spending , as well as prospects for housing construction .
Unfortunately , it appears to me that there are at least three reasons for thinking that housing prices have further to fall .
First , the ratio of house prices to rents — a kind of price - dividend ratio for housing — still remains quite high by historical standards , despite having fallen from its historical peak reached in early 2006 .
That suggests that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance .
Second , inventories of unsold homes remain at elevated levels .
This “ excess supply ” of available homes will put downward pressure on housing prices .
Indeed , these inventories are likely to directly depress construction activity , since there is little point in building new homes when there is already a large backlog of unsold homes .
Third , the futures market for house prices predicts further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year .
In particular , the Case - Shiller composite index for home prices shows a 15 to 20 percent year - over - year decline in the second half of this year .
The bottom line is that construction spending and house prices seem likely to continue to fall well into 2009 .
I would note that the housing market slowdown hit earlier and harder in San Diego than in most other parts of the state and the nation .
Using the Case - Shiller index for San Diego , the cumulative decline from the 2006 peak is approaching 30 percent .
San Diego illustrates that the housing problems are not simply a consequence of too much subprime lending , since the growth in subprime mortgages during the housing boom was much more limited in the San Diego area than it was in the most highly exposed parts of California , Arizona , and Nevada .
Nonetheless , mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures in San Diego have grown noticeably over the past two years as prices have dropped .
As with the rest of the country , it seems likely that further unpleasant adjustments in ownership and equity will be necessary before the housing market stabilizes .
Financial Markets
The ongoing fall in house prices has important implications for the financial markets , and it is one reason that we may continue to get troubling news from that part of the economy .
As I mentioned , falling house prices and , in particular , their effects on the subprime market , helped trigger the financial market crisis last August .
At that time , the Fed and other central banks took the first steps to pump substantial volumes of reserves into the system to respond to the surge in demand for liquidity .
These and other further actions helped alleviate some of the stress in financial markets .
But earlier this year , renewed stress culminated in the near failure of Bear Stearns in March .
Again , the Fed took actions to avert the peril that such a failure could have posed for financial markets and the real economy .
Since then , market stress has subsided to some degree , and better quality borrowers are still able to get credit .
For example , investment - grade corporate bond issuance has been very strong in recent months , and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been able to issue substantial quantities of mortgage - backed securities .
But markets remain very fragile .
For example , credit - default - swap spreads for many financial institutions are again on the rise , the debt ratings for several important bond insurers have been cut , and stock prices for financial institutions have plummeted .
There is further evidence that financial markets are still not operating efficiently or effectively .
In particular , the market for private - label securitized mortgages of even the highest quality remains moribund .
These securities were the primary source of financing for nonconforming residential mortgages , including subprime lending .
Outside of the expanded FHA lending , there is little or no lending to higher - risk residential mortgage borrowers .
Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are available , but at historically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages , as banks have been reluctant to make these loans .
Unfortunately , progress toward sturdier and more efficient financial markets is going to take some time , and that means the flow of credit is likely to remain impeded .
Let me explain by using a plumbing metaphor .
For one thing , it ’s going to take time to clear the pipes of the problem debt .
The gyrations in the prices of a number of securities suggest that there are still hitches in the price discovery process .
This may not be surprising given that there is still a good deal of uncertainty about the valuation of complex , nontransparent financial instruments .
There also is considerable uncertainty about the extent of the ultimate losses and the exposure of different institutions .
In the case of residential mortgages , where delinquency rates are still rising , the single most important determinant of performance has been the pace of house price changes .
But no one is sure how much more house prices will fall , or how that will affect delinquency rates on mortgages .
The considerable uncertainty has added to the difficulty of valuing the underlying mortgages and related asset - backed securities .
Credit quality problems also are emerging outside residential mortgages .
At commercial banks , for example , delinquencies are now rising almost across the board .
Especially notable is the rise in delinquency rates on construction loans that is affecting even institutions that had steered clear of the subprime market .
Moreover , it is not just a matter of clearing the pipes of the problem debt .
The plumbing itself needs to be redesigned and rebuilt .
Indeed , to deal with some of the vulnerabilities laid bare by the turmoil over the past year requires some restructuring in parts of the financial market and the channels for allocating credit .
Key areas of change include the originate - to - distribute model and securitization used to finance higher - risk mortgage debt , financial risk management , re-intermediation and deleveraging more generally , and regulation and oversight of financial markets .
Let me take these one at a time .
First , securitization was a key driver of the credit expansion .
Financial institutions originated loans that they then bundled into securities and sold to other investors .
With hindsight , it is clear that this originate - to - distribute model suffered severe incentive problems — the originator had insufficient incentive to ensure the quality of the loans , since someone else ultimately held them .
Conflicts of interest and moral hazard problems also are nested in the many other linkages in the securitization process .
Before private - label mortgage securitization can recover , financial markets must design mechanisms to align the incentives of originators with the interests of the ultimate investors .
Second , there was a widespread failure of risk management , both in terms of liquidity and credit risk .
An important shortcoming in credit risk management was an excessive reliance on what turned out to be flawed assessments of risk by rating agencies of certain asset - backed securities .
Investors , even large sophisticated financial institutions , did not take adequate steps to assess risk independently .
The lack of transparency in the credit process and the complexity of many of the newer financial products did not help .
Third , even with changes in contracting and financial modeling , the re-intermediation process and deleveraging more generally is likely to continue .
Re-intermediation involves a larger share of financing held in the portfolios of institutions such as commercial banks and less by other investors holding securitized assets .
The re-intermediation is part of deleveraging — that is less reliance on debt and more on equity financing — to the extent banks tend to hold more capital than other less regulated financial institutions .
We also will likely see less leverage in financing more generally .
That is certainly evidenced by the greater shares of equity required in leveraged buyouts , as the pendulum is swinging back from the leveraged financing run amok that we saw even as late as the first part of 2007 .
While these changes can improve the functioning of credit markets , they also likely will mean that the cost of credit will be higher going forward .
Finally , policymakers are likely to revise the regulatory and supervisory environment in ways that will affect the structure , functioning , and oversight of financial markets , and that , too , will not be a speedy or simple process .
During the transition , financial institutions are struggling against forces that have expanded their balance sheets even as they have sought to deleverage .
Borrowers have tapped outstanding credit lines , institutions have booked leveraged loans that they could n’t sell , and banks have brought onto their books assets from off - balance - sheet funding conduits .
The potential for further pressures on capital , along with institutions ’ lower tolerance for risk and concern about economic conditions , has resulted in banks tightening credit conditions for virtually all borrowers .
In recent weeks , large banks have been cutting back on lending .
Going forward , the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other intermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capacity to expand equity capital internally and externally .
The encouraging news is that large commercial banks , investment banks , and mortgage specialists have , to some extent , been able to issue new equity capital and to rebuild capital positions that have come under pressure from a combination of losses and growth in assets .
The balance - sheet pressures , and broader financial market dislocations , are likely to be with us for some time .
My expectation is that market functioning will improve markedly by 2009 .
But things could get worse before they get better .
For example , home prices could fall more than markets expect , leading to larger losses for financial institutions and further impairing their ability to make new loans .
The credit crunch could then lead to further declines in house prices .
The resulting decline in household wealth could then further reduce spending , leading to additional knock - on effects .
So an adverse feedback loop could develop , with consequences for both financial markets and economic activity .
Commodities
As if housing and a credit crunch were n’t enough , prices for food and energy have gone through the roof .
The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil has surged over 40 percent since January and over 100 percent in the last year , rising above $ 140 per barrel in late June .
Prices for other commodities , such as many metals and foods , have risen sharply as well .
Corn and wheat prices are up some 50 to 80 percent from a year ago .
The debates about why commodity prices have surged are heard everywhere from the nightly newscasts to the halls of Congress .
While I do n’t have a definitive answer myself , I do think it makes sense to start by looking carefully at the supply and demand fundamentals , and , to my mind , they do appear to play a central role .
On the demand side , booming economic activity in developing countries has boosted their appetite for commodities .
For example , since 2000 , world demand for oil has increased by roughly 11 million barrels per day , with China accounting for roughly 30 percent of this increase , and other developing countries accounting for another 60 percent .
In addition , ethanol production accounts for a substantial amount of the increased demand for corn .
On the supply side , there have been constraints .
Oil production has become more expensive , major discoveries are increasingly difficult to find , and spare capacity to supply more oil in the short run has been declining .
As a result , energy supplies have not kept pace with growing worldwide demand .
In some crop markets , bad weather has reduced supply .
For example , drought conditions have hampered wheat production in Australia , while excessive rainfall is affecting corn production here in the Midwest .
Neither supply nor demand for commodities adjusts quickly , so large price changes can occur in response to new information and other shocks to the market .
Recent volatility in oil prices appears to reflect a combination of news related to intensifying geopolitical concerns , falling inventories , and further deterioration in estimates of long - term supply .
There has been much discussion about speculative trading in commodities markets and its possible influence on recent price movements .
Hedge funds , institutional investors , and other traders have certainly increased their positions in commodity markets , typically by investing in commodity index funds , which consist of baskets of different commodities that trade on exchanges .
But I am not yet persuaded that speculation , rather than the fundamentals of global supply and demand , has played an important role in driving up prices .
For example , it should be harder to speculate and take positions on commodities that are not easy to trade on futures markets and are not included in index funds .
But the prices of individual commodities that are not in index funds have risen just as fast as those that are .
In addition , if speculators were important in driving prices up , then , at the high prices now prevailing , demand by nonspeculative end users would fall short of current supply , causing inventories to rise .
In fact , however , inventories appear to have been declining in most commodity markets .
There is no dearth of stories about how rising prices for oil , food , and other commodities are hitting U.S. consumers and businesses .
In the case of oil , we all feel the pain when we go to the gas pump .
Businesses also buy gasoline and other products made from oil , so their costs go up as well .
If rising commodity prices reflect supply and demand fundamentals , then the situation is not likely to turn around any time soon , and the consequence is that everyone is going to see that their dollar just does n’t stretch as far anymore .
In economists ’ terms , “ real wages ” — that is , dollar wages expressed in terms of the goods and services they can buy — will rise more slowly or even fall .
There is little that monetary policy can do to prevent this .
This is not a pleasant scenario , I grant you .
Indeed , it raises the specter of the oil price shocks of the 1970s , when over and above the inflation and real wage cuts due to soaring energy costs , a more general inflation took hold , with wages and prices escalating throughout the economy .
The story of how it happened goes roughly like this .
Workers — reasonably enough — asked for wage increases to pay the higher costs of food and energy .
Their employers — mainly firms outside the energy sector–were in the same tough position as their employees : their costs were rising to the extent that they used oil as an input in production ; and the prices they were receiving for their products were , at least initially , rising no faster than before .
But in spite of the fact that firms outside the energy sector were not well positioned to assent to faster wage increases , they granted them anyhow , figuring — reasonably enough , it turned out — that they could pass those costs on into higher prices for their goods .
Why was this reasonable enough thinking by firms ?
Because both they and their competitors were all in the same unpleasant straits , and they did not believe that the Fed was willing or able to keep a lid on overall prices .
The result was an upward wage - price spiral that led to double - digit inflation .
That inflation ended only after a major recession that sent the unemployment rate over 10 percent .
So we have learned from hard experience that , as unpleasant as lower real wages are , they are an unavoidable consequence of a fundamentals - driven rise in commodity prices .
But the development of a wage - price spiral , due to a loss of credibility in the Fed ’s determination to suppress it , may have even more devastating consequences .
Outlook
Now I ’d like to pull all of these threads together to give you my outlook for the economy .
Activity has been weak since late last year , and , given the three shocks I ’ve discussed , I expect the economy to grow only modestly for the remainder of the year , but to pick up next year .
The earlier policy easing by the Federal Reserve will help cushion the economy from some of the effects of the shocks , and the fiscal stimulus program is helping at present .
Over time , the drag from housing will wane and credit conditions should improve .
On the inflation front , the predominant problem so far has been soaring food and energy prices .
Headline inflation is likely to remain much higher than I would like over the next few quarters .
My best guess , which could easily be wrong , is that , consistent with futures prices , commodity prices will level off and cease to put direct upward pressure on headline inflation .
Core inflation has been better contained , but has still been running a bit higher than I would like .
In the next few quarters , I would n’t be surprised if it runs modestly higher , as businesses pass some of their higher energy and transportation costs on to customers .
By early next year , however , I expect that , assuming commodity prices level off , core as well as headline inflation will moderate , as more slack in labor and product markets emerges .
Policy
Let me now turn to monetary policy .
We ’re approaching a crossroads .
The FOMC responded to the difficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing monetary policy substantially .
Between September and April , the Committee reduced the federal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to its current rate of 2 percent .
With core consumer inflation running at about the same rate , the real funds rate is now around zero .
These cuts in the target rate , along with the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial markets , have mitigated the worst effects of the squeeze on spending .
I am somewhat reassured by the recent data , which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have , so far , been avoided .
Of course , the underlying housing , credit , and commodity - price issues are far from fully resolved .
My discussion of those issues makes clear that a lot of uncertainty surrounds my outlook .
A lot could still go wrong .
But maximum sustainable employment is only one of our mandates .
The other is low and stable inflation .
In the wake of rapid increases in prices for gasoline and food , consumer survey measures of longer term inflation expectations have turned up .
In contrast , other surveys , such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters , show little erosion in long - term inflation expectations .
In addition , the anecdotes I hear are more consistent with credibility than with an upward wage - price spiral .
In particular , my contacts uniformly report that they see no signs of general wage pressures .
On balance , I still see inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored and I anticipate that consumer survey measures will come down once oil and food prices stop rising .
But the risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely increased .
We cannot and will not allow a wage - price spiral to develop .
As I began with a reference to Shakespeare , let me end with one as well :
For monetary policymakers , “ readiness is all . ”
By this I mean that , in the face of these competing risks , we will monitor developments carefully and be prepared to act as needed to fulfill our mandate for sustainable economic growth and price stability .

But the real value of the dollar has depreciated only modestly over the past year , while oil prices have doubled .
For this reason , the price of a barrel of oil has risen sharply , whether valued in terms of a depreciating currency , like the dollar , or in terms of an appreciating currency , like the euro .

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is requesting immunity from lawsuits filed on behalf of Gulf Coast hurricane victims who claim they were exposed to dangerous fumes while living in government - issued trailers .
On Wednesday , U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt is scheduled to hear FEMA 's bid to be dismissed from a series of consolidated cases filed against the federal government and the companies that supplied FEMA with tens of thousands of trailers after Katrina and then Rita in 2005 .
Lawyers for Gulf Coast storm victims accuse FEMA of negligence for sheltering them in trailers with elevated levels of formaldehyde , a preservative used in construction materials that can induce breathing problems and is believed to cause cancer .
In court papers , FEMA 's lawyers told the judge the agency is entitled to immunity from such claims challenging its response to disasters such as Katrina .
The federal government 's lawyers said FEMA spent more than $ 2.5 billion to purchase more than 140,000 new trailers from recreational vehicle dealers and trailer manufacturers after the storms .
They also said the agency relied on manufacturers to furnish the agency with a " safe , habitable , functional product . "
" It is well - established that the ( government ) is only liable in such situations if it supervised and directed day - to - day activities of its contractors , which did not occur in this case , " they argued in the court papers .
The government 's lawyers also wrote that a review of legislative history left " no doubt " that Congress intended to enact a broad bar against any such claims arising from disaster relief actions .
Tony Buzbee , one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs , said FEMA and the trailer manufacturers " worked hand in hand " after the 2005 hurricanes and should share legal liability in the cases .
The lawsuits contend FEMA ignored concerns about formaldehyde levels in trailers for months after Katrina .
" FEMA is right to blame the manufacturers for the production of the toxic trailers , but the agency is not without culpability or legal liability for this debacle , " Buzbee said in a written statement Tuesday .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs want Engelhardt to certify the consolidated cases as a class action on behalf of tens of thousands of current and former trailer occupants in Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas .
The judge has n't ruled on that request yet .
The plaintiffs ' lawyers said it 's premature for Engelhardt to consider dismissing FEMA from the cases .
So what does one do with thousands of bicycles ?
Igor Kenk ’s record - setting collection have sparked myriad theories , ranging from the obvious : that he was planning to resell them all eventually in his used bicycle shop , to the eccentric : that he was saving them to melt them down during the next spike in scrap metal prices or was hording them for the eventual energy apocalypse .
Igor ’s operation alone might explain most of Toronto ’s reputation for being the capital of bike theft in North America .
His shop was so filled with bicycles that police had to take out second floor windows and lower the bikes out them .
Clearly this collection has been growing for a very long time .
His shop even had a reputation as the place to go to buy back your stolen bike – but no one knew for sure that he was the one stealing them .
Rumor has it he was waiting for a big energy crisis where the world as we know it would come to an end and he could make a killing reselling the rest .

Over ten thousand frustrated bicycle theft victims have perused Igor ’s reclaimed collection of stolen goods but only a few hundred bicycles have been returned .
He is now facing dozens of counts relating to the thefts alone , but the story does n’t end there : raids on Igor Kenk ’s house and myriad storage places revealed crack , cocaine and pounds of marijuana … as well as a stolen bronze statue of a centaur and snake in the heat of battle .
How that fits in is anyone ’s guess .
So how hard is it , really , to steal a bike in a public downtown place like Toronto ?
Well , two brothers – using their own bike and tools – set out to find out just that in the heart of New York City .
Starting small they use a bolt cutters in Union Square but by the end they are using power tools and full protective gear to steal ( their own ) bikes in broad daylight – all without being stopped .
There is one concerned citizen throughout the whole film however …
Hector , who stops to offer his advice on potentially better tools to speed up the operation .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
There are two things you may have heard about the Federal Reserve Board , both of which are wrong .
The first is that the Fed controls U.S. interest rates .
The second is that the Fed has made so many commitments that it 's in danger of running out of cash or Treasury securities .
Which would mean it could n't carry out its declared policy of putting cash into the world financial system or its undeclared policy of keeping institutions that it deems worthy afloat .
Let me show you why both of these beliefs are myths , not reality .
Let 's do interest rates first .
It 's the more common myth , created partly by sloppiness among people in my business who write ( and say ) things like , " The Fed cut interest rates today . "
In fact , we should always insert " short - term " before " interest rates " when we talk about the Fed 's control .
That because the Fed controls only some short - term rates , primarily the so - called Federal funds rate that financial institutions charge each other for overnight loans .
The financial markets set long - term rates , which often do n't move in the same direction as the Fed funds rate .
The case in point : the relationship - or lack of one - between the Fed funds rate and the interest rate on long - term mortgages .
Since September , the Fed has reduced the Fed funds rate by 62 % - to 2 % from the previous 5.25 % .
But long - term mortgage rates are higher than on Sept. 18 , when the Fed began its rate cuts , as you can see from the adjacent graphic , which is based on numbers from mortgage experts HSH Associates .
The rate on a 30 - year fixed - rate conforming mortgage - " conforming " means that the mortgage is eligible for sale to mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) or Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) - was 6.44 % the week before the Fed 's first cut , and was recently 6.51 % .
Jumbo mortgages - mortgages too big to be considered conforming - were going for 7.63 % , up from 7.26 % .
( All of these numbers include up - front points that borrowers pay , in addition to their basic interest rate . )
The Fed and Treasury - along with many of the world 's big financial players - would love to have U.S. mortgage rates decline , because that would lend support to home prices , which could use it .
Falling home values - what we have in most U.S. housing markets - increase foreclosures , which increase borrowers ' pain and lenders ' losses .
The declining value of houses as collateral for mortgages makes mortgage lenders less eager to lend , and makes potential home purchasers far less eager to buy .
It 's a vicious cycle that will end sooner or later - everything does - but it's not something that the Fed ( or any individual regulator or player ) can control .
The Fed cut short - term rates to help mitigate the panics that have been sweeping the world financial markets for more than a year .
In addition , those lower rates - in theory , at least - help prop up the U.S. economy .
But you can also argue that the Fed 's lowering of short - term rates has raised inflation fears and contributed to the decline of the dollar in international markets , which in turn has affected commodities prices , whose massive increases are a major factor in U.S. inflation .
So repeat after me : the Fed can set only short - term rates .
Which may contribute to having long - term rates act in ways that the Fed did n't intend , and does n't particularly like .
Can the Fed afford it ?
There 's an idea out there that the Fed may run out of money or government securities as a result of the huge , high - dollar programs that it and the Treasury have launched , or could end up having to launch , to keep financial markets afloat .
Fed chief Ben Bernanke and his crew have recently embarked on two programs that have raised questions about how it can afford its commitments .
First , it will now lend directly not just to commercial banks , but also to institutions , like investment banks .
Second , it will now lend selected borrowers Treasury securities ( which they can then sell or borrow against ) in return for securities ( like some mortgage - backed bonds ) that can't be sold or borrowed against for anything close to their stated value .
The worry is that the Fed owns only about $ 800 billion of Treasury securities , and all these existing programs , not to mention possibly helping arrange huge loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under a bailout plan now being kicked around , would consume a total of more than $ 800 billion .
But that worry overlooks the Fed 's amazing power to create as much money as it needs - out of nothing , as it were .
Here 's how it works .
If an institution borrows , say , $ 50 billion from the Fed , the Fed can just post a $ 50 billion credit to the bank 's account at the Fed , and the borrower can spend that balance on whatever it wants .
It is indeed as if the Fed created cash out of nothing .
And if the Fed somehow needed more than $ 800 billion of Treasury securities , it could buy them in the open market , and deposit the payment for them in the seller 's Fed account .
That way , the Fed could lay its hands on however many Treasury securities it needed .
Yes , I 'll grant you that this sounds odd .
But if you ask a Fednik how this all works , he ( or she ) would tell you what I 've just told you .
Except that it would be dressed up in fancier language , with all sorts of explanations of how the Fed can do all this and still carry out its monetary policy .
Why am I bothering you with this stuff in mid-summer , a time when I 'd rather be off drinking something cold than trying to deal with the Fed ?
Because myths get in the way of understanding .
And if there were ever a time when understanding the Fed 's powers - and limitations - matters , that time is now .
Upon browsing the source to the excellent MochiWeb , I came across a call to a function that , when I looked , was n’t defined anywhere .
This , it turns out , was a clue : Erlang has undocumented syntactic support for late - bound method dispatch , i.e. lightweight object - oriented programming !
The following example , myclass.erl , is a parameterized module , a feature that arrived undocumented in a recent Erlang release .
Parameterized modules are explored on the ‘ net here and here .
( The latter link is to a presentation that also covers an even more experimental module - based inheritance mechanism . )
- module ( myclass , [ Instvar1 , Instvar2 ] ) .
- export ( [ getInstvar1/0 , getInstvar2/0 ] ) .
getInstvar1 ( ) -> Instvar1. getInstvar2( ) -> Instvar2 .
“ Instances ” of the “ class ” called myclass can be created with myclass : new ( A , B ) ( which is automatically provided by the compiler , and does not appear in the source code ) , where A and B become values for the variables Instvar1 and Instvar2 , which are implicitly scoped across the entirety of the myclass module body , available to all functions defined within it .
The result of a call to a new method is a simple tuple , much like a record , with the module name in the first position , and the instance variable values in order following it .
Eshell V5.6 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > Handle = myclass : new ( 123 , 234 ) .
{ myclass,123,234} 2 > Handle:getInstvar1 ( ) .
123 3 > Handle:getInstvar2 ( ) .
234
While this looks really similar to OO dispatch in other languages , it ’s actually an extension to Erlang ’s regular function call syntax , and works with other variations on that syntax , too :
4 > {myclass,123,234}:getInstvar1 ( ) .
123
The objects that this system provides are pure - functional objects , which is unusual : many object - oriented languages do n’t clearly separate the two orthogonal features of late - binding and mutable state .
A well - designed language should let you use one without the other , just as Erlang does here : in Erlang , using parameterized modules for method dispatch does n’t change the way the usual mechanisms for managing mutable state are used .
“ Instance variables ” of parameterized modules are always immutable , and regular state - threading has to be used to get the effects of mutable state .
I ’d like to see this feature promoted to first - class , documented , supported status , and I ’d also very much like to see it used to structure the standard library .
Unfortunately , it ’s not yet very well integrated with existing modules like gb_sets , ordsets and sets .
For example , here ’s what happens when you try it with a simple lists call :
5 > lists : append ( [ 1 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 4 ] ) . [ 1,2,3,4 ]
6 > {lists , [ 1 , 2 ] } : append ( [ 3 , 4 ] ) . [ 3,4|{lists , [ 1,2 ] } ]
Apple lied about Steve Jobs ' health when it tried to quash concerns about his appearance at the WWDC conference last month , Joe Nocera of the New York Times says .
Steve himself also finally weighed in on the matter last week , calling Joe Nocera a " slime bucket . "
Most importantly , it seems
Steve 's cancer has not reappeared .
Nocera :
Apple tells analysts far less about its operations than most companies do .
It turns low - level decisions into state secrets .
Directors are often left out of the loop .
And it dissembles with impunity .
As , indeed , it has in this latest episode .
On Wednesday , John Markoff reported in The New York Times that Mr. Jobs had had a surgical procedure earlier this year , the details of which remain unclear .
I hear that he has had ongoing digestive difficulties , which have contributed to his weight loss — possibly a side effect of the surgery .
And in the weeks leading up to the conference , he came down with an infection , which had a lot to do with why he looked so gaunt .
It was n’t cancer , thank goodness .
But was more than a “ common bug . ”
By claiming Mr. Jobs had a bug , Apple was n’t just going dark on its shareholders .
It was deceiving them .
And then Steve finally weighs in :
On Thursday afternoon , several hours after I ’d gotten my final “ Steve ’s health is a private matter ” — and much to my amazement — Mr. Jobs called me .
“ This is Steve Jobs , ” he began .
“ You think I ’m an arrogant [ expletive ] who thinks he ’s above the law , and I think you ’re a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong . ”
After that rather arresting opening , he went on to say that he would give me some details about his recent health problems , but only if I would agree to keep them off the record .
I tried to argue him out of it , but he said he would n’t talk if I insisted on an on - the - record conversation .
So I agreed .
Because the conversation was off the record , I cannot disclose what Mr. Jobs told me .
Suffice it to say that I did n’t hear anything that contradicted the reporting that John Markoff and I did this week .
While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than “ a common bug , ” they were n’t life - threatening and he does n’t have a recurrence of cancer .
After he hung up the phone , it occurred to me that I had just been handed , by Mr. Jobs himself , the very information he was refusing to share with the shareholders who have entrusted him with their money .

Nature and nurture both play a role in eczema , but few genes have been linked to specific environmental risks .
Now a gene mutation that predisposes youngsters to the skin condition seems to pose a greater risk if they are also exposed to cats .
In 2006 , a mutation in the gene for the protein filaggrin – which helps keep foreign substances out of the skin – was shown to increase the risk of eczema .
About 9 % of people of European origin carry this mutation .
To find out whether an environmental trigger might also play a role , a team led by Hans Bisgaard of the Gentofte University Hospital in Copenhagen , Denmark , who was also involved in the 2006 work , tracked 358 Danish and 460 British children from birth .
About 25 % of children without the mutation developed eczema , compared with 45 % of those with the mutation .
However , of the 16 children who both had the mutation and lived with a cat , 14 developed eczema , all between the ages of one and three months .

“ It has been very hard to prove that there really are environmental factors that trigger those genes , ” Bisgaard says .
“ This is proof that there is an interaction , even in the first month of life . ”
However , Bisgaard says that much more data is needed before any prescriptions can be made for parents .
“ It ’s an interesting and convincing finding , ” says Natalija Novak , a dermatologist and epidemiologist at the University of Bonn in Germany .
But she says we should now look for other environmental factors that correlate with eczema .

Offender : Best Buy , Rancho Cucamonga , California .
After finding out I do I.T. , my propane guy told me a story .
He had
just gone to “ Best Buy ” ( yeah right , I am using that term more loosely
than ever ) and bought a new laptop ( HP with Vista ) for his wife .
He
said that his older desktop failed ( somehow ) , but those great Geek
Squad guys were AWESOME and had been able to retrieve all of his family
pictures for him .
He was very happy with that – AND those great guys
got him a deal on Quicken 2008 .
I told him that in the future I would be happy to help him get better
stuff for less , and he was very open to my help .
The conversation
progressed and he told me that his wife did all their businesses books
on it as well .
Naturally I asked him how he backed that up .
He did n’t .
He did say that he wanted to replace the desktop since he already had
a nice monitor and everything else , and that his wife would call me .
I set up an appointment with him and his wife , and stopped by their
business .
The fun begins .
The family pictures were ALL the Geek Squad was able to retrieve from
the dead computer .
Period .
They did not recover the last 7 years of
QuickBooks 2005 data that IS the core of their business .
Furthermore ,
Geek Squad sold them Quicken 2008 , which she later had to upgrade
online because Quicken will not open QuickBooks files ( that they did n’t
recover for them anyway ) .
And they sold them a wireless router to
hook up there printer even though they were happy with the USB cable
they had and they do n’t have high speed internet anyway .
I fixed the printer and helped her with a few other things .
I told
her that I would try to recover their business data .
The deal with
my clients is usually that you forfeit your old hardware as a donation
to the school I work at .
I get the computer to my office and this is what I find :
Geek Squad cut the wires from the power supply to the motherboard plug so the power supply is worthless and a stick of RAM has been stolen from the second blue slot .
3 ) Geek Squad cut all of the IDE cables !
4 ) The Crown Jewel – Geek Squad broke the power connector off of
the Hard Drive controller .
Maybe it was innocently , maybe it was maliciously , maybe to hide the fact
that they hosed the drive .
I ’m going with malicious until I can solder
on a connector and get these peoples data back …
I ’m so hacked at Geek Squad I ca n’t even express it right now .

Fatal shooting by police sparks Montreal riot Associated Press
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This By JANIE GOSSELIN Associated Press Writer MONTREAL ( AP ) -- Montreal 's mayor on Monday promised a swift inquiry into the shooting death of a Honduran teenager by police after the incident prompted violent clashes between angry youth and authorities in a heavily Haitian neighborhood .
A police officer was shot in the leg late Sunday , cars were set ablaze , stores were looted and firefighters were pelted with beer bottles in Montreal North , a multiethnic area referred to by local police as the Bronx of Montreal for its poverty and crime .
Several hundred officers in riot gear fanned out in the area , searching for a group of youths suspected of torching eight cars parked outside a fire station .
Six people were arrested .
The violence erupted after a peaceful protest against the Saturday shooting by police of three unarmed people , including an 18 - year - old man , identified by his sister as Freddy Alberto Villanueva , an immigrant from Honduras who died of his wounds .
Jean - Ernest Pierre , a lawyer and owner of a Montreal radio station popular with the city 's ethnic minorities , said his station was beset with angry calls from people concerned about police treatment of minorities .
Some policemen are not well equipped to face what Pierre called the new Quebec , a multiethnic society , he said , adding that many minorities feel targeted because of the color of their skin .
" People do n't trust the police , " Pierre said .
He also said there 's a gang problem in Montreal North , where poverty makes many young people vulnerable to recruitment .
About 25 percent of the residents of Montreal North are immigrants .
Almost 15 percent are black and 3.5 percent are Latino , according to census data .
On Sunday , men and women of all ages crawled through the smashed windows of a pawn shop , a convenience store and a butcher shop , grabbing anything they could .
They could be seen running down the street clutching TVs , cigarette cartons and slabs of meat .
Montreal police spokesman Ian Lafreniere said one police officer was hospitalized after being shot in the leg .
An ambulance technician was hit in the head by a bottle and a second police officer suffered minor injuries , he said .
Both were released from hospital after treatment .
Three people were arrested for breaking and entering , one for drug possession and two others for charges still to be determined , he said .
Mayor Gerald Tremblay said he 'll meet with community leaders to ensure another riot does n't happen .
" One thing is for sure - we have to do better than what we 've been doing , " he said .
Tremblay promised a speedy investigation and said they must be up front about what prompted police to open fire on Villanueva and two others on Saturday .
City police have said the officers were trying to make an arrest in Henri Bourassa Park around 7 p.m. when they were surrounded by about 20 youths .
A few individuals allegedly broke away from the group and rushed the officers .
According to police , one officer then opened fire .
The officers were not wounded .
Quebec provincial police have taken over the investigation into the shootings .
Villanueva 's sister , Julissa , said the family wants answers .
" We only know what we see in the news , in the newspapers , that 's all , " she said , weeping as she spoke about her brother , a student who wanted to become a mechanic .
Villanueva 's family came to Canada from Honduras in 1998 .
Community leaders said many youngsters feel disenfranchised and are frustrated by what they see as heavy - handed police tactics .
" What we are seeing are youngsters , a community that is in revolt because they do n't like they way they are being treated , " said Pierreson Vaval , who leads a youth group .
" They do n't like how authorities interact with them . "
The melee Sunday night was the second large - scale riot in Montreal in four months .
In April , a downtown celebration after the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Boston Bruins in a National Hockey League playoff game turned violent when people began torching police cars and looting stores .
Police arrested 56 people .
Police Chief Yvan Delorme said he 's prepared to do whatever it takes to mend ties with the community .
" We 're there to listen , to understand what happened ( Sunday ) night and to avoid these kinds of situations , " Delorme said .
" We have to feel safe in Montreal . "
Montana governor Brian Schweitzer ( D ) declared independence Friday from federal identification rules and called on governors of 17 other states to join him in forcing a showdown with the federal government which says it will not accept the driver 's licenses of rebel states ' citizens starting May 11 .
If that showdown comes to pass , a resident of a non-complying state could not use a driver 's license to enter a federal courthouse or a Social Security Administration building nor could he board a plane without undergoing a pat - down search , possibly creating massive backlogs at the nation 's airports and almost certainly leading to a flurry of federal lawsuits .
States have until May 11 to request extensions to the Real ID rules that were released last Friday .
They require states to make all current identification holders under the age of 50 to apply again with certified birth and marriage certificates .
The rules also standardize license formats , require states to interlink their DMV databases and require DMV employee to undergo background checks .
Extensions push back the 2008 deadline for compliance as far as out 2014 if states apply and promise to start work on making the necessary changes , which will cost cash - strapped states billions with only a pittance in federal funding to offset the costs .
Last year Montana passed a law saying it would not comply , citing privacy , states ' rights and fiscal issues .
In his letter ( .pdf ) to other governors , Schweitzer makes clear he 's not going to ask for an extension .
" Today , I am asking you to join with me in resisting the DHS coercion to comply with the provisions of REAL ID , " Schweitzer wrote .
" If we stand together either DHS will blink or Congress will have to act to avoid havoc at our nation 's airports and federal courthouses . "
But Homeland Security spokeswoman Laura Keehner says DHS has no intention of blinking .
" That will mean real consequences for their citizens starting in may if their leadership chooses not to comply , " Keehner said .
" That includes getting on an airplane or entering a federal building , so they will need to get passports . "
Keehner says DHS 's policy wo n't change even if Georgia – one of the 17 states that has signaled strong opposition to the rules – declines to apply for an extension .
If that scenario came to pass , every Georgian who flies out through the nation 's busiest airport – Atlanta - Hartsfield International – would have to be patted down by Homeland Security agents and have his carry - on bag hand - screened , likely resulting in massive delays .
Keehner also suggests that patted - down citizens will turn their wrath not on the feds but on their state government .
For his part , Schweitzer wants Congress to step up and pass alternative legislation that would stop Real ID and re-instate a commission that was working on driver 's license rules before the REAL ID Act was slipped into must - pass defense legislation in 2005 .
That legislation assigned DHS the task of setting the rules single - handedly .
Keehner is adamant that the rules will make the country safer and that the price tag is not too high .
" The ability to get false identification must end , and Real ID is that step , " Keehner said .
Privacy groups counter that the rules create a de-facto national identification card and wo n't stop terrorism or identity theft .
For his part , Schweitzer struck back at DHS statements he obviously considers arrogant .
" I take great offense at this notion we should all simply ' grow up ' , " Schweitzer wrote , referring to Thursday remarks from DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff about border rules regarding Canada .
Schweitzer says those remarks " reflect DHS ( sic ) continued disrespect for the serious and legitimate concerns of our citizens . "
A DHS policy maker suggested earlier this week that Real IDs could also be required to buy cold medicine and to prove employment eligibility .
Schweitzer 's letter went out to the governors of Colorado , Georgia , Idaho , Maine , New Hampshire , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Arizona , Hawaii , Illinois , Missouri , Nebraska , Nevada , North Dakota , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , and Washington .

If the dominant themes that have been used to justify the Iraq war recently were sincerely held , the administration and the neocons should be doing backflips of joy this week .
Building an independent and sovereign Iraq , preferably with a government responsive to the people ?
Check .
When the Iraqis stand up we will stand down ?
They ’re standing up .
You could even make an argument that the " surge " has helped to induce the kind of stability that should strengthen the political structures to the point that Iraq ’s leaders feel more secure and self - confident , which should allow them to act on behalf of the whole country rather than for strictly sectarian goals .
Apparently , however , this is n’t quite the kind of Iraqi democracy the Bush administration had in mind .
Last Monday Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki let it be known that the Iraqi government would be reluctant to sign an agreement formalizing the status of U.S. troops in Iraq , unless it included a timetable for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops .
A new agreement is needed because the UN resolution authorizing the presence of U.S. and other foreign troops in Iraq is due to expire at the end of the year .
Speaking to Arab ambassadors at a meeting last Monday in the United Arab Emirates , Maliki said : " The current trend is to reach an agreement on a memorandum of understanding either for the departure of the forces or a memorandum of understanding to put a timetable on their withdrawal . "
Making it clear that this was not just an off - the - cuff or unguarded comment , Maliki and Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari reiterated the position in more forceful terms later in the week .
Despite the fact that the Bush administration has consistently opposed the idea of a timetable for withdrawal when suggested by critics of the war , one might have thought that the administration would have been pleased by such a statement .
It indicates that the Iraqi government is feeling strong enough and independent enough that it does n’t believe it needs the crutch of U.S. troops much longer .
That has been the ostensible goal of U.S. policy for a long time .
And truth to tell , the words with which White House spokesman Tony Fratto greeted this news were carefully measured .
" The prime minister is reflecting a shared goal that we have , " he said , " which is that as the Iraqi forces become a more self - reliant force , we ’ll see reductions in U.S. forces . "
Not exactly dancing with joy , but the statement gives the impression of being modestly supportive , even though it carefully avoids addressing what Maliki actually said .
It ’s a bit like two ships passing in the night and each recognizing the other ’s presence by blowing horns and flashing lights , but not engaging one another on a more detailed basis , as one might expect of close allies .
Then there was the cheerleader for staying 50 or 100 years  to be fair , without violence and with only occasional outbursts of mutual resentment , as in Germany .
His past statements should have suggested unbounded joy , but Mr. Straight Talk could n’t seem to get it straight .
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in 2004 , Sen .
John McCain said that if an elected Iraqi government asked us to leave , " I think it ’s obvious that we would have to leave .
I do n’t see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the Iraqi government over to the Iraqi people . "
When informed that Maliki had suggested a withdrawal should come sooner rather than later , however , McCain at first suggested the statement must have been mistranslated .
Informed that the translation was accurate , McCain surrogates suggested that Maliki was n’t really serious , that he had been forced by political exigencies 
Iraq has elections scheduled for October  to , in effect , pander to public opinion .
But if the Iraqi prime minister feels pressured by public opinion or political expediency to talk about a timetable , it suggests that not only Iraqi public opinion , as measured by polls of the entire population , but nearly all factions in Iraq are eager to see an end to the U.S. occupation and a return to full Iraqi sovereignty .
It is possible that some of the dire consequences predicted by advocates of a longer - term U.S. occupation  civil strife , rejuvenation of al - Qaeda in Iraq , perhaps even a civil war  could happen in the wake of a U.S. withdrawal .
In effect , the Iraqis are telling us that they do n’t think the consequences will be so dire , but in any event they are prepared to face them .
Then there was a prediction by Lt. Gen.
James Dubik , who has been in charge of building Iraqi security forces , that Iraq ’s army and police will be fully manned and operational by mid-2009 .
You would think that this should be a signal for the United States to begin preparing as soon as possible for an orderly withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq .
To be sure , Dubik ’s relatively optimistic estimate was challenged at least in part by Philip Carter , who served in Iraq and now writes the " Intel Dump " blog for the Washington Post .
Carter noted that Dubik spoke of the Iraqi army , but not " the local Iraqi police , the Iraqi national police , and all of the Iraqi government institutions responsible for supporting the security forces .
Those are still in dreadful condition and it is these forces , and not the Iraqi army , who will patrol the streets of Iraq and keep its people secure . "
I would go further and note that almost all the commentators stress the official , top - down kinds of institutions that use force or the threat of force to ensure a semblance of order .
The implicit assumption is that government institutions with guns and training are the key to a good society .
Almost nobody talks about the kinds of bottom - up kind of order that Westerners mean by the term " civil society . "
But it is precisely such institutions , which in Iraq would include tribal and clan ties , the links among merchants and suppliers and customers , the voluntary associations among people with shared interests , whether in archeology , chess , or abstractions such as freedom and human rights , that lead to genuinely stable societies that do n’t require a whole lot of attention from the coercive institutions of government to operate reasonably peaceably and productively .
Of course it is difficult to see where these kinds of associations and institutions will come from in Iraq .
Largely as a result of the U.S. invasion , around 25 percent of the population has left the country or is " displaced " within Iraq , away from the places they lived in before and would probably prefer to inhabit again .
And this diaspora largely consists of the educated and relatively successful people who in a " normal " society would constitute a middle class , generally the bringers of stability and orderliness to a society .
Some of those people may be coming back , but some probably never will , ending up contributing to and enriching the countries in which they are exiled ( voluntarily or not ) , such as Jordan , Syria , and Finland  maybe even the United States , if U.S. officials ever get around to streamlining procedures , which may not be possible , given our sclerotic and overextended imperial bureaucracy .
Some factors that have led skeptics of the surge to argue that the surge has played only a small role in the increasing ( if fragile ) stability and self - confidence on display in Iraq today could be taken as hopeful signs , however .
As Fred Kaplan noted in Slate this week , and as I and others have noted repeatedly along the way , the surge was " combined with Petraeus ’ strategy , Moqtada al - Sadr ’s cease - fire , the paying of many insurgents to stop shooting at us , and , most importantly , the alliance initiated by the Sunnis before the surge began . "
But the fact that all these factors arose relatively independently of what the U.S. was doing ( though it must be admitted that Petraeus has been reasonably skillful at exploiting them ) suggests that there are forces and trends in Iraq militating in the direction of stability .
Few people enjoy living in conditions of chaos and unpredictable violence , and it may be the case that this kind of war - weariness , more than fundamental resolutions of conflicts within a society ( which seldom come about through violence , anyway ) , leads to periods of relative peace and calmness in any country that has been beset by war or insurgency .
If these signs of readiness for an end to war and violence are bubbling up naturally among Iraqis , it could bode well for their ability to move forward without the kind of civil war or renewed sectarian violence that many fear if the United States leaves .
I would argue that the best way to facilitate indigenous Iraqi desires for a relatively stable society in which the preferences of the people are at least taken into account  a Jeffersonian democracy imbued with respect for individual rights might develop over time , but it seems unrealistic to expect it overnight in a country that is still a neophyte in the ways of democratic government with limited and predictably applied powers  is for the United States to begin withdrawing troops immediately .
Whether further withdrawal proceeds on a timetable or is calibrated to conditions on the ground seems less important than beginning the process of turning Iraq over to the Iraqis , who are expressing a strong desire to regain genuine sovereignty .
An orderly withdrawal would not happen overnight ; considering the amount of U.S. equipment in Iraq , that would be logistically impossible .
It might take as long as the 16 months presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama predicts it will take if he is elected .
But it should begin quickly .
Tomorrow would not be too soon .
Suskind : Sources of WH forgery claim now under pressure to deny it David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Author Ron Suskind says his sources are under " enormous pressure " to change their stories after revealing to him that the Bush administration had ordered the CIA to forge a letter from the head of Iraqi intelligence connecting Iraq to the 9/11 hijackers .
On Tuesday , former CIA official Robert Richer , who is one of Suskind 's sources , sent a statement to news outlets in which he wrote , " I never received direction from George Tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from Habbush as outlined in Mr. Suskind 's book . "
Richer 's statement also quoted Suskind 's other source , former CIA officer John Maguire , as saying , " I have no knowledge to the origins of the letter . "
Suskind told NBC's Meredith Vieira on Wednesday morning , " It 's interesting .
... Rob Richer talked to me , and actually other reporters too , yesterday morning .
He was fine , he 'd gotten the book Monday night , read it .
And then something happened yesterday afternoon . "
" It 's one of these instances where you 've got a few people whose testimony could mean the impeachment , ostensibly , of the president , " Suskind explained .
" It 's enormous pressure on both men . "
Suskind had appeared on Countdown with Keith Olbermann the previous evening , where he had explained , " They 've got to feed their families .
They really survive off the government , they 're contractors , both of them .
...
They can be brought into a moment of crisis by the government saying , ' You 'll never work again . ' "
Suskind insisted to Vieira , however , that " I 'm actually not concerned , " telling her , " I 've spent a lot of time with them .
Their interviews are taped .
...
They talked to me at length , hour after hour ... and all of that is on the record . "
Suskind emphasized to Olbermann that " Maguire , I think , will still stand up in daylight . "
He noted that Maguire recently said he understands why the first and second amendments appear in that order , because " the first amendment is the most important amendment .
If they take that one away , then you should start loading your weapons . "
Suskind suggested to both Olbermann and Vieira that what is really needed is Congressional hearings with testimony under oath .
He revealed on Wednesday morning that " there are folks in Congress calling .
...
They want people under oath ... with threat of perjury . "
" They 're good guys , " Suskind said in concluding his interview with Vieira .
" Maguire 's sent me things about truth and the power of truth .
He 's a believer in that .
I think Richer is too .
And we 'll see how it unfolds . "

a 21 % increase
Leonard Sax , everyone 's favorite advocate of gender - based education , has a commentary in this week 's Ed Week , " Where the Girls Are n't : What the Media Missed in the AAUW 's Report on Gender Equity . "
Here 's the central argument : " There is a real gender gap , and it ’s growing rapidly , but that gap has little to do with graduation rates or college - entrance rates , parameters that are given great emphasis in the report .
The real gender gap is not in ability but in motivation — not in what girls and boys can do , but in what girls and boys want to do : specifically , in what they want to learn , and how they want to learn it .
" What 's the evidence for his argument ?
" The absolute number of young women studying computer science and physics has fallen by more than 50 percent in the past 20 years .
That drop may seem puzzling at first , since the past 20 years has been an era in which girls have been encouraged from kindergarten through grade 12 to be physicists , engineers , and the like , " says Sax .
Is Sax right ?
Before looking specifically at physics , computer science , and engineering , let 's check out trends in female BA attainment in science and engineering from 1966 - 2004 .
Over this time period , the percent of science and engineering degrees awarded to women has increased from 25 % to 50 % , according to data from the National Science Foundation
But what about the " hardest sciences ? "
Women have made steady gains in every field over this time period .
Women earn more than 60 % of degrees in the biological sciences , half of the degrees in Chemistry , and almost half of the degrees in mathematics .
The female share of degrees in physics , engineering , and computer science has also increased steadily over this time period .
Less than 5 % of degrees were awarded to women in physics and engineering in the 1960s , and now 1 in 5 degrees in these fields goes to women .
( Thanks to the American Institute of Physics for the graph . )
However , the female share of computer science degrees in 1985 was greater than it is in 2004 .
Why might that be ?
Things have ramped up since the Commodore 64 , and the number of degrees awarded in computer science has exploded .
That growth has been faster for men than women .
But if you look at counts of degrees - the meat of Sax 's argument - the same number of women earned CS degrees in 2004 as did at the female CS peak in 1985 .
( See this graph . )
In short , Sax 's claim does not appear to be true - the same number of women earned degrees in CS in the mid-1980s , and the female share of physics degrees has increased even as overall physics enrollments have increased .
When I contacted Dr. Sax about these data , he argued that overall degree attainment is misleading because the increase in female science and engineering degrees is driven by temporary visa holders , not US citizens .
He wrote , " Neither of your graphs takes into account the NATIONALITY of the women earning the degrees .
Most of the rise in the number of women earning degrees in computer science since 1999 comes from women from other countries holding temporary US visas .
" As far as I can tell , the BA attainment data are not available for citizens and non-citizens before 1995 .
Over that time period , female US citizens and permanent residents made amazing strides in science and engineering BA attainment .
Let 's look at different disciplines :* The number of BAs grew 36 % for women , 8 times the increase for men . *
In , the number of degrees grew 19 % for women even as it dropped 1 % for men . *
The number ofdegrees grew 35 % for women , 1.6 times the growth rate for men . *
In , there was a 102 % increase for women , which was less than the increase for men .
( And per Sax 's specific claim above , the number of female US citizens earning CS degrees increased 36 % ( from 9,569 to 12,990 ) between 2000 - 2004 ; it increased from 905 to 1416 ( 56 % ) for female non-US citizens . )
Sure , you can find some fields where there have not been increases for women .
For example , there 's been a 4 % decrease in female BA attainment in mathematics .
But when we look at the whole picture , rather than cherry pick one or two subfields , it 's hard to see evidence here that gender - mixed math and science classes in K - 12 have slowed female American citizens ' rate of progress in earning science and engineering BAs .
Unsatisfied with the fact that women have made quite substantial gains at the undergraduate level in science and engineering , Sax suggested that I look at graduate school .
But again , female US citizens have made enormous gains at the graduate level as well .
There were 135,431 female US citizen graduate students in science and engineering in 1999 and 163,820 in 2006 : .
At the same time , the number of male US citizen graduate students in science and engineering has only increased by 8 % .
To be sure , the rate of increase for non-US citizen women is greater than the rate of increase for US citizens - but there is that globalization phenomenon to consider .
In sum , Leonard Sax 's commentary did not provide an accurate portrait of trends in women 's attainment in science and engineering .
Women still have a way to go before achieving parity in computer science , physics , and engineering , but there 's little evidence that gender - based education a la Sax is going to get us there .
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - An Islamic civil rights advocacy group has asked Warner Bros. to change the title of its upcoming film “ Towelhead ” because , it says , “ the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the Muslim faith or Arab origin . ”
The studio said it plans to stand by the filmmakers , who chose the title to point out racial stereotypes , though it added , “ We apologize for any offence that is caused by the title . ”
“ Towelhead , ” directed by “ Six Feet Under ” creator Alan Ball and adapted for the screen by Alicia Erian from her novel of the same name , looks at the life of a 13 - year - old Lebanese - American girl in the early ‘ 90s .
A Warner Independent specialty title now being handled by parent studio Warners , it is scheduled to open September 12 in limited release in New York and Los Angeles .
The Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American - Islamic Relations said Monday that because the moniker is a “ racial and religious slur , ” Warners should consider calling the film “ Nothing Is Private , ” the title under which it debuted at last year ’s Toronto International Film Festival .
Erian , who is Arab - American , said that although the title is an ethnic slur , she “ selected it to highlight one of the novel ’s major themes : racism . ”
She called CAIR ’s work “ admirable , ” but said that “ the solution ... is not to force the artist to alter her work , but instead to use the occasion of that work as an entry point for meaningful debate and discussion . ”
Ball said he felt it was important to retain the title of Erian ’s novel because “ she so effectively dramatizes the pain inflicted by such language , something many people of non-minority descent never have to face . ”

Off - road engines , ships and aircraft pollute as much as 270 million cars California and five other US states are set to sue the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) if it does not act soon to cut pollution , officials say .
Later on Thursday , Californian attorney general Jerry Brown is to launch a lawsuit to " force the EPA into action " .
He accuse the EPA of continuing to " wantonly ignore its duty " to regulate greenhouse gases from ships , aircraft , and off - road industrial vehicles .
California sued the US in January to force carmakers to curb emissions .
" Ships , aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel and cause massive greenhouse gas pollution , yet President Bush stalls with one bureaucratic dodge after another , " Mr Brown said .
" Because Bush 's Environmental Protection Agency continues to wantonly ignore its duty to regulate pollution , California is forced to seek judicial action . "
If the agency fails to issue timely regulations to curb emissions from these vehicles , California will sue the federal government for unreasonable delay , Mr Brown said .
In a letter Mr Brown is to send on Thursday to the EPA , Connecticut , New Jersey , Oregon , the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and New York City are to join California in the lawsuit , according to a copy of the letter obtained by the Associated Press news agency .
' Responsive '
Off - road engines , ships and aircraft emit as much greenhouse gases as 270 million cars , more than the entire number of registered vehicles in the United States , the attorney general said in a press release .
But the agency said it had been " fully responsive " to California 's petitions , an EPA spokesman said .
" [ The lawsuit ] is certainly typical of the attorney general of California , " Jonathan Shradar said .
" If they do n't like how we make a decision on something , they sue and hope the courts will mandate toward their position .
It works sometimes and sometimes it does n't work , " he said .
Mr Brown would be better served lobbying the Democratic - led US Congress to take action , he added .
The states involved in the lawsuit want the EPA to require airlines and ships to use cleaner fuels , to use more fuel - efficient for aircraft or travel at slower speeds for ships , and for off - road vehicles to comply with anti-idling standards .

What are these ?
Apparently there 's a firestorm of controversy over the uniform Ralph Lauren designed for the U.S. team to wear at the opening Olympic ceremonies , and it 's not hard to see why .
For starters , the damned Ralph Lauren Polo logo totally upstages the Olympic rings logo .
It 's huge !
Also , as shown in a picture after the jump , the uniforms look pretty cheap up close , probably because they were made as part of a rush job sent to Chinese " tailors " at the last minute .
The American Politics Journal wrote , " Lauren – and most likely his son David – celebrated not the spirit of athletic competition but themselves and their brand , morphing our athletes into unpaid billboards for the " Polo™ " pony and rider that has helped bring the Laurens great ... riches . "
Well , sure , yes , but everyone is kind of past the whole notion of the Olympics as unspoiled , non-commercial amateur competition no ?
Which brings us to another key criticism of the uniforms , familiar to anyone who has followed the presidential race :
They are elitist .
Wrote one commenter on Project Rungay :
These outfits presented the United States athletes as rich snobs , frankly .
They made the team look like a 1948 yacht club .
Also , the design essentially copies from British , French , and Italian uppercrust aesthetics , thereby undermining the independent streak the U.S. tries so hard to boast in the international community .
Project Rungay sort of agreed , saying the uniforms " look fine , " like " classic American sportswear ... we honestly think baseball caps would have worked better . "
Well , we told you the opening ceremonies were going to look sort of gay .
On the bright side , at least we looked better than most of the other countries , like the New Zealanders below , who look like they were all in some sort of spray - paining accident .
USA !

Bee Deaths
PITTSBURGH TRIBUNE -REVIEW ; August 28 , 2008
EPA sued after allegations Bayer pesticide killing honeybees
For nearly two years , Jim Doan painstakingly has kept his thousands of bee colonies away from crops treated with a type of pesticide created by Bayer AG .
" We keep bees away as much as we can .
I do n't want them anywhere near it , " said Doan , of Hamlin , N.Y. , the state 's largest beekeeper .
Doan suspects a connection between pesticides and the mysterious , global bee die - off known as Colony Collapse Disorder .
And it 's a suspicion shared by most of the commercial keepers who haul their bees in tractor - trailers to pollinate everything from Florida oranges to Pennsylvania pumpkins .
" Lots of beekeepers have done careful observations , and they have pretty good instincts about the way bees behave .
And many of them think that CCD is caused by pesticides , " said Troy Fore , president of the American Beekeeping Federation in Jessup , Ga .
The federation has 1,100 members .
Beekeepers now have some support .
The National Resources Defense Council , a New York environmental advocacy group , last week filed a lawsuit against the federal Environmental Protection Agency .
The lawsuit accuses the agency of withholding information about the risks that honeybees face from pesticides .
" I am glad that someone filed suit to find out what 's in these products , " Doan said .
" This information should have been out there when the chemical was released . "
Dave Hackenberg , the largest beekeeper in Pennsylvania , said : " I think the noose is tightening .
I am convinced that pesticides are a large part of the problem . "
In Germany , two top - ranking executives of Bayer AG , including the company 's CEO , are being accused by the group Coalition Against Bayer Dangers of " knowingly polluting the environment . "
" We are aware that Coalition Against Bayer Dangers has filed allegations against Bayer AG 's CEO with regard to bee safety as it relates to the use of Bayer Crop Science pesticides .
We are unaware of any investigation being initiated by the prosecutors , " said Greg Coffey , a spokesman for Bayer Crop Science Inc. in Research Triangle , N.C .
Bayer AG is the corporate parent of Bayer Corp. , which has operations in Robinson .
The German company 's Medrad Inc. has manufacturing and research facilities in Allegheny and Butler counties .
The U.S. lawsuit was filed after the EPA failed to respond to a request in July made under the Freedom of Information Act , said Josh Mogerman , a Chicago - based spokesman for the National Resources Defense Council .
" This is an aggressive lawsuit .
This is potentially a crisis that affects every dinner table in the world .
And if there is information of value to the scientific community , they ought to know about it , " Mogerman said .
The EPA , which has posted some requested information on its Web site , said it had no intention of withholding information and did not reply to the council 's request promptly because the information requested was so vast .
Honeybees add about $ 15 billion to U.S. agricultural output each year .
The two - year bee die - off has led to sharp price increases for growers .
Pumpkin growers , for instance , now are paying $ 95 to $ 105 to rent a single bee colony , compared with $ 55 to $ 65 last year .
Even smaller beekeepers , like Jim Fitzroy of Penn Hills , are concerned .
" I have not had problems with CCD , but I know many people who have .
I am spending a lot more on supplemental feedings to avoid CCD , " said Fitzroy , who keeps about 15 hives at home and in the Allegheny National Forest .
The lawsuit seeks information connected with the EPA 's 2003 approval of clothianidin -- a pesticide used to treat corn , sugar beet and sorghum seeds .
" This is not an assumption of guilt .
We are not going in with the assumption that there is some kind of conspiracy , " said Mogerman of the National Resources Defense Council .
The same chemical is under fire in Germany , where there was a large bee die - off this past spring .
Bayer AG says the die - off occurred because the pesticide was used improperly .
And the bees in Germany died inside their hives , not -- as in the case with Colony Collapse Disorder -- far from their hives .
" Field studies have demonstrated that when used according to label directions and applied correctly , clothianidin will not harm bees .
All of the EPA 's study requirements have been conducted and have been submitted to the agency , " said Bayer AG 's Coffey .
Nearly two years since CCD first was identified , there is no evidence linking the phenomenon exclusively to pesticides , a particular pathogen or virus , said May Berenbaum , chairwoman of the department of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana .
" We just do n't know , " she said .
" It is unbelievably complicated .
Bees are as complicated as people -- except they do n't talk . "

As the 2008 Beijing Olympics is launched in a suffocating cloud of toxic smog and unprecedented security , it appears that another covert CIA false flag operation may be underway ; a new trigger intended to traumatise the world and facilitate the next stage in the global domination project of the US - UK - Zionist Alliance .
This seems to be a well - cloaked attempt to usurp control of Asia 's oil and mineral resources ­ worth at least $ 3 trillion ­ under the cover of a new " catastrophic and catalysing event " .
The potential impending false flag attack , evidently already in the works for more than a decade , now seems set to trigger during the Beijing Olympics , beginning on August 8 .
An insidious destabilization effort appears designed to weaken China through Islamization of the entire Central Asian region and fronted by pseudo - separatist terrorist groups that are financed , armed and trained by the CIA .
One such group to emerge only days before the opening of the Beijing Olympics is the Turkestan Islamic Party , TIP , a small separatist group from China 's northwestern Xinjiang region .
East Turkistan , although officially a province belonging to China , is actually recognized by the United States as an independent ' country ' .
A transcript of the 3 minute Turkestan Islamic Party video , issued by IntelCenter , a private US intelligence company with offices in Virginia , presents an ultimatum calling on China to cancel the Olympics under threat of attacks with weapons of mass destruction : " Our damullah , Abdul Heq [ Haq ] , made his final order to the [ person ] responsible for the military regarding the issue of severely attacking all central cities in inner China , particularly focusing on eight cities that are going to hold Olympic games .
... ask our merciful Allah to allow these brothers and sisters [ suicide bombers ] to deal a fatal blow in this jihad against Chinese and we ask our merciful Allah to completely stop Olympic Games .
... Bomb Chinese government buildings , military barracks , airplanes , airports , railways , hotels , entertainment venues , tourist spots and similar places ... You 're even permitted to use biological weapons this time . "
This grave threat was barely mentioned by the western media , and neither reported by China , despite Chinese authorities using every minor provocation to crack down on separatists and dissidents in Xinjiang Province .
The CIA Asia destabilisation operation is evidently run in conjunction with illegal heroin trafficking from Afghanistan , which now supplies 93 % of global heroin , and also finances al - Qaeda .
The heroin trade crosses Central Asia to America and interfaces with a black market in nuclear technology .
To hide the money trail , billions of dollars are being laundering through casinos and financial institutions in Central Asia and the Middle East .
A 2001 the Wall Street Journal article reports : " The Egyptian surgeon turned terrorist leader Ayman Al - Zawahiri has operated terrorist training camps , weapons of mass destruction factories and money - laundering and drug - trading networks throughout Albania , Kosovo , Macedonia , Bulgaria , Turkey and Bosnia .
This has gone on for a decade . "
A few of the tentacles of this vast covert operation of state - sponsored terrorism and its shady nexus with the poppy fields had just begun to be uncovered by FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds before she was gagged by the US Justice Dept under State Secrets Privilege , citing the risk of exposing certain ' sensitive foreign diplomatic and business relationships ' .
Sibel Edmonds comments : " You get to a point where it gets very complex , where you have money laundering activities , drug related activities , and terrorist support activities converging at certain points and becoming one . "
Some of these ' sensitive relationships ' that link pseudo - Islamic terrorism to US - UK - Zionist intelligence agencies also came to light during a recent US immigration court case involving the controversial Islamic leader , Fethullah Gülen , who is believed to be one of the Turkish operatives fronting for the CIA in the Islamization of Central Asia .
Gülen , who has been resident in the United States since 1998 , argued that he qualified for a Green Card as " an extraordinarily talented academic . "
Gülen 's visa was denied .
The attorneys stated : " Because of the large amount of money that Gülen 's movement uses to finance his projects , there are claims that he has secret agreements with Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Turkic governments .
There are suspicions that the CIA is a co-payer in financing these projects . "
A Turkish newspaper Hurriyet noted : " Among the reasons given by the US State Department 's attorneys as to why Gülen 's permanent residence application was refused , is the suspicion of CIA financing of his movement . "
With a reported $ 25 billion cash flow , the Gülen movement runs more than a thousand schools all over the world , has founded universities , runs unions , and hundreds of charities , trusts , lobby groups , student bodies , newspapers , radio stations and television channels dedicated to the Islamization of Central Asia .
The movement has several hundred thousand members , if not millions .
Among the people who wrote reference letters for Gülen 's petition were George Fidas , Graham Fuller and Morton Abramowitz .
George Fidas , an expert on the effects of global infectious diseases on US national security , worked at the CIA for 31 years .
Graham Fuller , also an ex CIA agent , and Morton Abramowitz were both deeply involved with the CIA sponsored Mujahedin in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
The Gülen Movement founded madrassas in the 1990's , mostly in the newly independent Turkic republics of Central Asia and Russia .
These madrassas were used as training schools for al Qaeda , and served as a front for undercover CIA and US State Department officials operating in the region .
The FSB , Russia 's intelligence agency , has barred the Gulen movement from Russia for acting as a front organization for the CIA According to TurkPulse : " One of the main tools Washington is using in this affair in order to get Turkey involved in the Xinjiang affair is some Turkish Americans , primarily the Fetullah Gulen team who are prosecuted in absentia in Turkey for trying to found a theocratic State in this country because he runs his activities from the United States .
His protégé , another Turk used in this affair , is Enver Yusuf Turani , who is the self styled Foreign and Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government in exile .
He has been an American citizen since 1998 .
Enver Yusuf is in close cooperation with Fetullah Gulen ...
Their activities for the government in exile are based on a report entitled " the Xinjiang Project " drafted by Graham Fuller in 1998 for the Rand Corporation and revised in 2003 under the title " the Xinjiang Problem . "
It emphasises the importance of the Xinjiang Autonomous region in encircling China and provides a strategy for it . "
A US espionage investigation into activities at their embassy in Turkey also implicated Major Douglas Dickerson , a weapons procurement specialist for Central Asia , who tried to recruit Sibel Edmonds into his network .
Sibel Edmonds has shown that after the fall of the Soviet Union , the superpowers began to fight over control of Central Asia , particularly the oil and gas , as well as the strategic value of the region .
Unable to directly seize control of Asia 's wealth , the US therefore decided on a policy to use Turkish proxies in covert operations without congressional approval .
It is well known that Russia has sponsored terrorist training camps and fomented international terrorism as a strategic operation since the 1950s .
China is also known to be a major state sponsor of terrorist activities , along with North Korea , Cuba , Czechoslovakia and East Germany .
Yet US state sponsorship of terrorism , drug trafficking and complicity in organised crime has remained largely hidden from public view .
Significant CIA operations such as the establishment of the al Qaeda network to confront Russia in Afghanistan ; the funding and training of the Central American Contras who fought under US command to overthrow the Sandinista government of Nicaragua ; CIA backing of the Kosovo Liberation Army , who were trained in terrorist camps run by Osama bin Laden and financed by heroin trade , all of these documented examples have been swept under the carpet until recently , when the unravelling of the 9/11 false flag operation finally alerted many people and exposed the significant extent of US state sponsorship of terrorist activities .
Larry Chin points out : " It is a well - established and deliberately unaddressed historical fact that the CIA created " radical Islam " and Islamic " terrorism " during the Cold War .
It is also a documented fact that the US , its allies , and their intelligence agencies ( CIA , Pakistan 's ISI , Britain 's MI - 6 , etc. ) have - from the 1970s to the present day - continued to use and guide terrorist groups , including " Al - Qaeda " , as intelligence and propaganda assets .
Planned covert operations and false flag operations using " terrorists " in direct and indirect military - intelligence roles are of imperial design .
Such operations ( exemplified by 9/11 ) , and their predictable propaganda results ( " the war on terrorism " ) are now routine events .
Official " war on terrorism " disinformation is repeated ad nauseum , accepted as fact by the mass populace , and used as the justification for ever - expanding Anglo - American war and ever - deepening criminality .
Virtually no attention is paid to the Anglo - American support and management of " Al - Qaeda " and other " terror " groups .
Little or no attention is devoted to the criminally fabricated nature of modern " terrorism " or the fact that every major " terrorism " event in recent times has been a US or US - allied covert operation , followed by political manipulation and cover -up .
September 11 was a false flag operation .
The Mumbai transit bomb attack was a covert operation carried out by terror cells directly connected to Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence , the ISI ( a virtual branch of the American CIA ) , and the same ( alleged " Al - Qaeda " ) apparatus .
The London 7/7 attack was the work of British intelligence , as well as Pakistan 's ISI . "
Serving US - UK - Zionist strategic interests , Islamic terrorism is largely a fabricated weapon using covert operations and false flag operations .
For decades the CIA has been funding illegal covert operations to steal the vast energy resources of Central Asian from Russia by ' Islamicizing ' the region as part of the policy of divide and rule espoused by Zbigniew Brzezinski , former National Security Advisor and now foreign policy advisor to Presidential candidate , Barack Obama .
Using Turkey as a proxy , it appears that this strategy is now also extending to China in accordance with Brzezinski's stated intention to weaken that once mighty imperium and splinter it into waring factions .
Linking into this vast CIA network of patsies and front groups , the sabre - rattling Turkestan Islamic Party 's leader is a man named Abdul Haq , who trained Uyghur militants in Afghanistan in 2001 , and while sheep - dipped analysts may serve their masters well as the magicians who distract public attention from hidden tricks , we should not be deceived whenever the next false flag attack occurs , about who is most certainly behind it .

Japan hopes that the technology and example set by The Zero Emissions House can somehow make a contribution to the world in cutting GHG emissions , at the very least , in half by 2050 .
I think a home like this would do well in the U.S. , do n’t you ?

The scale of British water consumption and its impact around the world is revealed in a new report today , which warns of the hidden levels needed to produce food and clothing .
The UK has become the sixth largest net importer of water in the world , the environment group WWF will tell a meeting of international experts in Stockholm , with every consumer indirectly responsible for the use of thousands of litres a day .
Only 38 % of the UK 's total water use comes from its own resources ; the rest depends on the water systems of other countries , some of which are already facing serious shortages .
The study makes the first attempt to measure the UK 's total " water footprint " and highlights the extent to which our imports come from countries which are running out of fresh water .
It calculates that :
· Average household water use for washing and drinking in the UK is about 150 litres a person daily , but we consume about 30 times as much in " virtual water " , used in the production of imported food and textiles ;
· Taking virtual water into account , each of us soaks up 4,645 litres a day ;
· Only Brazil , Mexico , Japan , China and Italy come higher in the league of net importers of virtual agricultural water .
People in poorer countries typically subsist on 1,000 litres of virtual water a day ;
· Different diets have different water footprints .
A meat and dairy - based diet consumes about 5,000 litres of virtual water a day while a vegetarian diet uses about 2,000 litres .
" What 's particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future , " said Stuart Orr , WWF 's water footprint expert .
With modern patterns of consumption , businesses and consumers are inadvertently contributing to the slow death of some of the world 's most important rivers , the charity warns , and we may not be able to depend on the same supplies in the near future .
Experts at this week 's World Water Week forum in the Swedish capital are increasingly talking of fresh water as " the new oil " , a finite resource that is running out in some areas and will become more and more expensive with a knock - on impact on consumer prices .
British retailers are already examining how much of their food comes from areas where water reserves are depleted and whether they will need to relocate some of their production as water runs out .
Marks & Spencer is working with WWF to calculate the water footprint of its entire food and clothing ranges .
M&S 's technical director , David Gregory , said the availability of water over the next decade was already a key part of the company 's strategic decisions about where to source food for its stores .
" We are already in discussion with WWF about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future , " he said .
The retailer is auditing the water footprint of five key crops - strawberries , tomatoes , lettuce , potatoes and roses - to establish where and how they should be grown in the next few years to make best use of water resources .
The WWF report identifies Spain , northern African countries including Egypt and Morocco , South Africa , Israel , Pakistan and Uzbekistan as countries which face acute water stress and yet supply the UK with substantial exports of their water .
Sainsbury 's agronomist , Debbie Winstanley , confirmed that water would be " on every agenda in sourcing food " .
" From our point of view we 've got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from , " she said .
Most British supermarkets currently depend on southern Spain for salad crops , such as lettuce , cucumbers , tomatoes and peppers , as well as broccoli out of season through the winter months .
But over - extraction of water for horticulture and the tourist industry have led to a crisis there .
Aquifers have become severely depleted and the water table has been infiltrated by the sea .
" There are massive challenges with water in places like Murcia [ southern Spain ] .
We have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply .
Murcia will have to look very different in five years ' time .
" We 'll have to look at new desalination technologies , and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions , such as broccoli .
We take tomatoes out of Morocco in winter , and we 've looked very hard at Moroccan water , but it 's complex ; if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy .
Peas and beans are a steady all - year market .
We 've got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner , " she said .
Whether you ’re a beginner cook or just a busy person , you ’ve probably got a roster of dishes that you cook on a regular basis .
They ’re tried , tested and true .
But , boy , do they get boring after a while !
Rather than starting from scratch , try tweaking standard dishes by adding and experimenting with new flavors .
There are many healthy , low or no -calorie ways to add a fresh twist to your meals .
Here are 7 quick flavor boosters to keep on hand .
1. Fresh herbs :
In the produce section of the grocery store , you ’ll find bunches of fresh herbs including parsley , basil , mint , cilantro , dill , chives , sage and rosemary .
A handful of chopped , fresh herbs gives a huge flavor boost to all kinds of ordinary dishes .
Basil livens up pastas and pasta sauces ; cilantro gives Asian and Mexican dishes that authentic kick ; and mint works well in salads .
Fresh parsley adds a tasty twist to something as basic as canned soup or scrambled eggs .
Tips :
You can use three times the amount of fresh herbs that you would dried herbs ; add fresh herbs to dishes in the last few minutes of cooking .
If you do n’t want to let leftover fresh herbs go to waste , here ’s how to freeze fresh herbs .
2. Seasoning blends , like Lawhorn ’s or Mrs. Dash , are a great way to add depth and flavor without adding salt .
You can substitute a seasoning blend in any recipe that calls for salt , or sprinkle it on any food that could use some zip : scrambled eggs , soups , sandwiches , salads , cooked meat or fish .
You can also make your own seasoning blend .
For the basics on spices , read Kathy ’s post on Starting a Spice collection .
3. Worcestershire sauce , an aged blend of vinegars and seasonings , can really rev up all kinds of beef dishes .
Marinate steaks in it , add it to hamburger patties , meatloaf or meatball recipes ; or just sprinkle it on steamed vegetables .
Another idea : splash it on some tomato soup .
4. Pickles :
Before you bite into that plain old cheese sandwich , why not throw some pickles in there !
Whether you like tangy dills or the bread - and - butter variety , sliced pickles make a great addition to sandwiches , burgers and wraps .
They can also be chopped and added to tuna , chicken or salmon sandwich filling .
5. Cinnamon .
Who does n’t love this spice ?
We all know it as the key flavoring in so many desserts and baked goods , but few people think to use it in savory dishes .
You can add a cinnamon stick or some ground cinnamon to soups , chilies and stews while they ’re cooking .
You can also steep a cinnamon stick in water to make cinnamon tea , or add ground cinnamon to coffee grounds before brewing .
6. Mustard :
Try spreading mustard , rather than mayonnaise , on sandwiches .
It brings lots of fat - free tang to the table , and comes in so many styles : good old ballpark yellow , hot Dijon or old - world grainy .
A herbed variety , like tarragon mustard , can quickly elevate a homemade dish to restaurant level .
7. Salsa :
A jar of salsa comes the rescue in almost any culinary emergency .
Aside from tasting great on the tip of a nacho chip , salsa stands in as a sauce any old time .
In Kathy ’s Cod with Salsa recipe , for example , you just bake cod with salsa on top , creating a main dish from two ingredients .
Try using it as a sauce over sautéed spinach , plain steamed vegetables , or baked potatoes .
And you do n’t have to stick to tomato - based versions ; you can always go for corn , black bean , mango or pineapple salsa .
In the next few days President Bush is expected to again claim the right to order mistreatment of prisoners that any civilized person would regard as torture .
Mr. Bush is planning to veto a law that would require the C.I.A. and all the intelligence services to abide by the restrictions on holding and interrogating prisoners contained in the United States Army Field Manual .
Mr. Bush says the Army rules are too restrictive .
What are these burdens ?
In addition to a blanket prohibition of torture , the manual specifically bans :
¶ Forcing a prisoner to be naked , perform sexual acts or pose in a sexual manner .
¶ Placing hoods or sacks over the head of a prisoner , and using duct tape over the eyes .
¶ Applying beatings , electric shocks , burns or other forms of physical pain .
¶ Waterboarding .
¶ Using military working dogs .
WASHINGTON , June 18 ( Reuters ) - Medical examinations of 11 former terrorism suspects held by U.S. troops found proof of physical and psychological torture resulting in long - term damage , a human rights advocacy group said on Wednesday .
Mistreatment cited by the men included beatings and other physical and sexual abuse , isolation , forced nakedness and being forced into painful stress positions with their hands and feet bound .
" The evaluations provide evidence of violation of criminal laws prohibiting torture and of the commission of war crimes by U.S. personnel , " said the report by the Cambridge , Mass . - based Physicians for Human Rights .
The image of the U.S. military has been tarnished by abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and criticism over the detention facility at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba .
Rights groups have condemned the U.S. government for allowing harsh interrogation techniques .
Physicians for Human Rights said its report provided the most detailed account available -- supplemented by medical evidence -- of the experience of detainees in U.S. custody who suffered torture at the hands of U.S. personnel .
" Additionally , this report provides further evidence of the role health professionals played in facilitating detainee abuse by being present during torture and ill - treatment ... and failing to stop or document detainee abuse , " it said .
The report said seven of the 11 had considered suicide after their abuse .
The report was released a day after a congressional hearing discussed how Pentagon officials had developed interrogation techniques after the Sept. 11 attacks , amid questions over whether there was a systematic government effort to determine the harshest methods .
TORTURE AND ABUSE 'SECOND TO NONE '
Physicians for Human Rights conducted two - day clinical interviews and evaluations of each of the 11 former detainees to document psychological and physical consequences of their treatment while in custody .
Four of the men were arrested in or brought to Afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and were later sent to Guantanamo .
They were held for an average of three years before being released without charge .
The other seven were detained in Iraq , most in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison , in 2003 and released without charge later that year or in 2004 .
" As a physician with more than 15 years of experience evaluating and caring for torture victims from all over the world , the torture and abuse these men were subjected to in Abu Ghraib and the resulting trauma are second to none , " said Allen Keller , one of the medical evaluators for the study .
Keller said he and his colleagues found " clear physical and psychological evidence " of torture and abuse , often causing lasting suffering .
Leonard Rubenstein , president of the advocacy group , said the men , particularly those held in Iraq , described a system of " gratuitous cruelty " by U.S. personnel .
" Another key finding is that the authorized techniques , many of which themselves amount to torture , begat yet additional forms of torture , proving once again that once torture starts it can't be contained , " Rubenstein said .
The report gave one example of the case of a man named Amir , who was arrested by U.S. forces in Iraq in August 2003 .
Amir said while at Abu Ghraib prison he was placed in a foul - smelling room and forced to lay face down in urine while he was hit and kicked .
He was also sodomized with a broomstick and forced to howl like a dog while a soldier urinated on him .
After a soldier stepped on his genitals , he fainted .
Amir continues to experience physical and psychological symptoms nearly four years after being released , the report said .
Rubenstein said the report showed the extent of the men's pain and suffering -- now and at the time of their detention .
" The pain from the beatings and stress positions , including suspension , combined with feelings of humiliation and shame was so bad it led seven men to consider suicide despite prohibitions in the Muslim religion , " he said .

“ Thinking that file locking is
a feature is just a sign that
you have n’t been taking
your medication lately . ”
From 1991 until 2002 , the Linux kernel source was passed around as patches or archived files , and there was no formal source control system , mainly because of the difficulties caused by the wide geographic distribution of the developers .
Then , in 2002 , the Linux kernel project started to use the proprietory DVCS ( Distributed Version Control system ) system called BitKeeper .
This was a controversial move that was criticised at the time by Richard Stallman amongst others for developing an open - source project by means of a commercial one .
In 2005 , the critics proved to be right when the Linux team decided to give up using the ‘ community ’ version of BitKeeper after the copyright holder Larry McVoy ( also a Linux developer ) withdrew free use of his product to some of the key members of the Linux team after he claimed that an Australian Linux programmer in the team had violate the terms of the license by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols for another project .
Like any other good red- blooded hacker , Linus Torvalds sat down and wrote his own source control system called ‘ git ’ – which , he says , is named after himself .
Though git was was initially nothing more than a rough temporary fill - in for BitKeeper , based on some of their experiences of using BitKeeper , other kernel hackers immediately started sending in patches to improve git – just as they had with the fledgling Linux and , in less than a month , git was close to matching the core capabilities of BitKeeper .
Git was written because of the non-linear development of Linux : there were thousands of parallel branches ;
It had to be reliable , fast and simple too , because of the huge size of the project .
It had to be distributed and allow disconnected working .
Torvalds was the right person to set the project going .
He is a true software architect , who is able to spot the deeper issues , formulate a framework for addressing them , and knock up a rough solution that others can perfect .
He also has the charisma to lead a large force of volunteers to turn his vision into reality
It was this that helped to make Linux so successful against all the odds and it is this that has propelled Git into prominence as a Source Control system .
Linus Torvalds paused on the way to world domination via a diving trip in Fiji , to tell Simple Talk about code management with git , his view on programming , share his trenchant views on Subversion and why he believes the software industry is a glorious mess of innovation .
RM :
Linus , it ’s two decades since Linux was first launched .
Can you identify any big changes in the way you think about programming now and you did twenty years ago ?
LT :
Oh , sure .
The biggest is actually that I do n’t do nearly as much programming at all these days .
I spend my time looking at and merging other people ’s code , rather than write any myself .
I do some programming ( like the dive application I ’m playing with ) , but most of my Linux programming is actually writing small example snippets of pseudo - codein email when I want to illustrate something .
That said , when I do write code , the code I write looks somewhat different too .
Especially in the kernel , I ’m just much more careful these days – and that is one reason it can be relaxing to write user - level ( application ) code , because you can do a lot of shortcuts and you do n’t have to be as careful as in the kernel .
RM :
Would you consider developing a new language from scratch ?
LT :
I have , but at the same time I ’m very pragmatic , and I think people who design things from scratch often forget that for things to be actually useful you need to have a lot of infrastructure , and you have to have people who know it .
Designing a new language is painful .
Even if it were to be much better than some old language , you ’re just losing a lot of the existing knowledge base of an old one .
And that “ if it were to be much better ” is pretty doubtful – people often have things that they dislike about old languages , but they do n’t think so much about all the small details that work very well – so when you design a new one you may fix the things you do n’t like , but you probably do n’t think about , and screw up all the things that made the old language successful .
I loathe the C pre-processor – the C language is wonderful , but the C pre-processor is pretty annoying .
I ’d love to have a pre-processor that could be aware of semantics and types – but also able to break them when necessary .
That said , every attempt at that has always been a total failure , so I ’m kind of resigned to the status quo .
RM :
I ’m intrigued to hear about the language .
Would it have been a pure functional language ?
LT :
Oh , no .
I ’ve been interested in C - like languages ; I just wish types in C were a more first - class citizen .
Untyped inline functions ( generics ) types as arguments .
Sparse does some of that , and was influenced by the kind of static checking that I think a C - type language could do .
RM :
If you were starting out at university again , would you be drawn to programming the way programming is today ?
Where did you get the idea that given a problem to solve , the first thing you need is an interactive programming environment ?
LT :
Hmm .
Starting out today , I suspect things have just changed so much that I ’d probably not do things the way I used to .
For example , I really love doing low - level stuff , and work close to the hardware .
It ’s why I did a kernel , of course .
And that made much more sense back when I started with computers , because the computers were simpler , and you really could know them very intimately .
So programming close to the hardware was how you did things , and the documentation existed , and there was a lot of support for that .
These days ?
It ’s hard to get very close to the machine , because machines have gotten so much more complex .
You need to know about SMP , you need to have device drivers for infinitely more hardware , it ’s just intimidating .
And the bar is just so much higher – to decide to do an OS today sounds like a very big undertaking .
Of course , that was true to some degree twenty years ago when I started Linux too – people who actually knew what was involved would never have started their own OS , because they knew what a huge undertaking it would be .
I was just naive enough and ignorant enough that I did n’t know how much work it would be .
RM :
Has programming – and therefore the kind of people who can succeed as programmers – has changed ?
Can you be a great programmer operating at a certain level without ever learning assembly or C ?
LT :
I do n’t think you need to learn assembly , but I do think knowing C is useful if you want to be a great programmer .
Why ?
Not because C is some magical language , but because C is in many ways closer to the machine than most other modern and still used languages .
And to be a great programmer , you really do need to know how the machine works , I believe .
You need to really understand what can be done efficiently , and what needs a lot of work from the CPU or the system .
Of course , many programming projects are n’t about efficiency or being close to the hardware .
Many projects are about being close to the user , and it ’s almost irrelevant what you ask the machine to do , because it ’s all about the user interfaces .
And that requires a different kind of understanding .
So I think in the end there is simply just a need for different kinds of programmers .
Different projects need different skills and often even the same project – you might have different people working on different parts .
I do think that programming has changed , but it ’s not because the ‘ old kind ’ of programming has gone away , it ’s because there ’s just a wider variety .
A couple of decades ago you pretty much had to be technical to do programming .
These days there are environments where you need other skills .
RM :
Do you think languages are getting better ?
It ’s obviously easier to write software now because of the advances that have been made but what are the things that are making it more difficult ?
LT :
I do n’t think it ’s about languages getting better – I still think C is a wonderful language , and unmatched for what it does .
But that ‘ for what it does ’ is about the same thing as in the previous question : the same way you ’d want people with different interests for different parts of a project , those new programming languages are not necessarily better than the old ones , but they have a particular bent .
They may be better at handling multithreading , they may have easier memory management with automatic garbage collection , they may have native interfaces for user interfaces etc .
That does n’t make them any better than C – it just means that for some particular use they may be more convenient .
And I think a lot of the programming language debate is kind of pointless – it ’s not so much about the programming language , as it ’s about the programmer .
People will always prefer – and be more productive with – a language that they know , and that matches their interest and expertise .
So I like C , and I ’ll happily prototype things in C and play around with it – while others find the whole notion of using C for some simple prototype to be abhorrent and crazy .
They ’d prefer to use some scripting language that is ‘ easier ’ – but it ’s easier because of what they are used to , and what they want to do with it .
One reason I still think that C is so important is that you can do pretty much anything with it .
It ’s a supremely flexible language that is limited only by your skills and effort .
Yes , it may take more effort , but you know you can do anything : you really can do anything from an OS kernel to a library to a nice pretty GUI and artificial intelligence .
It may not help you all that much , but it never ever says ‘ you ca n’t do that ’ .
Other languages tend to be more about the particular niche that they are really useful for .
RM :
Is programming getting easier and should everyone learn to program , at least a little ?
There ’s an argument which starts that programming teaches away of thinking that ’s important , it gives you order and structure in life .
Opponents to this say programmers are completely misunderstanding the world in exactly the same way everybody else does and it does n’t make you intellectually superior .
What camp are you in ?
LT :
I ’m absolutely not a believer in the ‘ everybody should know it ’.
That ’s just crazy talk .
It ’s the same mindset as ‘ everybody should be able to fix their car ’ , or ‘ everybody should be able to build their own house ’ .
No , not everybody should .
Specialization is what makes us human .
We can afford to specialize in things and be expert at something , because other people do other things .
Software is important in modern society , yes – but so is growing food .
You should n’t expect everybody to know how to be a farmer or to milk a cow .
And the thing is some people will be better at it .
Either because of some natural inclination , or just because they spent a lot of time at it .
Or both .
Expecting everybody to learn to program when you know that the majority wo n’t care or ever get all that great at it – why even bother ?
RM :
Is the software industry a brilliant engine of innovation or a horrible mess ?
And if it ’s in a horrible mess what could we do to drag ourselves out of it ?
Review the way we create standards and specify less ?
LT :
I think it ’s a mess , but it ’s not a horrible mess .
It ’s a glorious , crazy mess .
Software engineering is about complex systems and few people really understand the whole thing – I ’d argue that nobody does .
You ca n’t plan or even really engineer things in that kind of complex environment – I think you have to make things grow more or less organically .
And that ’s why I think open source works so well .
It ’s this crazy free - for - all where people who are interested and have a viewpoint can all participate and you get a kind of odd Darwinian thing where successful approaches work better and propagate .
There is n’t much ‘ intelligent design ’ , but there are lots of changes and lots of very active fitness testing .
RM :
Okay , a change of subject .
There ’s a lot of noise from people fresh to Git who say that the documentation is still less than brilliant , that git ’s wiki still has a long way to go and they have to consult the web to find out exactly how to format revision specifiers .
Are these criticisms valid or should they do something else with their life such as use Mercurial ?
LT :
I do n’t think they are really valid any more .
There is tons of documentation , and the problem most people tend to have is that getting into a new SCM takes effort and may require you to change how you think about what you ’re doing .
And git is a very powerful tool that can be used in many different ways .
The fact that it can take a while to get used to it is n’t because the documentation is lacking or bad , it ’s simply because it may take some effort to get proficient .
Getting started is easy .
Doing some of the complicated things can be hard .
I suspect people may get to the documentation for the complex things before they are really ready for it .
RM :
Windows users say that the official way of running git under Windows ( using cygwin ) is far from ideal , although it is completely functional ; it ’s a little sluggish and in some way Windows users remain second class citizens in the world of git .
You once said that ‘ If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I ’ve won ’ does this apply the other way round ?
LT :
Actually , you really should n’t use the cygwin port of git .
It ’s gotten lots better , but it ’s a very non-native interface for Windows , and I really suspect that people should use the more ‘ native ’ git port ( msysgit ) .
That said , a lot of people want to use cygwin just in general , because it obviously makes Windows look more like a UNIX environment – and that part has nothing what - so - ever to do with git , and everything to do with people wanting full shell access and all the normal UNIX tools .
If you ’re that kind of person , you probably want the cygwin git port too .
As to the ‘ who won ’ part – I just think that git won .
It ’s a good design , and it ’s the most robust ( and fastest ) SCM around .
And people are slowly really learning what the point of distributed SCM ’s are , and git has been instrumental in that and is the best tool around for it .
The fact that people use it on Windows too is just a side effect of that – once you ‘ get ’ the whole distributed model , I do n’t think you can ever really go back .
RM :
In 2007 you ’re quoted as saying that Subversion was ‘ the most pointless project ever started ’ , though it ’s the most popular version control system on the planet .
Why do you think so many use it and can you see the day when Veracity will be as pointless as Subversion ?

DIGG THIS
They " co-pastor " the largest church in America .
That explains why Joel and Victoria Osteen were flying to Vail , Colorado on December 19 , 2005 : Christmas is usually the clergy ’s busiest season , but hey , when you fleece the flock as strenuously as these two do , you need a little R&R at the holidays .
Besides , Lakewood Church in Houston , Texas boasts 60 other ministers for lesser duties like funerals , counseling , and whatever does n’t involve television cameras .
We ’ll presume , then , that the co-bigwigs boarded Continental Airlines flight # 1602 that winter ’s day with clear consciences while visions of sugary slopes danced in their heads .
Alas , the vacation got off to a rocky start when Victoria noticed " liquid " on her first - class seat .
Encountering dirty accommodations at whatever exorbitant prices Continental charges first - class passengers “ clearly " angered her .
Rage has become one of the aviation gulag ’s biggest crimes , however richly the airlines deserve it and especially if it ’s in response to shoddy service .
Accounts differ as to whether Victoria asked the flight attendants for napkins or told them to mop the mess ; they continue to differ when neither napkins nor clean - up were forthcoming .
The crew claims Victoria " grabbed " one of them by the " right forearm " and " led " her to the seat in question .
Touching a flight attendant becomes " assault " under Title 49 , United States Code ( USC ) 46504 if the touchee complains that it " interfere [d ] with and lessen[ed ] the ability of the flight attendant to perform his duties . "
But Victoria ’s casualty was a hardy sort : despite the assault , she was still able to perform her duty of calling for clean - up and accordingly headed for the cockpit .
Victoria followed her , only to bump into — literally , it seems , thereby committing her second assault — another flight attendant , Sharon Brown .
Sharon alleges that Victoria " push[ed ] her out of the way and elbow[ed ] her in the left breast . "
Victoria counters that when one of the crew handed her napkins , she protested , " ’ It ’s not my job . ’
I did n’t say it in an ugly tone of voice . "
Nevertheless , that was enough to antagonize the flight attendants , which " freaked " Victoria " out .
I asked a simple question , ” she told a packed courtroom Friday .
Sharon retaliated by " accusing me of stuff I did n’t do … .
I was dumbfounded . ”
She testified that she apologized to Sharon , saying , " If I ’ve done something to offend you , I ’m sorry , " before returning to her seat and cleaning it herself .
Everyone agrees the Osteens then disembarked , though they disagree about whether that was voluntary .
" ‘ [ Victoria ] failed to comply with the flight attendant ’s instructions , and they were asked to leave the flight , ’ FBI spokeswoman Luz Garcia said . "
Yes , in our silly times , the FBI actually concerns itself with cat - fights on airplanes .
But this one was so ridiculously trivial that even an agency eager to persecute innocuous passengers could n’t think of any charges to file .
That did n’t stop the flight attendants or the media from exaggerating and gossiping , so Victoria ’s spokesman tried to set the record straight the next day : “ The account of the event which has come to our attention is inaccurate and overblown .
The misunderstanding was minor and was resolved when Victoria voluntarily removed herself from the situation . ”
Hard to quibble with that .
Even if the " event " unfurled precisely as the flight attendants averred , it was decidedly " minor " and definitely " overblown . "
When the spokesman ’s efforts did n’t settle the furor , Victoria herself took a stab at doing so on the church ’s website .
" Regardless of how some have portrayed the situation , please know that it was truly a minor misunderstanding and did not escalate into what you saw or read in the news .
Contrary to those reports it was my choice to remove myself from the situation .
Nonetheless , it was a most unfortunate event and I truly regret that it happened . "
Oh , I ’ll bet she does : Our Masters fined her $ 5000 despite the lack of charges or even the remotest trace of criminality , then scaled back the extortion to only $ 3000 .
Victoria paid it , " not because she was guilty , " her attorney explained , " but as a way to conclude the matter and avoid any embarrassment for her church . "
That bought off Leviathan , but not Sharon Brown .
She realized that a very wealthy woman had treated her like the flight attendant that she is — and this in neoconservative Amerika .
We serfs may persist in seeing Sharon and her co-workers as little more than sky - high waiters and waitresses , but that only shows we do n’t understand the miracle of 9/11 .
They do .
They know it transformed them from menial employees whose jobs depend on pleasing customers into high - ranking officers in the Feds ’
War on Terror .
Mere passengers no longer dare question nor cross them .
And so Sharon is suing Victoria for 10 % of her net worth .
The case went to court last week .
It ’s a toss - up as to which woman is the bigger phony .
Reputedly a follower of Jesus Christ , Victoria " co-pastors " a church that says it believes " the entire Bible is inspired by God , without error . "
Except , of course , those passages in which God designates men to guide , protect , and succor their families and His church .
The Almighty forgot to add that women should share those roles .
Joel and Victoria have graciously corrected His oversight .
The Osteens and their congregation also differ with the Lord when it comes to humility .
They repeatedly brag that Lakewood is the largest church in America .
Yet the God of the Bible delights in small , spurned agents : an army of 300 men to fight masses of Midianites ; slave girls who tell their powerful , prestigious masters that Yahweh heals leprosy ; a Newborn in a manger .
Then there ’s the " gospel of prosperity " the Osteens so slickly sell , an ancient heresy that ’s fooled not only Lakewood ’s multitudes but far smarter folks .
Life can be horrifically depressing , squalid , unfair , and tragic ; insisting that God blesses good people with good things ignores the realities of this fallen world .
How can such fallacy possibly comfort the parents of a murdered son , Christians persecuted for their faith , or a 14 - year - old paraplegic confined to a wheelchair because of the car accident that killed his parents ?
Imagine the flawlessly dressed Osteens squatting in the filth and ashes beside Job as he scrapes his stinking sores with a potsherd .
" So , Job , " Joel pontificates as Victoria gags , " it ’s easy to get into a survival mode when times get tough and things are n’t going our way …
If we ’re not careful , we ’ll develop this survivor mentality , to where we ’re not releasing our faith , we ’re not believing to rise any higher …
The ‘ Voice of Victory ’ is found in God ’s Word .
It says , ‘ You are blessed . ’
‘ You are prosperous ’ , ‘ You can do all things ’ , ‘ Your best days are still ahead ’ . "
On the other hand , we can probably absolve not only Joel and Victoria but Lakewood as a whole of hypocrisy so long as we remove the word " Christian " from their prattle .
They may truly believe the positive - thinking baloney they ’re recycling from Norman Vincent Peale , and why not ?
Look how far it ’s taken them .
Actually , Lakewood itself avoids the terms " Christian " and " Christ " on much of its website .
It talks instead of " Lakewood ’s [ not Christianity ’s ] positive message of hope " while assuring us that " Joel and Victoria Osteen [ not Christ ] are proven leaders for this generation . "
We laugh at such preening , but at least the Osteens do n’t add nationalism to the brew .
In fact , critics complain that aside from the obligatory exhortation to vote , Lakewood eschews politics .
Other " Christians " are n’t as fastidious .
James Dobson , for example , " believe [s ] that God has ordained the social institutions of family , church , and government for the benefit of mankind and as a reflection of His divine nature .
Therefore , Christians are called to support these institutions … "
So , however small their saving grace , the Osteens have one .
Which is more than we can say for the larcenous Sharon Brown .
Saner times and Americans would have laughed this woman back to her dunghill if they did n’t horsewhip her for theft : her case against Victoria is about as strong as a politician ’s promise .
First , she routinely accuses folks of assault : " Brown had previously claimed she was attacked in another incident by an airport employee … "
Wonder whether the poor sap brushed past her down the concourse or tapped her shoulder to get her attention .
Whatever , Sharon apparently did n’t pick his bones clean enough and was lying in wait for Victoria , She of the Allegedly Lethal Elbow .
You do n’t want to block Milady ’s way , as Sharon can attest .
Not only did Victoria ’s elbowing her aside destroy Sharon ’s faith in God , it gave her hemorrhoids .
Yes , indeedy , you read that right .
And your taxes are paying a judge to hear this crap .
I guess that makes Leviathan the butt of the joke .
But then we ’ve always known the law is an ass .

Study shows that stimuli unrelated to decision can still influence men ’s choices

For the study , images such as these were used to stimulate positive emotional responses , negative emotional responses and neutral emotional responses in heterosexual men .
( The pictures shown here were not actually used in the study but are similar to those that were . )
JASON MOURATIDES © RMARMION | DREAMSTIME.COM
Attractive women plus cool cars equal brisk sales for auto dealers as men snap up those cars , prompted — or so advertising theory goes — by the association .
But is the human male really so easily swayed ?
Can the irrelevant image of an alluring female posing by the merchandise actually encourage a heterosexual man to purchase it ?
Possibly , according to a new study by Stanford researchers .
The study showed that when heterosexual men are exposed to positive emotional stimuli — in this case , erotic photos of a man and woman — an area of the brain associated with anticipation of reward is stimulated .
In the immediate aftermath of that stimulation , men are consistently more likely to take bigger financial risks than they otherwise would , said Brian Knutson , assistant professor of psychology .
" This is the first study to demonstrate that emotional stimuli can influence financial risk - taking , " said Knutson , lead author of a paper describing the research in the current issue of NeuroReport .
The hard evidence was gathered by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) of participants ' brains as they viewed photographs of positive , negative or neutral subjects and then had to quickly make a decision to choose one of two levels of financial risk in a required gamble .
Knutson and collaborator Camelia Kuhnen ( who received her PhD from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2006 and is now assistant professor of finance at Northwestern University ) had already shown in a 2005 study using fMRI that brain activity could be used to predict whether people were about to take a financial risk .
When they were , an area of the brain called the nucleus accumbens showed increased activation .
When they were about to choose to avoid the risk , a different area called the insula showed increased activation .
" We knew that we should be looking at [ the nucleus accumbens ] from the previous study .
But what we did n't know is whether we could somehow control the activation in that area by presenting some completely irrelevant stimulus , " Knutson said .
" And whether that would change activation in that area and actually change behavior . "
Knutson and his colleagues studied heterosexual male undergraduate college students .
The images the men viewed were intended to stimulate an emotional response .
Erotic images were used to elicit a positive response , snakes and spiders to prompt a negative response , and office supplies to trigger a neutral response .
In case any of the subjects found office supplies more repellent than snakes and spiders , the researchers had the men rate each image after the scans .
They then derived personalized ratings from each of the participants , which were used to make sure that whatever brain activation they observed was properly correlated with the actual emotional response of the viewer .
After viewing each image , the participants immediately had to decide whether to take the high - risk option of gambling a dollar or the low - risk option of gambling a dime .
Regardless of their choice , they had a 50 - 50 chance of winning or losing .
Knutson and his colleagues gave each man $ 10 to gamble with prior to entering the MRI scanner .
" We wanted them to care , " Knutson said .
Depending on the men's gambles and the random outcomes , they won or lost .
" We took that money back if they lost it , " he said .
" What we saw is that when they viewed the erotic pictures , the activation in their nucleus accumbens increased compared to the other stimuli , and also that they had increased activation in that region before choosing the high - risk gamble , " Knutson said .
The researchers then applied a statistical analysis to determine whether the activation in the nucleus accumbens accounted for some of the behavioral effect .
" The answer was yes , at least in the case of the positive stimuli , " Knutson said .
" After people had seen those erotic pictures , they tended to pick the high - risk gamble more often , especially if they had been picking the low - risk gamble before .
" The interesting finding from an economic standpoint is that these completely irrelevant stimuli , these pictures that have nothing to do with the gambles or the history of outcomes that people have experienced with these gambles , still influence behavior , " he said .
" They seem to do so at least partially by influencing activation of these brain regions . "
The findings have implications for what might make emotional appeals effective or ineffective in applications ranging from advertising to finance to politics and , perhaps not surprisingly , gambling .
" If you go to the casinos , people are wearing skimpy costumes , they 're giving you free alcohol , there are bells and lights and things like that , which do n't necessarily seem related to the odds of the gambling , " Knutson said .
" But these are cues that might activate brain regions that encourage risk - taking and therefore get people to gamble more . "
So does draping a seductive woman over the hood of a car in an advertisement really help sell that car ?
" Well , yes and no , " Knutson said .
" It may work sometimes under some conditions . "
" Our trials are happening relatively fast , changing on a second - to - second basis , " he noted .
" We 're forcing people to immediately make a decision , and the emotional stimuli appear in close temporal proximity to the decision itself .
" If you have these kinds of appeals , you 'd better make it easy for people to make an immediate decision .
You should put them under time pressure , " he said .
Knutson emphasized that there is still ample work to be done in deciphering the effects of emotional stimuli on behavior .
He plans to study women 's responses in the future , as well as to examine other types of emotional stimuli .
He also intends to examine the influence of time , to see how transient or lasting the influences of various emotional stimuli might prove to be .
" This is just a first step , " he said .
" It 's an existence proof that some irrelevant emotional stimuli can influence some immediate financial decisions and that we can track down one brain basis for this influence . "
In addition to Knutson and Kuhnen , the co-authors of the NeuroReport paper are G. Elliott Wimmer , formerly of Stanford University , and Piotr Winkielman of the University of California - San Diego .
This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health .

Living in the the heart of the American South in a fairly small town , I am literally surrounded by fundamentalist Christians .
They fill my neighborhood , my workplace , local stores , community groups , etc .
There is nothing approximating a local group of non-believers .
Based on what I have heard from my few non-fundamentalist ( but still religious ) friends and co-workers , I am convinced that concerns over increased prejudice , vandalism , and even assault are quite realistic .
I believe that my ability to do my job would be jeopardized in many ways by professing my atheism .
I would not be fired , but it would become much more difficult to do my job well .
I would face increased alienation , a loss of credibility , greater hostility , etc .
Because most of my co-workers and many more of my students are Southern Baptists who take their religion very seriously , I simply cannot expect that they would be tolerant of atheism .
I do not like the idea of my students and co-workers reading this blog and knowing that this was how I felt about their religion .
There are enough sources of conflict in the workplace without adding this to the mix .
Not having to worry about this makes me more effective here .
Giving up anonymity would change the way I write this blog .
Maybe it would n't be a major change , but it would be a change .
I would find myself tempted to hold back .
Atheists commonly assert that our situation will improve as more and more of us " come out " and reveal our atheism to the world .
I do not disagree , for the parallels to the GLBT movement are obvious .
So how can I continue to write this blog anonymously ?
This is a question with which I periodically struggle , but I remain convinced that the benefits of continued anonymity outweigh the costs .
I have a variety of reasons for remaining anonymous , some obvious and some probably less so .
This post was prompted by Hemant at Friendly Atheist who recently leveled some subtle criticism of anonymous atheist bloggers .
After acknowledging that his opposition to anonymity as " caused some friction with some people I know , " Hemant asks why we anonymous atheist bloggers maintain our anonymity when doing so makes it " that much harder to make atheism more acceptable in society .
" This is a fair question .
I cannot pretend to answer on behalf of all anonymous atheist bloggers , but I will attempt to do so for myself .
My family knows I am an atheist , but they live far away .
Those with whom I interact on a daily basis have little idea .
Why ?
I 'm comfortable with my anonymity .
I am sure I will question it again , and I may even decide at some point to drop it .
But I see no reason to apologize or to conclude that I am somehow less of an atheist or less of a blogger for preferring to remain anonymous here .
More signs of Israeli - US preparations for attacking Iran
By Peter Symonds
28 June 2008
The visit by US Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Mike Mullen to Israel yesterday is one more indication that the two countries are actively discussing a military strike on Iran .
Mullen ’s trip followed news that the Israeli air force carried out a major exercise earlier this month involving 100 fighter jets , backed by midair fuel tankers and rescue helicopters , flying some 1,500 kilometres westward over the Mediterranean Sea—roughly the same distance as eastward from Israel to Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Mullen ’s trip was only the second by a joint chiefs chairman to Israel in more than a decade .
Last December Mullen also visited Israel in the wake of an unprovoked attack last September by Israeli warplanes on a building in northern Syria .
In April , the Bush administration authorised a CIA briefing , which claimed , on the basis of limited evidence , that Syria had been constructing a nuclear reactor at the site with the assistance of North Korea .
Few details of Mullen ’s latest trip are available , but Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell did acknowledge that Iran was at the top of the agenda .
“ Obviously , when Chairman Mullen goes to Israel and speaks with the Israelis , they will no doubt discuss the threat posed by Iran , as we discuss it in this building , in other buildings in town , ” he said .
Two other top US military officers were also in Israel this week .
Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead met with his Israeli counterpart , as did General William Wallace , commander of the US Army Training and Doctrine Command .
Roughead ’s presence is particularly significant , as the US navy would be central in countering any Iranian retaliation in the Persian Gulf following an Israeli strike .
The high - level visits follow a series of threats against Iran by senior Israeli figures , most explicitly by Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz .
He told an Israeli newspaper on June 13 that “ if Iran continues with its program for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack it ” .
The Israeli ambassador to the US , Sallai Meridor , told CBS News last week that time was “ running out ” for a diplomatic action to force Iran to shut down its nuclear programs .
“ We can not take this threat lightly and as our prime minister recently said Israel will not tolerate a nuclear Iran , ” he said .
Like the US , Israel claims , without any substantive evidence , that Iran has an active nuclear weapons program , which , according to Israeli intelligence , could manufacture a bomb as early as next year .
Unlike Israel , Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its nuclear facilities are monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
A series of IAEA reports confirm that Iran is enriching uranium only to the low levels required to fuel its planned power reactors — as Tehran has insisted all along .
A National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) by US intelligence agencies last December found that Iran had ended any weapons program by 2003 .
Israel , however , is determined to maintain its military supremacy in the Middle East and to prevent any , even remote , possibility that Iran , or any other neighbour , will master nuclear technology that would in the future assist in the building of weapons .
Hypocritically , both Israeli and US officials remain silent on what is an open secret — that Israel maintains its own substantial arsenal of atomic bombs .
In order to retain its nuclear monopoly , the Israeli regime is prepared to risk plunging the entire region into a conflagration through an unprovoked and criminal attack on Iran .
The Bush administration , which regards Iran as an obstacle to US dominance in the oil - rich Middle East , is complicit in these plans .
As a number of defence analysts have pointed out , the Israeli military does not have the capacity to carry out the type of sustained air war needed not only to strike Iranian nuclear facilities , but to level Iran ’s air defences and military capacity to retaliate .
Moreover , any Israeli air strike on Iran is limited in its choice of routes — the most obvious one being over US - occupied Iraq .
Whatever is the case , Israel needs the tacit political support , if not active military assistance , of the US .
Israeli impatience has nothing to do with Iran ’s alleged weapons program .
If time is “ running out ” , the main consideration is a political one — that the Bush administration is due to leave office early next year .
Analyst Michael Oren from the Jerusalem - based Shalem Centre told CBS News that Israel would not wait for a new US administration .
“ The Israelis have been assured by the Bush administration that the Bush administration will not allow Iran to nuclearise .
The Israelis are uncertain about what would be the policies of the next administration vis -à - vis Iran , ” he said .
Within the Israeli establishment , an attack on Iran is openly discussed .
In a comment on Tuesday , provocatively entitled “ ... but someone has to do it ” , the right - wing Jerusalem Post pointed out that the not - so - secret Israeli “ dress rehearsal ” over the Mediterranean was aimed to pressuring “ the world ” — - particularly the US — into taking on the task .
After discounting the possibility that Bush or either of the US presidential contenders would authorise a US attack on Iran , the article bitterly concluded that in the event that Israel had no partners in such an enterprise , at least the “ Jews can lean on themselves ” .
A second article in the Jerusalem Post the following day attacked a New York Times editorial that had argued against attacking Iran , not because of its criminal character , but because the consequences would be “ disastrous ” .
The Jerusalem Post writer argued that there was little doubt that Iran would respond to a direct attack , or a blockade , “ but its options , heated rhetoric notwithstanding , are actually limited ” .
Tacitly acknowledging that Iran posed no real threat to either Israel or the US , he commented : “ Instead of unwarranted , self - deterring risk aversion , let us not forget who wields the incalculably greater ‘ stick ’ : Iran certainly will not . ”
Israel has been intensifying its propaganda against Iran .
According to Ha’aretz , Foreign Ministry Director General Aaron Abramovich secretly visited IAEA headquarters in Vienna on Wednesday to demand that the body “ act more quickly and efficiently to block Iranian nuclear ambitions ” .
Abramovich , the first senior Israeli official in several years to visit the IAEA , reportedly briefed a group of ambassadors on Israel ’s belief that Iran has a secret military nuclear program .
Israeli officials are claiming that the purpose of Syria ’s alleged nuclear reactor was to supply its ally Iran with plutonium for a nuclear weapon .
An adviser to Israel ’s national security council told the Guardian this week : “ The Iranians were involved in the Syrian program .
The idea was that the Syrians produce plutonium and the Iranians get their share . ”
Given that it is yet to be demonstrated that Syria was even building a nuclear reactor , the Iranian connection , for which no evidence has been offered , has been concocted to add further fuel to the scare campaign .
IAEA inspectors this week visited the site of the bombed building in Syria and said it would be some time before any conclusions could be reached .
Admiral Mullen ’s visit this week makes clear that far from being left to its own devices , Israel enjoys collaborations with the highest levels of the US military .
Moreover , discussion about a possible attack on Iran is taking place within the American political establishment and is not confined to the Bush administration or its extreme right - wing allies .
A statement released this month by the Presidential Task Force on the Future of US - Israeli Relations convened by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy focussed almost exclusively on the issue of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Its key recommendation called on the US president to initiate a dialogue with the Israeli prime minister using “ the most trusted advisers ” to consider “ the costs and benefits ” of “ the entire range of policy ” including diplomacy , “ coercive options ” including an embargo of Iranian oil , and “ preventative military action ” .
Ha’aretz noted this week with some satisfaction that the task force included prominent Democrats such as Susan Rice and Tony Lake , who are among Senator Barack Obama ’s senior foreign policy advisers , as well as representatives from the camp of Senator John McCain , the Republican candidate .
While it indicated that the statement was of course suitably nuanced , the article bluntly characterised the underlying message as follows :
“ If you want it in a journalistic headline format : Obama , McCain advisers agree : US - Israel should discuss preventative military action against Iran . ”
Former US ambassador to the UN John Bolton , who openly advocates attacking Iran , suggested last week that Israel would most likely launch a strike after the US elections in November and prior to the inauguration of the next US president .
However , an article in the Jerusalem Post on Thursday made clear that tactical considerations might dictate a far earlier date .
It noted that Tehran is believed to have purchased the sophisticated Russian - made S-300 air defence missile system , which the Israeli military has warned “ cannot be allowed to reach the region ” .
After reviewing the implications of Bolton ’s remarks , the article concluded : “ There is no guarantee , however , that Israel can wait that long . ”
WASHINGTON , Aug. 21 ( UPI ) --
The White House said Thursday there will be " further consequences " if Russia fails to withdraw from Georgia beyond the end of U.S. - Russian military cooperation .
" There will be further consequences to Russia 's action , there 's no doubt about it , " White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
" But Russia has already , I think , begun to suffer some of the consequences of their actions .
And their continued reluctance to adhere to the withdrawal plan only further isolates them . "

Russian forces invaded Georgia after Georgian troops entered two breakaway regions .
NATO earlier announced Russia was ending all military cooperation with the alliance , but Johndroe said , " I think the -- for all practical purposes -- military - to - military cooperation had really already been suspended with the Russians .
We -- NATO -- canceled some exercises .
And I can't imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the Russians until the situation in Georgia is resolved . "
Johndroe said he was not aware of any problem transporting cargo through Russia to Afghanistan , where a U.S. - led coalition is fighting insurgents .
Johndroe made the comments during the daily press briefing in Crawford , Texas , site of the summer White House .

Nepal 's acute fuel shortage is causing serious concern among local food traders about its impact on food prices .
" The shortage of fuel has been affecting the cost of our transportation .
We can expect further increases in food prices which could heavily affect poor families , " Ravi Sharma , a local food trader , who supplies rice and other food from the Terai region ( fertile plains of southern Nepal ) to the hill areas of the country , told IRIN in the capital .
Many food traders explained that commodity supplies had seriously deteriorated and expected the situation to worsen .
Transportation costs have increased by almost 27 percent over the past six months , in turn feeding into food prices , which have risen by 20 - 30 percent , according to the UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
People are buying smaller quantities and cheaper food items .
Nepal depends on fuel imports from India and sells petrol , diesel and kerosene at highly subsidised rates , at huge financial cost to the government 's Nepal Oil Corporation ( NOC ) .
The cash - strapped NOC , which runs on a monthly loss of more than US $ 22 million , had no option but to increase fuel prices by 25 percent last month , resulting in nationwide protests .
Impact of price hike
But Nepal 's food insecurity was already critical before the global food crisis : 41 percent of its population ( 27 million ) are undernourished and half its children stunted from chronic lack of food , according to the UN food agency , which is concerned that acute malnutrition is approaching 20 percent in some parts of the Terai where people should have access to food through the markets .
" An inverse relationship between rising food prices and food intake can be observed for the extreme poor and poor wealth groups .
This may result in higher malnutrition rates , " warned a new report , Market and Price Impact Assessment Nepal , by WFP and the Nepal Development Research Institute ( NDRI ) , released on 28 July .
The assessment was conducted in more than 40 districts through the WFP Food Security Monitoring and Analysis System ( FSMAS ) by its team of 30 field monitors as well as six NDRI enumerators .
FSMAS collects and analyses price and market information in most of the poorest and food - insecure districts of Nepal .
According to WFP , the poorest 20 percent of the population spend as much as 73 percent of their income on food , against an average 59 percent for the rest .
Sharp increases in the price of coarse rice and cooking oil will have major repercussions on the food security status of the poor , said the report .
According to the traders questioned , in the next six months the biggest price increase was expected in coarse rice , the staple food for most Nepalese .
" The problem could get worse in the hills and mountain regions where the price of food is already 10 times more expensive than in the Terai , " said food trader Sharma .
Economic challenges
High prices in food are posing a serious challenge to Nepal 's economy , according to the report , which warned of a serious risk of stagflation , where low growth ( around 3.5 percent ) is combined with rising prices .

Children in poor villages of the far west of the country are at risk of malnutrition
The country also just emerged from a decade - long armed conflict ( 1996 - 2006 ) and the government structures are very weak , said political analysts .
" Improvements in living standards are urgently needed to avoid civil unrest that may threaten the new government , " explained the report .
WFP costs rise
According to WFP , its operational costs have increased by at least 26 percent due to the rise in food and transportation costs .
The scarcity of fuel is one of the principal logistical challenges the agency faces .
Its food for work programmes , under the protracted relief and recovery operation ( PRRO ) , procure a significant amount of food locally .
Most of WFP 's food aid is distributed in the hills and mountains .
" With adequate funding , the PRRO will provide food support to 1.25 million food - insecure people .
This activity is to be expanded in the short term to provide coverage to the 2.5 million rural poor who need immediate food support , " stated the WFP / NDRI report .

In the last five years , the New York Times has declined in value by an astonishing 70 percent .
There is no indication that things will get better any time soon .
Indeed , as the specter of recession looms , there is every reason to believe that things will get worse .
At some point here in the near future , the market capitalization of the New York Times will fall below $ 2 billion .
At that point , a psychological floor will have collapsed and the company will be in play .
The company that has the most to gain from buying the New York Times is Google .
If it proffered a Murdoch - like , no-auction bid of $ 4 billion , would n't the Sulzberger family have to accept it ?
Every single class B shareholder would accept the offer .
It 's their only exit .
It is also likely that Times employees and retirees would enthusiastically support the deal ; it 's their only exit as well .
So it would all come down to whether the Sulzberger family ( smaller in number and not as far - flung as the fractious Bancroft clan that owned Dow Jones ) would accept the deal .
The choice for the family would be basically this : double your money or double down on " young Arthur , " as the NYT 's Chairman and CEO is sometimes called .
In the back of their minds , the prospect of doubling down on " young Arthur " could only mean that the company 's stock will continue its relentless decline .
The prospect of doubling up with Google offers realized value , a global platform and thus a much clearer path to future growth .
Everyone would be a lot richer than they are now .
Assuming a cash / stock transaction , some might be a whole lot richer in the future .
I am told by smart people who know the business that the Sulzbergers will never sell ; that their identity is the New York Times .
It 's also said that they take their role as stewards of journalistic " excellence " and " integrity " seriously .
They 're plenty rich as it is , if not as rich as they once were , so it 's not about the money .
It 's about the Statue of Liberty and justice and righteousness , all of which they feel The New York Times embodies .
And I believe that they believe all that .
But as everyone knows , and the Sulzbergers know better than most , the game has changed .
Classified advertising has been gutted by Craig 's List ( and a thousand other web - sites ) .
Department stores have consolidated and newspaper advertising budgets have consequently declined .
The way people access information has fundamentally changed , thanks to the Internet .
On and on it goes .
But perhaps the biggest change is that The New York Times is squarely in the cross-hairs of the aforementioned Rupert Murdoch .
Mr. Murdoch recently acquired Dow Jones for $ 6 billion .
He did not buy Dow Jones because of its growth potential .
It 's a mature business , to say the least .
He did not buy Dow Jones because he sees limitless growth opportunities in financial news and business information .
It 's a crowded field .
He bought Dow Jones so that he could own The Wall Street Journal .
He intends to use The Wall Street Journal as a precision - targeted weapon .
And the target he has locked onto is The New York Times .
The Sulzbergers understand this .
The question they have to ask themselves , knowing that Mr. Murdoch intends to bleed them to death , is this :
Can they afford to engage in this battle without a very deep - pocketed partner or do they sell the New England properties ( The Boston Globe , NESN , The Boston Red Sox stake and the Worcester Star - Telegram ) and use the proceeds to fund the counter - offensive ?
Given " young Arthur 's " tenure as Chairman and CEO of the enterprise , is there any evidence that he would deploy the proceeds from the sale of the New England properties in a manner that would thwart Mr. Murdoch 's siege .
If the answer to the latter question is " no , " then the Sulzberger family 's argument ( that they are the keepers of the flame of journalistic " integrity " and " excellence " ) disintegrates .
You can't keep the flame burning if you do n't have any fuel .
You can't be a national and international newspaper if you do n't have the means to support it .
And from a fiduciary point of view , the Sulzbergers have to accept the fact that Mr. Murdoch 's platform ( News Corp . ) enables him to lose money on the Wall Street Journal without any debilitating consequence .
He really can bleed them to death .
What 's in it for Google ?
Well , for one thing , it 's cheap .
Sell off the New England properties and the real cost is $ 3 billion .
That 's not much money to buy one of the premier brands of the information age .
It also comes with some excellent real estate , which further reduces the risk .
And happily enough , it will probably get cheaper in the coming months .
So the price is definitely right .
Second , Google is embarking on an ambitious mobile platform .
It is buying wireless spectrum and will soon introduce Google Mobile .
In so doing , it is entering into an arena where the established players have hired ( almost ) every lobbyist and ( almost ) every law firm with expertise in telecommunications in Washington , DC and in virtually every state capital .
Owning the New York Times would level that playing field in one fell swoop .
Owning major media outlets is a strategy that has worked very well for General Electric , Disney , News Corp. , Time Warner and others in their dealing with the federal government and with state governments .
There 's every reason to believe it would be helpful to Google .
Third , there 's all that content .
Google is a company that could actually make money repurposing the cultural and culinary coverage , to pick just two categories , of the New York Times , across both its Internet and mobile platforms .
An acquisition of The New York Times would greatly enhance the richness and reach of Google News .
And should Google choose to invest in expanded news and cultural coverage , it could greatly enhance the richness and reach of The New York Times .
Finally , a Google acquisition of the New York Times would allow Kleiner Perkins ( which would likely be assigned the task of finding new management for the paper ) to attract people of great talent to a fascinating and challenging project : the reinvention of a great newspaper across multiple platforms and within a variety of applications .
Even if the project failed , the knowledge gained from the undertaking would make Google a better , smarter , more deft information age company .
The alternative , which is what the Sulzberger family must keep in mind at all times , is a slow , steady slide with a relentless and ruthless competitor attacking at every turn .
Whatever else he does , " young Arthur " is not going to lead The New York Times to greater glory .
He 's had more than enough time to turn things around and no turn around has been forthcoming .
Taking the company private will not work , because then the mission becomes debt service .
The only real hope for the paper is what it could call a " strategic sale , " on mutually agreed upon terms that would enable the Family to say it held up the flame .

Before looking further into these relationships it is necessary to look at the insider trading information that is being ignored by Reuters , The New York Times and other mass media .
It is well documented that the CIA has long monitored such trades  in real time  as potential warnings of terrorist attacks and other economic moves contrary to U.S. interests .
Previous stories in FTW have specifically highlighted the use of Promis software to monitor such trades .
It is necessary to understand only two key financial terms to understand the significance of these trades , selling short and put options .
 Selling Short is the borrowing of stock , selling it at current market prices , but not being required to actually produce the stock for some time .
If the stock falls precipitously after the short contract is entered , the seller can then fulfill the contract by buying the stock after the price has fallen and complete the contract at the pre-crash price .
These contracts often have a window of as long as four months .
 Put Options ,  are contracts giving the buyer the option to sell stocks at a later date .
Purchased at nominal prices of , for example , $ 1.00 per share , they are sold in blocks of 100 shares .
If exercised , they give the holder the option of selling selected stocks at a future date at a price set when the contract is issued .
Thus , for an investment of $ 10,000 it might be possible to tie up 10,000 shares of United or American Airlines at $ 100 per share , and the seller of the option is then obligated to buy them if the option is executed .
If the stock has fallen to $ 50 when the contract matures , the holder of the option can purchase the shares for $ 50 and immediately sell them for $ 100  regardless of where the market then stands .
A call option is the reverse of a put option , which is , in effect , a derivatives bet that the stock price will go up .
A September 21 story by the Israeli Herzliyya International Policy Institute for Counterterrorism , entitled  Black Tuesday : The Worlds Largest Insider Trading Scam ?  documented the following trades connected to the September 11 attacks : - Between September 6 and 7 , the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw purchases of 4,744 put options on United Airlines , but only 396 call options Assuming that 4,000 of the options were bought by people with advance knowledge of the imminent attacks , these insiders  would have profited by almost $ 5 million .
- On September 10 , 4,516 put options on American Airlines were bought on the Chicago exchange , compared to only 748 calls .
Again , there was no news at that point to justify this imbalance ; Again , assuming that 4,000 of these options trades represent insiders ,  they would represent a gain of about $ 4 million .
-
[ The levels of put options purchased above were more than six times higher than normal . ] -
No similar trading in other airlines occurred on the Chicago exchange in the days immediately preceding Black Tuesday .
- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. , which occupied 22 floors of the World Trade Center , saw 2,157 of its October $ 45 put options bought in the three trading days before Black Tuesday ; this compares to an average of 27 contracts per day before September 6 .
Morgan Stanleys share price fell from $ 48.90 to $ 42.50 in the aftermath of the attacks .
Assuming that 2,000 of these options contracts were bought based upon knowledge of the approaching attacks , their purchasers could have profited by at least $ 1.2 million .
Merrill Lynch & Co. , with headquarters near the Twin Towers , saw 12,215 October $ 45 put options bought in the four trading days before the attacks ; the previous average volume in those shares had been 252 contracts per day [ a 1200 % increase ! ] .
When trading resumed , Merrills shares fell from $ 46.88 to $ 41.50 ; assuming that 11,000 option contracts were bought by insiders ,  their profit would have been about $ 5.5 million .
- European regulators are examining trades in Germanys Munich Re , Switzerlands Swiss Re , and AXA of France , all major reinsurers with exposure to the Black Tuesday disaster .
[ FTW Note : AXA also owns more than 25 % of American Airlines stock making the attacks a double whammy  for them . ]
 Investors have yet to collect more than $ 2.5 million in profits they made trading options in the stock of United Airlines before the Sept. 11 , terrorist attacks , according to a source familiar with the trades and market data .
On September 29 , 2001  in a vital story that has gone unnoticed by the major media  the San Francisco Chronicle reported ,  The uncollected money raises suspicions that the investors  whose identities and nationalities have not been made public  had advance knowledge of the strikes . 
They dont dare show up now .
The suspension of trading for four days after the attacks made it impossible to cash - out quickly and claim the prize before investigators started looking .

October series options for UAL Corp. were purchased in highly unusual volumes three trading days before the terrorist attacks for a total outlay of $ 2,070 ; investors bought the option contracts , each representing 100 shares , for 90 cents each .
[ This represents 230,000 shares ] .
Those options are now selling at more than $ 12 each .
There are still 2,313 so - called put options outstanding [ valued at $ 2.77 million and representing 231,300 shares ] according to the Options Clearinghouse Corp .  
The source familiar with the United trades identified Deutsche Bank Alex .
Brown , the American investment banking arm of German giant Deutsche Bank , as the investment bank used to purchase at least some of these options 
This was the operation managed by Krongard until as recently as 1998 .
As reported in other news stories , Deutsche Bank was also the hub of insider trading activity connected to Munich Re. just before the attacks .
CIA , THE BANKS AND THE BROKERS Understanding the interrelationships between CIA and the banking and brokerage world is critical to grasping the already frightening implications of the above revelations .
Lets look at the history of CIA , Wall Street and the big banks by looking at some of the key players in CIA s history .
Clark Clifford  The National Security Act of 1947 was written by Clark Clifford , a Democratic Party powerhouse , former Secretary of Defense , and one - time advisor to President Harry Truman .
In the 1980s , as Chairman of First American Bancshares , Clifford was instrumental in getting the corrupt CIA drug bank BCCI a license to operate on American shores .
His profession : Wall Street lawyer and banker .
John Foster and Allen Dulles 
These two brothers designed  the CIA for Clifford .
Both were active in intelligence operations during WW II .
Allen Dulles was the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland where he met frequently with Nazi leaders and looked after U.S. investments in Germany .
John Foster went on to become Secretary of State under Dwight Eisenhower and Allen went on to serve as CIA Director under Eisenhower and was later fired by JFK .
Their professions : partners in the most powerful - to this day - Wall Street law firm of Sullivan , Cromwell .
Bill Casey  Ronald Reagans CIA
Director and OSS veteran who served as chief wrangler during the Iran - Contra years was , under President Richard Nixon , Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
His profession : Wall Street lawyer and stockbroker .
David Doherty -
The current Vice President of the New York Stock Exchange for enforcement is the retired General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency .
George Herbert Walker Bush  President from 1989 to January 1993 , also served as CIA Director for 13 months from 1976 - 7 .
He is now a paid consultant to the Carlyle Group , the 11th largest defense contractor in the nation , which also shares joint investments with the bin Laden family .
A.B.  Buzzy  Krongard 
The current Executive Director of the Central Intelligence Agency is the former Chairman of the investment bank A.B. Brown and former Vice Chairman of Bankers Trust .
John Deutch -
This retired CIA Director from the Clinton Administration currently sits on the board at Citigroup , the nations second largest bank , which has been repeatedly and overtly involved in the documented laundering of drug money .
This includes Citigroups 2001 purchase of a Mexican bank known to launder drug money , Banamex .
Nora Slatkin 
This retired CIA Executive Director also sits on Citibanks board .
Maurice  Hank Greenburg 
The CEO of AIG insurance , manager of the third largest capital investment pool in the world , was floated as a possible CIA Director in 1995 .
FTW exposed Greenbergs and AIGs long connection to CIA drug trafficking and covert operations in a two - part series that was interrupted just prior to the attacks of September 11 .
AIGs stock has bounced back remarkably well since the attacks .
To read that story , please go to http://www.copvcia.com/stories/part_2.html .
One wonders how much damning evidence is necessary to respond to what is now irrefutable proof that CIA knew about the attacks and did not stop them .
Whatever our government is doing , whatever the CIA is doing , it is clearly NOT in the interests of the American people , especially those who died on September 11 . [�

Dealers get drugs and mobile phones thrown over prison walls
They are raking in tens of thousands of pounds from operations while inside jails .
With a captive market , they can charge fellow inmates more for drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine than they can sell them for on the outside .
In some cases , heroin is 10 times dearer inside prisons than out on the streets .
Dealers are deliberately setting out to get caught for ­relatively minor offences they know will result in a three - month jail term .
Having already set up bank accounts , they smuggle mobile phones into the prison .
Drug-using inmates then call friends and relatives with the account details so they can make cash deposits into the dealer ’s bank .
The dealer is able to use either phone or internet banking via the smuggled mobile to check the money has been deposited .
Once it is in his account , a drug drop is arranged .
A source released from Hull Prison last week told the Daily Express that dealers boast about making more than £ 20,000 during three months in jail .
The 37 - year - old former burglar said : “ The dealers are laughing at the prison officers because they say they can make more in just a couple of weeks than they earn in a whole year .
“ Most use mobile phones but some are so brazen they even use the prison phones which are recorded .
Getting the drugs into jail is no problem .
They are thrown over the wall at designated times , again organised via the mobile phones .
“ If the phones get confiscated , a new one can be delivered in much the same way . ”
The source said prison visitors also bring in large quantities of drugs , often hiding them in the clothing of young child­ren .
A common ploy is to smuggle the drugs inside a baby ’s nappy , as these are not checked by the guards .
Because of the high profits to be made , there is also a strong temptation for prison officers to assist in smuggling in drugs .
The Government said 64 prison officers were investigated for involvement in the trafficking of drugs last year .
No figures were available for how many of these investigations subsequently led to prosecutions .
The source has just completed four - year jail term for burglary and has spent much of the past two decades in prison .
He has never developed a drug problem and is amazed at the scale of the illicit trade .
He said : “ I have been moved between 13 different prisons during this last stretch , all across Britain , and this scam was happening at every prison .
It would be so easy to stop but most of the screws ca n’t be bothered because it would only mean more grief and paperwork for them to do .
“ A prisoner who is an addict is a lot easier to handle if he has got his fix than if he ’s being deprived it .
“ I reckon about 80 per cent of the prisoners I have come into contact with are addicts .
Even if they ’re not smack heads when they go inside , there is so much temptation and boredom once they are banged up that most give in .
“ Proper policing of jails could stop drugs quite quickly but nobody seems to care and that is allowing dealers to flourish ­within the system . ”
Tory justice spokesman Nick Herbert reacted with astonishment at the revelations .
He said : “ These are extraordinary allegations which the Ministry of Justice should investigate without delay .
“ The idea that criminals might actually want to return to prison to conduct criminal activity offends against the fundamental tenet that jails should be secure .

A German scientific research institute is using an open - source database running on Linux and x86 hardware to store global seismic activity data and to interpret that data .
The purpose is to ensure that countries around the world are in compliance with the terms of the nuclear test ban treaty .

The most recent nuclear test to violate the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty ( CTBTO ) was North Korea , in late 2006 .
The world was alerted to the testing thanks to the efforts of monitoring stations around the world , including four stations under the auspices of the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources ( BGR ) .
The CTBTO calls for global monitoring to ensure compliance with the treaty .
Monitoring stations worldwide use infrasound , hydroacoustic and radionuclide technologies .
It also tests for underground movement that is usually associated with earthquakes , called seismic activity , to ensure that no country can get away with secret underground nuclear testing .
The BGR , an official primary seismic monitoring station for the CTBTO , oversees the activities of four seismic monitoring stations ( of about 50 ) , keeping track of all kinds of seismic activity and interpreting the results .
The BGR stores the data in a database used by CTBTO member nations to determine compliance with the terms of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty .
The BGR also monitors natural seismic activity that occurs in conjunction with earthquakes , including the recent 7.9 - magnitude quake that rocked China 's Sichuan Province in May .
The BGR was a longtime Sun SPARC and Solaris customer , using the Ingres database to store data retrieved from instruments that monitor global seismic activity .
" The database is used to store evaluations of seismic waveform data from German stations , and earthquake information from various international geological services , such as the United States Geological Survey , " said Markus Dohmann , BGR geophysicist .
" The database forms the basis for our scientific work in the field of seismology and provides information on current earthquake alerts in Germany , Europe and across the globe .
The Earthquake Monitor System ( ERMOS ) displays this earthquake information in a Web application in the form of epicenter maps . "
The BGR had been running the Ingres database for more than 20 years , Dohmann said , and the institute was happy with its performance .
A highly reliable , stable database is crucial to the BGR .
Its contractual obligation to the CTBTO includes a minimum of 98 percent data availability and uptime , and Dohmann said Ingres worked just fine in that role .
When Ingres released its database as open - source software in 2004 , Dohmann started thinking about the potential benefits of a switch to open source , not only for BGR 's applications , but also for its entire infrastructure .
Dohmann was already familiar with the concept of open - source software since the BGR was using several open - source tools , such as GMT , a free , open - source collection of 60 Unix tools used to manipulate ( x , y ) and ( x , y, z ) data sets and produce Encapsulated PostScript File illustrations , created by the University of Hawaii .
The BGR also uses MapServer , an open - source development environment for building spatially enabled Internet applications , created by developers at the University of Minnesota , and the widely available GNU toolset .
Because of his familiarity with these open - source licensed tools , Dohmann understood the inner workings of the open - source community , and he knew that open - source software was secure and robust enough to do the critical work of around - the - clock seismic activity monitoring .
So when BGR hardware was coming to the end of its lifecycle and needed to be replaced , Dohmann decided that it would be a great idea to move from a proprietary infrastructure to one based on open - source software , and not just for the obvious money - saving reasons .
" An open - source solution offers advantages like flexible installation without being tied down to licenses , " Dohmann said , as well as the ability to commoditize the infrastructure on less - expensive x86 hardware .
After comparing the Ingres open - source database with several other products , including Oracle 's well - known proprietary database , Dohmann was persuaded .
" They all involved higher conversion costs and greater administrative complexity , especially since we needed to convert every single application that accessed the database , " he said .
The result :
In 2007 , BGR undertook a massive migration from a Sun SPARC infrastructure to Linux and Solaris x86 on commodity hardware .
Additionally , BGR moved from Ingres 's proprietary database to its open - source product .
Because BRG was able to keep the same database , the migration was made easier , but it was still a challenge , Dohmann said .
Some problems arose when he and his team had to " adapt around 100 programs in an extremely limited time period . "
The team had to work around the clock , completing the switchover of the entire database system and its respective applications in a single day to ensure the briefest possible downtime for the seismology data center .
Once the transition was complete , Dohmann was happy with the results .
" We not only benefit from the lower cost of ownership attributed to the open - source business model , but from the strong community surrounding open source as well .
The rapid feedback received from the community to queries on specialist topics is a major plus .
In our sector in particular , the reliability and availability of data are decisive criteria . "
Now that Dohmann has weathered the challenges of a successful migration to an open - source infrastructure , he said it 's beneficial to have a good understanding of Linux before making the switch .
" Familiarize yourself with the new operating system and test the installations ... on the new system , " before committing to a complete overhaul , Dohmann offers to other research facilities that may be considering a migration on the scale of the BGR 's transition .
And when moving from Sun hardware to commodity hardware architecture , Dohmann wryly recommended , " Transfer all your data in ASCII format . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The worst flooding in the U.S. Midwest in 15 years sent fresh shocks to global markets and consumers as corn prices hit record highs on devastating crop losses in the heart of the world ’s top grain exporter .
The price of corn at the Chicago Board of Trade soared above $ 8 a bushel for the first time as relentless rains and overflowing rivers raised fears that Midwest farmers will not be able to grow much of anything on as many as 5 million acres
.
“ The market is being driven by water , ” said Glenn Hollander , a veteran grain merchant on the CBOT trading floor .
“ Estimates show 3 million acres of corn under water and probably 2 million did n’t get planted .
So that gets you up to 5 million or over 700 million bushels , and that takes out the entire carry - out , ” he said , referring to estimates for grain stocks carried over to the next crop year .
Overwhelmed river levees across Iowa and Illinois , which produce about a third of U.S. corn and soybeans , have also displaced thousands of people .
Twenty - six people have died since May 25 during storms or tornadoes in flood - stricken Midwest states .
The White House said U.S. President George W. Bush would pay a one - day visit on Thursday .
Dry weather was forecast through Wednesday across the region , allowing some rivers to recede .
But those flows were surging into the Mississippi River , which was expected to rise above 1993 records and test barriers guarding low - lying sections of Burlington , Iowa , and Quincy , Illinois .
Hundreds of National Guard troops and volunteers reinforced levees on Monday on both sides of the Mississippi .
Some of the worst agricultural flooding was in Iowa , where the U.S. Department of Agriculture said 9 percent of the state ’s corn crop and 8 percent of the soybeans were flooded -- some 2 million acres .
“ It ’s not a good start , at all , ” Iowa farmer Donald Miller said from his partly flooded farm near Iowa City .
“ This corn should be knee - high right now and it ’s ankle high , the good stuff is .
The puny stuff , it ’s stunted , and probably will never amount to anything . ”
Saturated , mushy soils suffocated the seedlings , he said .
Many farmers waited for flooded fields to dry out enough for them to decide whether to replant soaked acres .
But yields will be down due to late planting .

The problems add up to more food inflation for not just U.S. domestic consumers but also dozens of countries that buy U.S. grain .
The United States exports 54 percent of the world ’s corn , 36 percent of soybeans and 23 percent of wheat .
STICKER SHOCK
Foreign buyers are scrambling .
Slideshow ( 40 images )
“ They have sticker shock right now .
There are credible people in the trade who think corn will be $ 2 higher in a month .
It could happen .
That would put beans up to $ 20 .
It could happen .
Anything can happen , ” said Rich Feltes , senior vice president and director of MF Global Research .
On Monday morning , the price of corn for delivery in July before next year ’s harvest jumped to a record $ 8.07 a bushel before retreating to close at $ 7.87 , the eighth consecutive day of record prices .
Soybeans for July delivery neared the record of $ 15.96 before closing at $ 15.34 .
Group of Eight finance ministers , meeting in Japan over the weekend , highlighted the threat to the global economy .
“ Elevated commodity prices , especially of oil and food , pose a serious threat to stable growth worldwide , have serious implications for the most vulnerable and may increase global inflationary pressure , ” the ministers said in a communique that did not offer any specific remedies .
The damage to Iowa ’s bridges , highways , roads and railroad tracks is worse than what the state suffered in 1993 .
“ They ’ve lost a lot of bridges and they ’ve lost a lot of track and it ’s affected freight service throughout the state , ” said Dena Gray - Fisher of Iowa ’s Department of Transportation .
Amtrak suspended passenger train service between Chicago and St. Paul , Minnesota , and from Chicago to Denver .
Iowa officials said 36,000 people have been evacuated or forced from their homes in Iowa , and the state ’s losses may exceed the $ 2.1 billion suffered during the epic 1993 flood that triggered huge federal outlays .
In total , the 1993 flood caused 48 deaths and $ 21 billion in damage .
As in 1993 , rebuilding and repairing homes , roads , rail lines , bridges , electrical grids and sewers could boost the region ’s economy , officials said .
“ It will certainly take a long time ” to rebuild , Iowa Gov. Chet Culver said .
There are a lot of bloggers out there aiming to make a living from their blogging ( or at least supplement their main income a bit ) .
In the blogging world , content is king , but there are other factors as well .
One major factor is basic human impatience .
If your blog loads slowly , to a lot of people it might as well be down .
Even if you have good content , they will simply move on elsewhere to a website that loads within a few seconds .
If it ’s your blog they leave behind , the monetization of your blog wo n’t go well .
Since we here at Pingdom run an uptime and web monitoring tools , we figured an article like this could provide some helpful advice to those who , unlike us , do n’t deal with website uptime and performance issues every day or use our page speed monitoring .
Above :
Unlike these cars , your visitors CAN take another route and leave your blog behind .
Negative effects of having a slow blog
Frustrated readers = loss of existing subscribers and returning visitors .
= loss of existing subscribers and returning visitors .
New readers being put off = fewer new subscribers and less returning visitors .

Unhappy advertisers .
If you sell ads , your advertisers will want to know that they are getting their money ’s worth .
Imagine them evaluating your blog when it ’s really slow .
Would you buy ads there ?
That last point directly influences your income , and the other four points contribute to giving you fewer readers .
For the vast majority of monetized blogs , fewer readers will mean fewer clicks on ads and fewer ad impressions , which of course means that you will earn less from your blog than you otherwise would have .
And the worst thing is of course downtime .
If your blog is down often , you may have the bad luck of Google indexing error pages on your blog instead of the real content , and if they come by your blog repeatedly when it is down , your blog may end up being removed from their search index entirely .
And of course , while your blog is down you have ZERO visitors and ZERO ad impressions .
And let ’s face it , downtime just does n’t look good .
What can make my blog slow ?
Shared hosting has a lot of pitfalls when it comes to performance .
It ’s very affordable , but never forget that you are sharing server resources with potentially hundreds of other websites .

This is a luxury problem for a blogger , but if your blog grows in popularity or tends to end up on the front page of Digg a lot , make sure your website can handle the extra load or you will be throwing a lot of that progress down the drain .
Hosting far away from your actual readers .
If your blog has a strong local focus , it can pay off to choose hosting geographically close to your readers .
For example , if your blog is hosted in the US and you have most of your readers in Europe , or vice versa , make sure your hosting provider ’s network has good network peering connections so performance does n’t suffer .
Same thing if you target a world - wide audience .
Make sure your web host performs well from all around the world .
These are just some of the things that can make your blog load slowly .
There are of course a lot of other things that can slow down a website , including the way the website itself is constructed and hosted .
Yahoo has a good collection of advice that you can look into , though some of it may be overkill for a blog ( such as using a CDN ) .
How to stay on top of things
Measure how fast your blog loads and if any specific parts of it are slow .
You can use Yahoo ’s Yslow add - on for Firefox ( it ’s integrated with Firebug ) to measure from your own computer , and Pingdom ’s Full Page Test for a similar web - based test .
If your blog takes more than five seconds to load a page , you are probably losing visitors .

Monitor your general web server performance .

This will let you spot trends and changes in performance , and has the added benefit that you can be alerted if your blog goes down or reports other errors .

Cache for a quicker blog .
Caching can increase your performance by a factor of 100 , and will ( usually ) let you keep your head above the water if the likes of Digg come knocking .
There are plenty of free plugins to for example WordPress that can help you with this .
They key to having good performance to be proactive .
Do your research , use the load - time tests mentioned above , and put in the time to make your blog as fast as possible .
Your existing readers will appreciate it , and you wo n’t drive away new ones .

Several years ago , a friend of mine put two thousand dollars into Owens - Corning stock .
Not long after , he took out his original investment , leaving what he had earned ; a year or so after that , he took out twenty - five hundred dollars of pure profit .
“ I want to do that ! ” I thought , and bought some stock .
It tanked .
What did I do wrong ?
Partly I did n’t research my choices enough ; but mainly , I used my friend ’s experience to decide my actions when I should have thought harder about the numbers involved .
People are much more likely to die in a car crash ( or on a bicycle ) than in a plane crash .
But after 9/11 , more than a million people decided plane travel was too risky , and many of them drove instead of flew–and some of them died .
( See this article on how driving fatalities increased after September 11 , 2001 . )
Most people , if pressed , know that driving is more dangerous than flying .
Most of the people who decided not to fly after 9/11 probably knew this too .
Why did they make the choice they did ?
For the same reason I bought stocks without studying how they were likely to do : the base - rate fallacy .
The base - rate fallacy is a cognitive heuristic , a rule of thumb for making quick judgments .
We use cognitive heuristics for processing information in fast bursts .
This was good for us back when we were living in the wild in small groups , surrounded by threats ; it ’s not as useful now , when we live in modern , safe , diverse civilization .
We have a whole new set of problems .
But cognitive heuristics are hardwired into our brains , and they have n’t caught up with modern times .
The base - rate fallacy means that people do n’t pay real attention to probabilities or base rates–even when they know they ’re important .
Instead , we care about dramatic events , pictures or visceral moments –like seeing a plane crash into the World Trade Center .
One picture is worth a thousand statistics .
In essence , we like faces better than numbers .
This makes sense considering our primate roots : immediate , dramatic events , especially events happening to other people , are important and will probably affect us ; abstract ideas probably will not .
But in today ’s modern life–and especially in the realm of personal finance –it ’s important not to let this fallacy trip you up .
Maybe you just read an article about someone who bought Google as a penny stock and is now a millionaire , but that does n’t mean you should buy penny stocks from Unknown Company X–or that you should put money in the stock market just because your friend did .
The image of being like that millionaire is a pleasing one , but the numbers are against you .
How do you fight the base - rate fallacy ?
Take a moment to think , rather than react , and remember that–adages aside–personal influence will lead you awry more often than statistics will .
If you ’re finding it hard to concentrate on the numbers , try to think about statistics in a visual , relevant way .
You have a 1 in 17 million chance of winning the lottery ?
If you drove through the entire state of Florida and personally saw every person who lived there , only the last person you met would be a lottery winner .

A few months ago I threw together a quick redesign of the Learning jQuery site .
It 's nothing fancy , mind you , but I was itching to retire the thin veil covering the tired old WordPress Kubrick theme , so something had to be done .
Almost immediately upon changing the font - family and font - size of the blog post titles , I noticed a few unsightly widows ( just to clarify , we 're talking about typographical widows .
My mother already suspects me of avoiding her ; I do n't want to add to her anxiety . ;) ) .
Here is an example of one such widow :
See how the last word , " plugin , " appears on its own line ?
According to a couple designerly friends of mine , that 's a no - no .
So , I considered for half a minute how to get that title to look more like this :
The lowly yet lovely non-breaking space ( ) would do the trick , but how to replace it for the regular , breaking space ?
I certainly was n't about to manually edit all of the entries ' titles .
Not only would it take too long , but it would also pollute the markup with something that really should n't be there .
No , what I needed was a little JavaScript .
Selecting the Titles
On this site , entry titles are wrapped in < h2 > < a href = " foo " ></a></h2 > , which can be selected in jQuery with $ ( ' h2 a ' ) .
Easy .
Now , because I want to manipulate the text of each title independently , I 'll need to use the .each ( ) method , which is basically a chainable for loop .
Inside the .each ( ) is where I substitute the last breaking space with the non-breaking variety .
Here are three ways I came up with to achieve this .
Array
The first approach was to convert the title string into an array of words and then stitch the array items back together , dealing with the last one specially .
[ js ] $( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { var h2 Text = '' ; $ ( ' h2 a' ) .each ( function ( ) { var h2 Array = $ ( this ) .text ( ) .split(' ' ) , h2Last = h2Array.pop ( ) ; h2 Text = h2Array.join ( ' ') + ' ' + h2Last ; $ ( this ) .html( h2Text ) ; } ) ; } ) ; [ / js ]
A couple things to note about line 5 above : ( a ) the variable is actually being declared ( with a " var " ) because it 's separated from the previous variable declaration by a comma rather than a statement - ending semicolon .
( b) The JavaScript .pop ( ) array method " pops " the last item off the array and returns it ; so it 's no longer part of h2Array , but its value is stored in the h2 Last variable .
This is especially handy for us , because we do n't want the last word to appear twice .
Line 6 joins the remaining array items with a space between them and then appends the non-breaking space and the popped last item .
Line 7 dumps that concatenated string back into the title , inside < h2 >< a></a></h2 > .
String
The next approach involved working solely with strings , using the slice and lastIndexOf methods to split the the string into two pieces — one leading up to the last space , and one immediately following the last space .
[ js ] $( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { var h2all , h2a , h2 b ; $ ( 'h2 a ' ) .each ( function ( ) { h2 all = $ ( this ) . text ( ) ; h2a = h2all.slice(0 , h2all.lastIndexOf ( ' ' ) ) ; h2 b = ' ' + h2all.slice(h2all.lastIndexOf ( ' ' ) +1 ) ; $ ( this ) .html ( h2a + h2 b ) ; } ) ; } ) ;[/ js ]
As line 7 demonstrates , the two sliced strings are stitched back together to keep the last two words on the same line .
Regular Expression
The final technique is the one I ended up sticking with , partly because it 's the tersest and partly because I have a fondness for regular expressions :
[ js ] $( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { var h2 Text = '' ; $ ( ' h2 a' ) .each ( function ( ) { h2 Text = $ ( this ) . text ( ) .replace ( / ( \w+ ) $ / , ' $ 1 ' ) ; $ ( this ) .html( h2Text ) ; } ) ; } ) ;[ / js ]
The distinguishing feature here is line 4 , which uses the replace regular - expression method .
This method takes two arguments , a pattern to match against and a replacement value .
For the pattern , which appears between the two slashes , we first match a space and then match one or more " word characters " ( letters , numerals , or underscores ) .
The parentheses capture all but that initials space , and the " $ " at the end ensures that the match appears at the end of the string .
The replacement argument starts with the non-breaking space and follows with $ 1 , which refers to the first ( and in our case , only ) parenthetical " capture group . "
( Please forgive me if I 've provided too much detail about the regular expression .
I 'm never quite sure how much of this stuff is worth mentioning , but since this entry is targeting beginners , I suppose it 's better to err on the side of too much . )
By the way , all three of these code examples can be reduced in length quite a bit .
For example , the regular expression example can be pared down from 7 to 5 lines if we do n't bother with the h2 Text variable and instead do something like this :
$ ( this ) .html ( $ ( this ) . text ( ) .replace ( / ( \w + ) $ / , ' $ 1 ' ) ) ;
However , the code is usually easier to read and maintain ( for me , at least ) if the value is first stored in a variable .
Any suggestions for improvement here ?
Any other approaches that you would recommend instead ?

PUTIN , POWER , AND THE NEW RUSSIA
By Marshall I. Goldman
Oxford University Press , $ 27.95 , 256 pages
REVIEWED BY JOSEPH C. GOULDEN
For anyone with knowledge of economic warfare , the opening scene in Marshall I. Goldman ’s new book evokes a shudder .
Russian hosts take him into a darkened room that is the “ brain center ” of Gazprom , the world ’s largest producer of natural gas , in an office building high above Moscow .
“ In front of me , ” Mr. Goldman writes , “ covering the whole 100 - foot wall of the room , was a map with a spiderweblike maze of natural gas pipelines reaching from East Siberia west to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Arctic Ocean south to the Caspian and Black seas .
Manipulating this display were Gazprom dispatchers , three men controlling the flow of Gazprom ’s gas to East and West European consumers of this Russian natural gas monopoly … . ”
With a flick of switch , these dispatchers sitting in this Moscow room could freeze - and have frozen - entire countries .
At the very least , they could send their citizens off in a panic in search of sweaters , scarves and gloves .
What an empowering feeling .
Should they choose to , these Gazprom functionaries could not only cut off natural gas from the furnaces and stoves of Germany ’s houses but also the natural gas that many German factories need for manufacturing a range of products from ammonia fertilizer to plastics .
Now , to be sure , as Gazprom officers told Mr. Goldman for his book , “ Petrostate : Putin , Power , and the New Russia , ” “ politics never , ever affect their calculations . ”
Sure , and your check is in the mail .
The first week in July , Russia sharply curtailed oil exports to the Czech Republic in apparent retaliation for that country ’s agreement to host a radar facility associated with a U.S. anti-missile system .
Mr. Goldman , professor emeritus at Wellesley College , and long associated with the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard , speaks with authority .
He has advised U.S. presidents and the CIA on Soviet and Russian affairs .
“ Petrostate ” documents how President Vladimir Putin used petroleum riches to bring Russia back from near - bankruptcy in 1998 to its current strength in world economic affairs .
As he summarizes , the book “ is a tale of discovery , intrigue , corruption , wealth , misguidance , greed , patronage , nepotism , and power … a little something for everyone . ”
As I read of how Mr. Putin ’s cronies muscled aside competitors to take control of formerly state - owned oil companies , the thought flickered through my mind , “ John D. Rockefeller meet Tony Soprano . ”
As Mr. Goldman notes , Russia has not hesitated in the past to cut off the flow of both petroleum and gas to strengthen its side of a political dispute .
Because of this control over gas , he writes , “ Gazprom and , by extension , the Russian government are already beginning to enjoy a power over their European neighbors far beyond the dreams of the former Romanov czars or the Communist Party general secretaries . ”
Further , the Russian government owns more than 50 percent of Gazprom , and Mr. Putin “ takes a very personal and intense interest in Gazprom ’s operations . ”
Further , Russian influence over the energy industry is expanding far beyond its bounds .
An immediate example : For years , the service station down the hill from my home in Georgetown carried the logo of Getty Petroleum .
The sign out front now says “ Lukoil , ” for another Russian - owned oil company - one of 2,000 former Getty stations it owns on the Eastern seaboard , along with another 1,000 purchased from Mobil .
As Mr. Goldman writes , Lukoil now commands 24 percent of the market in New Jersey and Pennsylvania , and is rapidly expanding elsewhere .
One person who foresaw - and feared - this petroleum dominance was William J. Casey , director of central intelligence during the Reagan years .
Mr. Casey was a very shrewd economic warrior .
Realizing that the USSR relied on oil money to pay its international bills , Mr. Casey met with Saudi Arabian leaders to persuade them to increase their production , with the aim of lessening the demand for Soviet oil .
Soviet oil income did plummet , one of the factors that led to troop withdrawals from Afghanistan , and a free fall into economic chaos .
But by Mr. Goldman ’s analysis ( and he is going to draw some return fire from Casey chums ) the Saudis did not increase production until after the beginning of the Soviet drop , and hence the CIA ’s strategy does not deserve full credit .
Be that as it may , the Reagan administration expended considerable political energy in trying to dissuade Western Europe from becoming dependent on oil and gas imports from the USSR , for the reasons so eloquently described by Mr. Goldman .
The drive ultimately failed , and so we now see the Reagan prophecies becoming reality .
The Putin government cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in the dead of winter toward the end of 2007 in a contract dispute .
Other states once part of the dismantled USSR are feeling similar pressures .
And , as I write , Russian oil moguls are trying to muscle BP out of a joint venture with TNK - BP ( part of the ploy is withholding visas for British managers ) .
And Gazprom just concluded a deal to buy the entire gas output of Libya , what one financial observer termed the first step towards creation of a “ gas OPEC . ”
For we hard - liners who eye the newly powerful Russia with alarm , Mr. Goldman ’s book is a sobering read .
Foreign investors such as BP ( the old British Petroleum ) are increasingly wary of “ partnerships ” with Russian concerns that turn out to be controlled by the government .
One ominous sign is that many of the jokes formerly told about Soviet leaders now target Mr. Putin .
In one , Stalin comes to Mr. Putin in a dream and says , “ Vladimir , I have two bits of advice for you : kill your opponents , and paint the Kremlin blue . ”
Mr. Putin ponders a moment , then asks , “ Why blue ? ”

前書き ( Preface )
この本 はGCの本です。 GCとは、プログラムが利用し終わったヒープ領域を自動的に回収するものです。
昔も今も、メモリは限られた貴重な資源です。
コンピュータの初期、VLSIが現れるまでメモリは高価で、
Unixのような時分割OSでもたった64KBのセグメント1つで動くことが望まれました。 今日、SIMMは比較的安価でインストールも簡単ですが、
プログラムはメモリ資源をますます浪費するようになっています。
MS Windows 95は1ユーザのPC用OSなのに、 快適に利用するには12MB以上のRAMが必要です。 つまり、メモリだけでPCのコストの半分かかるくらいです。
他の大事な資源同様、メモリは注意深く管理し、
不要になったら再利用する必要があります。
多くのプログラムのメモリ要求は単純で予測可能です。
そのようなプログラムのメモリ割り当て・解放は、
プログラマやコンパイラが効率良く行なうことができます。
しかし、非常に大きく複雑になったプログラムもあります。
LispやPrologのような言語では、 複雑に絡み合った大きなデータ構造が良く使われます。
関数型や論理型の言語には複雑な実行パターンがあります。
このため、多くのデータ構造の生存期間は実行時に決定し、
プログラマやコンパイラが決定することはできません。
自動的なメモリの回収が必須です。
GCの重要性の拡大は、 計算機科学コミュニティにおける議論に反映されています。 論文誌や国際会議における論文ばかりか 、
1990 , 1991 , 1993 年 のObject - Oriented Systems , Languages and Applications ( OOPSLA ) ではGCに関するワークショップが開催され、
1992年と1995年に国際ワークショップのトピックになりました。 また、Usenetニュースグループでも良く話題になります。
オブジェクト指向は、今日の分析・設計・プログラミングにおいて
強い関心を集めている分野です。 良いソフトウェア工学の鍵は複雑さを制御することです。
オブジェクト指向はこの目標を達成する方法の1つであり、
明確に定義されたインタフェイスを通じて作用し合う
オブジェクトに抽象をカプセル化するものです。
プログラマによるメモリ管理は、オブジェクト指向のモジュール性を阻害します。 このため 、Smalltalk , Eiffel , Java , Dylanなど ほとんどのモダンなオブジェクト指向言語はGCをサポートしています。 今日では 、Modula-3 やOberonなどシステムプログラミング用の言語さえ このような健全だが実践的な理由からGCをサポートしています。 CやC++など不親切な言語にもGCライブラリが存在します。
本書が対象としている読 者 ( The audience )
GCに関する文献は多い。 GCについて書かれた論文誌の記事、本の章、国際会議の発表、
技術報告書、博士論文は軽く千を越えます。 それなのにGCには多くの迷信が存在します。
「 GCが必要なのはLispと関数型言語だけだ。 インタプリタに必要なだけでコンパイラには要らない。
GCのオーバヘッドは重すぎる。 」 −そう、奴らは馬鹿に違いない！ （奴らって誰？） 2つの帰結が出てきます。
GCは適切に使えるところで無視されがちだった。 データ構造の複雑さが増大しGCが必要なところで 文献からの知識が広まらず、車輪が再発明されてきた。
本書の目的は 、GCに関する経験の蓄積を 単純でとっつきやすい統一的な枠組に組み入れることです。
宣言的・手続き的なプログラミングスタイル、
並行・分散アーキテクチャにおける最先端の技術を説明し比較します。
重要なアルゴリズムは詳細に解説し、 特徴的な機能を図や動作で示します。 アルゴリズムの｛複雑さ、性能、応用性、 関連アルゴリズムとの関係｝も示します。
本書のサーベイ は
大学院生 や
｛コンパイラ構築、関数型・論理型・オブジェクト指向のプログラミング・設計、
ソフトウェア工学、OS｝といった分野の研究者に役立つでしょう。
これらの分野を選択した学部生にも面白いでしょう。
また、単純なツールから複雑なリアルタイムシステムまで
プログラムを開発するプロに読んでもらうことを望みます。
特に、過去数年でオブジェクト指向システムが急速に普及したため、 プログラマにとってGCの理解は必須になりました。
本書の構成 ( Organisation of the book )
第1章はメモリ管理の変革とメモリ自動回収の必要性から始めます。
次にヒープ中のオブジェクトの表現を説明し、
GCの異なる戦略を比較する基準について議論します。
最後に本書の疑似コード表記を説明します。
第2章では3つの古典的なGC ｛参照数え ( reference counting ) 、mark - sweep、copying｝方式を紹介します。 これらの方式を既に知っている読者はこの章をとばして下さい。
次の4つの章では、これらの方式とmark-compact方式を詳細に解説します。
第 7章では世代 ( generational ) GCを紹介します。 世代GCは、GCの硬直時間と 広範なアプリケーションのコストを減らしたパラダイムです。
第8章ではGCとそれ以外の計算を多重化する方法を説明します。
第9、10章では言語コンパイラによるサポートのない環境に
GCを組み入れる方法をそれぞれC、C++について説明します。
第11章では、比較的新しい研究分野である、 GCとハードウェアデータキャッシュの相互作用について議論します。
第12章では分散システムにおけるGCを簡単にサーベイします。
各章の終りにポイントをまとめてあります。 これらのまとめは、GC方式を選ぶために
方式、クライアントプログラム、OS、アーキテクチャについて
疑問を解消するのに役立つでしょう。 これらは読者からの疑問を想定しています。
しかし、まとめは各章を読む代わりにはならず、
答が書いてあるわけではありません。 さらに、前の方の章で紹介するGC方式は後の方の章で参照することになります。
単純な実装の特徴や性能は、同じ方式の最先端の実装を計る参考になります。
これらのまとめが単なるお料理本ではなく、
さらなる分析に役立つことを望みます。
本書に欠けているものも明らかにしておくべきでしょう。
最もコストの低いメモリ管理は、実行時に何もしないことです。
オブジェクトがいつ捨てられ再利用されるかを翻訳時に発見する
研究が大量になされてきました。 ほとんどの研究は理論上のもので、性能向上の証拠はほとんどないと思われます。
したがって、この話題には触れません。
また、言語特有の技術があります。 C++に触れるのはGCを必要とするC++利用者が増え続けているからですが、
一般的に適用できる方式のみ触れます。 純関数型プログラミングや論理型プログラミングなど
特定のプログラミングスタイルに固有の技術は簡単に触れるだけです。
最後に、精力的な研究者はオンラインの文献データベースを眺め回し、 他のGCに関する論文を見つけるでしょう。 本書は批判され、無視され、ゴミの山に埋もれ、
焼かれて、海に投げ込まれるかもしれません。 健全なGCの疑問は上がり続けるでしょう。 言語戦争はまた別のものです！ （分かるような分からないような）
参考文献 とWWW ( The Bibliography and the World - Wide Web )
GCについて千を越える論文があると既に述べました。

はじめに ( Introduction )
「 Lispの最も大きな影響の1つは言語機能ではなかった。 GCと呼ばれる、システムによる自動メモリ管理技術だった。」
Jean E. Sammet
Programming Languages : History and Fundamentals , 1969
ここ十数年でGCの時代がやって来ました。 かつてはLispと関数型言語に限定されていましたが、 今日GCは宣言型だけでなく手続き型のモダンなプログラミング言語の多くでも
メモリ管理システムの重要な位置を占めています。
GCは遅くてプログラムの対話性をぶち壊すという意見がありましたが、 モダンな実装技術はGCのオーバヘッドを大幅に減らし、
Cなど古典的な言語でさえヒープのGCが現実的な選択肢となりました。
最もへぼいコンピュータでもメモリサイズが大きくなっているのに、
メモリを使い切れないということはありません。
他の限られた資源同様、メモリも注意深く保持し再利用する必要があります。
今日多くのプログラミング言語でプログラマがメモリを割り当て・解放し、
プログラム文面上のスコープに縛られない
生存期間を持つデータを扱うことができます。 このようなデータは動的に メモリを割り当てると言います。 動的メモリはプログラマが明示的に管理し、
組み込みまたはライブラリの手続きを呼び出すことによって
メモリを割り当て、不要になったメモリを解放 することができます。 （この本では、動的メモリとはヒープのことであり、
スタックは動的に割り当てるとは言わない。）
手動回収による動的メモリ管理はあまり嬉しくありません。
もう1つの方法は、動的メモリ管理を実行時システムに任せることです。
プログラマはまだ動的メモリ割り当てを要求しなければなりませんが、
そのメモリがいつ不要になるかを決定する必要はなくなります。
不要になったメモリは自動的に再利用されます。
GC とは正に動的メモリ割り当ての自動管理です。 reference counting など直接方式 と tracing など間接方式 を区別したがる人もいます。 しかし 、GCという言葉は広く動的メモリ割り当ての自動管理を指して使われるので、 本書で もreference counting とtracing の両方を指します。 本書で はGCとプログラム の 「本当の」仕事をする部分を区別します。
Dijkstraの用語に従い、ユーザプログラムをmutator と呼びます。 GCに関する限り、mutatorの仕事はヒープ中に生存するデータ構造の
グラフ接続を変更するだけだからです。
本章では3つの疑問に答えます。 GCが解決する問題は何か？ GCのコストはどれくらいか？ 異なるGCアルゴリズムを比較するパラメタは何か？ また、GCの分類を概観し、以降の章で使う表記を説明します。
まず、プログラミング言語とメモリ管理の実装の歴史を
1940年代から現在まで簡単に眺めてみましょう。
1.1 メモリ割り当ての歴史 ( History of storage allocation )
プログラミング言語の発展の歴史は、より一層の抽象化を提供し、
それまで手動で明示的に行なっていた動作を自動化するものでした。
コンピュータの初期、プログラマとマシンはビット単位の
単純な入力スイッチを通してコミュニケーションをとっていました。
間もなく単純な入出力装置が現れ、 オペレータとマシンは16進数で簡単にやりとりできるようになりました。
次の段階でプログラマはニモニックコードを使い、
それを機械的に2進表現に落とせるようになりました。
まだ、ユーザはプログラムの実行の隅々まで責任を負っていました。
例えば、特別な注意を払ってプログラムのワード数を数え、
命令の絶対アドレスを知り、プログラムをロードするスペースがあるかとか
ジャンプ先を特定する必要がありました。
1940 年代後期から1950年代初期までに、この面倒な帳簿つけは マクロコードとアセンブリ言語へと代わりました
[ Metropolis et al. , 1980 ] 。 シンボリックなプログラムは、 アドレスや演算子が数字のコードより意味のある記号コードに変わっており、 機械語プログラムよりも書きやすく理解しやすいものでした。 しかしまだ、プログラマは特定のコンピュータの動作と 機械のどこでどのようにデータを表現するかに密接に関わっていました。 数多くの機械依存の詳細を知らなければ、 アセンブリ言語できちんとプログラミングすることはできませんでした。
これらの問題を解消する高級言語のアイデアは プログラミングを単純にしようとするもので、
1940年代半ばから後期にかけて生まれました。
1952年までに最初の試作コンパイラが現れ、 1957年初めに最初のFortranコンパイラが発表されました。
高級言語のコンパイラは、ターゲットマシンの資源を割り当て、
ユーザプログラムの扱うデータオブジェクトを表現しなければなりません。
メモリ割り当てには3種類の方法があります （静的割り当て→スタック割り当て→ヒープ割り当ての順に
柔軟性とコストが高くなる）。
静的割り当て ( Static allocation )
最も単純な割り当て方針は静的割り当てです。
プログラム中の全ての名前は翻訳時にメモリ中の場所に束縛され、
実行時に束縛が変わることはありません。
このため、手続きの局所変数は手続きが実行される度に同じ場所に束縛されます。 静的割り当てはFortranの最初の実装方針であり、 現在でも例えばFortran 77や並列言語occamに使われています （正誤表より：occamは静的割り当てではない）。
静的割り当てには3つの制限があります。
各データ構造の大きさは翻訳時に分からなければならない。
（ Cの配列 ）
局所名に対して実行の度に同じ場所が使われるため、手続きを再帰できない。
（ Cのstatic）
データ構造を動的に生成することができない。
しかし、静的割り当てには2つの重要な利点があります。
静的割り当て言語の実装は速く、 スタックフレームなどのデータ構造を実行時に生成・破壊する必要がありません。
全てのデータの場所をコンパイラが知っているので、
間接アクセスではなく直接アクセスできます。
また、静的割り当ては安全性を保証します。 必要メモリが分かっているため、 プログラムが実行時に空間不足で失敗することはありません。
スタック割り当て ( Stack allocation )
最初のブロック構造言語は、1958年に現れたAlgol-58とAtlas Autocodeでした。 ブロック構造言語は、スタック上のメモリ割り当てによって
静的割り当ての制約をいくつか解消しました。
手続きが呼び出される度に活性レコード ( activation record ) またはフレーム ( frame ) がシステムスタックにプッシュされ、 手続きから戻る時にポップされます。 スタック構成 は5 つの特徴を持ちます 。
局所名に対して手続き実行の度に同じ束縛が使われることはない。
再帰呼び出しが可能になり、言語の表現力が大幅に向上した。 （←静的割り当て）
配列など局所データ構造の大きさを手続きの引数に応じて決められる。 （ Cでは配列引数はポインタ渡しだし、引数に応じて大きさの決まる
局所配列はヒープに割り当てないといけません。）
スタックに割り当てられた局所名の値が 次回の手続き実行まで残っている保証はない。 ( auto vs static )
呼び出された活性レコードは呼び出し側で生存できない。 （printfなど不定個引数の手続きは呼び出し側が活性レコードを作るが、
アクセスするには低級言語が必要。固定個引数の手続きは
呼び出される側が＝空間効率良く活性レコードを作れる。）
翻訳時に大きさが分かっているオブジェクトしか
手続きの結果として返すことができない。 （→ヒープ割り当て）
ヒープ割り当て ( Heap allocation )
スタック はLIFO 原則なのに対して、 ヒープ中のデータ構造は任意の順序で割り当て・解放できます。
従って、活性レコードと動的データ構造は親手続きの外で生存できます。
ヒープ割り当てには多くの長所があります。
リストやツリーなど、 元来階層的な実世界の問題をモデル化する抽象化に向いている。 ヒープ割り当ては、このような抽象化を再帰によって具体的に表現できる。 ヒープはグラフ（リスト・ツリー含む）の自然な具体表現である。 驚くことに、ヒープ自体もリストで実装される
[ Fujitsu , MetaWare , High C Compiler V1.7 Users ' Manual ]
（ヒープを実装するまで、メモリは配列ないしスタックのインタフェイスしか
持たないので、配列上にリストを実装するやり方でヒープを実装する）。
つまり、明示的なヒープ管理のコストも GCよりずば抜けて安価であるとは言えない。
局所・非局所 データ構造の大きさは不定であり、動的に決定できる。 配列などデータ構造の大きさが組み込みの制限を越えるのは、 プログラムが失敗する最大の要因である （ヒープだと理論的には上限サイズがない） 。
データ構造の大きさは不定であり、動的に決定できる。
配列などデータ構造の大きさが組み込みの制限を越えるのは、
プログラムが失敗する最大の要因である 。 動的に大きさの定まるオブジェクトを手続きの結果として返すことができる。 （←スタック割り当て）
多くのモダンな言語は手続きの結果として手続きを返すことができる。
スタック割り当て言語がこれを可能にするには、
ネスト手続きがあってはならない。 返された手続きの静的アドレスが使われる。
（ネスト手続きを返すには環境、従ってヒープ割り当てが必要。
ネストしていなければ全域環境は省略し、コードのアドレスだけで良い。）
関数型言語や高階手続き型言語ならば、結果の関数は 中断 ( suspension ) または閉包 ( closure ) である。 これは｛関数（コード）と、 環境 ( environment ) （名前から場所への束縛）｝の対である。 つまり、これらの束縛は親関数の外で生存する。 （関数結果の関数は環境を含み、環境はヒープ割り当てが必要。）
今日ほとんどの高級言語はスタックとヒープの両方にメモリ割り当てができます。
Pascal やCなど多くの言語は 伝統的にヒープ上の全てのデータを明示的に管理しました。
C++はこの方針を守り続けている唯一（？）最近の言語です。
関数型、論理型、ほとんどのオブジェクト指向言語は
GCを使って自動的にヒープを管理します。 例え ばScheme , Dylan , ML , Haskell , Miranda , Prolog , Smalltalk , Eiffel , Java , Oberonがあります 。
他の言語として、例え ばModula - 3 は ヒープの明示的・自動的管理の両方を提供しています。
1.2 状態、生存、ポインタ到達可能性 ( State , liveness and pointer reachability )
プログラムが直接操作できる値は、プロセサのレジスタ内、
スタック上（局所変数と一時変数を含む）、大域変数内にあります。 これらの場所は、計算の根 ( roots ) となる ヒープデータへの参照を保持しています。 自動ヒープ管理を行なうには、プログラマが特定の規則に従う必要があります。 ユーザプログラムが動的割り当てデータへアクセスするには、 根を通すか、根からポインタの連鎖をたどらなければなりません。 プログラムは、ヒープの底から勝手なオフセットをとるなどして ヒープ空間にランダムアクセスしてはいけません。 この制限 はGC特有のものではありません。 Pascalなど強く型付けされた言語でもこの規則があります。 Cの明示的なmalloc/free割り当て機構を安全に使うにも、ユーザプログラムが
メモリの割り当てられていない領域にアクセスしない必要があります。 （ GCには制約があるが、安全性のために必要な制約である。）
ヒープ中に割り当てられた個々のデータ片を、 節 ( node ) , cell , object （ 注1 ）とか呼びます。 前述の規則の帰結として、ヒープ中のオブジェクトグラフの生存は ポインタ到達可能性 ( pointer reachability ) によって定義されます。 ヒープ中のオブジェクトが生存しているのは、 オブジェクトのアドレスが根に保持されている場合、 または生存している他のヒープ節が そのオブジェクトを指すポインタを保持している場合です。 もっと形式的に、 → を
「 を指す」関係とします。 任意の節または 根Mと任意のヒープ 節Nについて、 M→NとはMがNへの参照を保持していることです。
ヒープ中の生存節の集合は、この関係下における根からの 遷移的参照閉包 ( transitive referential closure ) です。 即ち、次の集合live の極小集合（ 注2）です 。
live = { N ∈ Nodes | ( ∃r∈Roots . r→N ) ∨ ( ∃ M∈live . M→N ) }
注 1 明らかに最後の言葉はオブジェクト指向的な意味です。
注 2 数学ノート ：Tarskiの定理より、このような極小集合は存在する。
Tarskiの定 理：f がモノトーンな操作である時、 S = f S という形の等式は極小不動点を持つ 。
ただし、この生存ヒープセルの集合は、 実際にプログラムからアクセスされ得るセルの集合の保守的な近似に過ぎません。
｛最適化コンパイラのプログラムテキスト解析やデータフロー解析
によって死亡と確認されるセル｝が含まれるかも知れません。
典型的な例として、手続きの中で使い終わった局所変数、
スタックフレーム中の初期化されないスロット、
（削除するコストを惜しんで）レジスタに残った無効ポインタが含まれます。
この疑問に対する答えは本章の後の方と、 第9章で保守的なGC技術を考慮する時に後述します。
節の生存は直接間接に決定できます。 直接法は各ヒープ節について、 他のヒープ節や根からの全ての参照を記録する必要があります。
最も有名な直接法は、セルを指すポインタの個数 ＝参照数 ( reference count ) をセル自身に保持しておきます。 分散システムの直接法なら、各オブジェクトへの参照を保持した 遠隔プロセサのリストで代替することもできます。 いずれにせよ、これらの記録は mutatorが ヒープ中のグラフ接続を変えるのに合わせて更新しなければなりません。
間接または追跡 ( tracing ) 法は、普通 ユーザプログラムのメモリ要求が失敗する度に生存節の集合を計算し直します。
GC は根から始まり、ポインタをたどって全ての到達可能節を訪れます。 訪れた節は生存していると考えられ、 その他の節が占めるメモリは再利用可能とされます。 十分なメモリが回収できれば、ユーザプログラムは要求を満たされて再開します。
1.3 明示的なヒープ割り当て ( Explicit allocation on the heap )
単純な例 ( A simple example )
伝統的に、ほとんどの手続き型言語はヒープ中のオブジェクトの
割り当て・解放の責任をプログラマに負わせてきました。
Pascalでは、new手続きによってヒープ中のメモリが割り当てられます。 ポインタ変数pがある時、new(p ) は
｛pが指すと宣言された型｝のオブジェクトに新しくメモリを割り当て、
このオブジェクトをpが指すようにします。 このオブジェクトはdispose( p ) を呼び出すことによって解放 されます。 次ページのアルゴリズム1.1のプログラム片は、リスト[ 1,2,3]を作ります。
+--+--+ +--+--+
+--+--+
myList--->|
1 | -+->| 2 | -+->| 3 | /| +--+--+ +--+--+ +--+--+ 図 1.1 アルゴリズム1.1で作られるリスト
ゴミ ( Garbage )
動的に割り当てられたメモリは到達不可能になることがあります。
生存していないが解放されてもいないオブジェクトは ゴミ ( garbage ) と呼ばれます。 解放が明示的な言語では、ゴミは再利用できません。 その空間は洩れて ( leaked ) しまいます。 次ページのアルゴリ ズ
ム1.1のプログラムでリストが作られた後に 次の1行を加えると、メモリリークが発生します（図1.2）。
myList^.next := nil ;
+--+--+ +--+--+
+--+--+
myList--->| 1 | | | 2 | -+->| 3 | /| +--+--+ +--+--+ +--+--+ 図 1.2 myList^.next := nil によってメモリリークが発 生
すると、プログラムはリストの第1要素にしかアクセスできなくなります。
アイテム2と3を保持したメモリはプログラムの到達範囲から外れ、
使うことも回収することもできません。 自動メモリ管理ならアクセス不可能なメモリを回収できます。 それが本書の主題です。 （ Cなどの明示的なヒープ管理ではメモリリークが大問題で、 専用デバッガも常識。）
program pointer ( input , output ) ; type ptr = ^cell ; cell = record value : integer ; next : ptr end ; var myList : ptr ; function Insert ( item : ingeger ; list : ptr ) : ptr ; var temp : ptr ; begin new ( temp ) ; temp^.value := item ; temp^.next := list ; Insert := temp end ; begin myList := Insert ( 1 , Insert ( 2 , Insert ( 3,nil ) ) ) (* ; myList^.next := nil --- 第2,3要素が到達不可能になる *) end . アルゴリズ ム1.1 Pascalによるリストの動的割り当て
宙ぶら参照 ( Dangling references )
まだ参照されているメモリが解放されてしまうこともあります。
アルゴリズム1.1に次の1行を加えてアイテム2をヒープマネジャに返してしまいます。
dispose( myList^.next ) ;
+--+--+ -- -- +--+--+ myList--->|
1 | -+->| | +- | 3 | /| +--+--+ -- -- +--+--+ 図 1.3 dispose( myList^.next ) によってメモリリークと宙ぶらポインタが発生
プログラムは解放されたメモリに触れる権利を持ちません。
従って、帳簿情報の保持と再利用はヒープマネジャの仕事です。
プログラムが宙ぶら参照をたどると、良くて即座にクラッシュします
（情報を破壊しつつ動き続けるよりはマシ）。
ヒープマネジャが解放されたメモリをプログラム中の他のデータ構造に割り当てると、
1つの場所が2つの異なるオブジェクトを表すことになります。
運が良ければ、プログラムはいつかクラッシュするでしょう。
運が悪ければ、プログラムは動き続け、間違った結果を吐き出します。
共有 ( Sharing )
ゴミと宙ぶら参照は、明示割り当ての裏表です。
ゴミができるのは、オブジェクトが解放される前に参照がなくなる場合です。
宙ぶら参照ができるのは、参照の残っているオブジェクトが解放される場合です。
参照を壊すのと同時に参照先を解放すれば両方の問題を解消できます。
しかし、共有があるのでこれは簡単ではありません
（単一参照が保証されていれば簡単）。
2つのリストが尾を共有しているものとします（図1.4）。 行儀の良いリスト解放ルーチンは、リストの先頭を指すポインタが壊れた時
リストの各アイテムを再帰的に解放するものでしょう。 しかし、catかmatのどちらかがこのように破壊されると、
他方はアイテム1つと宙ぶらポインタになってしまいます。
この問題は1950年代後期の自動メモリ回収技術の焦点となりました
[ McCarthy , 1981 ] 。
+--+--+ +--+--+ +--+--+ cat--->| c| -+--+->| a| -+->| t| /| +--+--+ | +--+--+ +--+--+ | +--+--+ | mat--->| m| -+--+ +--+--+ 図 1.4 2つのリストが尾を共有することもある。 mat := Insert ( 'm ' , cat^.next ) ;
故障 ( Failures )
複雑なプログラムの動的メモリを正しく管理して
明示的に割り当て・解放するのは難しく、 プログラム故障の大きな要因となります。 プログラムは予期せずクラッシュし、 サーバは良く分からない理由でメモリ範囲を越えます。
このようなプログラミングエラーの結果は、
特にマルチスレッド環境では、不確定です。
ヒープマネジャがこのようなオブジェクトを再割り当てしなければ、
宙ぶら参照は無害です。 テストや通常使用では現れないメモリリークも起こるかも知れません。
故障は普通、プログラムがストレス状態にあったり
長期間動き続けていたりする時の表層に過ぎません。
例えば、コンパイラへの入力が機械生成され、
プログラマが正しく書くと期待されているような
コードの形式を破っているかも知れません。
開発マシンでコードが実行されても、 メモリリークは気づかれないで残るかも知れません。
しかし、メモリの少ないマシンや長期間動き続けるサーバで実行されると、
そのコードはメモリを使い果たします。 このような状況下でのデバッグは難しく、 故障には再現性がありません。
1.4 なぜGC か ？ ( Why garbage collect ? )
言語の要求 ( Language requirements )
GCは必須だったり単に要望が強かったりします。 言語の要求かも知れません。 データ構造が親手続きよりも長く生き伸びるには、ヒープ割り当てが必要です。
これらのデータ構造は別の手続きや関数に渡され、
安全に解放できる点をプログラマやコンパイラは決められないことがあります。
共有や｛中断の遅延実行｝があるので、 特に関数型言語では実行順序が予測不可能であるのが普通です。
GCは必須です。
問題の要求 ( Problem requirements )
GCが問題の要求であることもあります。 [ Boehm and Chase , 1992 ] には分かりやすい説明があります。 汎用スタックデータ型 をCのリストで実装するものとします。 スタックの各ノードはdataとnextとい
う2つのポインタフィールドを持ちます。
Pop操作はスタックの先 頭firstを解放し、 スタックの続きを指すポインタを返します。 この時 、Popは先頭の要素first->dataを解放すべきでしょうか？ そのデータが静的に割り当てられていた場合、答えはNOです。 動的割り当てでそのデータへの参照が他になければ、答えはYESです。
そのデータが複数のスタックにプッシュされていたら（図1.5）、答えは何でしょう。
これほど単純な場合でも、解放に関する規約が必要です。
応用性を減じてスタックのインタフェイスを複雑化するか （ GCの実装と同じ手間） 、 不要なコピーを行なって解放を局所的なものにするか （単一参照の保証 vs GC）になります。
ソフトウェア工学的な問題 ( Software engineering issues )
ソフトウェア工学は、大規模ソフトウェアシステムの複雑性を管理するのに
最も明解な答を出します。 ソフトウェア技術者の持つ最も強力な2つのツールは、抽象化とモジュール化です。
明示的なメモリ管理はこの原則を妨げるものと私たちは固く信じています。
自動メモリ管理は抽象化を後押しします。 メモリ割り当てモデルが高級になり、 プログラマは帳簿つけの負担を負わずに済みます。
プログラマは高級な設計の詳細や問題の実装に時間を使えるでしょう。
また、実行時システムによるメモリ管理は、
高級言語の静的・スタック割り当てに適合しています。
このような低級な問題の抽象化は、 大域的・スコープ付きのデータに本質的な問題として
高級言語の設計者に広く認識されています。
大域データをどこに置くかとか、 スタック上の手続き活性フレームをどのように用意・始末するかを
プログラマが気にする必要はありません。
複雑なプログラムのヒープ割り当てデータにも
このような抽象化を適用すべきだと私たちは信じています
（静的・スタック割り当ては既に抽象化されているのだから、
ヒープ割り当ても抽象化すべき）。
信頼できるコードは理解できるコードです。 モジュールレベルで言うと、プログラマはモジュールの振舞いを理解するのに
そのモジュールだけ、あるいは最悪でも近傍のモジュールを調べれば済むべきです。
プログラム全体を理解しなければモジュール1つ開発できないのでは困ります。
複数の開発チームが参加するような大規模プロジェクトでは、
この条件が本質的なのは明らかです。 対照的に、明示割り当てではあるモジュールのメモリリークによって
他のモジュールが故障する可能性があります。
モジュールの振舞いは使用される文脈に依存してしまいます。
良く引用される目標として、 ソフトウェア部品をハードウェア部品のように組み合わせるには、
インタフェイスが単純できちんと定義されている必要があります。
拡張可能なモジュールは簡単に他のモジュールと組み合わせられるでしょう。
違う言葉で言えば再利用可能なモジュールです。
また、組み合わせられるモジュールが増えるにつれて
プログラムの保守が容易になります。 Meyerの提案によると、モジュールはなるべく少数のモジュールを相手に、
なるべく少量の情報をやりとりすべきです
[ Meyer , 1988 ] 。 Wilsonの正しい観察によると 「 生存性は大域的な 属性」です [ Wilson , 1994 ] 。 帳簿つけの詳細をモジュールのインタフェイスに含めると、
モジュールの抽象性と拡張性が弱くなります。 モジュール機能の変更はメモリ管理コードの変更を伴うかも知れません。 生存性は非局所的な性質なので、 帳簿つけコードの変更は開発されるモジュールの外部に及ぶでしょう。
大域的で明示的な動的メモリ管理は、 段階的詳細化による階層設計から作られたモノリシックなシステムでは
効率的で妥当かも知れませんが、 オブジェクト指向の哲学から外れています。
これは通信最小の原理に反し、インタフェイスを混乱させます。
オブジェクトが異なる文脈で再利用されると、
新しい文脈はこれらを組み合わせる規則を知らなければなりませんが、
これではオブジェクトの組み合わせの自由度が低くなります。 ある著者によると、 複雑なシステムにおけるメモリ管理の問題はGCがなければ、 正しくメモリ管理を行なうよう設計されたプログラムの最大の
目標となる でしょう [ Nagle , 1995 ] 。 一方 GCは、メモリ管理の問題とクラスのインタフェイスを切り離し、
メモリ管理コードが散らばるのを防ぎます。 このため、GCは多くのオブジェクト指向言語の基本部分となっているのです。
（明示的なメモリ管理のテスト・デバッグのコストは高い。）
メモリ管理の問題の広がりを示すものとして、
ヒープメモリ利用の正当性を検証するツールの隆盛があります。 最も有名な例はCenterLine [ CenterLine , 1992 ] とPurify [ Purify , 1992 ] です。 この種のツールが出回っているのは、 正しいメモリ管理の重要性と難しさを示しています。 しかし、これらのツールは実践的にデバッグに役立つだけであり、 プログラム実行時に無視できないオーバヘッドがかかります
（ CenterLineインタプリタでは50 倍 、 Purifyリンク時ライブラリでは2から4 倍 [ Ellis , 1993 ] ）。 これらのツールはプログラミングエラーを追跡するのにとても役立ちますが、 問題の本質を指し示してくれる訳ではありません。 デバッグツールは複雑なシステムのインタフェイスを単純化したり、 ソフトウェア部品の再利用性を高めてくれたりはしません。 メモリリークや宙ぶら参照を見つけた後に、 労力をかけて｛実装を、あるいは悪くすると設計から｝直さなければなりません。 デバッグツールは病巣ではなく症状に立ち向かっているのです。
一 方GCは効果的なソフトウェア工学ツールであり、 メモリ管理エラーが起こらないことを保証することによって プログラマをエラーの発見作業から解放します。
Rovnerの労作によると、 開発時間の大きな部分がメモリ管理のバグに費やされます
[ Rovner , 1985 ] 。 その概算によると 、 Mesaシステムの開発時間の40%がメモリ管理に費やされました（注3）。
今日、オブジェクト指向言語はますます使われるようになっています。
これらの言語で書かれたプログラムは、伝統的な手続き型言語に比べて
多くのデータをヒープに割り当てます。 オブジェクト指向プログラムの生むデータ構造と問題はしばしば複雑です。
これらの要因がますます明示的なメモリ管理を難しくしています。
注 3 開発時間に占めるメモリ管理バグのコストについてはさらなる研究が必要である。
設計者とプログラマは、明示的な動的メモリ管理の複雑さを克服するのに
過剰防衛的な傾向があります。 データを静的に割り当て、モジュール間で共有する代わりにコピーし、
モジュール毎にそのコピーを破壊・解放することによって、
大域的な生存性を局所的に変換します。 不要なコピーと静的割り当ては良くても必要メモリの見積りを高くし、
空間を浪費することになります。 悪ければ静的上限の設定が不十分でプログラムが故障します。
良く採られる選択肢は、領域特有のGCを作ることです。 しかし、領域特有のGCが進んだGC技術に勝ることは多くありません。
応用性が限られているので、 幅広い応用によって開発コストを償却することができません。
このため、テストも十分に行なわれません。
Wilsonによると、これら不十分なGCが多いことは GCの重要性を明らかにしています [ Wilson , 1994 ] 。 GC は 「ネジ止め」ではなくシステムの一部であるべきです。
万能薬ではな い ( No silver bullet )
GCはあらゆる言語のあらゆる問題を解決する訳ではありません。
動的割り当てが単純なプログラムは、 明示割り当ての方が実行時のコストが低いかも知れません（注4）。
しかし、複雑なプログラム中に再利用される
単純な問題を解決することに傾注しましょう。
短期的な利益は長期的にはコストをもたらすかもしれません。 問題の性質はGCでは解決できないものかも知れません。
厳しいリアルタイムシステムでは、 メモリ要求や消費時間の上限を保証する必要があります。
厳しいリアルタイムプログラミングにおけるGCの問題は、 まだ特殊なハードウェアを使わなければなりません。
注 4 必ずしもそうであるとは限らないが。
また、GCはあらゆるメモリ管理の問題を解決する訳でもありません。
GCには時間と空間とのコストがかかり、次の2つの節でそれを紹介します。 さらに、GCは明示的なメモリ割り当ての2つの古典的なバグ
＝宙ぶらポインタとメモリリークを排除できますが、
他のエラーには弱く、またGC特有のデバッグ問題も現れます。
GCは、際限なく増殖するデータ構造の問題を解決しません。
Detlefs とKalsowの報告によると、 このようなデータ構造は「 驚くほど多く」、
例えば再計算を避けてキャッシュされる中間結果などがあります
[ Detlefs and Kalsow , 1995 ] 。 このような増殖はテスト段階や短期間の使用では無害で、 プログラムはメモリを使い切る前に正常終了します。 しかし、長期間動くサーバにこのコードが使われると、 問題は大きくなりプログラムはクラッシュします。
前述したように、GCの最大の利点は抽象化をサポートし、
ソフトウェア部品のインタフェイスを単純化することです。
不幸なことに、オブジェクトの具体表現がヒープデータを参照しているのに
抽象表現がそうでない場合、この抽象化は別のエラーの源を隠してしまいます。
最もありそうな例は、ヒープ割り当てデータへの参照のスタックが
配列として実装される場合です。
Popは何をすべきでしょうか？ スタックの抽象表現に従えば、 スタックトップが指すヒープオブジェクトへの参照を返し、 スタックポインタをデクリメントするでしょう。 しかし、これだとヒープデータは、スタックの具体表現である 配列からアクセス可能なまま残ってしまいます（図1.6）。 安全な解によるPopは、ヒープデータへの参照を返す前に
スタックトップにあるポインタをnullにすべきです。
図 1.6 抽象表現では残らない参照が具体表現には残る場合がある （影つきの配列要素）。
tracing GCは、プログラムスタックを含む計算の根から ポインタをたどって生存データを識別します。
不幸なことに、スタックは無効なポインタで汚染されていることがあります。
無効なポインタを追跡すると、メモリリークが起きます
（スタックに無効なポインタが残っていると、
ゴミが生存データと見なされ、GCされない）。
スタックフレームの汚染を防ぐ1つの手段は、
局所変数を使い終わったらnullにしておくことです。
しかし、フレームの死亡後に無効なデータが 別のフレームに残るかもしれません。 手続 きAが手続きB , Cをこの順に呼び、 Bはスタックフレーム中にヒープデータを指すポインタxを持つものとします。 フレームの始末は高価なので 、Bがフレームを始末せずに終了し、 そし てCがスタックフレームにxと重なる作業空間を予約し、 この作業空間が初期化されないと、ヒープオブジェクトは再び到達可能になります。 復活！ この問題は保守的
なGC実装者に広く知られていますが（第9章）、 DetlefsとKalsowの指摘によると、xは全く正しいポインタであり もっと根の深い問題です [ Detlefs and Kalsow , 1995 ] 。 通常、xを保持する作業空間は次の収集までに使われるので、 この種のエラーはそれほど深刻ではありません。 しかし 、Detlefs とKalsowによると、マルチスレッド環境は特に
スタックフレーム汚染によるメモリリークに弱く、 前述の例で言うとCを実行中のスレッドがブロックされ、 xが上書きされるまでに収集が行なわれる可能性があります。 （xの参照先が到達可能とされた後、 xが上書きされてメモリリークが発生。 だが、その次のGCで回収されるのでは？）
DetlefsとKalsowの作ったツールは、 Modula-3プログラムにおけるこの問題を検査するものです。
Modula-3は強く型付けされた言語であり、 各ヒープオブジェクトに型がタグ付けされます。
そのツールはヒープ割り当ての型を見たり、ヒープ利用状況の型と 呼び出しサイト（ubiquitousな型があるので）を見たりできます。
また、プログラマは選択した1つの根から到達可能なオブジェクトを識別したり、
あるオブジェクトが到達不可能であることを言明したりできます。
言明が偽の場合、ツールは根からそのオブジェクトへのパスを表示します。
1.5 GCのコスト ( How costly is garbage collection ? )
GCはプログラム実行に大きなオーバヘッドをかけるという意見があります。
過去、この意見が正しいアプリケーションもありましたが、
そのコストはシステムに強く依存していました。
例えば1970年代から1980年代初期にかけての研究によると、 大きなLispプログラムは実行時間の40%までGCが占めていました [ Steele , 1975 ; Foderaro and Fateman , 1981 ; Gabriel , 1985 ] 。 比較できる場合 、GC付きの言語で書かれたプログラムは
伝統的な言語で書かれた同等プログラムよりも遅いのが普通でした。
GCは明らかな槍玉にあげられました。 しかし、これらの言語の実装が遅いのはGC以外の理由も多く、 引数渡しの仕組みが非効率であったり、 高階関数や式の遅延評価をサポートしているせいであったりしました。
モダンな技術はGCのオーバヘッドを大幅に減らし、
Modula-2+やModula-3などシステムプログラミング用の言語さえ
GCをサポートするようになりました。 自動メモリ管理のコストはアプリケーションや言語に強く依存しており、
そのオーバヘッドを単純に計算することはできません。
例えばインタープリタでは同じ言語の高度な最適化コンパイラに比べて、
実行時間全体に占めるGCのオーバヘッドは小さくなります。
テストプログラムの形式（例えば関数型のスタイルで書かれているか）や
言語実装の詳細（例えば手続き活性レコードがヒープとスタックの
どちらに割り当てられるか）にも影響を受けます。
オブジェクトの生存期間や大きさの分布などにも影響を受けます。
また、空間と時間のトレードオフも普通です。 GCの頻度が高いと、回収できるメモリ量は少なくなるでしょう。
これらの条件を考えて、GCの実行時間は数%から20%程度になります。
平均して、きちんと実装されたシステムで10%と言えるでしょう
[ Wilson , 1994 ] 。 しかし、GCのオーバヘッドに関する単純な数字は 用心して受け取る必要があります。
1.6 GCアルゴリズムの比較 ( Comparing garbage collection algorithms )
異なるGCアルゴリズムの比較は、原理的にも実践的にも難しいことです。
アルゴリズムの複雑さの公式は決定できますが、
定数や実装の詳細が実際の性能に大きな影響を与えるからです。 本書では異なるGC技術を幅広くサーベイします。
GCが要する時間と空間のコストで最も分かりやすいのは、セルの回収です。
しかし、これは唯一の要因ではありません。
割り当てコストも同じくらい重要です。 効率的な回収アルゴリズムも、新しいセルの割り当てが高価だと非効率です。
ポインタの読み書きなどユーザプログラムの操作に税を課す アルゴリズムもあります（例えばreference counting）。
GCの間、ユーザプログラムは中断するかも知れません。
特定クラスのアプリケーションではGCの遅延が重要になります。
困ったことに、これらは独立なパラメタではありません。
さらに、異なる文献の結果は異なるマシン、 異なるCPU、異なるOSで採られたものです。 アルゴリズムの実装法は、 全体の性能にデリケートな予期しない影響を及ぼします。
回収サイクルの実行時間は、ヒープ中の生存データの
トポロジーや量に依存する部分があります。
単純にヒープの大きさやオブジェクトのレイアウトを少し変更するだけで、
回収の間隔が変わり、従って生存グラフも変わってしまいます。
データへのアクセスパターンが変われば、
ディスク・メインメモリ・キャッシュへのアクセスも変わります。
グラフの渡り歩き・コピーの順序は、仮想メモリの振舞いに影響を与えます。
設計における1つの選択の影響を議論するには、
「 他の全ての要因は等しい」ことが望ましいのですが、
現実的にはそんなことはほとんどありません。
しかし、GCアルゴリズムを選択する時に考慮すべき原則は考えられます。
★ GCは安全 ( safe ) でなければなりません。 生存データが誤って回収されるようなことがあってはいけません。 しかし、ある種 のGCはポインタ到達可能性の不変条件を無視する 過激な最適化コンパイラと競合する危険があります。 このことは第9章の保守的 なGCのところで議論します。 ★ GCは包括的 ( comprehensive ) であるべきです。 ゴミは回収されずヒープ中に残るべきではありません。 しかし 、GC方式によって包括的な回収のアプローチはさまざまです。 reference counting に基づ くGCのほとんどは、 ループを成すデータ構造のゴミを回収できません。
ヒープ全体からの回収ではなく、 1回の回収サイクルで1つの領域に集中するGCもあります。 他の領域がいつ・どれくらいのコストで回収されるのか
というのは当然の疑問です。
また、回収サイクルはクライアントプログラムの実行と
多重化されているかも知れません。 最も包括的なGCの方針は、回収が完了するまでにゴミになった
全てのデータをそのサイクルのうちに回収するものです。
しかし、この方針を実装するのは高くつきます。
このようなデータは次のサイクルで回収する と制限を緩めて良いでしょう。
プログラマはプログラム実行中のGCのオーバヘッドを知りたいでしょう。
1つ考えられるのは、そのプログラムのGCに費やされる全体の時間です。
対話的なプログラムでは、GCの間ユーザプログラムが中断するか、
中断時間がどれくらいかも重要です。 ヒープの領域毎に回収が可能なら、1つの領域を回収する硬直時間は
ヒープ全体の回収時間より短いでしょう。 一部・全体の相対的な回収頻度も重要です。
漸次 ( incremental ) GCは、GC中もmutatorを中断させません。
しかし、回収サイクルの始めにGCを初期化するため、短い中断が必要です。
例えば、プログラムの状態の「スナップショット」を撮って、 根を調べる必要があります。
並行でない漸次GCは、回収アルゴリズムの各段階で 少量の仕事を行なう時にもmutatorを少し中断するでしょう。
この仕事量は、1つの節の処理から仮想メモリ1ページのスキャンまで様々です。
漸次GCのもう1つの要素は、 回収サイクルが終了したかどうか決定するコストです。 これはmutatorの中断に必要です。
GC全体の時間と中断時間以外にも考慮すべき時間要素があります。
対話的なリアルタイムの反応には、中断時間の上限だけでは不十分です。 mutatorの満足な進捗のためには、どんな間隔でも
GCに費やす時間の割合が一定であることも重要です。 （バッチ処理vs時分割処理。 任意の時間をとると、GCにかかる時間が全体に比例していること。）
ヒープ中に新しいデータを割り当てるコストも、
ゴミを回収する時間と同じくらい重要です。
一般に、分断されたヒープの割り当てはまとまったヒープより高価で、
新しいオブジェクトが収まる大きさのフリーメモリを探し回る必要があります。
全てのデータが同じ固定サイズの場合、 不定サイズのオブジェクトを割り当てるよりも簡単です。
分断されたヒープ中に可変サイズのデータを割り当てる問題はGC特有ではなく、 明示的・自動的な全てのヒープ管理システムに共通のものです。
自動メモリ管理は、ポインタ書き込みなどmutatorの操作に 直接オーバヘッドを課すことがあります。
最も単純 なreference countingシステムは、 ヒープセルを指すポインタが生成・消滅する度に
セル参照数を更新する必要があります。 もう少し賢いGCでは、このオーバヘッドを削減するために
参照数の不変条件を緩めています。
漸次世代GCではヒープの回収を部分的に実行できます。 漸次GCは普通、回収サイクルが始まる前に出たゴミは そのサイクルで回収することを保証しています。 一方、世代GCは各サイクルでヒープの一部 ＝ 1世代 ( generation ) だけ回収します。 いずれもmutatorに時間のオーバヘッドを課します。
漸次GCは、GC中のグラフ接続の変更をmutatorに報告させます。 世代GCは、他の（普通は古い）世代から その世代のセルへの全ての参照をmutatorに記録させます。
GCの役割は普通、mutatorがヒープを使い果たした時に メモリを回収することです。 しかし、GCは独自の目的で追加メモリを要求し、
空間オーバヘッドが必要だと考えるかも知れません。
GCはヒープ中のセルに参照数やマークビットを付け、セルの生存や （移動GCなら）そのセルの新しいアドレスを記録するかも知れません。 また、GCは｛そのセルに格納された全てのポインタの場所｝が
分かる情報を必要とするかも知れません （もっとも、この情報はmutatorも必要とすることが多く、 その場合はGCのオーバヘッドではありません）。
（そのセルに格納された＊ことのある＊全てのポインタ？
それともコンスの2つのポインタ？） （ポインタ値のハッシュみたいなものか？ 参照先がどの世代かとか。）
また、GCはヒープデータ構造の渡り歩きスタックなど 固有の追加データ構造を使うかも知れません。 copying GCは移動なしのGCに比べて余分なアドレス空間を要し、
現在ヒープの占めるメモリ領域から全ての生存データを拾い集めて
新しい領域にコンパクトにコピーします。 ヒープのレイアウトと回収戦略のため、 copying GCは移動しないGCの2倍までのアドレス空間を必要とします。
GCアルゴリズムのコストは、ヒープサイズや生存データの量
に対する割合など複雑さの単純な分析だけでは分かりません。
複雑さの公式中の定数も重要です。
同様に、割り当て・回収を実行する命令の個数を数えても完全な答えは出ません。
プログラム中の参照の局所性は重要な影響があります。
最近の研究によると、異なる種類のGCは
仮想メモリでもデータキャッシュレベルでも異なる性能を持ちます。
GCの振舞いは両方のレベルでチューンすることができます。 特に、CPUが頑張れば仮想メモリ環境におけるページングを削減できます。
もっと嬉しいことに、GCを使うことによって mutatorの参照の局所性を高め、性能を上げることができます。
プログラムのヒープ占有率 ( residency ) は普通、定数ではありません。 回収アルゴリズムは占有率に影響するかも知れないし、 しないかも知れません。 参照 数GCでは占有率は問題になりませんが、 追跡GCではヒープ占有率が高いほど回収頻度が高くなるでしょう （mutatorのメモリ要求例外が多くなるので）。 占有率が上がるにつれてメモリ管理システムの性能が下がらないことが重要です。
最後に、GCアルゴリズムは一般的な目的であるかも知れません。
その応用性はある種のプログラミング言語、例えば純関数型言語や
論理型言語に束縛されているかも知れません。
あるいは、ある種のプログラミングイディオムに縛られ、例えば
ループを成すデータ構造の作成やアクセスが制限されるかも知れません。
これらの要素の多くは互いに関係しています。 時間と空間のトレードオフは計算機科学に共通のものであり、
異なるアプリケーションは異なる要素の優先度を望むでしょう。例えば、
対話的なアプリケーションは短い中断時間を選び、
非対話的なアプリケーションは全体の実行時間を短くしたがるでしょう。
リアルタイムアプリケーションは、中断時間の上限も 任意の期間にGCが費やす時間の割合も低いことを望むでしょう。
ワークステーションでは仮想メモリで動くプログラムの
ページングの振舞いが良いことは重要ですが、
小さなPCや組み込みシステムで動くアプリケーションでは メモリのオーバヘッドが小さいことが大きな関心事になります。
異なるアーキテクチャ・コンパイラ・アプリケーションプログラム に対するGCの移植性も、考慮すべき重要な点です。
他の設計と同様に、保守の容易さも重視すべきです。 コンパイラに密接に結び付いたreference countingなどのメモリ管理は、 もっと単純なインタフェイスを持つ追跡GCなどに比べて保守が大変です。
本書では、このような制約のトレードオフを考慮して 提案された方式を比較します。 どのGC戦略を使うかという疑問に本書が「答え」を出すのではなく、
正しい疑問を見分け、提案されたアプローチを検証するのに
本書が役立つことを望みます。 GC のスローガンは、 「 自分のシステムの要求を知り、 生成されるデータの性質＝量・型・トポロジー・生存期間を理解しよう 」 というものです。 これはGC独自の提案ではありません。 明示割り当てでも言えることです。 明らかに、明示的なメモリ管理を行なうプログラムの性能は、
割り当てられるプログラムの振舞いと利用する割り当て器
の両方を良く理解することによって改善できることが多いのです
[ Zorn , 1993 ; Wilson et al. , 1995 ] 。
まとめると 、GC は ソフトウェア技術者に有用なツールであることを述べました。
GC はある種の問題やプログラミングスタイルに必須であり、
少なくとも他の選択肢に比べて現実的であると私たちは信じています。
GC付きのシステムを経験すれば、 GCが開発時間を削減してくれると分かるでしょう。
少なくとも明示的なメモリ管理と並ぶ選択肢として考慮する価値はあります。
メモリ管理のバグを追う開発時間を、 もっと有益な性能や機能を向上する他の部分に集中できるのですから。
1.7 表記 ( Notation )
本章の最後として、本書の残りで前提とするヒープの仕組みと
ヒープ中のオブジェクトのレイアウトについて説明します。
GCアルゴリズムの説明に使う疑似コードの表記も説明します。
ヒープ ( The heap )
ヒープは連続したワードの配列かも知れないし、
不連続なブロックの集合からなるかも知れません。
ヒープ中のユーザデータはセル、節、 オブジェクト とか呼ばれます。 明らかに、最後の言葉はオブジェクト指向的な意味です
（ 2度も言ってる）。 1つのセルは連続したバイトかワードの配列で、 fields に分かれています （コンスに限らない） 。
1つのフィールドはポインタ値か非ポインタ値を持ちます。 非ポインタ値を持つフィールドはatomic です。 これを敷衍して、ポインタフィールドを持たないオブジェクト はアトムと呼ばれます。 プログラムのそれぞれの根から到達可能なヒープデータは、 ｛データセルを節に、ヒープオブジェクトへの参照を枝に｝ 持つ有向グラフを成します。 参照は、ヒープセルのポインタフィールドに格納されます。 これらのグラフは重複しても良いし、互いに素かも知れません。
本書ではヒープを連続したスロットの配列として扱うことが多く、
Heapと書きます。 オブジェクトの大きさが固定のアルゴリズムでは、
1スロットの大きさは普通オブジェクト1個分です。
オブジェクトの大きさが可変の場合、 1スロットの大きさは1ワードです。 ヒープの底はHeap_bottom、ヒープトップはHeap_topと書きます。
ポインタと子供 ( Pointers and children )
一般に、セルは最初のワードのメモリアドレスで参照します （バイトアドレスだとビッグ・リトルエンディアンによって違う）。
セル Nに対して、Nのポインタフィールド（の指すアドレス）のリストを
Children ( N ) と書きます。 ｛場合によって、セルの任意のポインタ・非ポインタ フィールドを参照することがあります。 この場合、セルを配列として扱います。 即ち、セ ルNのi番目のフィールド はN [ i ] と書きます。 フィールドは0 から数えます。｝
セルの直接の子孫を参照するには、 ポインタフィールドを手繰る必要があります。
Cから借りた表記を使います。 即ち、セルNに対して、pがリストChildren(N)のメンバである時、
Nの子供は* pと書きます。 （子供はセル内のフィールド、子孫は参照先のセル。）
（表記の使用例 ） 図 1.7の根のセルはアドレスがnであり、 影つきの2つのフィールドが子供です。
このセルにはヘッダと非ポインタデータフィールドがあります。
4つのフィールドはそれぞれ1ワード長です。 nの子供は2つのセルを指しており、 これら（子孫）のアドレスは*( n+2 ) と*( n+3 ) です。
図 1.7 ヒープセ ル
疑似コード ( Pseudo - code )
本書ではあらゆるGCアルゴリズムに共通の枠組を用います。
私たちは4つの理由から、実際のプログラミング言語よりも
疑似コードを使うことを選びました。
疑似コードは変数宣言などの面倒が少なく、 コード片が理解しやすくなる。 実際のプログラミング言語を使うと、コード片が大きくなる。
本書のアルゴリズム片は定義ではなく説明である。 実際のGCは複雑に言語・アーキテクチャ依存している。
実際のコードを使うと、アルゴリズムの説明が
特定の言語に縛られる危険がある。 できる限り、言語依存に触れないようにする。
mutatorの命令セットは、NewとUpdateという2つの操作を行ないます。
Newはヒープマネジャから新しいオブジェクトを貰い、
新しく貰ったオブジェクトの先頭を指すポインタを返します。
Newの引数として割り当てるメモリの大きさを渡すことができます。
固定サイズのオブジェクトしか扱わないアルゴリズムや
アルゴリズムが理解しやすくならない場合、 この引数は省略します。
Updateはセルのフィールド値を変更します。
Updateは代入操作の一般化であり、｛変更するフィールドと
新しい値＝普通はポインタかそうでない値nil｝の2引数を取ります
（非ポインタ＝アトミックな値はGCには無関係）。
手続き本体の範囲や制御文のスコープは、インデントで表します。
代入操作 = は、複数代入に良く使います 。
a , b = b , a
セルのフィールドを読んだり変更したりするため、
左辺値を返す手続きを適当に使います。 例えば、セルNの参照数はRC(N)であり、次の文で初期化します。
RC( N ) = 1
1.8 ノート ( Notes )
計算機とプログラミング言語についての初期の歴史は、
[ Metropolis et al. , 1980 ] の Donald Knuth とLuis Trabb Pardoを参照すると良いでしょう。 Lispの初期の版では明示的な解放関数eralisが使われましたが、 すぐにGCが取って代わりました [ McCarthy , 1981 ] 。

Security remains tight in Lhasa , recent reports say More than three months after a wave of violent anti-China protests , Tibet has reopened to foreign tourists , Chinese state media says .
The region was " safe " and overseas visitors were welcome , Xinhua quoted a local tourism chief as saying .
China closed Tibet to foreign tourists after riots erupted in mid-March .
The decision to allow them back in comes days after the Olympic torch 's short , tightly - controlled visit to the region passed off smoothly .
" The success of the Olympic torch relay held three days ago in Lhasa demonstrated that the foundation for the social stability has been further consolidated , " Xinhua quoted Tanor , deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Tourism , as saying .
" Tibet is safe .
We welcome the domestic and foreign tourists . "
Separately , an employee at the China Tibet Tourism Bureau in Lhasa told the BBC that foreign tourists were being allowed back in .
Domestic tour groups have been allowed in since late April , Xinhua said .
Talks delay Access to the region for foreign journalists remains extremely limited .
Monks led the first protests in regional capital Lhasa in March
At a news conference on Tuesday , foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said he hoped " reporting trips to Tibet will be arranged as soon as possible when the situation in Tibet further returns to normal " .
Unrest began in Tibet on 10 March , on the anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
Buddhist monks led anti-Beijing rallies in Lhasa which grew into widespread unrest among Tibetans , both in Tibet and surrounding provinces .
China says rioters killed at least 19 people , but Tibetan exiles say security forces killed dozens of protesters .
It was the worst unrest in Tibet for 20 years .
Last week , a Chinese official said 116 people were still in custody over the protests - but rights groups say they fear the number is far higher .
Early in May , in what was seen as a concession to international pressure , Chinese officials held talks with two envoys of the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader .
Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of orchestrating the violence - allegations the Nobel Peace Prize winner roundly rejects .
A second round of talks between the two sides was postponed following the devastating earthquake in Sichuan province .
Tibetan activists accuse Beijing of using " delaying tactics " to avoid the issue .

The growing recognition that the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries that can increase risk of heart attacks and strokes begins as early as childhood has experts calling for earlier and more aggressive treatment to reduce this risk .
Lifestyle and drug interventions aimed at lowering cholesterol beginning in early adulthood and even childhood could significantly reduce death rates from heart and vascular disease , the experts concluded in an analysis appearing in the Aug. 5 issue of the American Heart Association journal Circulation .
The current practice of prescribing cholesterol - lowering statin drugs to mostly middle - aged people who already have significant plaque buildup does not take full advantage of the potential of these drugs , longtime cholesterol researcher Daniel Steinberg , MD , PhD , of the University of California , San Diego tells WebMD .
" The research tells us that [ statin ] treatment as it is currently given reduces death and disability from heart disease by about 30 % , " he says .
" Our contention is that that is a gross underestimate of the benefits we would see if we treated earlier and more aggressively . "
やあ，踊る鳥のビデオだよ。こいつは愉快だ！
このノリの良さにはまったく驚かされるけれど，このビデオには単なる面白映像という以上に興味深いところがある。
まず，これは意外に思われるかもしれないけれど，人間以外の動物のほとんどは「リズムにのる」ということができない。認知進化の専門家によると，人間に最も近い霊長類のひとつであるチンパンジーを連れてきて，特殊な訓練を施しても，リズム感を獲得することはできなかったという。
そのようなこともあって，「リズムにのる」という能力は人間に特有のものであると考えられてきた。ところが，上のビデオを見れば分かるように，「リズムにのる」ことのできる動物は，確かに存在する。これはどういうことかと調べてみると，どうやら鳥類の中にはリズム感を持つものがいるらしいということが分かってくる。さらに詳しく調べてみると，どうやらインコやヨウムのように喋る能力を持つ鳥だけがリズム感を持ちうるらしいということが判明した。
でも，どうして喋る鳥だけがリズム感を持ちうるんだろう？
その理由について詳しいことは分かっていない。ただひとつ言えるのは，チンパンジーには無くて喋る鳥にはあるもの
― つまり「喋る能力」が大きく関連しているのだろうということ。
大きく異なる進化の過程を辿った２つの種に対して，「喋る能力」と「リズム感」という同じ能力の組み合わせが発生したということは，進化の過程でそれらを得たというよりも，そもそも「喋る能力」というものが原理的に「リズム感」を生みうるということなのかな……その逆かもしれないけれど。
今までは，なんとなくのイメージで，リズム感というのは動物的な本能から生まれるものと思っていたのだけれど，そのイメージがひっくり返されてしまったような感じがする。実は人間と一部の動物だけが持つ特殊な能力に付随するものだったんだ……と。

There is nothing new about India being perceived as a place of great and growing wealth : for much of the pre-colonial period , the West was the eager consumer of the spices , silks , and luxuries of the subcontinent , while India was the prosperous supplier .
As early as the reign of Nero , there was such a dramatic drain of Western gold to India that Strabo , the Greek geographer and historian , anxiously asks in a letter what can be done to solve the crisis .
One South Indian dynasty even sent an embassy to Rome to discuss the problem of the balance of payments .
You can still get a flavor of the intoxicatingly rich and sophisticated classical India that supplied these luxuries at the once - great port of Mamallapuram on the Coromandal coast .
Here massive relief sculptures faced onto the port where , according to a seventh - century poet , “ ships rode at anchor , bent to the point of breaking , laden as they were with wealth , with big - trunked elephants , and with mountains of gems of nine varieties . ”
The reliefs cover one side of a hill : at the right are two huge elephants , trunks swinging ; nearby , warrior heroes and meditating sages stand below flights of gods and goddesses , godlings , nymphs , and tree spirits .
There is a breezy lightness of touch at work : a flute is playing , there is dancing , and the heavenly apsara fertility spirits and goddesses are whispering fondly to their consorts .
The man who commissioned the sculptures was King Mahendra , a ruler of the Pallava dynasty who reigned from 590 to 630 AD .
( The dynasty itself held power between the sixth and the eighth centuries . )
Taking the titles Vicitracitta ( The Curious Minded ) and Mattavilasa ( Drunk with Pleasure ) , Mahendra was an eclectic poet and playwright and an innovative aesthete and sensualist .
He wrote two lost treatises on South Indian painting and music , and several plays — one of which , a cynical and sophisticated satirical farce called The Drunken Courtesan , tells the story of an alcoholic worshiper of Shiva and his courtesan - lover who get into an argument with a tipsy Buddhist monk over a drinking bowl left lying in front of a bar .
The farce is still regularly performed in the south today .
The same playful mind that can be sensed in Mahendra ’s plays can be seen in the dynastic sculptures commissioned a little inland from Mamallapuram , at the Pallava capital of Kanchipuram : here we see the ladies of the court riding on elephants under crimson parasols ; messengers arrive breathless at halls packed with courtiers ; ambassadors from China sue for peace .
Wizened ascetics examine the omens ; beaten monarchs flee into exile to escape the arrows of the Pallava chariot - archers ; the courtiers feast and the dancing girls celebrate .
This was a world where the frontier between the divine and the human remained porous .
Vishnu , Brahma , and especially Shiva turn up intermittently to give advice at the Pallava court and intervene in its battles .
Images of the holy family of Lord Shiva echo those of the Pallava dynasty : only the number of arms …
There is apparently no limit to the Bush administration ’s desire to invade Americans ’ privacy in the name of national security .
According to members of Congress , Attorney General Michael Mukasey is preparing to give the F.B.I. broad new authority to investigate Americans  without any clear basis for suspicion that they are committing a crime .
Opening the door to sweeping investigations of this kind would be an invitation to the government to spy on people based on their race , religion or political activities .
Before Mr. Mukasey goes any further , Congress should insist that the guidelines be fully vetted , and it should make certain that they do not pose a further threat to Americans ’ civil liberties .
Mr. Mukasey has not revealed the new guidelines .
But according to senators whose staff have been given limited briefings , the rules may also authorize the F.B.I. to use an array of problematic investigative techniques .
Among these are pretext interviews , in which agents do not honestly represent themselves while questioning a subject ’s neighbors and work colleagues .
Four Democratic Senators  Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island , Richard Durbin of Illinois and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts  have written to Mr. Mukasey and urged him not to sign the guidelines until they are publicly announced and national security and civil liberties experts have had a chance to analyze them .
I have Google ’s blogsearch set to give me notifications about unit testing .
On an average week , I read dozens of blogs and mailing list discussions about the topic .
Occasionally , I read something new , but there ’s lot of repetition out there .
The same arguments crop up often .
Of all of them , though , there is one argument about unit testing which really bugs me because it rests on a flawed theory about testing and quality and sadly , it ’s an argument that I fell for a long time ago and I ’d like to lay it to rest .
Hopefully , this blog will help , but I have to relate a little history first .
Back in the very early 2000s , I had a conversation with Steve Freeman at a conference .
We were talking about Test - Driven Development and Steve had the strong feeling that most of the people who were practicing TDD at the time were doing it wrong - they 'd missed something .
Steve was and is part of a close - knit community in London who have been practicing XP and TDD from the very beginning .
Among the fruits of their labor was the entire notion of mock objects .
Steve Freeman and Tim MacKinnon wrote the paper that introduced the idea to the broader community .
The rest is history .
There are mock object frameworks out there for nearly every language in common use .
Mock Objects , however , are part of a larger relatively unpublicized approach to TDD .
The story I heard was that it was all started by John Nolan , the CTO of a startup named Connextra .
John Nolan , gave his developers a challenge : write OO code with no getters .
Whenever possible , tell another object to do something rather than ask .
In the process of doing this , they noticed that their code became supple and easy to change .
They also noticed that the fake objects that they were writing were highly repetitive , so they came up with the idea of a mocking framework that would allow them to set expectations on objects - mock objects .
When Steve told me about this approach , I thought it sounded okay but I there was one thing that I could n’t wrap my head around – Steve , and Tim , and the people who had been on that team were using mocks extensively .
In fact , they used mocks whenever they could .
This was a bit different from the way that I was practicing TDD .
What I did , in general , was use tests to drive a class and then I extracted new classes from the class I was designing as it became bulky .
Some tests would cover just one class , but others would cover several classes working together .
The problem that I saw with the mock object approach was that it only tested individual classes , not their interactions .
Sure , the tests I wrote were nominally unit tests , but I liked the fact that they occasionally tested real interactions between a class and its immediate collaborators .
Yes , I liked isolation but I felt that this little tiptoe into integration level testing gave my tests a bit more power and a bit more strength .
But , there was only one problem .
The team at Connextra that was using mocks extensively was reporting extremely low defect rates .
I just was n’t sure how they were getting them .
After all , it did n’t seem like there was any integration testing going on .
Their application should have been rife with integration errors .
Or should it have ?
Let ’s examine our reasoning .
One very common theory about unit testing is that quality comes from removing the errors that your tests catch .
Superficially , this makes sense .
Tests can pass or fail and when they fail we learn that we have a problem and we correct it .
If you subscribe to this theory , you expect to find fewer integration errors when you do integration testing and fewer “ unit ” errors when you do unit testing .
It ’s a nice theory , but it ’s wrong .
The best way to see this is to compare unit testing to another way of improving quality – one that has a very dramatic measurable effect .
Back in the 1980s , there was a movement to use something called Clean Room Software Development .
The notion behind Clean Room was that you could increase quality by increasing the rigor of development .
In Clean Room , you had to write a logical predicate for every little piece of your code and you had to demonstrate , during a review , that your code did no more or less than the predicate described .
It was a very serious approach , and it was a bit more radical than what I just described : another tenet of Clean Room was that there was to be no unit testing .
None .
Zilch .
When you wrote your code it was assumed correct after it was reviewed .
The only testing that was done was stochastic testing at the functional level .
Amazingly , Clean Room worked .
Clean Room teams demonstrated very high quality numbers .
When I read about it , I was stunned , but then I came across a passage in a book that I was reading about the process .
The author said that many programmers wrote their predicates after writing a section of code , but that experienced programmers often wrote the predicates first ..
Gee , that sounds familiar , does n’t it ?
In TDD , we write the test first and the test is , essentially , a specification of the behavior of the code we are about to write .
In the software industry , we ’ve been chasing quality for years .
The interesting thing is there are a number of things that work .
Design by Contract works .
Test Driven Development works .
So do Clean Room , code inspections and the use of higher - level languages .
All of these techniques have been shown to increase quality .
And , if we look closely we can see why : all of them force us to reflect on our code .
That ’s the magic , and it ’s why unit testing works also .
When you write unit tests , TDD - style or after your development , you scrutinize , you think , and often you prevent problems without even encountering a test failure .
Now , as you ’re reading this , you might think that I 'm saying that we can get away with doing nothing as long as we sit back in our chairs , rest our chins on our hands , and think about our code .
I do n’t think so .
I think that approach may work for short periods for some people , but software development is a long - haul activity .
We need practices which help us achieve continuous discipline and a continuous state of reflection .
Clean Room and TDD are two practices which , despite their radical differences , force us to think with absolute precision about what we are doing .
I have no doubt that a team could do well with , say , Clean Room , but personally , I like the fact that the tests we end up with using TDD give us additional leverage : they make it easier to change our code and know that it is still working without having to re-reason through the entirety of the code base .
If you have to change your code often it ’s not the best use of your time , especially when you can write tests that have recorded and embodied that reasoning and run them at will .
With those tests in place , you free yourself up to reason about other things that you have n’t reasoned about in the past , rather than repeating yourself endlessly .
But , enough about TDD .
My point is that we can't look at testing mechanistically .
Unit testing does not improve quality just by catching errors at the unit level .
And , integration testing does not improve quality just by catching errors at the integration level .
The truth is more subtle than that .
Quality is a function of thought and reflection - precise thought and reflection .
That ’s the magic .
Techniques which reinforce that discipline invariably increase quality .
The ASP.
NET MVC team is in the final stages of finishing up a new " Preview 4 " release that they hope to ship later this week .
The Preview 3 release focused on finishing up a lot of the underlying core APIs and extensibility points in ASP .
NET MVC .
Starting with Preview 4 this week you 'll start to see more and more higher level features begin to appear that build on top of the core foundation and add nice productivity .
There are a bunch of new features and capabilities in this new build - so much in fact that I decided I needed two posts to cover them all .
This first post will cover the new Caching , Error Handling and Security features in Preview 4 , as well as some testing improvements it brings .
My next post will cover the new AJAX features being added with this release as well .
Understanding Filter Interceptors
Action Filter Attributes are a useful extensibility capability in ASP .
NET MVC that was first added with the " Preview 2 " release .
These enable you to inject code interceptors into the request of a MVC controller that can execute before and after a Controller or its Action methods execute .
This enables some nice encapsulation scenarios where you can easily package - up and re-use functionality in a clean declarative way .
Below is an example of a super simple " ScottGuLog " filter that I could use to log details about exceptions raised during the execution of a request .
Implementing a custom filter class is easy - just subclass the " ActionFilterAttribute " type and override the appropriate methods to run code before or after an Action method on the Controller is invoked , and / or before or after an ActionResult is processed into a response .
Using a filter within a ASP .
NET MVC Controller is easy - just declare it as an attribute on an Action method , or alternatively on the Controller class itself ( in which case it will apply to all Action methods within the Controller ) :
Above you can see an example of two filters being applied .
I 've indicated that I want my " ScottGuLog " to be applied to the " About " action method , and that I want the " HandleError " filter to be applied to all Action methods on the HomeController .
Previous preview releases of ASP.
NET MVC enabled this filter extensibility , but did n't ship with pre-built filters .
ASP.NET Preview 4 now includes several useful filters for handling output caching , error handling and security scenarios .
OutputCache Filter
The [ OutputCache ] filter provides an easy way to integrate ASP .
NET MVC with the output caching features of ASP.
NET ( with ASP.
NET MVC Preview 3 you had to write code to achieve this ) .
To try this out , modify the " Message " value set within the " Index " action method of the HomeController ( created by the VS ASP.
NET MVC project template ) to display the current time :
When you run your application you 'll see that a timestamp updates each time you refresh the page :
We can enable output caching for this URL by adding the [ OutputCache ] attribute to the our Action method .
We 'll configure it to cache the response for a 10 second duration using the declaration below :
Now when you hit refresh on the page you 'll see that the timestamp only updates every 10 seconds .
This is because the action method is only being called once every 10 seconds - all requests between those time intervals are served out of the ASP.
NET output cache ( meaning no code needs to run - which makes it super fast ) .
In addition to supporting time duration , the OutputCache attribute also supports the standard ASP.
NET output cache vary options ( vary by params , headers , content encoding , and custom logic ) .
For example , the sample below would save different cached versions of the page depending on the value of an optional " PageIndex " QueryString parameter , and automatically render the correct version depending on the incoming URL 's querystring value :
You can also integrate with the ASP .
NET Database Cache Invalidation feature - which allows you to automatically invalidate the cache when a database the URL depends on is modified ( tip : the best way to - do this is to setup a CacheProfile section in your web.config and then point to it in the OutputCache attribute ) .
HandleError Filter
The [ HandleError ] filter provides a way to declaratively indicate on a Controller or Action method that a friendly error response should be displayed if an error occurs during the processing of a ASP .
NET MVC request .
To try this out , add a new " TestController " to a project and implement an action method that raise an exception like below :
By default when you point your browser at this URL , it will display a default ASP.
NET error page to remote users ( unless you 've gone in and configured a < customErrors > section in your web.config file ) :
We can change the HTML error displayed to be a more friendly end - user message by adding a [ HandleError ] attribute to either our Controller or to an Action method on our Controller :
The HandleError filter will catch all exceptions ( including errors raised when processing View templates ) , and display a custom Error view response when they occur .
By default it attempts to resolve a View template in your project called " Error " to generate the response .
You can place the " Error " view either in the same directory as your other Controller specific views ( for example : \ Views \ Test for the TestController above ) , or within the \ Views \ Shared folder ( it will look first for a controller specific error view , and then if it does n't find one it will look in the shared folder - which contains views that are shared across all controllers ) .
Visual Studio now automatically adds a default " Error " view template for you inside the \ Views \ Shared folder when you create new ASP .
NET MVC Projects starting with Preview 4 :
When we add a [ HandleError ] attribute to our TestController , this will by default show remote users an html error page like below ( note that it picks up the master page template from the project so that the error message is integrated into the site ) .
You can obviously go in and customize the Error view template to display whatever HTML and / or friendlier customer error message you want - below is simply what you get out of the box :
To help developers , the default Error view template provided by the new project template in Visual Studio is written to display additional error stack trace information when you are browsing the application locally :
You can turn this off either by deleting the code from the Error view template , or by setting < customErrors > to " off " inside your web .config file .
By default the [ HandleError ] filter will catch and handle all exceptions that get raised during the request .
You can alternatively specify specific exception types you are interested in catching , and specify custom error views for them by specifying the " ExceptionType " and " View " properties on [ HandleError ] attributes :
In the code above I 'm choosing to display custom error views for SqlExceptions and NullReferenceExceptions .
All other exceptions will then use the default " Error " view template .
Authorize Filter
The [ Authorize ] filter provides a way to declaratively control security access on a Controller or Action method .
It allows you to indicate that a user must be logged in , and optionally require that they are a specific user or in a specific security role in order to gain access .
The filter works with all types of authentication ( including Windows as well as Forms based authentication ) , and provides support for automatically redirecting anonymous users to a login form as needed .
To try this out , add an [ Authorize ] filter to the " About " action in the HomeController created by default with Visual Studio :
Declaring an [ Authorize ] attribute like above indicates that a user must be logged into the site in order for them to request the " About " action .
When non-logged - in users attempt to hit the / Home / About URL , they will be blocked from gaining access .
If the web application is configured to use Windows based authentication , ASP.
NET will automatically authenticate the user using their Windows login identity , and if successful allow them to proceed .
If the web application is configured to use Forms based authentication , the [ Authorize ] attribute will automatically redirect the user to a login page in order to authenticate ( after which they 'll have access ) :
The [ Authorize ] attribute optionally allows you to grant access only to specific users and / or roles .
For example , if I wanted to limit access to the " About " action to just myself and Bill Gates I could write :
Typically for all but trivial applications you do n't want to hard - code user names within your code .
Instead you usually want to use a higher - level concept like " roles " to define permissions , and then map users into roles separately ( for example : using active directory or a database to store the mappings ) .
The [ Authorize ] attribute makes it easy to control access to Controllers and Actions using a " Roles " property :
The [ Authorize ] attribute does not have a dependency on any specific user identity or role management mechanism .
Instead it works against the ASP.
NET " User " object - which is extensible and allows any identity system to be used .
AccountController Class
I mentioned above that the [ Authorize ] attribute can be used with any authentication or user identity management system .
You can write or use any custom login UI and / or username / password management system you want with it .
To help you get started , though , the ASP .
NET MVC Project Template in Visual Studio now includes a pre-built " AccountController " and associated login views that implement a forms - authentication membership system with support for logging in , logging out , registering new users , and changing passwords .
All of the views templates and UI can be easily customized independent of the AccountController class or implementation :
The Site. master template also now includes UI at the top - right that provides login / logout functionality .
When using forms - based authentication it will prompt you to login if you are not currently authenticated :
And it displays a welcome message along with a logout link if you are authenticated on the site :
Clicking the Login link above takes users to a Login screen like below that they can use to authenticate :
New users can click the register link to create new accounts :
Error handing and error display is also built - in :
The AccountController class that is added to new projects uses the built - in ASP .
NET Membership API to store and manage user credentials ( the Membership system uses a provider API allowing any back - end storage to be plugged - in , and ASP.
NET includes built - in providers for Active Directory and SQL Server ) .
If you do n't want to use the built - in Membership system you can keep the same AccountController action method signatures , View templates , and Forms Authentication ticket logic , and just replace the user account logic within the AccountController class .
For the next ASP .
NET MVC preview release we are planning to encapsulate the interaction logic between the AccountController and the user identity system behind an interface - which will make it easier to plug - in your own user storage system ( without having to implement a full membership provider ) as well as to easily unit test both it and the AccountController .
Our hope is that this provides a nice way for people to quickly get started , and enable them to have a working end to end security system as soon as they create a new project .
Testing TempData
One last improvement to touch on in this first preview 4 post is some improvements being made on the Controller class that allow you to more easily unit test the TempData collection .
The TempData property allows you to store data that you want to persist for a future request from a user .
It has the semantic of only lasting one future request ( after which it is removed ) .
It is typically used for MVC scenarios where you want to perform a client - side redirect to change the URL in the browser , and want a simple way to store scratch data .
With previous ASP.
NET MVC
Previews you had to mock objects in order to test the TempData collection .
With Preview 4 you no longer need to mock or setup anything .
You can now add and verify objects within the Controller 's TempData collection directly within your unit tests ( for example : populate a controller 's TempData property before calling its action method , or verify that the action updated the TempData after the action returned ) .
The actual storage semantics of the TempData collection is now encapsulated within a separate TempDataProvider property .
Conclusion
Hopefully the above post provides a quick look at a number of the new features and changes coming with ASP .
NET MVC Preview 4 .
My next post on ASP .
NET MVC Preview 4 will cover the new AJAX functionality that has been added , and demonstrate how to take advantage of it .
Hope this helps ,

EU forces market trader to pulp thousands of kiwi fruit because they 're ONE MILLIMETRE too small
Greengrocer Tim
Down holds a legal kiwi fruit in his right hand along with an illegal kiwi fruit in his left hand
A market trader has been banned from selling a batch of kiwi fruits because they are 1 mm smaller than EU rules allow .
Inspectors told 53 - year - old Tim Down he is forbidden even to give away the fruits , which are perfectly healthy .
The father of three will now have to bin the 5,000 kiwis , costing him £ 1,000 in lost sales .
Speaking yesterday from the stall in Bristol he has owned for 20 years , Mr Down said : ' It 's total nonsense .
I work hard enough to make a living without all these bureaucrats telling us what we can and can't sell .
' They 're saying I 'm a criminal for selling this fruit , but the real crime is that all this fruit will go to waste - all because it 's 1 mm too small .
' It 's a terrible waste , particularly when we 're all feeling the pinch from rising food prices and I 've got to throw away this perfectly good fruit . '
The case comes only two weeks after the European Commission said it wants to relax rules on misshapen fruit and vegetables .
It could eventually mean an end to notorious bans on straight bananas , curved cucumbers and skinny carrots .
But that will bring little comfort to Mr Down in the meantime .
He took over Percy J Down wholesalers in 1988 , following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather .
Tim Down with his illegal consignment of Kiwi fruits .
The greengrocer will lose £ 1,000 because EU regulators say the fruits are one millimetre too small
Last week , he ordered 75 boxes of Chilean kiwis from an importer in Kent , paying £ 525 for the batch of 12,000 fruits .
The kiwis were on sale for 20 p each from his 15,000sq ft stall at the Wholesale Fruit Centre in Bristol .
Mr Down sold 44 of the boxes and was expecting to make a profit from the remaining 5,000 fruits .
But that was before he received a visit by inspectors from the Rural Payments Agency - part of the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs .
The inspectors conducted a random check to see if Mr Down 's produce met strict European laws .
The regulations state that Class II kiwis must weigh a minimum of 62g - around 21/4oz .
But the two - hour inspection revealed that a number of the batch weighed 58g , or about 2oz .
Close inspection :
The legal Kiwi fruit is on the left , while the ' too small ' illegal Kiwi fruit is on the right
Mr Down said that , in effect , this meant there were a mere 1 mm , or 1/25 of an inch , too small in diameter .
Selling them - or giving them away - carries a fine of up to £ 5,000 .
The Rural Payments Agency insists the rules are in place to ensure quality and uniformity .
Barrie Stedman , head of the agency 's inspectorate , said : ' Unfortunately the kiwi consignment in question failed to meet the minimum standards for saleable produce , in contravention of EU grading rules . '
He added : ' The trader was offered a number of options , including returning the fruit to the importer . '

Palestinians : Mossad tried to assassinate West Bank exile
Sources in Ireland claim Israeli agents attempted to shoot Jihad Jaara , one of most wanted men sent to exile following siege on Church of Nativity in 2002

Palestinian sources have accused Israel of trying to assassinate Jihad Jaara , one of the Palestinians sent to exile following the siege on the Church of the Nativity in 2002 , who now resides in Ireland .
According to the sources , Jaara escaped an assassination attempt and the Irish police arrested two suspects – a Palestinian from Gaza who has a European citizenship and a Moroccan with a French citizenship .

Back
Six and a half minutes .
That 's how long it took me to create my first kooky , adorable critter using the Creature Creator for Spore , Will Wright 's new sim game due out this fall .
I started off with a default " body " – a sort of shapeless lump of virtual plasticine – and used the mouse to pull and stretch it around a bit .
Then I added a head , and spent a few seconds smooshing that back and forth , first trying out a long - nosed look , then crushing it down to a pig - like snout .
A pig !
A freaky mutant pig !
Hey , I liked that idea .
Within seconds , I 'd added a couple of legs to the body , and figured out how to push them downward so they seemed suitably stumpy ; then , a couple of hooves and Bambi - like eyes later , I was done .
My little virtual pig stumbled around the screen , grunting and oinking while I admired my work .
And like I said , it took only six and a half minutes .
Think for a second about how remarkable this is .
When it comes to art and design , I am your Average Joe .
I have only rudimentary sketching and visualization skills , and precisely zero experience with CAD software that animators use to craft Pixar - like animals .
Yet in less time than it takes to drink a cup of coffee , I had created a completely awesome - looking 3 - D creature .
Spore 's Creature Creator , in other words , is doing something quite interesting and unexpected :
It 's de-skilling 3 - D design .
I say de-skilling in the positive sense .
What I mean is that Spore is democratizing the art of 3 - D design .
We probably should n't be surprised by this effect , because videogames have been de-skilling the world for decades now .
Games propagate technology stealthily , quietly and gradually taking all sorts of skills that only pros used to possess and spreading them across the population .
Think about the whole concept of using your mouse to navigate files and icons on your computer .
A mere few decades ago , this task – using a physical interface to manipulate a virtual one – was so opaque and weird that only computer - science pros could grasp it .
Then videogames came along and , in barely a few years , trained an entire generation of kids worldwide in eye - hand - machine coordination .
Steve Jobs ' original Macintosh would have been DOA without videogames ; they de-skilled the art of mouse manipulation .
There are dozens of other examples of this .
Role - playing games have trained millions of gamers in highly complex resource and inventory control .
Basically , they 've made screwing around with databases fun .
Or think about conducting a big raid in World of Warcraft , where you need to deploy virtual team - management skills and diplomacy worthy of the Cuban missile crisis .
Previously , this was the concern of only very high - level employees at multinational corporations – but now 13 - year - old kids are doing it .
Wright is the undisputed reigning master of creating games that contain subterfuge training .
Ever wonder how The Sims became the world 's top - selling game of all time ?
It 's not because people actually play it .
Most longtime Sims fans quickly tire of creating families .
No , what hard - core fans love is The Sims ' elegant " house - design " engine – which they use to painstakingly craft sprawling , monster homes , customized to the level of individual tile patterns they hand - draw in cracked versions of Photoshop .
The Sims is n't a game :
It 's the world 's most popular architectural CAD package .
Now Spore is going to do the same thing to the world of 3 - D characters and the sort of work regularly produced by Pixar .
In a sense , the word de -skill might be misleading , because in reality two forces are moving in opposite directions .
Games increase the skill levels of gamers while , at the same time , showing software makers how to make tools easier to use .
With their " play around and see what happens " interfaces , today 's DIY creativity software titles – from GarageBand and Photoshop to Final Cut Pro or even MySpace and Facebook – are all children of videogame design .
Their creators realized that making interfaces fun to use and playful will inspire more people to create things .
Now , let 's be clear : I certainly do n't believe that Creature Creator , a free trial edition of which will be available for download Tuesday , is going to make someone employable at a 3 - D design house .
De-skilling does n't happen that abruptly .
But what Spore will do , very subtly and quietly , is to begin changing the way people interact with 3 - D culture .
3 - D art will suddenly seem less opaque and more understandable .
The next time you go to an animated movie , you 'll see the onscreen characters as a series of design decisions .
You 'll notice the exaggerated length of the legs , or perhaps the way the eyes are set – because you 'll have experience doing this yourself .
And pretty soon you 'll find yourself thinking : " Yeah , I could do that . "

There is a lot of confusion over the Fed 's use of core inflation as part of its policy making process .
One reason for confusion is that we using a single measure to summarize three different definitions of the term " core inflation " based upon how it is used .
First , core inflation is used to forecast future inflation .
For example , this recent paper uses a " bivariate integrated moving average ... model ... that fits the data on inflation very well , " and finds that the long - run trend rate of inflation " is best gauged by focusing solely on prices excluding food and energy prices . "
That is , this paper finds that predictions of future inflation based upon core measures are more accurate than predictions based upon total inflation .
Second , we also use the core inflation rate to measure the current trend inflation rate .
Because the inflation rate we observe contains both permanent and transitory components , the precise long - run inflation rate that consumers face going forward is not observed directly , it must be estimated .
When food and energy are removed to obtain a core measure , the idea is to strip away the short - run movements thereby giving a better picture of the core or long - run inflation rate faced by households .
I should note , however that this is not the only nor the best way to extract the trend and the Fed also looks at other measures of the trend inflation rate that have better statistical properties .
Thus while the first use of core inflation was for forecasting future inflation rates , this use of core inflation attempts to find today 's trend inflation rate [ There is a way to combine the first and second uses into a single conceptual framework that encompasses both , but it seemed more intuitive to keep them separate .
In both cases , the idea is to find the inflation rate that consumers are likely to face in the future . ]
Let me emphasize one thing .
If the question is " what is today 's inflation rate , " the total inflation rate is the best measure .
It 's intended to measure the cost of living and there 's no reason at all to strip anything out .
It 's only when we ask different questions that different measures are used .
Third , and this is the function that is ignored most often in discussions of core inflation , but to me it is the most important of the three , it is the inflation target that best stabilizes the economy ( i.e. best reduces the variation in output and employment ) .
In theoretical models used to study monetary policy , the procedure for setting the policy rule is to find the monetary policy rule that maximizes household welfare ( by minimizing variation in variables such as output , consumption , and employment ) .
The rule will vary by model , but it usually involves a measure of output and a measure of prices , and those measures can be in levels , rates of change , or both depending upon the particular model being examined , but generally a Taylor rule type framework comes out of this process ( i.e. a rule that links the federal funds rate to measures of output and prices ) .
However , in the Taylor rule , the best measure of prices is usually something that looks like a core measure of inflation .
Essentially , when prices are sticky , which is the most common assumption driving the interaction between policy and movements in real variables in these models , it 's best to target an index that gives most of the weight to the stickiest prices ( here 's an explanation as to why from a post that echoes the themes here ) .
That is , volatile prices such as food and energy are essentially tossed out of the index .
Another feature is that the indexes often include both output and input prices , and occasionally asset prices as well .
That is , a core measure of inflation composed of just output prices is n't the best thing for policymakers to target , a more general core inflation rate combining both input and output prices works better .
The core inflation rate you see in the news , the one that strips out food and energy , should be though of as a short - hand , quick measure of all three of these concepts .
But in each case the Fed uses measures ( formally or informally ) designed to best satisfy these three functions .
For example , when it forecasts future inflation , it uses a different concept of core inflation than it uses in setting policy .
The Fed paper linked above is one example of how the Fed searches for the optimal way to predict future inflation .
All that matters for policy is finding the most accurate way to predict inflation , and they will use whatever definition of inflation is best suite for this job .
There is evidence that core inflation is best and that 's why it is used , but it is a statistical question and did n't have to come out that way ( and the best measure of core inflation may not be simply stripping out food and energy - also , there are different measures of prices to choose from , e.g. the CPI and the PCE ) .
When it comes to setting policy , the Fed does n't formally use a Taylor rule , though they certainly have Taylor rule estimates in the information they use when considering policy moves , instead they look at a variety of measures of inflation ( both core and total ) , and they look at the rate of change in input prices such as wages and commodities ( e.g. oil ) as well .
They then weight each of those pieces of information in some way ( and hence construct an implicit index of all of this information ) , and then set the federal funds rate accordingly .
While I have no way of knowing if the weights they use are optimal , this is exactly what the theoretical models say they should do .
But the point is that it is some implicit combination of all of this information that matters for policy , and hence this core measure is very different from the core measure that is best at predicting future inflation alone .
The core inflation rate you see in the news , the CPI less food and energy , does do a fairly good job of representing the information the Fed uses to forecast future inflation , i.e. it is a measure of the trend rate of inflation ( but not the best one ) , and it also does well at approximating the information the Fed will use to set policy , but the actual process it uses is more complicated than this and the Fed employs measures that are specialized for the job at hand .
Finally , there is also a question of what we mean by inflation conceptually .
Does a change in relative prices , e.g. from a large increase in energy costs , that raises the cost of living substantially count as inflation , or do we require the changes to be common across all prices as would occur when the money supply is increased ?
Which is better for measuring the cost of living ?
Which is a better target for stabilizing the economy ?
The answers may not be the same .
For a nice discussion of this topic , see this speech given yesterday by Dennis Lockhart , President of the Atlanta Fed :
Inflation Beyond the Headlines , by Dennis P. Lockhart , President , Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta : ... Let me begin by posing the simple question :
What do we mean by " inflation " ?
The answer to that simple question is n't as simple as it may seem .
The popular treatment of inflation in our sound bite society risks confusing inflation with relative price movements and the cost of living .
By cost of living , I 'm referring to the costs you and I incur to maintain our level of consumption of various goods and services including essential items such as food , gasoline , and lodging .
Relative price movements occur continuously in an economy as individual prices react to market forces affecting that good or service .
Neither relative price movements nor sustained high living costs constitute inflation as economists commonly use the term ....
And I think I 'll end with this part of his remarks :
No really , 50 % of the food that is grown , gets wasted before it ever gets to anyone ’s mouth ( or an ethanol factory , or a cows mouth ) .
It ’s no wonder there have been food riots , rising prices , and record shortages .
To meet the challenge of feeding growing populations and the global hungry , massive reductions in the amount of food wasted after production are needed .
The Stockholm International Water Institute ( SIWI ) , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) will today , release a policy brief â€ œSaving Water : From Field to Fork â€ “ Curbing Losses and Wastage in the Food Chain , â€ that calls on governments to reduce by half , by 2025 , the amount of food that is wasted after it is grown and outlines attainable steps for this be achieved .
Tremendous quantities of food are discarded in processing , transport , supermarkets and peopleâ€™s kitchens .
This wasted food is also wasted water .
In the US , for instance , as much as 30 percent of food , worth some USD 48.3 billion ( !!! ) , is thrown away .
Thatâ€™s like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can – enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people .
Besides being horrifically inefficient , through international trade , savings in the US might benefit communities in other parts of the world .
More than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population .
Distribution and access to food is a problem â€ “ many are hungry , while at the same time many are stuffing themselves , becoming fat and unhealthy in the process .
The Report highlights an often overlooked problem : we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits .
â€ œAs much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted , â€ says Dr. David Molden , Director of Research at IWMI .
â€ œCurbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win-win opportunities for farmers , business , ecosystems , and the global hungry .
An effective water - saving strategy requires that minimising food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda.â€ 
Food production is constrained by the availability of water and land resources .
An estimated 1.2 billion people already live in areas where there is not enough water to meet demand .
And with rising demand for water - intensive agricultural products , such as beef and bioenergy , pressure mounts .
According to the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture 2007 , these trends will lead to crises in many places , particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia .
â€ œUnless we change our practices , water will be a key constraint to food production in the future , â€ said Dr. Pasquale Steduto of FAO .
Water losses accumulate as food is wasted before and after it reaches the consumer .
In poorer countries , a majority of uneaten food is lost before it has a chance to be consumed .
Depending on the crop , an estimated 15 - 35 percent of food may be lost in the field .
Another 10 - 15 percent is discarded during processing , transport and storage .
In richer countries , production is more efficient but waste is greater : people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow , ship and produce the food along with it .
The Report stresses that the magnitude of current food losses presents both challenges and opportunities .
â€ œImproving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations , â€ says Prof. Jan Lundqvist of SIWI .
â€ œReaching the target we propose , a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal .â€ 

The topic is about the glut of content on the Web today .
The bar for quality content keeps getting higher .
What that means for you , if you publish content on a blog or website , is that you have to be choosier about topics — and more creative in how you present them .
I give 3 tips for content :
– Focus on topic niches , rather than general topics .
Before you write that “ top 10 list of marketing ideas ” do a search in Google and see if there are already articles on that topic .
If so , consider how to make your article different .
One good way is to go narrow and deep — because a lot of the broad and general topics have been done to death .
Narrow the topic .
Make it “ top 10 marketing ideas for under $ 5 ” or “ top 10 marketing ideas for home - based landscaping businesses . ” – Write about your own experiences .
The one thing that I guarantee has not been written about ad nauseum are YOUR experiences .
Instead of writing on broad topics , write from the perspective of what you have experienced , done , learned , etc .
Only you can write that .

A dog sheltered a newborn baby abandoned by its 14 - year - old mother in a field in rural Argentina until the boy was rescued , a doctor said Friday .
The abandoned infant was found in a field with this dog and her newborn puppies .
A resident of a rural area outside La Plata called police late Wednesday night to say that he had heard the baby crying in a field behind his house .
The man went outside and found the infant lying beside the dog and its six newborn puppies , said Daniel Salcedo , chief of police of the Province of Buenos Aires .
The temperature was a chilly 37 degrees , Salcedo said .
The dog had apparently carried the baby 50 meters from where his mother had abandoned him to where the puppies were huddled , police said .
" She took it like a puppy and rescued it , " Salcedo said .
" The doctors told us if she had n't done this , he would have died .
" The dog is a hero to us . "
Dr. Egidio Melia , director of the Melchor Romero Hospital in La Plata , said police showed up at the hospital at 11:30 p.m.
Wednesday with the baby , who doctors say was only a few hours old .
Though the infant had superficial scratches and bruises and was bleeding from his mouth , he was in good shape , Melia said .
The next morning , the child 's mother was driven by a neighbor to the hospital and told authorities that the 8 - pound , 13 - ounce infant is hers , Melia said .
The teenager was immediately given psychological treatment and was hospitalized , he said .
She has said little about the incident .
The child has been transferred to a children 's hospital in La Plata , 37 miles from Buenos Aires .

Texas leads nation in abstinence education funding
AUSTIN — Texas spent a nation - high $ 17 million last year for abstinence education programs that continue to stir debate about whether classes promoting virginity before marriage work in public schools .
Federal statistics in June showed that 52.9 percent of Texas students in ninth through 12th grades had sexual intercourse , compared with 47.8 nationally .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that Texas youths are less likely to use condoms .
Public schools in Texas are not required to offer sex education , but those that do must make the lessons abstinence - focused .
Instructions about condoms are couched in terms of how often they fail , according to state law .
Abstinence - only supporters say more comprehensive sex education sends a mixed message to teenagers that having sex at their age is fine , while opponents cite surveys that they say prove abstinence lessons are failing .
Regardless , a change in Texas policy does not appear likely , the Austin American - Statesman reported Sunday .
" The governor is comfortable with the current law and supports abstinence programs , " said Allison Castle , a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry .
But the state lawmaker who co-authored the abstinence legislation in 1995 says the law was not meant to eliminate comprehensive sex education in schools .
Democrat Garnet Coleman of Houston said he put up the bill at a time when he feared conservative state officials would abandon sex education completely .
" I think the interpretation has morphed into abstinence - only , which is not our policy , " Coleman said .
" If I could fix anything , it'd be to make the law more instructive to say , ' This is what you can teach ' " about contraceptives .
The federal government has spent $ 1.1 billion on funding for abstinence programs since 1982 , according to federal officials .
Texas has spent more than other state — almost $ 117 million , including $ 32.4 million of its own money .
Twenty - two states have rejected money from federally funded abstinence education programs , opting instead for a more comprehensive approach to sex education .
In Texas , some school districts struggle with how much information they can give students in the classroom .
Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe says the state gives school districts " flexibility " about how to teach sex education , but few appear to be doing so .
" It breaks my heart , " Whitney Self , a health teacher at Chapa Middle School in Kyle , said about the uncertainty of how far the district can go when talking about contraception .
In some schools in California , teachers can demonstrate how to wear condoms by rolling them onto bananas .
In Texas , schools are forbidden to hand out condoms or instruct proper use .
Abstinence supporters say it 's the job of parents , not the schools , to determine how much their teenage children know about contraceptives .
" Can you imagine being a parent and having your child come home and tell you all the ways they learned in school that you can ( have sex ) ? " said Republican state Rep. Rob Eissler , chairman of the House Public Education Committee .
Kendra Wilkinson , a Playboy cover model , television star and one of Hugh Hefner 's three live - in girlfriends , professes deep love for the Olive Garden Italian restaurant chain .
The feeling is n't mutual .
To the consternation of Olive Garden 's marketers , who have spent millions crafting the franchise 's family - friendly image , the 23 - year - old adult - entertainment ...
There are many ways to upgrade a computer , but few enhance productivity as expanding your desktop space by adding a second monitor to your system .
If your computer already has an unused monitor connector , setting up another monitor usually involves little more than simply connecting it .
But if you dont have a spare graphics connector , you face the prospect of having to open up the system to add another graphics card or replace your existing one , which may not desirable or even possible in some cases .
If you fall into that second group , EVGA 's the $ 79.99 adapter ‑ the UV Plus + UV16 ‑ offers a hassle - free path to that second monitor .
The UV16 is an external display adapter that connects to your system via USB 2.0 and lets you hook up a standard display ( CRT , LCD , or projector ) without having to crack open your system .
Specs and Compatibility
The UV16 is a square device about the size of a small tape measure that sports an integrated DVI port and comes with a DVI to VGA adapter for use with older analog monitors .
A retractable USB cable is included to connect the device to your system .
The UV Plus+ UV16 works with 32 - or 64 - bit Vista , XP ( 32 - bit only ) and Windows 2000 , and supports a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 allowing it to work with up to a 22 - inch widescreen monitor .
Theres also a slightly less expensive and lower resolution ( $ 59.99 , 1440 x 900 ) UV12 version .
Since the UV Plus+ doesnt contain a conventional graphics processor , it depends on your systems CPU for a helping hand -- the minimum system requirements for the UV Plus + are a 1.2 GHz CPU and 512 MB , but a dual - core processor and 1 GB RAM are recommended ( and required for Vista ) .
A Simple Setup
We tested our UV16 on a Vista desktop system that exceeded the devices recommended system requirements .
Unlike installing or replacing a graphics card , getting the UV16 up and running is quick and easy , and you dont have to power down your system to do it .
After installing the drivers , we connected a 19 - inch Viewsonic monitor to the UV16 and then connected the UV16 to the system .
Within about 30 seconds , the second monitor sprung to life and was running at its native resolution of 1280 x 1024 with our Windows desktop automatically extended across it ( complete with Aero effects like transparent menus ) .
By accessing a control panel via a tray icon we could configure the UV16 to run at any of the monitors supported resolutions , rotate the display to accommodate monitors that can pivot between landscape and portrait modes or physically orient the UV16 display relative to a primary monitor ( e.g. left , right , above or below ) .
This external adapter , the EVGA UV Plus+ UV16 , lets you add up to six monitors to one computer .
Performance
For the most part , programs run on the UV16 display look and act as they would on a conventional graphics card .
We had no trouble running a host of common work applications , like browsers , e-mail and IM utilities , office apps and the like .
Helpfully , when you close an application window running on the UV16 it will open in the same place the next time you launch it , and if you disconnect the UV16 , all of its open windows automatically migrate back to your primary display ( though they dont return to the UV16 when you reconnect it ) .
Given that the UV16 lacks real graphics - rendering brawn , there are some things it cant do very well .
For example , you wont want to run a graphics - intensive game or other 3D - type application on the UV16s display , especially at anything close to full - screen resolution , because the results will be far from satisfying .
The same is true of high - definition or even just relatively high - quality video ‑ attempts to play standard DVDs suffered from minor but perceptible frame rate reductions , and we also noticed that the mouse cursor responsiveness often became sluggish during full - screen video playback .
Having said that , low - and moderate - resolution video of the kind typically streamed from the Internet ( like YouTubes Flash - based video ) played back well and without any ill effects .
The UV16 supports most media players , but not all  it handles Windows Media Player and RealPlayer , but not QuickTime .
If you ve already got two monitors , you can use a UV16 to add up to six devices to a system ( the units have grooves allowing them to stack neatly atop each other ) .
Instead of extending your desktop onto your UV16 - powered monitor , you also have the option to use it to mirror your primary display , a feature that can be useful for demos or any situation where you dont want a large number of people to have to gather around a single monitor .
The UV16s $ 80 price tag is about what youd pay for a halfway - decent graphics card , so it wont really save you any money , but it saves you the hassle of a potentially troublesome trip inside your system .
While the EVGA UV Plus + UV 16 is nt a no-compromise way to get more desktop real estate , it is a low - compromise option , which will make it an attractive one for many .
Price : $ 79.99 ( MSRP )
Pros :
Offers simple way to add extra monitors without adding or replacing internal graphics card ; supports high - resolutions and widescreen displays
Cons : Costs as much as a conventional graphics card ; not appropriate for graphics - intensive applications or high - resolution video

Hello friends
Having tuned in today to KPFA Radio / Pacifica Radio , which gave six hours of coverage of the Congressional quasi- impeachment hearings , or at least the floor time as gesture in the direction of impeachment hearings ..... I was so disgusted with what I heard coming out of the mouths of Congress members that I clicked off the radio .
Then I tuned back in later .
Just in time to hear about people being kicked out of the room by John Conyers because of the crime of " holding signs which are not allowed to be in this room " , according to a Congress member .
And Conyers backed that official .
It 's important to note that those accused of the crime of bearing signs had not made one peep the entire time the hearings had commenced .
They were absolutely peaceful and not disruptive .
Well , America ai n't no free speech country no more , or at least , that 's how John Conyers wants it .
Because he started to kick out those guilty of the crime of wearing impeachment buttons and bearing signs of undisclosed statements .
And of course , when protesting their first amendment rights , sign - bearers were arrested .
Free speech America , eh ?
To her credit , Congresswoman Maxine Waters objected and told a policeman not to arrest a sign - bearing person .
Friends , please do n't let this slide by .
Please write letters to the editor about how unconstitutional such government censorship is .
Come on , those in Congress know that .
Shame them in public !
Make people aware of what is really going on .
Create a wave of objections !
Ask people to fax Conyers and reprimand him .
Then we get the lame , lame " excuses " why not to impeach .
You know , " distractions from what we need to do , " " we must be very judicious in choosing when to impeach " ( like a string of war crimes and Constitutional breaches is not such a moment ?
And of course , a sex act is the right moment to be " Judicious " about impeaching ?
Thank you , my friends in Congress ; we know you for just who you are ! )
And above all , " fear those Muslim terrorists " .
That 's really reason not to impeach , eh ?
Well , I want to give it to you straight .
The links and facts below will prove what I have repeatedly and vociferously been stating on this forum all along :
It ai n't no terrorists being targeted in post - 911 America .
It is , by and large , activists .
I am asking you friends , please , to pass these links and facts around everywhere .
Because with the impeachment hearings going on , this ain't no time to support the illusion that we are fighting a legitimate war on terror .
Instead , it 's time to break through the lies and give the scoop for what it is :
The war OF terror is a phrase I am repeating on purpose , because I am hoping that activists on this forum will pass it around everywhere you walk , talk , and write .
Check this link out first :
It 's short , but it tells the whole story .
For those of you who have not seen this when I circulated it previously , it is an actual declassified FBI document downloaded from the ACLU 's website , titled " International Terrorism Matters " .
See for yourself who is being investigated as " international terrorists " , and why .
But before you do , let me add as a ps to the picture which is worth a thousand words , that civil disobedience is NOT illegal as objected by one ignorant person who saw this .
It is , in fact , a protected form of free speech under the first amendment , the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances , so long as it does not become violent :
http://www.aclu.org/safefree/spyfiles/28000res20060314.html
Here is my other favorite link , which shows how the FBI is cracking down on individuals for such crimes as bird watching , and others who are shackled / humiliated / put into contorting positions because of the suspicion of appearing to be Middle Eastern : http://www.rightsmatter.org/multimedia/
Here is another link with a poingnant statement by the ACLU 's Ann Beeson : " Since when did feeding the homeless become a terrorist activity ? " asked ACLU Associate Legal Director Ann Beeson .
" When the FBI and local law enforcement target groups like Food Not Bombs under the guise of fighting terrorism , many Americans who oppose government policies will be discouraged from speaking out and exercising their rights . "
http://www.aclu.org/safefree/spying/17548prs20050518.html
In fact , the ACLU 's clients --- formally accused as " terrorists " by the Bush Administration ---- include Amnesty International , Greenpeace , Food Not Bombs , Common Cause , and others .
The ACLU itself is being spied on , as documented by more than 1000 FBI pages of spying on the ACLU .
Fear ye , fear ye ??
Ohh , terrorists .
Right .
Be afraid .
Be very afraid .
Really , these " terrorists " are very good reason not to impeach .
Huh ?
Repeat :
The above - named " terrorist " organizations are very good reason NOT to impeach .
WHAT'S THE REAL MOTIVE HERE ???
We 'd better ask the question , in public .
Sometimes it 's dangerous to be ignorant .
Grill politicians , put them on the spot , in public !
Tell them in open letters to the editor and the Internet , that these " terrorists " being good reason NOT to impeach shows one hell of a motive on that Congressperson 's part !
Get the truth out there !
Let people realize what 's really at stake .
And let them think about it , too !
( Glare ..... )
In fact , according to former FBI agent Mike German , now counsel to the ACLU , between the years 2003 - 2005 , 183,000 National Security Letters were issued , 53 % of them for Americans .
That 's 1,270 per week , folks , at about 674 per week for Americans .
To boot , said Mike German , in that three - year time frame , only ONE terrorist was caught .
Talk about , errrr .... literally beating around the Bush .
Let 's make this very clear : National Security Letters are gag order - carrying FBI - issued subpoenas for " terrorist " phone , internet , library , and medical records .
Anybody ordered to fork YOUR records over to the Feds who tells even their girlfriend about it , risks being jailed for five years .
That 's free speech America under the Patriot Act .
The FBI now has the unilateral , whim - based discretion under which s/he may order such an investigation , thanks again to the deliberately misnamed Patriot Act .
( You can read more about this on the ACLU 's website , www.aclu.org punch in " Patriot Act Fact Sheets " into the search box and it will come up ) .
To qualify , " an authorized investigation " as per the Patriot Act requirement , also involves no judicial review or warrant .
Therefore , as attorney Stephen Schulhofer points out in the excellent book " Liberty Under Attack " , basically " the FBI is self - certifying that they are acting in good faith " .
No wonder the numbers of NSL 's exploded after the passage of the Patriot Act , since it requires no warrant or judicial review .
Prior to that passage , when FBI agents had to go through the painstaking judicial review and warranting process , the numbers were less than twelve per year .
Give the FBI one inch and they will take five hundred miles .
Check out which librarian " terrorist " was served such a National Security Letter ( NSL ) and gagged until the ACLU finally was able to get the gag lifted in court .
Even the ACLU attorneys could n't talk .
No wonder we Americans think we still have free speech !
Things are so secret that even Congress * ca n 't * know the extent of the FBI abuses and even attorneys can't talk .
Check out this true story here , printed by the Washington Post :
www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201882_pf.html
News of the classified ( FBI ) bulletin ( about FBI crack - downs on dissent ) also comes on the heels of an ACLU lawsuit against the Secret Service for the continuing practice of allowing pro-Bush protesters to remain visible to cameras during presidential appearances , and corralling anti-Bush protesters into pens or designated areas far from the media : http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/16960prs20031123.html www.aclu.org/safefree/general/20073prs20050718.html
This link takes you to the ACLU 's statement that they , as an organization , are being spied on ( more than a thousand FBI pages about the ACLU ) , as are other groups .
Ohh , lest ye think I have forgotten .
Those in Guantanamo have been proven innocent by the Center for Constitutional Rights and the ACLU ---- about 98 % of them , anyway .
The ACLU 's movie " Stop the Abuse of Power " stated that ( during the time that movie was made ) there were 850 Guantanamo detainees , and ( in my best recollection ) about twelve of them were guilty .
No " Best recollection " talking here :
The ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rights echo each other with unremitting consistency , in stating that those released from Guantanamo were let go " Without so much as being charged with a single crime " .
The most recent announcement ( less than two weeks ago ) on the Guns and Butter radio show , in which Michael Ratner of the CCR was interviewed , was that there are currently 250 Guantanamo detainees .
Again , most of them innocent , yet they are not being released , said Michael Ratner .
It just goes to say that a mere newspaper photograph plus a blurb about someone in captivity , said to be a terrorist ringleader , is not ample burden of proof .
Knowing that these victims have no access to an attorney ( if they are lucky enough to have an attorney fighting for them ) , no access to their own so - called " trials " , and no right to challenge the " legal " grounds for their detentions , it just goes to say how gullible we Americans really are .
Please spread word and get people thinking about this !
Does everybody feel really safe now , knowing that kidnapping and torture is sanctioned world - wide by the Bush Administration , including the kidnapping of American " terrorists " ?
Fear ye , fear ye , do n't impeach , please !
( I am being as sarcastic as they come .
Mark my words ! )
Just within the last week , during quasi- impeachment hearings ( Or better said , floor time given Kucinich and his 13 highly credible witnesses as gesture of diplomacy ) New York Congressman Maurice Hinchey said an interesting thing :
While he called the Afghanistan attacks " Successful " , he also said that something " interesting " happened .
He said that Ashcroft simply let Bin Laden go and make his escape .
Hmmm ....
Then there 's the no-fly " terrorists " ---- all one million of them , according to the latest ACLU statistic ---- including infants .
Because you see , the US Government is so strong on terror that they have to target babies who can't walk yet , because their name happens to match someone else 's name on the terrorist database .
That person 's name , by the way , happens to be someone like Joe Smith , whose name also matches some other Joe Smith's .
Or for that matter , as computer sorting goes , Josephine Smith .
Does everybody feel really safe , now ?
But no matter .
The " Real " terrorists who have actually and officially been targeted by the FBI , include Cat Stevens among them , who penned the song " Morning Has Broken " .
He became the reason why a plane was grounded .
You see , he is Islamic and therefore , if a Buddhist or Catholic or Jew had been on board , it also would have been just as good reason for grounding that plane .
Or , that 's at least the point I am making .
The War OF Terror is a war based on racial profiling , and not much more .
Well , let me correct myself .
It is LOTS more .
It 's all about who is " for or against us " as Bush famously said .
Those against the Bush Administration 's war profiteering and oil money are classified as " Terrorists " .
Like the University of California , Berkeley Students Against the Iraq War , who testified in a live ACLU Town Hall meeting in San Francisco , that they are being tracked by surveillance cameras and queried by police about speakers on campus .
LIke Greenpeace , who threatens the Bush oil - money agenda .
Good " terrorists " , eh ?
Fear ye , fear ye !
Everybody quake in your boots !
Well , I suggest we all work together as citizen journalists to get this " terrorism " matter on the public radar , once and for all .
Smash those myths of fear and initimidation !
Embarrass the officials claiming to be so tough on terror , publicly !
Grill them in radio talk shows .
Grill them in letters to the editor , publicly , and hand them a copy of it !
Tell the public and the officials , in no uncertain terms , that We the People ai n't puttin ' up with no more lies , and no more fussin ' and a - fightin ' !
WHAT TO DO IF A LOVED ONE IS ON THE NO - FLY LIST OR IS VICTIM OF SECRET RENDITION / TORTURE :
Immediately contact :
Electronic Frontier Foundation www.eff.org for no -fly list and electronic spying cases
ACLU www.aclu.org for torture cases and spying cases and more

The storm , still south of Cuba on Wednesday evening , could veer from Florida to the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico , but its current path is aimed at southern Louisiana and Mississippi , which bore the brunt of Hurricane Katrina .
Because any evacuation would have to be declared well in advance , officials warned residents to stay alert .
“ It ’s still too early to tell exactly what it will do , ” Jerry Sneed , the city ’s director of emergency preparedness , said at a news briefing in City Hall .
“ Way too early to give a good timeline . ”
Gustav was downgraded to a tropical storm after grazing Haiti as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 miles per hour .
The Associated Press reported that 15 people were killed on Haiti ’s southern peninsula , while 8 died in a landslide in the neighboring Dominican Republic .
The storm was thought likely to intensify in the warm Gulf waters , with forecasters saying it could be as close as 300 miles from the mouth of the Mississippi River on Sunday afternoon as a Category 3 hurricane , with winds of 120 m.p.h .
At that strength officials here would order a mandatory evacuation of the city 60 hours before the predicted landfall .
The highways would become one - way exit routes for people with cars .
Those without cars would be transported by bus or train , officials said , unlike in the period before Hurricane Katrina , when the plan was to shelter those residents in the Superdome .
That arena and the Convention Center , which became symbols of human misery after Katrina , will not be used as hurricane shelters .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in Baghdad Sunday for the start of a historic two - day trip , said " visiting Iraq without the dictator is a good thing . "
The Shiite - led Iraqi government rolled out the red carpet , literally , for Ahmadinejad as he became the first Iranian president to visit Iraq , a country that was a bitter enemy when Saddam Hussein 's Sunni government was in power .
Ahmadinejad , at a joint news conference with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , said the trip " opens a new chapter in bilateral ties with Iraq . "
" We have had good talks in a friendly and constructive environment , " Ahmadinejad said .
" We have the same understanding of things and the two parties are determined to strengthen their political , economic and cultural cooperation . "
Later in the day , Ahmadinejad met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
Both al - Maliki and Talabani have made official trips to Iran since taking office .
At a joint news conference with al - Maliki in Baghdad 's Green Zone , Ahmadinejad did not hide his disdain for the United States and its leadership .
" ( U.S. President ) Bush always accuses others without evidence and this increases problems , " Ahmadinejad said .
" The Americans have to understand that Iraqi people do not like America . "
Watch Ahmadinejad comment on the U.S. presence in Iraq »
The United States has accused Iran of supporting some insurgent groups in Iraq , including supplying EFPs , the deadliest and most sophisticated type of roadside bomb .
Ahmadinejad shunned the security measures followed by many other leaders on visits to Baghdad , riding from Baghdad 's airport in a civilian - style sedan -- and not an armored military vehicle or helicopter -- to central Baghdad .
His official welcome and meeting with Talabani was at the presidential house outside of the heavily - fortified International Zone where most high - level events in Baghdad are held .
Ahmadinejad said a unified and powerful Iraq is in the best interest of Iran and all its neighbors .
" Iraqi people are passing through a critical situation but as we know , the Iraqi people will overcome the situation and the Iraq of tomorrow will be a powerful , developed and unique Iraq , " he said .
Ahmadinejad was warmly welcomed in Baghdad .
An Iraqi military band played the Iranian and Iraqi national anthems as Ahmadinejad and Talabani stood side - by - side at the end of a long red carpet outside the presidential house .
Ahmadinejad then walked down the carpet where he was greeted by two Iraqi children with flowers and a long line of Iraqi officials .
Ahead of his trip , Ahmadinejad said it would " contribute to regional peace and security " and stressed that the people of Iran and Iraq share close bonds .
" My visit to Iraq is to the benefit of all countries , because if there 's peace , if we establish peace and put an end to ( U.S. ) occupation , that will be to the benefit of all countries , " the Iranian leader told Tehran - based Press TV before his departure .
Although Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after a territorial dispute , and the two countries fought an eight - year war , Ahmadinejad said the nations share a common history .
" The people of Iran and Iraq have close bonds , and there are many holy shrines in Iraq , " he said .
" People travel there , so we have age - old , historical bonds and common civilization . "
He noted that Iraq has a new government , and is an " independent state . "
" We should help them , " he added .
On Monday , the U.N. Security Council votes on a resolution that would impose new sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt uranium enrichment .
" We do n't care about new resolutions .
In such a case , the world would realize that even the United Nations has been oppressed , " Ahmadinejad said .
" The United Nations has turned into an instrument . "
The nuclear issue , he said , has been " politicized . "
" They cannot force the Iranian nation to engage in negotiations , but if they commit such a blunder , that would be a major blow to mechanisms they use for having their power , " Ahmadinejad said .
He said the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , has confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran 's nuclear program .
The United States and other nations have accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons , which Iran denies .
On the Israeli attacks waged against Palestinian militants in Gaza , Ahmadinejad said , " They are launching strikes against Gaza , and this is a starting point , and this scheme is doomed to failure , and this time the Israelis will be eradicated . "
Asked about Iran 's parliamentary elections on March 14 , Ahmadinejad said there are about 5,400 candidates -- 600 of them from different political parties .
He said all the candidates would receive " equal chances , " although critics say hundreds of reformists have been disqualified from voting .

All About Mahmoud Ahmadinejad • Iran • Iraq • Jalal Talabani • International Atomic Energy Agency • United Nations
Recently , one of my colleagues , a pediatric gastroenterologist , told me about a teenage boy who had come to see him because of severe stomach pain he ’d had for about two months .
The boy had been referred by his primary care doctor , who had evaluated him for several possible causes , including infections and ulcers .
That doctor had also recommended or prescribed a variety of medications to relieve the pain , but to no avail .
The specialist performed an endoscopy , in which a camera is inserted into a patient ’s esophagus and down into the stomach and upper part of the small intestine .
The findings were impressive : severe inflammation , bleeding and ulcerations in a part of the small intestine called the duodenum , the portion of the intestine closest to the stomach .
When the medical team ’s members went back and got further history , they learned that the teen had been drinking several Redline energy drinks a day .
Energy drinks , including Red Bull , Rockstar and Full Throttle , have become extremely popular over the last decade because they can give lift when needed , such as when studying for finals or partying into the wee hours .
The energy drink industry is worth about $ 2.5 billion in the United States , according to a 2006 report in Fortune magazine , and it has grown 700 % since 2000 , earning manufacturers millions of dollars , primarily by marketing to teens and young adults .

The staple ingredient in energy drinks is caffeine -- lots of it .
If you ’re wondering how much caffeine energy drinks have compared with other beverages , here ’s your answer , according to the caffeine database at www.energyfiend.com:
8 ounces of tea ( brewed ) : 47 milligrams
12 ounces Coca - Cola : 34 milligrams
12 ounces Sunkist : 41 milligrams
Advertisement
8 ounces coffee : 108 milligrams
8 ounces Red Bull : 80 milligrams
8 ounces Redline RTD : 250 milligrams
Those who love caffeinated beverages such as coffee probably , at one time or another , have experienced the heartburn they can cause .
This is a known effect of caffeine .
In excess , such drinks can irritate the lining of the gut , leading to severe pain .
As with this teenager , they can tear you up on the inside .

Though his situation is probably a rarity , reports of serious medical events because of caffeine are increasing .
A recent three - year study of calls to a Chicago poison center found more than 250 cases of caffeine - supplement overdose , with 12 % of those requiring hospitalization .
Nearly two - thirds of the hospitalizations involved the intensive care unit .
Symptoms included insomnia , palpitations , tremors , sweating , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and chest pains .
The average age of patients was 21 .
Another poison center study focused on Redline .
Nine cases requiring hospitalization related to this specific drink were reported in the California Poison Control System database in a two - year period , with severe symptoms involved .
Besides traditional forms of caffeine , many energy drinks include caffeine - containing substances such as guarana , a South American plant whose seeds are crushed and added as a stimulant .
Other common ingredients include ginseng ( thought to increase endurance , although studies have never proved it ) , carnitine ( a protein thought to improve muscle performance , but again , that claim remains unproved ) and other snake oil we do n’t know a whole lot about .
All of these ingredients are classified as nutritional supplements by the Food and Drug Administration , meaning they can be sold over - the - counter without any trials to demonstrate their effectiveness or safety .
The label on Redline recommends consuming no more than one a day .
Clearly , though , few consumers seem to notice the small print ( and there ’s little motivation to make it larger , because a four - bottle pack of Redline can cost about $ 15 ) .
There seem to be two lessons here .
For starters , getting high on energy drinks can be hazardous to your health .
Second , parents and those of us who work with children need to be aware of how popular the drinks have become .
As with other high - risk behaviors such as drinking alcohol and smoking , we may need to clearly ask and counsel young people about their risks .

As for the Redline - guzzling teenager , he was given medication to relieve his gastritis -- and strictly forbidden to consume caffeinated products .

A search engine hacker has uncovered fresh evidence that the Chinese women 's gymnastic team cheated by fielding underage competitors .
Doubts surfaced even before the competition that as many as half the members of the six - strong team - who won China 's first ever team gold medal at the Beijing Olympics last week - are far younger than the minimum age of 16 .
He Kexin , Jiang Yuyuan and Yang Yilin were all too young to compete , AP reports .
AP based its reports on registration lists filed by Chinese authorities in the years 2004 to 2006 .
Subsequent media reports have mentioned articles by Chinese official press agency Xinhua .
Much of this information has since been pulled by Chinese authorities , but enterprising hackers have found digital remnants of incriminating files .
Search engine hacker Stryde Hax has unearthed copies of official registration documents by Chinese sporting authorities ( the General Administration of Sport ) that show the age of a Chinese double gold medal winning gymnast to be 14 - two years younger than the age that appears on her government - issued passport .
The Excel files , purged by censors from the official site and from Google 's document cache , were found in the document translation cache of Chinese search engine Baidu .
Stryde Hax 's findings ( here ) reveal that He Kexin , who won individual gold on the uneven bars as well as a team gold , was born on 1 January 1994 ( rather than 1992 , as per her official passport and birth certificate ) .
Under competition rules introduced to protect youngsters , gymnasts must be aged 16 during the year of an Olympics in order to be eligible .
Younger girls have more flexible bodies , giving them an unfair advantage .
All this ought to be the focus of an investigation by the International Olympics Committeee or the gymnastics governing body ; but such is the desire of both to avoid doing anything to offend their Chinese hosts that it 's very unlikely anything will happen .
Questioned about the age controversy , IOC President Jacques Rogge said it was n't its role to check up on the age of athletes .
" The IOC relies on the international federations , who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes , " Rogge said .
" It 's not the task of the IOC to check every one of the 10,000 athletes . "
The minimum age for gymnasts was raised from 14 to 15 in the 1980s , then to 16 in 1997 .
Issues of age falsification are n't new ; North Korea , Romania and China have all fielded underage competitors in the past , AP notes .
Olympic games medallists Gina Gogean and Alexandra Marinescu of Romania and Sydney Olympics double bronze medalist Yang Yun of China all competed under the eligible age , they have since admitted .
North Korea was kicked out of the 1993 world championships after it was discovered that had listed a gold medallist at the previous games as being only 15 for three years on the trot .
Stryde Hax ( the nom - de plume of Mike Walker , a principal consultant for the security outfit Intrepidus Group ) said he does n't have strong opinions about the age limit for gymnastic competitions , and simply undertook his investigation out of intellectual curiosity .
He adds that he has nothing against the Chinese people either .
" While I may disagree with the effort the Chinese government is making to conceal this young woman 's age , I have the utmost respect for the Chinese people , " he writes , " and I believe that united they will be able to make state - sponsored censorship a thing of the past . " ®
Invalidation of a law because it is thought to be too broad is “ strong medicine ” that is not to be “ casually employed , ” Justice Scalia wrote , citing earlier Supreme Court rulings and declaring that the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit had employed the strong medicine too casually in the case at hand .
Monday ’s decision in United States v. Williams reinstated the conviction of Michael Williams of Florida , who was caught in a federal undercover operation in April 2004 and found guilty later of “ pandering ” child pornography , a charge defined in part as promoting or distributing real or “ purported ” material in a way that reflects the belief  or is intended to persuade another  that the material is indeed child pornography .
Mr. Williams was nabbed offering to trade nude pictures of his young daughter and other forms of child pornography in an Internet chat room .
He did not actually have pictures of his daughter , but he did have 22 pornographic images of other children on his computer hard drive .
He pleaded guilty to possessing that material , which has long been a crime , and was sentenced to five years in prison .
That aspect of the case against him was not part of the Supreme Court argument .
Instead , lawyers on his behalf challenged the “ pandering ” charge , which also carries a five - year sentence , asserting that it was so “ overly broad ” as to violate the First Amendment guarantee of free speech .
The 11th Circuit found that argument persuasive , reasoning that offering a copy of “ Snow White ” on false claims that it depicts minors engaging in sex could be construed as criminal behavior .
But Justice Scalia dismissed the 11th Circuit ’s finding , its reliance on what he considered far - fetched hypothetical situations and the notion that the statute under review would cause all sorts of fact - finding problems .
Judges and juries are routinely called upon to assess difficult issues of fact and intent involving charges like conspiracy , incitement and solicitation , he wrote .
Two men pushed a woman onto railway tracks after she told them to stop smoking , police have said .
The woman , 58 , suffered a broken wrist and bruises to her legs at Farningham Road station in Kent but officers said she was lucky to be alive .
She landed inches away from the live third rail , which carries 750 volts .
Det Insp Bob Richardson said it appeared the woman had spoken to the two men about smoking earlier in the week .
He said the woman walked along the London - bound platform and was pushed onto the line as she passed the men at 0700 BST on Wednesday .
This is clearly a serious situation and our concern is for the woman at this time
Southeastern statement
The woman was taken to hospital and released after treatment , he added .
Det Insp Richardson said : " The woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured . "
Police were looking into a number of leads and were viewing CCTV from the station , he said .
A statement from rail operator Southeastern said : " This is clearly a serious situation and our concern is for the woman at this time . "
Fellow commuters pulled the woman from the tracks .
Train services between Kent and London were disrupted during the morning rush hour because the power had to be turned off .
One of the men was described as white , in his mid 20s , and about 6ft , with a stocky build .
He had short cropped brown hair and was wearing beige shorts , a green round - necked T - shirt and trainers .
The other man was white and in his early 20s with a medium build , bright red shorts and a dark top .
Officers are trying to establish what the men did after the attack .

Ferrari-loving book dealer arrested after 10 - year hunt for £ 15 m Shakespeare manuscript
An eccentric book dealer was being questioned last night in connection with a stolen Shakespeare manuscript worth up to £ 15 million .
Raymond Scott , 51 , was arrested at the semi- detached home he shares with his elderly mother in connection with the disappearance of the 17th - century treasure .
Regarded as the most important printed work in English , Shakespeare 's First Folio was among several items of astonishing rarity snatched ten years ago from Durham University library in an audacious daytime raid .
The cover and frontispiece of the stolen William Shakespeare 's Comedies , Histories & Tragedies first folio , published in 1623
At the time , police suspected an international gang of art thieves and launched a global investigation involving the FBI and specialist art detectives .
But yesterday they dramatically announced the hunt for the ' irreplaceable ' book was over - as details emerged about Mr Scott 's extraordinary life on a run-down housing estate in Washington , Tyne and Wear .
As he was taken away for questioning , neighbours painted a bizarre picture of him emerging from his home in a silk dressing gown and wrap - around sunglasses to iron the seats of his yellow Ferrari - before taking a bus into town to do his shopping .
When not at home with his 80 - year - old mother Hannah , Mr Scott travelled the world and wore Armani suits .
He was described as ' wacky ' and ' harmless ' and neighbours said they could not believe he had anything to do with the Shakespeare theft .
But police are investigating whether the snatched treasure , rather than being touted around underworld art markets in far - flung corners of the world , had been hidden in Britain all along .
Shakespeare 's First Folio - printed in 1623 , seven years after his death - is the definitive anthology on which all subsequent collections are based .
Yellow Ferrari : Raymond Scott would polish his car and then take the bus instead
The goatskin - bound edition , in near - perfect condition , was stolen in December 1998 from an exhibition at Durham University library .
Also taken were an ancient handwritten New Testament and other treasures of early English literature including an edition of Beowulf , a 14th - century manucript containing a fragment of a poem by Canterbury Tales author Geoffrey Chaucer , and two works by the 10th century scholar Aelfric , printed in 1566 .
The thief or thieves had breezed into the library reading room during opening hours and waited for a quiet moment to jemmy open two glass cabinets .
Staff did not even notice the books were missing at first because the cabinets were covered with cloths to protect them from light .
Police feared the ancient books had been snatched to order and spirited out of the country .
Two weeks ago , police in Durham were alerted by the British Embassy in Washington after a man walked into the Folger Shakespeare Library with the folio and asked them to verify it was genuine .
According to police sources , the man returned a day later bearing gifts of cigars and cakes for the staff and asked whether they had had been successful .
They are said to have replied that it would take another fortnight - then contacted the FBI .
A police spokesman said : ' It is understood he told staff he was an international businessman who had bought the folio in Cuba and agreed to leave it with the library for research to be carried out .
Their checks revealed it as the one stolen from Durham . '
Bill Bryson , the university 's chancellor and author of an acclaimed book on Shakespeare , said : ' This is not only wonderful news for Durham University , but for all Shakespeare 's scholars and fans around the world . '
The vice - chancellor , Professor Chris Higgins , said : ' Staff and the community felt a huge sense of loss when the books were stolen , so you can imagine my delight when I received the call to say the First Folio had been found .
' Our security has been enhanced to the highest standards since the theft and we are confident the First Folio will be safe when it arrives back in Durham .
We also very much hope that the other books stolen at the same time will be found soon . '
Detective Superintendent Andy Reddick , who is coordinating the inquiry , said the Shakespeare edition remained in the safe care of the Folger Library .
Officers in the inquiry were said to have discovered a large number of old books .
A neighbour of Mr Scott , Tara Etemadi , a 26 - year - old cashier , said he was 6ft , dark - haired and well - groomed .
He drove a new car every year - Lamborghinis , a Rolls - Royce , an Aston Martin and now the Ferrari .
Mr Scott was born in South Shields in 1957 and is believed never to have married .
He ran a bookshop in Newcastle with his father , also called Raymond , until Mr Scott senior died in January
Another neighbour , Tony Armitage , 45 , said : ' When his father died after a long battle with Alzheimer 's , he asked us across for a drink .
I remember that there were books all over the place .
' The spare room was full from the floor to the ceiling with them , and so was the storage cupboard beneath the staircase . '
385 - year history of ' Actor 's Bible '
The First Folio , entitled ' Mr William Shakespeares Comedies , Histories , & Tragedies ' is the first published collection of the playwright 's complete works .
The 36 plays in the folio were prepared by Shakespeare 's colleagues John Heminges and Henry Condell in 1623 , about seven years after his death .
It is believed that around 1,000 copies of the First Folio were printed .
There are 228 still in existence of which only 40 are complete .
The British Library has five copies while the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington D.C. holds the world 's largest collection with 79 .
A complete copy of the First Folio was auctioned at Sotheby 's auction house in July 2006 .
The book , which was in its original 17th - century binding , sold for £ 2.5 million .
Today , the First Folio - despite its variant forms and occasional inconsistencies - is widely known as the ' Actor 's Bible ' .
Some Shakespeare directors choose to use the folio because they believe that modern editions of his plays are heavily edited and have been changed from the original to make them more readable .

Now that Nicole Kidman has finally achieved her life 's goal and given birth to a baby , we can all concentrate on why she gave it such a crappy name .
And actually it seems like there 's quite a simple answer – Nicole Kidman decided to name her new daughter Sunday Rose because she really , really hates Scientology .
Apparently .
You see , Nicole Kidman is a Catholic and Sundays are important to Catholics , but not important to Scientologists , and she used to be a Scientologist , so she called the baby Sunday as a sort of painfully oblique jab at Scientology .
See ?
Insulted , Tom Cruise has vowed to even the score by naming his next child after something that 's important to Scientology , meaning that in a few years we can all say hello to little Unnecessarily Litigious Cruise or Unsettling Public Image Cruise .
Nicole Kidman is n't a bitter woman .
Or at least we do n't think that Nicole Kidman is a bitter woman – we have n't really been able to discern a single identifiable facial expression of hers other than ' mildly startled ' since about 2004 – but if this new report is true then we might have to reverse our decision .
On Monday morning Nicole Kidman finally gave birth to her first biological baby , and we 're absolutely certain that it was a moment of sheer , undiluted , life - changing joy for both her and Keith Urban .
Nothing could have made the moment more perfect .
Well , except for Nicole Kidman deliberately giving the baby a name that would nark off Tom Cruise , anyway .
And that 's what some are saying she did .
Nicole Kidman 's new baby is called Sunday Rose , which is obviously a direct insult to all Scientologists .
Obviously .
Do n't believe us ?
MSNBC has spoken to a source who definitely exists and has obviously got all of the obvious facts :
“ Nicole is a Catholic , and Sunday was an important religious day for her until she was involved in Scientology , ” said the source .
“ She ’s still bitter about her experience with Scientology and the fact her baby ’s name could be perceived as one last jab does n’t exactly upset her . ”
Yeah !
Take that , evil Scientologists !
If naming a baby after a day of the week that has equal importance to every other day for them does n't finish the religion off for good , nothing will !
This is bound to hit Scientology harder than anything since the time that Halle Berry named her baby Nahla Ariela , which is an anagram of Anal Ear Hail , which is – oh , we do n't know – something that Xenu invented or whatever .
Of course , there 's also a report claiming that Nicole Kidman decided to call her baby Sunday Rose because Keith Urban had written a song called Sunday about the baby , and that probably sounds a bit more true .
Note to any Keith Urban fans reading – that 's a brand new song called Sunday as opposed to the existing Keith Urban song Raining On Sunday , which Keith wrote before he met Nicole Kidman and was just a lonely cowboy with a dream of having a baby , naming it Sunday and getting to piss all over it whenever he liked .
We do n't want any confusion .
“ Babies are always more trouble than you thought – and more wonderful . ” – Charles Osgood

Anyone who has kids knows that any life with kids is going to be complicated , at least to some degree .
From extra laundry to bathing and cooking and shopping and driving and school and chores and crises and sports and dance and toys and tantrums , there is no shortage of complications .
You wo n’t get to ultra - simple if your life includes children … but you can find ways to simplify , no matter how many kids you have .
Take my life , for example : I have a house full of kids , and yet I ’ve found ways to streamline my life , to find peace and happiness among the chaos .
How is this magic trick accomplished ?
Nothing magical , actually , but just little things that have simplified my life over the years .
The main magic trick , however : making my family my top priority , and choosing only a small number of priorities in my life .
If you have too many things you want to do , or need to do , your life will become complicated .
But if you choose just a few things that are important to you , you can eliminate the rest , and simplify your life greatly .
What follows is a list that might seem complicated to some — 25 items !
Trust me , I could easily double this list , but I do n’t want to overwhelm you .
Instead of trying to tackle everything on this list at once , choose a few things that appeal to you , and give them a try .
Bookmark this page and come back to it from time to time to try out other ideas .
Best yet , they might inspire new ideas of your own !
Self - sufficiency .
This one tip could simplify your life greatly , over time .
However , it will make things more complicated in the short term .
The idea is to teach your kids to do things for themselves as they get older and more capable .
Teaching them to do something themselves instead of just doing it yourself takes time and can be a little frustrating at first , but it will pay off for years to come .
My kids , for example , can make themselves breakfast , shower and dress themselves , brush their teeth , and generally get themselves ready in the morning with only minimal prompting from us .
They can clean their rooms , wash dishes , sweep , mop , dust , wash the car .
The older ones can cook basic dishes and babysit the younger ones .
This type of self - sufficiency has saved my wife and me tons of time and trouble over the years .
One calendar .
If you have more than one kid , you might have a lot of activities going on that you need to track , from school events such as Christmas performances and parent - teacher conferences to extracurricular activities such as soccer practice , dance classes , or Spring concerts .
Organize your life with a simple calendar ( I use Google Calendar ) and enter all activities and appointments on this one calendar , from kids ’ stuff to your own goings on .
When they hand you papers from school , or soccer schedules , immediately enter everything onto the calendar .
Then a quick glance at the calendar each day will help you plan your day .
Toy bins .
It ’s an inevitable fact of life that kids have lots of toys , and that they will be everywhere .
You will drive yourself crazy if you try to manage them with dictator - like ruthlessness .
Instead , let kids play , but have lots of bins where they can toss the toys inside when they ’re done .
Then cleaning up is a cinch — they just toss everything on the floor into the bins , and move on to making their next mess .
You can have designated bins for certain toys ( this one ’s for Legos , this one ’s for stuffed animals , this one ’s for cars ) , and also have some general - purpose bins for things that do n’t fit anywhere else .
Do n’t be too strict about them — the whole purpose is to make things simpler .
Regular cleanups .
If you ’re like me , you do n’t like a huge mess .
Teach your kids to clean up after themselves — let them make a mess , but every now and then , tell them it ’s time to clean up .
Be sure to tell them to clean up before moving on to something else , such as lunchtime or bedtime .
It ’s good to have regular times during the day when they do cleanups , such as before bed or before they leave for school , so that the house is always clean at night and during the day .
Quiet bedtime routines .
Kids thrive on routine , and no routine is better than the one before they go to sleep .
Have a regular routine before bed — it might consist of cleaning up , showering , brushing their teeth , getting into their pajamas , and reading a book .
Reading aloud to them just before bedtime is a great idea , because it quiets them down after a day of activity , it gives you quality bonding time together , and it gets them into the habit of reading .
Plus , it ’s just something that everyone can enjoy .
Prep the night before .
Mornings can be a hectic time for parents and kids alike , but they do n’t have to be .
Instead , prep as much as possible the night before , and have your mornings be a little more relaxed .
I like to prep lunches , get their clothes ready ( and mine as well ) , and have them shower , get their homework and school bags ready .
Then the morning is simply eating breakfast , a little grooming , getting dressed , and gathering everything together before you head out the door .
It ’s a great way to start your day .
Do n’t schedule too much .
Sometimes we schedule things back - to - back - to - back , so that every minute of every day is planned out .
That leads to stress and problems .
Instead , schedule as little as possible each day , and leave space between events , appointments or activities , so that your day moves along at a more leisurely pace .
Start getting ready earlier than necessary , so there ’s no rush , and leave yourself time to transition from one thing to another .
A more spaced - out schedule is much more relaxing than a cramped one .
Have dedicated family times .
Try to find regular times in your schedule when you do nothing else but spend time together as a family .
For some people , dinner time works well — everyone sits down to dinner together as a family , and no other activities are planned at that time .
For others , weekends , or maybe just one day of the weekend , work better .
We reserve Sundays as our Family Day , and try our best not to schedule anything else on that day .
It ’s something we look forward to .
Weekends in general are for our family , as are evenings — all work gets done on weekdays , before 5 p.m. Simple clothing .
It ’s best to buy clothes for your kids that will match easily — choose a similar color scheme , so that you ’re not always digging through their clothes to find stuff that matches .
Go through their clothes every few months to get rid of stuff that does n’t fit ( kids grow so fast ! ) and donate the old clothes to relatives or charity ( or pass them on to a younger sibling ) .
Keep their wardrobe simple — if it does n’t fit neatly in their drawers , you have to get rid of it or get rid of something else .
Do n’t stuff drawers , or you ’ll make it hard to find stuff .
Also , socks are usually a challenge — use mesh bags , one for clean socks and another for dirty ones .
Then throw the dirty mesh bag in the laundry , and socks wo n’t get lost ( or at least , not as often ) .
Always prep early .
I try to make it a point to look at the schedule in advance ( usually the day before ) to see what ’s coming up .
That allows me to prepare for those events or activities early , so that we are n’t in a rush when we ’re getting ready .
For example , on soccer days , we make sure that all the soccer gear , plus folding chairs and water bottles and snacks and whatnot , are all ready to go beforehand .
Prepping early makes things a lot easier later on .
Always bring snacks .
Kids always get hungry .
So be ready — if you ’re going on the road , pack some snacks in baggies .
Crackers , cheese , fruit , carrot sticks , PB&J sandwiches , graham crackers , peanuts , raisins all make good portable snacks .
An insulated lunch container with re-usable ice packs help keep things fresh .
Also always bring plenty of water , as kids are always thirsty .
Ca n’t help you with the urgent bathroom breaks , though .
Baby wipes and emergency kit .
There will always be messes .
Be ready .
Baby wipes , even after they are past using diapers , are indispensable for all kinds of messes .
Pack them in a little “ emergency kit ” that might include medical supplies , reading material , activities , a towel , and extra clothes — anything you can think of that might prepare you for anything that regularly arises .
Pack spare clothes .
We have a little carry - on luggage that ’s always packed with a couple of changes of clothes for each kid — good clothes ( for a party or something ) , regular clothes , underwear , socks .
This way we ’re always ready , if there ’s an accident , or should they want to spend the night with grandparents or a cousin while we ’re out at a party or something .
It ’s indispensable .
Create weekly routines .
Aside from regular family times ( mentioned above ) , it ’s good to have a weekly routine that ’s written out and posted somewhere everyone can see it .
A weekly routine might include regular practice times , house cleaning day , washing the car , yard work day , errands day , recurring appointments , etc .
This makes the schedule more predictable for everyone , and eliminates a lot of surprises .
Communicate as a family .
Regular communication between family members solves a lot of problems .
Have regular times when the family can talk about family issues .
Dinnertime is a good time for that .
We also have a weekly “ Family Meeting ” where we all sit down and talk about household issues , we compliment and thank each other , we plan our Family Day , and we play a fun game at the end .
Go on dates .
If you have trouble finding alone time with each child ( whether you have one child or more than one ) , setting up “ dates ” can be a good way to ensure that you do things together .
Make a date with your child for a specific day and time , and together you should decide what you want to do on that date .
It can be something simple , like taking a walk in your neighborhood or in a park , reading together , playing board games , sports or video games , or it can be something like going to a restaurant or movie or amusement park .
If you have lots of kids , you might have to rotate dates with them .
Create alone time for your spouse .
It ’s easy to become so busy with your kids that you forget about your significant other .
Do n’t let this happen — it ’s a sure way to drift apart and lose that bond that led you to having a family together .
Keep the relationship alive by getting a babysitter ( maybe once a week ) and doing something together , just the two of you .
Let things go sometimes .
I ’m not always good at this , but it ’s something I work on constantly : do n’t always be so strict .
Let things go .
They ’re kids — let them live .
I have a tendency to be very strict about things , but I remind myself constantly that it ’s not worth all the hassle to get on their cases about things .
Instead , let things go , and just relax .
They ’ll turn out just fine in the end , as long as you love and support them .
Make decluttering a family event .
I like to set aside one day every few months when we go through all the stuff in our rooms and declutter .
We do it together , and it can be a bonding time .
We end up with trash bags full of junk , boxes full of stuff to donate or give to family , and in the end , much simpler rooms .
It ’s very satisfying .
Spend quiet time at home .
Often we get so busy that we ’re on the road all the time , going to one thing or another .
And when we have family time , that ’s often spent on road too — going to movies or restaurants or other fun events .
But that can be exhausting , and expensive .
Instead , try to spend time at home as often as you can .
You can watch a DVD instead of going to the movies , and pop some popcorn .
You can play board games or go outside and play a sport .
You can read to each other , or by yourselves , or tell stories .
There are dozens of things you can do at home that cost nothing , and that are relaxing and fun .
Create traditions .
Kids love traditions , from holiday traditions to family traditions .
My mom likes all our kids to come over before Christmas to make Christmas cookies , or come over before Easter to color eggs .
The kids love those traditions .
You might also create some traditions at your house , whether that ’s a family dinner time , Family Meetings or Family Day , or anything that brings you together .
If you make it a regular thing , and give it special importance , it will be a tradition , and it will be something your kids remember into adulthood .
Make cooking and cleaning a family thing .
Cooking and cleaning can be complicated things , and they can take your time away from your kids .
Doing these activities as a family solves both problems — having everyone pitch in can really simplify cooking and cleaning , and it gives you quality time together while teaching your children valuable life skills .
Make it fun — let them choose recipes , go shopping for ingredients with you .
See how quickly you can clean the whole house — if my whole family pitches in , we can do it in about 30 - 40 minutes .
Make everything a game or a challenge .
Reduce commitments .
This tip applies to both your commitments and your kids ’ commitments .
If you have too many , your life will be complicated .
If you reduce your commitments , your life will be simplified .
It ’s that simple .
Make a list of all your family ’s commitments and see which ones align with your priorities , and which ones are the most important .
Which ones give you the most joy and benefit ?
And which ones just drain your time and energy without giving you much back in return ?
Keep the essential commitments — yours and your kids — and eliminate as many of the rest as possible .
Get active .
These days , kids can become very inactive ( and unhealthy ) with all the TV , Internet and video games they consume .
Get them active by going outside with them and taking walks , going for swims , playing sports .
My family likes to play soccer or kickball .
Play freeze tag .
If you run , let your kids run with you , at least part of the way .
Get them bikes and go to the park .
Do challenges , like races or pushup or pullup challenges .
Make it fun , but get them active .
How does this simplify your life ?
It means they consume less media , which in my opinion is a complicating factor .
And even better , it gets them healthy in an inexpensive way , reducing your healthcare costs down the road .
Focus on doing , not on spending .
Too often we send messages to our kids about how to live life , based on what we do : we like to go shopping , and eat out , and go to the movies , and so our kids learn that having fun means spending money .
We focus on material things , and therefore so do they .
Instead , teach them ( by talking but also by your actions ) that what ’s important is doing stuff , not buying stuff .
Go for walks in the park , play outdoors , play board games , read , tell stories , play charades , cook and clean , go to the beach or lake , build stuff , wash the car .
Spend quality time together , doing stuff that does n’t cost money .

How much patience you have , for instance . ” – Franklin P. Jones
Book Writing Update : I wrote two hours and a chapter of my book today !

Unlike many criminal defense attorneys in private practice , Mr. Kroger has never prosecuted or investigated anyone on behalf of a governmental entity .
He has never worked to put anyone behind bars .
Mr. Kroger has always been 100 % defense - oriented , and he maintains a laser focus on checking the powers of the prosecution and law enforcement .
This is the distinctive mindset that is needed for criminal defense work .
Many people get into a car after drinking with friends , confident that they have not consumed enough alcohol to adversely affect their blood alcohol concentration , such that they should not be driving .
The legal limit is .08 % .
However , you can be arrested and convicted for driving under the influence even if you do not meet the legal limit .
Under California Vehicle Code 23152 ( a ) , it is a misdemeanor to drive under the influence of an alcoholic beverage .
The outcomes of DUI cases depend heavily on the specific facts , which is one reason why it is critical to hire an experienced criminal defense attorney in the Los Angeles area if you have been charged with drunk driving .
We can look closely at your situation to determine whether there are procedural , constitutional , or substantive challenges that we can raise in your defense .
There are a wide range of drug crimes in California , including drug possession , possession for sale , distribution , manufacturing , and transportation .
The types of drugs are divided into five different schedules that are punished differently .
For example , Schedule I includes opiates , mescaline , and cocaine base , while Schedule III includes hallucinogens .
The appropriate defense against a drug crime will be dictated by the situation .
Defenses can include medical necessity , a lack of knowledge or intent , an illegal search and seizure , challenging lab results based on problems with the analysis , or showing that a doctor had issued a prescription for the drug .
Domestic violence is not a separate crime in California .
Instead , if a crime qualifies as domestic violence , the penalties will be more serious .
A crime qualifies as domestic violence if the victim and the defendant have a certain household or family relationship .
Under California Penal Code section 273.5 , spousal abuse can be charged if the defendant and the complainant are current or former spouses , current or former cohabitants , fiancés , currently or previously in a dating relationship , or co-parents of a child .
Los Angeles criminal defense attorney William S. Kroger can help you fight to keep your record clean and avoid any collateral consequences of a domestic violence conviction .
These may include a restraining order , restrictions on your gun rights , restrictions on child custody or visitation , and immigration consequences for non-citizens .
Some common theft crimes include embezzlement , forgery , identity theft , robbery , and receiving stolen property .
Other types of theft can include misappropriating entrusted property , fraudulently obtaining credit , failing to return leased property , or illegally transferring a credit card .
What must be proven depends on the specific theft crime being charged .
Under California Penal Code section 211 , for example , robbery occurs when somebody feloniously takes another person ’s personal property from their person or immediate presence and against their will , through force or fear .
Generally , the law classifies the severity of the crime according to the value of the property taken .
The value of the property is measured by its reasonable and fair market value .
As of January 1 , 2018 , recreational marijuana is lawful in California .
However , under California Health and Safety Code section 11357 , you need to be 21 or older , and there are limits on your possession .

Most parents want to protect their children from criminal prosecution , realizing that a mistake charged as a crime can haunt their children far into adulthood .
There are some serious crimes for which a child who is at least age 14 can be tried in adult court , such as drug crimes , weapons crimes , rape , carjacking , murder , setting fire to a building with people inside it , and kidnapping .
If they are tried in adult court , a juvenile can be sent to adult prison as part of their sentence .
Juveniles who are 15 or younger need to be permitted to talk to a lawyer before talking to the police or waiving their Miranda rights .
In a juvenile delinquency case , the court will evaluate how old the child is , the severity of the crime , and any prior criminal record .
A child tried as a juvenile may be ordered to live with their parents under court supervision , placed on probation , sent to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , or sent to a probation ranch .
Weapons crimes are serious offenses in California .
You should retain a Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer if you have been charged with a crime such as possession of an assault weapon , illegal sale of a firearm , firing into an occupied building , carrying a concealed weapon , aggravated assault with a deadly weapon , or possession by a convicted felon .
Although carrying a concealed weapon is usually a misdemeanor , it can be charged as a felony in some cases .
These include when the weapon is not possessed lawfully , the defendant has a prior felony conviction , or the defendant is actively involved in a street gang .
There are also certain circumstances under which possessing or carrying firearms is illegal , even though it would be lawful to possess or carry outside those circumstances .
Internet crimes include money laundering , revenge porn , child pornography , online identity theft , online solicitation of sex , online computer fraud , and cyberstalking .
Under California Penal Code section 646.9 , cyberstalking occurs when the defendant has harassed or threatened the victim so much that the victim fears for their safety , and the harassment or threats are communicated via text , email , telephone , fax , video message , or another device .
Meanwhile , Penal Code section 647 ( j ) ( 4 ) describes the crime of revenge porn .
The prosecutor needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had an image of an intimate body part of an identifiable person or an image of that person having some form of sex , and the defendant intentionally distributed the image .
Also , there must have been an understanding that the image would stay private , the defendant must have known or should have known that distributing the image would engender serious emotional distress , and the victim must have suffered serious emotional distress .
